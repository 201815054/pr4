LONDON (Reuters) - A lawyer for Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, accused a British newspaper publisher in court on Wednesday of commercially exploiting its legal dispute with her by using court documents as the basis for ""sensational"" coverage.
Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers over articles the Mail on Sunday printed last year that included parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.
Increasingly hostile relations between the royal couple and some British newspapers they accused of intrusive, inaccurate and sometimes racist coverage was one of the reasons why Harry and Meghan left Britain for the United States.
A full trial on the substantive issues in the case pitting Meghan against the Mail on Sunday is not expected until next year, but the High Court has been dealing with side issues in pre-trial proceedings.
At Wednesday's hearing, the issue under discussion was whether the Mail should be allowed to publish the names of five friends of Meghan who gave anonymous interviews to the U.S. magazine People. Meghan is seeking a court order preventing disclosure of the names.
The People interviews are central to Associated Newspapers' defence. The Mail has justified publishing the letter Meghan wrote to her father on the basis that she had revealed its existence in People, via her friends, and that was what drove her father to reveal the letter.
One section of the Mail's article was titled: ""HOW MEGHAN’S MEDIA FIGHTBACK LED HER DAD TO REVEAL LETTER HE WANTED TO KEEP SECRET"".
Meghan has told the court in a written statement that she did not authorise her friends to speak to People. She said they ""made a choice on their own to speak anonymously with a U.S. media outlet ... to defend me from the bullying behaviour of Britain’s tabloid media"".
The identities of the five are known to the Mail because they were named in a confidential document filed to court by Meghan's lawyers in July as part of the legal proceedings and seen by the defendant.
Her lead counsel, Justin Rushbrooke, said that within hours of the legal papers being filed, the Mail used them as the basis for what he described as a long and sensational article on its website, which in turn ""started a wildfire"" of media coverage.
""Other litigants don't make commercial fodder out of the other side's pleadings,"" he said, arguing such practices made it all the more important that the privacy of Meghan's friends be protected by a court order.
In her witness statement, Meghan said ""for the Mail on Sunday to expose them in the public domain for no reason other than clickbait and commercial gain is vicious and poses a threat to their emotional and mental wellbeing"".

Associated Newspapers' lead counsel Antony White was due to make arguments in response later on Wednesday. The judge was not expected to immediately give his ruling on the matter.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Governments have the right to restrict protests on public health grounds, the U.N. Human Rights Committee said on Wednesday.
The committee stepped in to formulate its legal interpretation having seen a gap in the international norms being tested even before the coronavirus pandemic.
But with the proliferation of Black Lives Matter protests and others demonstrations when authorities are trying to stem the spread of COVID-19, the matter has become more pressing.
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, signed by 173 countries, including the United States and China, has always allowed for restrictions to be placed on the rights of peaceful assembly on grounds including public health and the new document, called a ""general comment"", confirmed that. 
""The protection of 'public health' ground may exceptionally permit restrictions to be imposed, for example where there is an outbreak of an infectious disease and gatherings are dangerous,"" the report said.
The document's author, Christof Heyns, said the legal interpretation was intended to set out the ""rules of the game not just for protesters but for police"".
On the issue of whether protesters are allowed to wear masks to hide their identity as pro-democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong have, the report said they had the right to wear them.
It also says that public order, one of the other grounds on which governments can restrict assemblies, ""should not be used unduly"".
Asked about whether a state requirement to wear face coverings during the pandemic was a human rights violation, Heyns told Reuters: ""It's understandable and acceptable that for health reasons there may be limits on your rights."" 
However his comments on COVID face coverings were not part of the official legal report. In parts of the United States, as well as Australia, the issue of mask-wearing has been divisive in some cases resulting in anti-mask protests.

The 18-person U.N. Human Rights Committee does not have enforcement powers but it reviews the party states' implementation of its rules and may call them out for not conforming.

The video showed clouds of dust before the missiles streaked into the sky.
The military drill in the Gulf, which began on Tuesday, comes at a time of high tension between Tehran and Washington.
The U.S. military said the drill caused two bases with American troops in the region to go on heightened alert and said Tehran’s missile launches were irresponsible.
There have been periodic confrontations in the Gulf in recent years between the Guards and the U.S. military, which has accused the Guards’ navy of sending fast-attack boats to harass U.S. warships as they pass the Strait of Hormuz.
The video posted by YJC showed fast-attack boats firing missiles as well as missiles striking a mock-up U.S. aircraft carrier.
Tehran, which opposes the presence of U.S. and other Western navies in the Gulf, holds annual naval war games in phases in the strategic waterway, the conduit for some 30% of all crude and other oil liquids traded by sea.

MADRID (Reuters) - Health experts, citizens' rights groups and lawmakers lined up on Wednesday to criticise plans by Madrid authorities to give immunity passports to people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies.
Dubbed 'COVID cards' by regional government leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso, who wants to introduce them as a pilot project in September, they would identify holders as coronavirus-free, granting them access to high-risk infection zones including gyms, museums and bars.
""The key is letting people who are not infectious continue to live a normal life and focusing the precautions on the vulnerable,"" Ayuso said on Tuesday. ""We are asking for the card to be studied so we can identify who cannot infect or be infected right now."" 
However, at a time when countries are struggling to strike a balance between fighting the virus and respecting civil liberties, experts have questioned the scientific validity of such a system and say it could infringe on privacy rights. 
""A positive COVID-19 antibody result does not necessarily mean you have 'functional' antibodies that will protect you from another infection,"" Liverpool University epidemiologist Raquel Medialdea tweeted.
The World Health Organisation has discouraged the use of immunity passports on those grounds, and a large Spanish study into immunity showed 14% of participants with antibodies had lost them when tested again three months later. 
The country has been gripped by a surge in new infections with 13,116 diagnosed in the last seven days, prompting some other regions to re-introduce curbs on movement and gatherings, and the UK government to impose a quarantine on returnees from Spain.
Madrid, which bore the brunt of the virus's early April peak but has since managed to keep a lid on new infections, is the first Spanish region to consider a card system. 
Ruben Sanchez, a spokesman for the FACUA consumer-rights group called the idea ""ridiculous"", saying it would violate data-protection laws by obliging the bearer to hand over sensitive medical information.
Iñigo Errejon, leader of the left-wing Mas Madrid party, said Ayuso had failed to hire sufficient virus trackers and been slow to introduce mandatory mask use. He also criticised the card scheme, whose name Rocio Monasterio, a lawmaker with the far-right Vox party, said called to mind post-war ration books.
There was some support for Ayuso amid all the criticism.

""An attempt at tracking and controlling the virus doesn't seem bad to me,"" Alberto Nunez Feijoo, head of the northern Galicia region, told RNE radio.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Former Kremlin insider recounts Putin’s moves to retain power,"By Catherine Belton
LONDON (Reuters) - When Russian President Vladimir Putin was preparing for last month's nationwide vote on potentially extending his rule until 2036, he let the veil slip on part of the calculation behind the constitutional change.
""If this doesn't happen, then in about two years – and I know this from personal experience – the normal rhythm of work of many parts of government will be replaced by a search for a possible successor,"" Putin said in an interview with state TV channel Rossiya. ""We must be working, not looking for successors.""
The Kremlin won the vote, declaring it a triumph. The constitution now will allow Putin to return to power for another two six-year terms. Independent monitor Golos, however, reported unprecedented vote fraud, and political opponents say the elaborate maneuvering over the ballot has weakened Putin's legitimacy. Public discontent over Putin's rule has begun to spill into the open in Russia's Far East, where tens of thousands have marched in protest for the past three weekends.
Beyond Putin's own comments to state TV, the Kremlin isn't explaining its calculus about the constitutional change. But a first-hand account by a former insider of how the Kremlin tried to manage the handover of power in 2008, when Putin first faced a constitutional limit on his presidency, provides a glimpse into the under-the-carpet power struggles of Moscow's ruling elite and some of the issues the Russian leader must grapple with.
Since at least 2006, former Kremlin adviser Sergei Pugachev told Reuters, Putin has been grappling with the question of succession. Once known as the Kremlin's banker, Pugachev played a key role in Putin's rise 20 years ago. His business interests spanned military shipyards, coal and construction, and he sat as a senator in parliament's upper chamber. Today he is in deep conflict with his former allies, accused by Russian authorities of bankrupting the bank he co-founded, a charge Pugachev denies. He fled to Britain and then France, where he currently lives, after London's High Court in 2014 ordered his assets frozen at Russia's request.
Now, Pugachev has spoken for the first time about Putin's decision-making in the run-up to 2008. He told how the president was often hostage to the will of his inner circle of former KGB men and associates from his hometown of St Petersburg.
The question of handing over power has always been the ""biggest headache"" of Putin's rule, Pugachev told Reuters. For Putin, the succession ""was always a serious, personal stress. He never intended to hand over control of the country to anyone."" Putin saw himself running Russia behind the scenes as the father of the nation, said Pugachev, but finding a successor who would go along with this plan ""was always a big problem.""
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment about Pugachev's account of events.
In 2007, Pugachev was still a consummate Kremlin insider, close to many of the powerful men around Putin, the so-called siloviki, mostly drawn from Russia's security services. He says he was in the room when several key decisions were made. Photos and other documentary materials reviewed by Reuters show Pugachev held a position near the pinnacle of Kremlin power right up to 2008, and support some elements of his account.
The photos show Pugachev's teenage sons hanging out with Putin's daughters at his dacha. Other pictures show Pugachev dining at his dacha in 2005 with the leading security men around Putin. These included Nikolai Patrushev, then the head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB, successor to the KGB; and Igor Sechin, one of Putin's KGB allies from St Petersburg, who at the time of the photo was deputy head of the Kremlin administration.
A LOOMING DEADLINE
The first time Putin considered changing laws to prolong his rule was in the second term of his presidency, Pugachev said.
By the summer of 2007, Sergei Ivanov, Putin's first deputy prime minister and the youngest ever general in Russia's foreign intelligence service, was widely considered the frontrunner to become president the following year, ahead of another Putin ally, Dmitry Medvedev. The constitution dictated that Putin should step down in 2008 upon expiry of his second consecutive term.
Members of Putin's inner circle feared that if Ivanov got the top job, he would cut them out of power. They began briefing Putin against Ivanov, said Pugachev. ""They began telling Putin that Ivanov is very dangerous. He is very aggressive. He will take power and then you will never be able to get rid of him. They were collecting all kinds of kompromat (compromising information) on Ivanov. Almost everyone was against him.""
Kremlin spokesperson Peskov said Ivanov, now the president's special representative for nature, ecology and transport, would not be able to comment. Reuters couldn't reach him directly.
Pugachev too had fallen out with Ivanov, after failing to win a major shipbuilding contract in 2006, when Ivanov was the defence minister. That Ivanov seemed to be a loner only boosted him in Putin's eyes, according to Pugachev. It meant Ivanov ""couldn't coordinate with anyone against Putin.""
Behind the scenes, another option to extend Putin's hold on power was also under consideration. Pugachev said that, at Putin's request, Pugachev directed a group of lawyers headed by a co-author of the Russian constitution, Sergei Shakhrai, to look into ways Putin could run for a third term. The lawyers proposed changing the law through a two-thirds majority vote in parliament. Putin had consistently opposed changing the constitution but, said Pugachev, he wanted ""a second option just in case."" Shakhrai declined to comment.
Ivanov's candidacy ended in August 2007, according to Pugachev. Putin had just announced the restoration of long-haul military flights capable of reaching American shores for the first time in 15 years, a move hailed by Russian newspapers as a demonstration of Moscow's restored military might. 
Six days after Putin's triumphant announcement, Ivanov said in a television interview the flights did not signify a return to the Cold War. By appearing to speak for the Kremlin, he had overstepped the mark.
""Sechin brought a tape of Ivanov's interview to Putin,"" Pugachev said, describing a meeting between Pugachev, Putin and Sechin. Sechin, according to Pugachev, told the president: ""'Look, Vladimir Vladimirovich, you launched the bombers which have not flown for 15 years, since before the Soviet collapse. And Sergei Ivanov, who is no one – he isn't even the president yet, he isn't even the successor yet – he has already claimed [the project] as his own.""
""Sechin played on his ego,"" Pugachev continued. ""Putin has a thing about going down in history. This was his story, and Ivanov entered his territory…. It was an important psychological moment.""
A spokesman for Sechin declined to comment. Kremlin spokesman Peskov said he could not comment since he was not present.
Putin wanted a successor who would be president in name only and ready to make way at any moment, Pugachev said. After this incident, added Pugachev, the door was closed to Ivanov.
But time had run out to amend the rules so that Putin could run for a third term. The presidential election was to be announced by the end of 2007, with the vote itself in March 2008. By law, any legal change allowing Putin to remain in power had to happen at least six months prior to an election being called. Putin ""slept through"" the opportunity for a third term, Pugachev said.
Instead, in September 2007, Putin announced he was appointing as prime minister Viktor Zubkov, a little-known former state farm director who at the time was head of Russia's anti-money laundering watchdog. The 66-year-old Zubkov was suddenly in the frame to succeed Putin.
Pugachev said Putin was weighing making Zubkov president for one year, after which Zubkov could say he had fallen ill, and Putin could return. ""I discussed this with him personally. With Putin and with Zubkov,"" Pugachev said. But Putin rejected the idea. ""He told me it wouldn't look very good.""
Reuters couldn't reach Zubkov. Kremlin spokesman Peskov declined to comment on the matter.
Finally, on December 10, just as the election was about to be declared, Putin announced Dmitry Medvedev, a St Petersburg lawyer who'd long worked in Putin's shadow, was his favoured candidate to take over as president. Pugachev said Putin's circle believed that Medvedev, who'd served as Kremlin chief of staff and most recently alongside Ivanov as a first deputy prime minister, would be the most malleable successor and, importantly, the most willing to make way for Putin should Putin decide to return to the presidency. Similar views of the Putin-Medvedev partnership were widely reported in Russia at the time.
A TIME OF CONFUSION
For the next four years of Medvedev's presidency, it was as if there were one and a half presidents, Pugachev said. While Putin served as prime minister to Medvedev's president, many within Russia's elite were confused about who had the final say.
""First people ran to Medvedev, and then they ran to Putin. People didn't understand. If you did something Putin gave you the go ahead to do, the next day Medvedev could reproach you,"" Pugachev said, citing the example of one Russian state bank boss who, when arranging financing, first sought Putin's approval and then went to Medvedev for his. ""For people it's unacceptable when there are two presidents, or one and a half. It's very important for them to understand who the Tsar is.""
Putin might have been happy to allow Medvedev to serve as president for a second term, but Putin's inner circle could not contemplate the prospect, Pugachev said, because they feared losing their hold over the economy. A ""vicious war"" broke out between factions as Medvedev, in anticipation of running for a second term, began positioning his allies to take over greater chunks of the economy, including Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Rosneft, the state energy giants long run by Putin's closest cohort, including Sechin.
The U.S. administration's open courtship of Medvedev over Putin further exacerbated the rift.
Medvedev's hopes for a second term were quashed at the very last minute, said Pugachev. By now, Pugachev had already fled Russia, but he said he continued to have in-depth conversations with one of Medvedev's closest allies about what was happening.
According to this account, Medvedev was in the Kremlin putting the finishing touches to his anticipated announcement that he would run for a second term, to be delivered the next day, Sept. 24, 2011, at the annual congress of the ruling United Russia party. In the small hours of the morning, Putin's security men quietly swapped out the most loyal members of Medvedev's presidential guard.
The switching of the guards was a threatening sign, according to Pugachev. He recounted that soon afterwards Putin arrived at Medvedev's Kremlin office and the two men had a friendly chat. Later, Putin announced he was seeking the presidency for himself. ""In the end it didn't really matter how much pressure Putin's security men put on Medvedev [to stand aside]. In the end it was a question of personal contact between Putin and Medvedev,"" said Pugachev.
Kremlin spokesman Peskov said he could not comment on the veracity of Pugachev's account. He said he only heard of Putin's plans to return as president when it was publicly announced at the United Russia congress. ""I worked alongside Putin. But he did not share his plans,"" Peskov said.
Medvedev could not be reached for comment.
A political consultant who'd previously worked for Medvedev, Gleb Pavlovsky, said at the time that it looked like Medvedev had stepped down under pressure. He pointed out that only three months earlier, in an interview with the Financial Times, Medvedev had made clear he would seek a second term as president.
But while the 2008-2012 experiment with Medvedev's presidency had revealed to Putin's circle the risks of a handover of power, Pugachev said he believes Putin might still be considering standing aside again. The recent constitutional vote may give Putin time to resolve a succession plan behind the scenes, without the pressure of the clock ticking on his final term, Pugachev said.
A sign that Putin may be keeping his options open, Pugachev said, is that a little-noticed change formalises into the constitution a law granting former presidents immunity from prosecution.
If Putin were to pick a successor, it would be imperative this person be a member of his trusted inner circle, Pugachev said. ""Putin can't stand outsiders. It's either his people or no one. It could be his driver or his bodyguard. The successor has to be his.""

The list of countries will fall to 11, assuming the provisional decision is confirmed in writing by EU members, two EU diplomats familiar with the discussions said. The deadline for submissions was likely to be Thursday afternoon.
The safe countries deemed to have COVID-19 largely under control are Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, South Korea, Tunisia and Uruguay.
China has also been provisionally approved, although travel would only open up if Chinese authorities also allowed in EU visitors.
A Reuters tally of government and World Health Organization data showed the total of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus in Africa has exceeded 750,000, with Algeria among the worst affected countries on the continent.
The EU list is unlikely to be revised again during August, when EU institutions typically take a break, although countries might be removed if there is a sharp increase of coronavirus infections.
The list serves as a guideline rather than a rule for the EU's 27 members and is aimed at supporting the EU travel industry and tourist destinations, particularly countries in southern Europe hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The idea is that no EU country would open up to countries not on the list. However, Italy and Belgium, for example, have held off opening up to any.
Most of the countries on the safe list also either ban almost all foreign visitors or require them to quarantine for 14 days. 
Meanwhile, many restrictions remain for travel within Europe and the passport-free Schengen area, which includes non-EU countries, such as Norway and Switzerland. 

Britain, which is also considered part of Europe for travel purposes, suddenly announced on Saturday that it was enforcing a quarantine for people coming from Spain.

But the southern African nation does not have the money and will issue long term bonds and jointly approach international donors with the farmers to raise funding, according to the compensation agreement.
Two decades ago Mugabe's government carried out at times violent evictions of 4,500 white farmers and redistributed the land to around 300,000 Black families, arguing it was redressing colonial land imbalances.
The agreement signed at President Emmerson Mnangagwa's State House offices in Harare showed white farmers would be compensated for infrastructure on the farms and not the land itself, as per the national constitution.
Details of how much money each farmer, or their descendants, given the time elapsed since the farms were seized, was likely to get were not yet clear, but the government has said it would prioritise the elderly when making the settlements.
Farmers would receive 50% of the compensation after a year and the balance within five years. 
Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube and acting Agriculture Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri signed on behalf of the government, while farmers unions and a foreign consortium that undertook valuations also penned the agreement.
""As Zimbabweans, we have chosen to resolve this long-outstanding issue,"" said Andrew Pascoe, head of the Commercial Farmers Union representing white farmers.
The land seizures were one of Mugabe's signature policies that soured ties with the West. Mugabe, who was ousted in a coup in 2017 and died last year, accused the West of imposing sanctions on his government as punishment.
The programme still divides public opinion in Zimbabwe as opponents see it as a partisan process that left the country struggling to feed itself. But its supporters say it has empowered landless Black people.

Mnangagwa said the land reform could not be reversed but paying of compensation was key to mending ties with the West.

The Office of the Attorney-General and the national police dropped criminal charges against Vorayuth ""Boss"" Yoovidhya last month, without providing a reason, stirring public outrage about Thailand's entrenched culture of impunity for the rich and well-connected.
Vorayuth had missed eight summonses to appear in court in connection with the killing of policeman Wichien Klanprasert, whose body was dragged for dozens of metres under a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) sports car owned by Vorayuth, who was 27 at the time.
Authorities issued a warrant for his arrest five years after the incident and Vorayuth later left the country. His current whereabouts is unknown.
Prayuth said a committee had been formed to look at what led to the case being dropped but it would not interfere in the work of the attorney-general, police and court. The committee has 30 days to complete its task.
""This case is of great interest to the people and society so we must find the truth to see where the problems are,"" he said.
""We must fix these problems to ensure justice in Thai society without dividing it along social class lines,"" he said.
The Office of the Attorney-General and police said they were also looking into what led to the case being dropped.
Vorayuth had been accused of fleeing the scene of the crash. A family driver initially tried to take the blame but was later charged with giving a false statement to police.
Police have said the old case against Vorayuth had officially ended and could only be relaunched if relatives of the victim filed the case directly to a court, or if there were new witnesses or evidence.

Veteran Druze power broker Walid Jumblatt said replacing Hassan Diab ""should seriously be considered because he has amnesia,"" according to comments to local daily L'Orient-Le Jour that were confirmed by his office.
The newspaper said Jumblatt was referring to remarks by Diab on Tuesday in which he appeared to criticise French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian for linking assistance to Lebanon with enacting of reforms and an IMF deal. Le Drian visited Beirut last week.
""It is high time the sponsors of the government realise the gravity of the situation their protege (Diab) has put us in,"" Jumblatt said. 
Lebanon desperately needs aid as it wrestles with a financial meltdown rooted in decades of state corruption and waste, in its worst crisis since a 1975-90 civil war. It entered negotiations with the International Monetary Fund in May after defaulting on its foreign currency debt.
Jumblatt's party is not represented in Diab's cabinet, formed in January with backing from the Iran-backed Shi'ite movement Hezbollah and its allies. 
But the Druze, adherents to a small offshoot of Islam, are an important minority in Lebanon’s sectarian system of government and Jumblatt has frequently played the role of kingmaker.
The state news agency quoted Diab as telling a cabinet meeting that France's Le Drian's warning and ""lack of information"" about government reforms indicated an ""international decision not to assist Lebanon"". Diab has deleted a tweet stating the same.
The IMF talks have stalled in the absence of reforms and amid differences between the government and banks over the scale of Lebanon's financial losses.

The finance ministry said in a statement on Wednesday that the IMF dialogue was ""ongoing and constructive"", and the government remained commitment to constructive engagement over its debt restructuring.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A prominent Chinese legal scholar who was detained and then fired after criticising President Xi Jinping hopes to clear his name by overturning a prostitution charge brought against him by police, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
Xu Zhangrun, a former constitutional law professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, was detained by police in Beijing in early July for nearly a week after being accused of soliciting prostitution while in the southwestern city of Chengdu last December.
Xu engaged rights lawyers Mo Shaoping and his partner Shang Baojun on Tuesday night in an effort to overturn the charge, Mo told Reuters.
""Professor Xu engaged us because he rejects the trumped up prostitution charges meant to smear his name,"" said Mo.
According to Mo, as evidence of his offence, police from Chengdu's Qingyang district presented a woman who said she had intercourse with Xu. Xu contends that he had never seen her before, Mo said.
Xu and his lawyers are still deciding the exact course of action to take, Mo said. His options are to lodge an appeal to the Chengdu city-level police or sue the district police, Mo said.
Neither Xu nor the Chengdu district police could be immediately reached for comment.
While Xu was being detained, Beijing's Tsinghua University fired him for violating its ethical code. It cited the prostitution case as well as various articles Xu had published since July 2018, in a notice seen by Reuters.
Xu, 57, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two-term limit for China's leader.
At the peak of China's coronavirus outbreak in February, Xu wrote an article calling for freedom of speech. In May, he wrote an article accusing Xi of trying to bring the Cultural Revolution back to China.
Under Xi, China has clamped down on dissent and tightened censorship.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in's new point men on North Korea face a daunting challenge: they must engineer a breakthrough in strained ties amid public scrutiny of their history with Pyongyang, which once landed them in prison. 
Moon this week appointed Park Jie-won as director of the National Intelligence Agency (NIS) and Lee In-young as the unification minister, seeking to cement progress with North Korea as a major legacy in his final two years in office. 
The two men, both longtime lawmakers, are key advocates of Moon's drive for inter-Korean rapprochement, but their political pasts rekindled the controversies and debates that have shaped Seoul's relations with Pyongyang. 
Both of them have a dramatic history with North Korea. 
A former businessman, Park was sentenced to three years in prison for helping the late President Kim Dae-jung arrange for Hyundai, which was operating North Korea businesses, to send $450 million to Pyongyang.
Hyundai said the money was for business rights, but the court ruled the payment was to facilitate the inter-Korean summit in 2000 with leader Kim Jong Il, and came through the NIS. 
Park served about eight months in prison before he was pardoned. 
Park, 78, said at his confirmation hearing on Monday that the payment was ""inappropriate"" and that he complied with the court ruling, but the verdict was wrong because the money was wired by Hyundai without his knowledge. 
Opposition lawmakers said Park's appointment could send the wrong message to Pyongyang and Washington. Moon is trying to restart inter-Korean economic projects even as nuclear negotiations have stagnated. 
The NIS could play a catalytic role in behind-the-scenes negotiations with the North, but the agency's opaque structure has triggered calls for overhaul. Many former directors and senior officials have been imprisoned for illegal political meddling. 
""I don't believe the government would seek illicit financial transactions for another summit, but there would be greater temptations to resort to an abnormal approach in finding a breakthrough with North Korea,"" said Cho Tae-yong, an opposition lawmaker who was formerly a deputy national security adviser and nuclear negotiator. 
Park vowed to transparently carry out policy and steer clear of illegal activity. 
""I would help bring a breakthrough in inter-Korean relations and respond with reform that cleans up the dark side of the NIS' history,"" he told Moon during an appointment ceremony on Wednesday. 
Lee, 56, was a prominent democracy campaigner who led a student activist group in the 1980s seen by some as revering North Korea's founding father Kim Il Sung and his ""juche,"" or self-reliance, ideology. 
He was sentenced to one and a half years in prison in 1988 on charges of possessing North Korean propaganda materials and hosting protests that might cause ""social unrest,"" but was pardoned six months later. 
""When I was young, our primary cause was to accomplish unification, because dictators exploited the national division to persecute us democracy activists,"" Lee told Reuters in 2018. ""Some people called us North followers but that's not true, though we might have a warmer heart than others toward the North and greater patience to achieve peace."" 
During his confirmation hearing on Friday, Lee faced off with lawmaker Thae Yong-ho, a North Korean defector, who questioned whether Lee still harboured belief in the juche philosophy, prompting angry denials. 

Some human-rights activists also criticised Lee for defending the Unification Ministry's controversial decision to revoke the licenses of defector groups that send anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets to the North.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Fahmi Reza was once sentenced to jail in Malaysia for portraying former prime minister Najib Razak as a clown. That image has now been updated and re-posted with ""GUILTY"" written across Najib's eyes in red.
As Najib was sentenced to 12 years in jail on Tuesday in the first verdicts against him related to the multi-billion dollar scandal over the 1MDB state fund, Fahmi was among the critics, investigators and journalists who welcomed it with relief.
""When he was still prime minister, so many activists were unjustly arrested, charged, convicted and sentenced to jail for speaking out against his corruption and abuse of power,"" Fahmi, a graphic designer and activist, told Reuters.
""We finally feel vindicated,"" said Fahmi, whose one-month jail sentence for the clown caricature was commuted.
Najib was sentenced to 12 years and a nearly $50 million fine for abuse of power on Tuesday as well as being found guilty of six other charges over accusations of illegally receiving nearly $10 million.
Najib denies wrongdoing over this and dozens of other charges related to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal. Prosecutors say more than $1 billion ended up in his personal accounts.
Najib's punishments were delayed pending appeal, but the verdict was welcomed by those who once tried to investigate him.
Top officials at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) had complained that their investigations into 1MDB had been blocked, with witnesses disappearing and even death threats against them.
""It's the biggest gift for me at the end of my 37 years of service in the MACC,"" said now retired investigator Bahri Mohamad Zin.
""At the time, I really felt alone. Our lawyer was arrested at 1 a.m., my lead investigator was detained, our offices and homes were raided. This was what we had to go through just to do our jobs,"" said the former director of special operations at the commission who left his job in 2016 after a decision not to bring charges over 1MDB.
Bahri returned to the commission in 2018 after Najib's surprise election loss brought in a government that revived the charges.
The fall of that government five months ago for a coalition that includes Najib's party had raised concerns among his critics that the courts could be lenient - fears assuaged by Tuesday's verdict.
""Malaysians look to celebrate as the judiciary demonstrates its teeth and impartiality,"" commented Tony Pua, another 1MDB whistleblower who is now a member of parliament.
Among those who had investigated Najib, and was called a liar and barred from Malaysia for her articles, was British journalist Clare Rewcastle-Brown, who published ground-breaking reports on the 1MDB scandal on her Sarawak Report website.
""Ultimately the facts were very clear,"" she told Reuters.

""It’s a good opportunity for Malaysia to put in place changes that will protect the media and ensure that the public has access to free media that can shine the truth on corruption,"" she said.

14,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 29, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","U.S. says will help Japan monitor ""unprecedented: Chinese incursion around disputed East China Sea islands","By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - The U.S. military will help Japan monitor ""unprecedented"" Chinese incursions around East China Sea islands controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing as Chinese boats prepare to begin fishing in nearby waters, the commander of U.S. Forces Japan said on Wednesday.
""The United States is 100 percent absolutely steadfast in its commitment to help the government of Japan with the situation,"" Lieutenant Kevin Schneider said during an online press conference.
""They (Chinese ships) would go in and out a couple of times a month and now we are seeing them basically park and truly challenge Japan's administration,"" he added.
Schneider's comments come as he and other senior U.S. commanders criticize Beijing for pushing territorial claims in Asia amid the coronavirus pandemic and a sharp deterioration in relations between the United States and China.
In the latest spat, Beijing this week closed down the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu after Washington shuttered China's consulate in Houston, Texas. 
China reacted within an hour to the comments from Schneider, who also described Beijing's actions as ""aggressive and malign"". The foreign ministry said the islands were Chinese territory and called on ""all parties to uphold stability in the region"".
The dispute over the East China Sea islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China, has simmered for years. Washington is neutral on the question of sovereignty, but has pledged to help Japan defend them against attack.
Beijing will likely end a fishing ban in the East China Sea around Aug 15, allowing a large trawler fleet backed by a maritime militia, the Chinese coast guard and the Chinese navy to fish around the disputed islands, Schneider said.
Japan hosts the biggest concentration of U.S. forces in Asia, including an aircraft carrier strike group, fighter squadrons and an amphibious force deployed in Okinawa. There are about 50,000 military personnel and their families members in Japan.
Those troops are operating under restrictions, including curbs on travel and large gatherings following coronavirus outbreaks at some bases, including U.S. Marine facilities in Okinawa, where many local residents are unhappy about the U.S. military presence. 
Schneider said there were 139 active coronavirus cases on Wednesday and in a statement with the Japanese government promised to publish a list of cases twice a week to reassure Japanese residents.

Abubakar Mansur Mohammed Surur was detained for alleged ""ivory-related offences"" after he landed in the coastal city in a chartered plane flown from Yemen, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said on Twitter.
In a June 2019 indictment, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration charged Surur and three others with conspiracy to traffic at least 190 kg of rhino horn and 10 tonnes of ivory worth more than $7 million.
The DEA said last year that Surur and another Kenyan, Abdi Hussein Ahmed “Abu Khadi,” were on the run while a Liberian suspect was in custody in the United States and a Guinean suspect detained in Senegal pending extradition.
Kenya also has an extradition treaty with the United States. 
The quartet had run their enterprise out of Uganda and neighbouring countries between 2012 and last year, according to the DEA indictment.
Surur and Ahmed were also charged with conspiracy to launder money and distribute heroin.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong could postpone a vote for seats in the city's legislature by a year amid fears of a resurgence in coronavirus cases, public broadcaster RTHK reported on Wednesday, in what would be a blow for opposition democrats.
The pro-democracy camp is aiming to win a historic majority in the Sept. 6 election given widespread resentment of Beijing's imposition of a new security law widely criticised by Western countries as eroding citizens' rights.
The RTHK report cited unidentified sources and did not give any more details. 
The government's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said in an emailed statement it was preparing for the election together with the Registration and Electoral Office ""and shall closely keep in touch with the Food and Health Bureau, the Centre for Health Protection and relevant departments to monitor the development of the epidemic and formulate various plans"". 
Some 600,000 people voted in unofficial ""primary"" polls for the opposition in Hong Kong this month, sending a younger, more confrontational generation of pro-democracy politicians into the race for the legislature.
One of them, prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong, said he would doubt the reason given for any coronavirus delay.
""Using pandemic as an excuse to postpone the election is definitely a lie,"" Wong said on Twitter.
The Legislative Council election would be the first vote in the former British colony since the introduction of the national security legislation in the semi-autonomous city.
The law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and sees mainland Chinese security agents operating officially in the city for the first time.
Critics of the law say it erodes the freedoms Hong Kong was promised when it was handed back to China in 1997, while supporters say it would restore stability after a year of often-violent pro-democracy, anti-China protests.
Britain's foreign minister, Dominic Raab, told top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi that Britain would be watching the elections closely and stressed that China needed to rebuild trust in the global community, a British Foreign Office spokesman said on Tuesday.
Under city laws, the government can postpone elections if the chief executive is of the opinion that the vote ""is likely to be obstructed, disrupted, undermined or seriously affected by riot or open violence or any danger to public health or safety"".
A new election date, not more than 14 days after the original date, must be announced immediately, according to election laws. But colonial-era legislation gives the government sweeping powers in case of emergency or public danger.
It is not clear if former members of the city assembly, whose terms have expired, could return to the legislature in the event of a year's postponement.
Hong Kong has reported about 3,000 coronavirus cases since January and more than 20 deaths - far lower than in other major cities around the world. 
But the government has warned of a new surge of infections in the community and has banned dining in restaurants and limited group gatherings to two people.
Rival finance hub Singapore, which has had a larger coronavirus outbreak, held a general election this month.
At least 68 countries and territories have delayed national or regional elections due to the coronavirus since February, the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance said.
At least 49 countries and territories have decided to hold national or subnational elections, it said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Hackers linked to the Chinese government have infiltrated Vatican computer networks, including the Roman Catholic Church's Hong Kong-based representative, a U.S. firm that tracks state-backed cyber attacks said on Wednesday . 
It said the attacks began in May. The Vatican and Beijing were expected to engage in talks this year over the renewal of a landmark 2018 deal that stabilised relations between China and the Church. 
U.S. cybersecurity firm Recorded Future said in the report that the attacks targeted the Vatican and the Catholic diocese of Hong Kong, including the head of the Hong Kong Study Mission, who is seen as Pope Francis' de facto representative to China. 
The report said the targets included communications between the Hong Kong diocese and the Vatican and used similar tools and methods previously identified with Chinese state-backed hacking groups.
China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, speaking at a daily news conference in Beijing on Wednesday, said that China is a ""staunch defender"" of cybersecurity.
Ample evidence rather than conjecture is needed when investigating cyber events, said Wang. 
Beijing routinely denies it engages in any state-backed hacking attempts, and says it is a victim of such threats.
A Vatican spokesperson had no immediate comment. The Hong Kong Study Mission did not respond to a request for comment.
The reported hacking follows an extremely rare meeting between Beijing and the Vatican's foreign minister earlier this year in Germany, marking the highest-level official encounter between the two sides in decades. 
Relations between the two have been improving and they have been expected to renew the provisional two-year deal on the operation of the Catholic Church in China this September.
A Chinese delegation had been due to visit the Vatican as part of continuing talks but there was no indication if or when they would travel because of the coronavirus outbreak, a senior Vatican source has said. 

The source, who spoke to Reuters before the hacking report, said it was still not clear if the deal would be automatically extended because of the pandemic and for how long.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia was the deadliest country for land rights activists in 2019, as killings of environmental defenders soared in the Andean country, according to a report published by advocacy group Global Witness on Wednesday. 
The report found 64 land rights activists were killed in Colombia last year - up from 25 in 2018 - the highest level Global Witness has ever recorded in the country. 
Globally 212 environmental and land defenders were registered killed in 2019, the highest number in a single year, though Global Witness warned the real figure is likely much higher as many cases are not recorded.
Though violence in Colombian overall has fallen since a 2016 peace deal between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels and the government, so-called ""social leaders"" continue to be threatened, attacked and killed - many in cases which remain unsolved.
Hundreds of social leaders have been killed since the deal was signed, though counts vary widely. Earlier this month 94 U.S. lawmakers signed a letter condemning the killings. 
Environmental defenders in Colombia fear threats and attacks, said Angelica Ortiz, who lives in desert province La Guajira and is the secretary general of indigenous group the Association of Wayuu Women.
""The threats and intimidation have been very severe,"" she said. 
Wayuu communities in La Guajira are locked in long-running disputes with coal miner Cerrejon over water use and pollution, dust, noise and health issues.
Global Witness found one environmental defender was killed in La Guajira in 2019. Colombia's Cauca province saw the highest number of killings last year, with 24 land defenders murdered. 
A report from the Business and Human Rights Resource Centre (BHRRC) this year found 44% of attacks from 2015 to 2019 connected to businesses in Colombia were against defenders who raised concerns about five companies including Cerrejon, which is jointly owned by BHP,  Anglo American  (LON:AAL) and Glencore (OTC:GLNCY). 
In responses to the BHRRC report, four of the companies - including Cerrejon - rejected violence against activists and any link to threats. Cerrejon told Reuters in an email that it was ""profoundly concerned"" by the situation facing social leaders in Colombia.

""We will not accept a deal at any price,"" he told France Inter radio in his first public comments on Brexit since his appointment on Sunday. ""Better no deal at all than a bad deal,"" he said while adding that a deal was nevertheless the best outcome for all concerned.
Britain and the European Union clashed last week over the chances of securing a free trade agreement, with Brussels deeming it ""unlikely"" but London holding out hope one could be reached in September.
France is one of the coastal states that has pushed hardest for EU fishermen to keep the right to fish in British waters after a transition period ends at the end of this year. 
Before becoming Europe minister, Beaune served as President Emmanuel Macron's Europe adviser. A self-described anglophile, he has advised Macron on Brexit negotiations since the 2016 referendum.
He said France would be ""intransigent"" on fishing, and will not be ""intimidated"" by Britain in the negotiation ""game"".

""Let's not kid ourselves, if there is no deal, it will be a difficult issue,"" he added. ""We'll have to organise a response for sectors like fisheries. Support our fishermen financially. We're not there yet.""

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines has taken a big step towards tapping nuclear power, its energy minister said on Wednesday, after President Rodrigo Duterte created an inter-agency panel to study the adoption of a national nuclear energy policy.
As power demand soars in what has for years been among the world's fastest-growing economies, Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi has been passionately advocating use of nuclear power, despite public concern over safety in a country hit frequently by natural disasters.
Nuclear power is seen as a potential answer to the Philippines' twin problems of precarious supply and Southeast Asia's highest electricity costs, but Duterte has yet to express full support for Cusi's proposal.
In a July 24 executive order and made public on Wednesday, however, Duterte created a committee to conduct the study, indicating openness to reviving the country's nuclear energy ambitions.
The Philippines spent $2.3 billion to build what was Southeast Asia's only nuclear power facility, but never used it https://reut.rs/39NyZcR.
The 621-megawatt Bataan Nuclear Power Plant was completed in 1984 but mothballed following the devastating Chernobyl disaster and the collapse of the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos, who ordered its construction.
Cusi welcomed Duterte's move as ""a major step towards the realisation of a Philippine nuclear energy programme"" that would ""help shield our consumers from traditional power price volatilities"".
The committee will assess the feasibility of adding nuclear to the Philippines' power mix, taking into account economic, security and environmental implications.
If it goes ahead, it could either build new facilities or rehabilitate the Bataan plant. Previous attempts to pursue nuclear energy have failed due to safety concerns and its association with Marcos and his brutal martial law era.

Despite having no nuclear policy, however, the Philippines has been in talks with Russian state atomic company Rosatom about a feasibility study for deploying small nuclear plants in far-flung areas.

BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors brought tax charges on Tuesday against a Harvard University professor accused of lying to authorities about his ties to a China-run recruitment program and funding he allegedly received from the Chinese government for research.
Charles Lieber, the former chair of Harvard's chemistry and chemical biology department, was charged in an indictment filed in federal court in Boston with failing to report income he received from Wuhan University of Technology in China.
The four tax-related counts are in addition to two counts of making false statements to federal authorities that Lieber, 61, pleaded not guilty to in June.
Marc Mukasey, his lawyer, said in a statement that Lieber was innocent. ""He didn't hide anything, and he didn't get paid as the government alleges,"" he said.
Lieber's case is one of the highest-profile to emerge from a U.S. Justice Department crackdown on Chinese influence within universities amid concerns about spying and intellectual property theft by the Chinese government.
The case centers on China's Thousand Talents Program, which U.S. authorities say China uses to entice overseas Chinese citizens and foreign researchers to share their knowledge with China in exchange for perks including research funding.
Prosecutors said Lieber in 2011 became a ""strategic scientist"" at Wuhan University of Technology and later contractually participated in the Thousand Talents Program.
Under his contract, Lieber was paid up to $50,000 a month and living expenses of up to $158,000, prosecutors said. He also was awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab, the prosecutors said.
In exchange, Lieber agreed to organize international conferences, publish articles and apply for patents in the university's name, prosecutors said.

Prosecutors alleged that in 2018 and 2019, Lieber lied to U.S. authorities about his involvement in the Thousand Talents Plan and affiliation with Wuhan University of Technology.

Under the resolution, Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC) would rescind self rule, implement the Riyadh agreement and appoint a governor for Aden, said the statement on Wednesday.
Yemen's prime minister would form a government within 30 days from both northern and southern Yemen, it said.
Shortly after the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) report, STC spokesman Nizar Haitham tweeted that his group would abandon self-administration.

The ""Riyadh agreement"", which aimed to centralise all military factions and form a government made up equally between the north and south, was never implemented. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper held two days of talks in Washington with their Australian counterparts, who had flown around the world for the meetings despite the COVID-19 pandemic and face two weeks of quarantine on their return.
At a joint news conference on Tuesday, Pompeo praised Australia for standing up to pressure from China and said Washington and Canberra would continue to work together to reassert the rule of law in the South China Sea, where China has been pressing its claims. That has led to friction with other countries in the region and concerns about freedom of navigation.
Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the United States and Australia shared a commitment to the rule of law and had reiterated their commitment to hold countries to account for breaches, such as China's erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong.
She said the two sides had also agreed to form a working group to monitor and respond to harmful disinformation and would look at ways to expand cooperation on infectious diseases, including access to vaccines.
At the same time, she said Australia did not agree on everything with Beijing - or with the United States.
""The relationship that we have with China is important. And we have no intention of injuring it,"" she said. ""But nor do we intend to do things that are contrary to our interests.""
She said Australia and the United States had a shared interest in an Asia-Pacific region that was free, prosperous and secure and were broadly aligned on issues, including China. 
""We don't agree on everything though. And that's part of a respectful relationship, is part of a relationship that has endured over 100 years of 'mateship.'""
Payne did not elaborate on disagreements with Washington, but said Australia made its own decisions and judgments based on its national interests and security.
""We deal with China in the same way. We have a strong economic engagement, other engagement, and it works in the interests of both countries.""
Pompeo, a persistent and forceful critic of Beijing, said in a speech last week that Washington and its allies must use ""more creative and assertive ways"" to press China to change its ways and called it the ""mission of our time.""
Pompeo also said then it may be time for ""a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies"" for this purpose.
Pompeo has been criticized by some for the speech, given the confrontational approach the Trump administration has taken towards some traditional allies, including in Europe, over issues such as trade.
Payne declined to comment on it specifically, but said, ""the Secretary's speeches are his own, Australia's positions are our own,"" even if the countries operated on the basis of shared values.
Responding to a question, Pompeo rejected the suggestion that the administration's approach was unworkable.
""This isn't about picking America versus China,"" he said. 
""This is about choosing freedom and democracy against tyranny and authoritarian regime, and I am confident that the democracies, our transatlantic Alliance ...know precisely, which side of that debate they want to be on.""
While Washington is Australia's main security ally, China is its largest trading partner and Canberra has strained ties with the latter by pushing for an international inquiry into the spread of the coronavirus that first emerged in China.

Beijing has imposed dumping tariffs on barley from Australia, suspended some beef imports and warned students and tourists against traveling there, citing racism accusations.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - A major Bolivian union led a protest march in the highland city of El Alto on Tuesday, opposing a delay to the country's presidential election as tensions mount over the vote that will decide the country's political future.
Thousands of people joined the march organized by the powerful Bolivian Workers' Center (COB), an umbrella group representing various industries. They carried banners criticizing the conservative interim government, which read ""We demand elections"" after the ballot was pushed to Oct. 18 due to the coronavirus.
The vote, a re-run of a fraught election last year that sparked violent protests leading to the downfall of long-term leftist leader Evo Morales, is a tussle between the country's socialist party and a fragmented conservative flank.
Morales, exerting his political influence from exile in Argentina, has called for the election to be held on Sept. 6 as previously planned. The electoral tribunal postponed the date because coronavirus infections are expected to peak in coming months.
""The problem in the country is not coronavirus, the problem is this incapable government that has not paid attention [to the pandemic] in a timely manner,"" said COB union head Juan Carlos Huarachi.
The march ended in a council of workers declaring an indefinite general strike and mobilizations all around the country.
The COB said the interim government of led by presidential candidate Jeanine Añez had used the pandemic to extend power and persecute supporters of Morales' Movement for Socialism (MAS).
""If we join together as miners, peasants, the middle class and El Alto, we can be explosive,"" said Huarachi.
Yerko Núñez, the minister of the presidency, responded to the demonstrations by accusing MAS presidential candidate, Luis Arce, and union leaders of committing ""crimes"" against public health by promoting the mobilizations.
""Let it be clear, the leaders of MAS, the coca growers of Chapare, the Bolivian Workers' Center and all those who called for this mobilization will be solely responsible for infections that occur and the collapse of the health system,"" he said.

Bolivia has recorded over 70,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with over 2,600 deaths.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera has reshuffled key parts of his cabinet, replacing his interior chief and five other ministers, in an effort to shore up his fractious ruling coalition following a rebellion over a controversial pensions bill passed last week.
The second reshuffle in nine months of almost all of the president's inner political circle saw a swing toward conservatism in the political affiliations of new ministers, also in the foreign, defense, social affairs, presidency and communications portfolios. 
""I call on this new cabinet and all of the Chile Vamos coalition to begin a new chapter for our government and for our country, with a true constructive spirit, conviction, unity, faith and hope,"" Pinera said at a swearing-in ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital Santiago.
Commentators noted the hard line of the new cabinet ministers. Alvaro Elizalde, president of Chile's Socialist Party, said: ""The president has opted for internal order, but not to win over, or try to win over, citizens."" 
The reshuffle comes as the center-right president faces his toughest year in office so far, with massive social protests from October to December and the combined economic and social blow of the coronavirus outbreak, which began in March. 
Last week, Chile Vamos lawmakers backed an opposition bill allowing citizens to draw down 10% of their pensions from the country's private retirement system, something the government had staunchly opposed. 
Interior Minister Gonzalo Blumel took the fall for failure to stop the pensions rebellion and was replaced by senator Víctor Perez, a member of the far-right UDI party. Perez became the third interior minister in nine months.

Billionaire Pinera is 20 months from the end of his second non-consecutive term in office. In October last year, his security forces' heavy-handed response to the biggest protests in Chile since the end of the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship in 1990 saw his approval rating fall to 6%. It has since ticked upwards to 15% but has been held down by some missteps in the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.

LISBON (Reuters) - Wearing masks in public will be compulsory at all times on the popular Portuguese island of Madeira from Aug. 1, the local government announced on Tuesday, making it the first region in the country to adopt such a measure against COVID-19.
Madeira, popular for its wine and green landscape, has managed to keep its tally of coronavirus cases low since the pandemic started. It has reported 105 infections, with no new cases since Saturday.
""The use of the mask is exactly to show those who visit us the reason why we have these results,"" said the region's general health secretary, Pedro Ramos. 
The use of masks in closed spaces and public transport is already compulsory in Madeira but now those on the streets must wear masks too.
Last year, Madeira hosted around 1.5 million visitors, from mainland Portugal and elsewhere. This year, only 258,000 tourists have arrived so far and those from abroad must provide proof they have tested negative for the virus.
Portugal, which as a whole has reported 50,410 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,722 deaths, was initially hailed as a success story in its fight against the outbreak.
But a wave of outbreaks on the outskirts of Lisbon over the past two months forced the government to bring back some measures across affected areas. The government is expected to ease some of those measures on Wednesday.

Lozoya, who was chief executive of the firm formally known as Petroleos Mexicanos from 2012 to 2016 under former President Enrique Pena Nieto, faces accusations ranging from accepting bribes to money laundering.
Lozoya, 45, has denied any wrongdoing.
A Mexican judicial official said the hearing began with officials summarizing key accusations and information relating to the case, the highest profile prosecution yet in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's push to root out what he describes as Mexico's entrenched political corruption.
Prosecutors contend that before he became Pemex's boss, Lozoya solicited and obtained funds from Brazilian company Odebrecht, and funneled cash into the 2012 presidential election campaign of Pena Nieto.
Then, as Pemex CEO, he handed contracts to Odebrecht and did the same for steelmaker Altos Hornos de Mexico after receiving bribes, the prosecutors allege. Odebrecht has admitted paying bribes in Mexico. The heads of Altos Hornos have denied wrongdoing.
In addition, prosecutors allege that Lozoya recommended a Pemex subsidiary buy the assets of the Agro Nitrogenados fertilizer plant, though it had long been inactive and would require significant investment.

Lawyers representing Lozoya, who was extradited from Spain earlier this month, have said he acted on Pena Nieto's orders in conducting major transactions that have now landed him in trouble. Pena Nieto has not been charged and has rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing.

OSTEND, Belgium (Reuters) - There could be no one around but the wind and the sea, but wherever you go along Belgium's coast this summer you had better wear a mask.
Instead of trying to enforce a rule with countless exceptions, local authorities in northern Belgium have decided to make masks mandatory outdoors at all times from July 25.
Even on windy boardwalks and deserted coastal causeways, when sitting down in the sun or cycling along harbour paths. You can take it off only when eating or swimming. Otherwise, there's a fine.
""It's not very pleasant after all,"" said Belgian tourist Nancy van Impe in the port city of Ostend. ""We were just cycling without a face mask and then we thought: Oh, do we have to put it on when we cycle?"" 
Belgium was hit hard in Europe's initial coronavirus wave, still holding the record for the most deaths per capita from COVID-19 in the world apart from the tiny northern Italian city state of San Marino. It has since largely curbed transmission through a lockdown that has slowly been lifted in recent months.
But a surge of infections in the past three weeks has raised concern of a second wave. Some tourists said they accepted that drastic measures needed to be taken.
""It's a bit weird, but now we're moving to a situation where we already think it's weird that someone doesn't wear one,"" said tourist Martine Vermeiren. 
Belgian restaurants, bars and cafes are required to gather the names and contact information of those at every table they serve to make it easier to track customers infected with COVID-19.

""It's a good measure. It involves more work for us, but we do it with pleasure to fight the disease,"" Ostend restaurant owner Lorenzo de Jonghe told Reuters.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Tuesday it was still waiting for Yemen's Houthi group to authorize deployment of an assessment team to a decaying oil tanker that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil off the war-torn country's coast.
Two weeks ago U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the U.N. Security Council that Houthi officials had agreed to allow a U.N. team to conduct a technical assessment and whatever initial repairs might be feasible on the Safer tanker. 
U.N. Yemen mediator Martin Griffiths told the 15-member council on Tuesday: ""We are still awaiting the permissions necessary for this team to deploy.""
The Safer tanker has been stranded off Yemen's Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for more than five years. Earlier this month the Security Council called on the Houthis to facilitate unconditional U.N. access to the tanker as soon as possible.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government.
Lowcock earlier this month said a U.N. team could deploy within three weeks of receiving all necessary permits.
""An independent and expert driven assessment is critical ... to allowing us to fully understand the scope, the size, the threat of this issue and the possible solutions to it,"" Griffiths said on Tuesday. 
Lowcock has said that on May 27 water began leaking into the engine room, threatening to destabilize the tanker and that while divers from the Safer Corporation were able to fix the leak ""it is impossible to say how long it might hold.""
The United Nations has warned that the Safer could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez disaster off Alaska.

In a report, U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) said a verification of the facts and circumstances about a Feb. 2 air strike triggered by allegations of civilian deaths established one civilian had been killed while three were injured. 
""Unfortunately, we believe our operations caused the inadvertent death of one person and injury to three others who we did not intend to target,"" AFRICOM's commander, Gen. Stephen Townsend was quoted as saying. 
""We work hard to prevent civilians from getting hurt or killed during these operations designed to bring increased security and stability to Somalia.""
The air strike, AFRICOM said, took place in the vicinity of Jilib, an area about 380 km (236 miles) south of Somalia's capital Mogadishu. 
AFRICOM's civilian casualty assessment reports cover its operations in Somalia, Libya and other African countries. The initial report published in April said two civilians were killed and three injured in an air strike in Somalia in early 2019. [nL5N2CF66L] 
The United States has been conducting air strikes in Somalia for years to help defeat the Islamist group al Shabaab. 
Al Shabaab seeks to topple Somalia's Western-backed central government and set up its own rule based on its strict interpretation of Islamic sharia. 
Rights activists have long accused the United States of shrouding its Somalia operations in secrecy, potentially undermining accountability for incidents involving civilian deaths.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the two former officials, including Luis Motta, who was sacked by Maduro as electricity minister last year after a series of blackouts, had accepted bribes and kickbacks in exchange for awarding ""lucrative"" supply equipment contracts for Venezuela's state power company, Corpoelec.
Pompeo also accused Motta and Eustiquio Jose Lugo Gomez, a former deputy minister of finance at the electricity ministry, of misappropriating public funds to enrich themselves.
Tuesday's action bars both former officials and their immediate family members from traveling to the United States.
The officials were previously blacklisted by the United States last year in a decision that froze any of their U.S. assets and generally prohibits Americans from dealing with them.
""This designation reaffirms the U.S. commitment to combating corruption in Venezuela,"" Pompeo said.
The United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, regarding Maduro’s 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country’s military and by Russia, China and Cuba.
""The United States continues to stand with Interim President Juan Guaido, the democratically elected National Assembly, and the people of Venezuela in their fight against corruption and for the peaceful restoration of democracy and economic stability,"" Pompeo said.

Tai was a leading figure in Hong Kong's 2014 ""Umbrella"" protests, which paralysed the city for 79 days as demonstrators occupied main roads demanding greater democracy. 
He was sentenced to 16 months in prison last year for two public nuisance offences, but released on bail pending an appeal - a conviction that prompted HKU to begin reviewing his position.
Tuesday's decision by the governing council reversed an earlier decision by the university senate that there were not enough grounds for a dismissal.
""It marks the end of academic freedom in Hong Kong,"" Tai said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""Academic institutions in Hong Kong cannot protect their members from internal and outside interferences.""
Tai was also singled out by Beijing officials this month for his role in helping organise an unofficial primary vote for the opposition pro-democracy camp to select candidates for elections to the city legislature.
The officials said the vote was illegal and potentially violated a new, sweeping national security law that many fear will erode freedoms in the semi-autonomous city, including those of the media and academia.
In a statement on Tuesday, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing's main representation in the city, said Tai's sacking was ""just an act of punishing evil, promoting good and conforming to the people’s will"".
The said Tai's words and deeds ""have severely intensified social conflicts in Hong Kong and poisoned Hong Kong's political environment"".
Beijing and the Hong Kong government have said the law will not affect rights and freedoms, and that it is needed to plug security loopholes.
HKU said in a statement that its council had resolved a personnel issue"" following a ""lengthy"", ""stringent"" and ""impartial"" process, without naming Tai.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia on Tuesday banned informal outdoor parties popular with youngsters, saying anyone taking part would be fined up to 15,000 euros ($17,598.00), in the latest step to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
The measure was announced a day after Catalan leader Quim Torra said those participating in the tradition of the ""botellon,"" whereby young people gather at night on the street or in parks to share drinks and party, were being irresponsible.
""For public health reasons, the shared consumption of alcoholic beverages on the streets and in any other open public space is banned in all Catalonia,"" government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo told reporters, referring to the ""botellones"".
Anyone ignoring the ban would be fined between 3,000 and 15,000 euros, Budo said, with municipalities in charge of monitoring and enforcement.
Catalonia, which is Spain's second-most populous region is its worst affected by the coronavirus with 75,613 cases, including 10,134 in the last two weeks.
The German government on Tuesday followed France's lead and advised its citizens not to travel to tourism-dependent Catalonia, which said it regretted the decision.
The Catalan government on Friday ordered the closure of all nightclubs, while bars and restaurants were told to shut at midnight in dozens of municipalities, including Barcelona. It had earlier recommended that some four million people stay home and avoid all non-essential trips.

MADRID/LONDON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Spain reacted angrily on Tuesday to recommendations from Britain and Germany that their citizens avoid its islands and beaches because of an increase in coronavirus cases during what should be the height of the tourism season.
With advisories piling up on top of a quarantine order from Britain for returning travellers, Spain, which depends on summer visits by sun-seeking northern Europeans, is facing a major blow to any hopes of reviving its economy.
Tourism accounts for just over 12% of Spain's GDP and nearly 13% of jobs. The country lost one million jobs between April and June, its biggest ever quarterly decline, and fears steeper losses as the summer season crashes.
""It's very unfair because it's not based on any sanitary criteria,"" Francina Armengol, the head of the key tourist Balearic region, told Cadena Ser radio of the travel advisories.
Britain's decision had no logical explanation, Armengol said, adding that the archipelago's contagion rate was lower than that of the United Kingdom. The northern Spanish Aragon region said the no-travel advisories were ""discriminatory"".
Their comments chimed with those of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who on Monday said it was a mistake for Britain to have considered Spain's overall coronavirus rate rather than having a granular, regional approach.
On the streets of Madrid, the reaction was one of outrage.
""It annoys me because it's not as though they were especially better off than us,"" said Madrid resident Isabel Garcia, who works in marketing. ""Everyone is in a bad way, and the fact that they pick on Spain... It seems wrong.""
But Britain stood firm, saying it would stick to the sudden quarantine announced on Saturday and its late Monday move to extend a travel advisory against travel in mainland Spain to the Canary and Balearic islands.
'OUR JOB TO ACT SWIFTLY'
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday Britain would take action to impose quarantines on other countries should COVID-19 infections rise.
""I'm afraid if we do see signs of a second wave in other countries, it is really our job, our duty, to act swiftly and decisively to stop travellers coming back from those places seeding the disease here in the UK,"" he told reporters.
The only glimmer of hope for Spain came from Britain's junior transport minister Charlotte Vere, who said that while London would continue to make decisions on a country-wide basis, it was looking at setting quarantine rules for different regions ""in the future"". She gave no timeframe.
Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said Madrid was working on convincing London to soften its stance. 
""We are still talking to British authorities, explaining that the outbreaks in Spain are under control ... and making sure that the measures taken by Britain respond to epidemiological criteria and no other criteria that have nothing to do with COVID,"" Laya told reporters in Athens.
Britons make up the biggest group of foreign tourists in Spain, with some 18 million travelling there last year, just over a fifth of the total number of visitors. Some 11.2 million Germans visited Spain, making them the second-largest group.
Britain's quarantine alone could cost Spanish tourism 10 billion euros ($11.73 billion) in lost revenue, Jorge Marichal, the head of tourism association CEHAT, told La Sexta television.
Spain has recorded 278,782 coronavirus cases and 28,434 deaths, but the infection rates, which have jumped since a nationwide lockdown ended in June, vary widely from region to region. Catalonia and Aragon have seen the highest increases in the past weeks.
Britain has, however, been the hardest-hit country in Europe. Some 300,111 people have tested positive for coronavirus and there have been 45,759 deaths.

""They're pointing the finger at others when they have the same situation,"" Spaniard Mercedes Blanco said as she sat down to lunch with her daughter during a visit to Madrid.

In recent months, hundreds of migrants have been stopped at sea and their vessels sent back to Libya despite the risk of violence there. 
Both IOM and the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR have said Libya should not be classified as a safe port for migrants and that they should not have to disembark there. They want an alternative scheme to take people rescued or intercepted at sea to safe ports. 
IOM Libya chief Federico Soda said 31 of the 70 migrants who disembarked were taken into detention and the others were reported to have escaped. Two migrants died at the scene of the incident and a third on the way to hospital. 
""The use of excessive violence results yet again in the senseless loss of life, amid a lack of action to change a system that often fails to provide any degree of protection,"" Soda said in a statement.

CARACAS/PUERTO ORDAZ (Reuters) - When a Venezuelan political party asked union leader Henry Arias to run for congress on a platform opposing President Nicolas Maduro, Arias quickly responded that the party in question didn't actually represent the opposition - and turned them down.
Weeks earlier, Venezuela's supreme court had put the main opposition parties in the hands of politicians who had been expelled from those parties on accusations of corrupt dealings with Maduro's government.
These politicians, who are widely accused of being Maduro's shadow allies, are now scrambling to find candidates to run in December's congressional election, according to opposition leaders and activists. 
""I wouldn't run even if they put in the money,"" Arias said in a telephone interview, saying the court-appointed party leaders are seeking to help Maduro legitimize an election that the opposition is expected to broadly boycott. 
""That would be betraying my family and myself,"" said Arias, who declined to identify the political party that called him.
Union leaders, student activists and party militants in the provinces have been receiving similar phone calls from the newly installed leaders of political parties First Justice, Democratic Action and Popular Will, according to the interviews. 
The effort signals that Maduro is concerned that a boycott will undermine an election that will already be complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The vote is expected to allow the Socialist Party to take back control of congress, the only major governmental institution outside its control.
That would change the situation of opposition leader and congress chief Juan Guaido. Last year, he was recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's rightful president after assuming an interim presidency in 2019 on the grounds that Maduro's 2018 re-election was fraudulent.
Maduro calls Guaido a U.S.-backed puppet seeking to oust him in a violent coup, and has accused Guaido and his allies of not wanting to participate in the elections because they know they will lose
The court-appointed opposition leaders deny supporting the Socialist Party, and say Maduro's adversaries backed them after growing weary of the existing opposition leadership.
""I don't know if there are candidates,"" said Jose Brito, appointed by the supreme court to lead First Justice after being expelled from the party last year amid influence-peddling accusations that he denies.
""There will be meetings to determine that.""
PACKING CONGRESS
Guaido declared the legislative vote illegitimate after the pro-Maduro supreme court named a new directors to the election council even though the constitution specifically grants this power to congress. 
The new electoral council then expanded the number of legislators to be elected to the next congress by 66%, adding 110 new legislative seats in what critics called an effort to dilute opposition influence in parliament.
Some of Maduro's adversaries have cautiously broached the idea of joining the elections, but insist that they would only do so if the government improved conditions. 
The court-appointed opposition leaders also appear to lack the rank-and-file party activists who are crucial to run campaigns and to serve as poll station witnesses. 
Engineering student Hector Pinto of the central state of Aragua got a WhatsApp message this month from a person who said they were part of the ""new party leadership"" of First Justice, asking if Pinto would recognize the court-appointed leaders.
""We know they are usurping (the leadership of the party) and I refused to accept this proposal,"" Pinto said in a phone interview. ""I know they've contacted members of the youth leadership in other states and (the youth leaders) have also refused."" 
The traditional leaders of those parties disavow the court ruling, but they appear to remain in limbo. Their legislative terms are set to expire in January, at which point they will no longer have parliamentary immunity.
Maduro's shadow allies first rose to prominence in January, when they unexpectedly declared themselves to be the new leaders of congress after troops blocked Guaido from entering parliament on the day of the annual election of legislative leadership.
Guaido, who was later re-elected head of congress by a majority of legislators, said the lawmakers had been bribed to do the bidding of the ruling Socialist Party while pretending to be working against Maduro.
Javier Torres, a union leader, refused a request to run for congress in December from the same group on mistrust of their motives.
""Those parties are trying to recruit candidates among recognized union leaders, but we are not going to serve as tool for the regime,"" Torres said in an interview.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. investigators monitoring compliance with sanctions on North Korea are looking into a possible military and technology deal between Pyongyang and Venezuela and have warned Caracas that it could be in violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.
In two previously unreported letters to Venezuela's U.N. ambassador, Samuel Moncada - sent in October and last month and seen by Reuters - the independent panel of U.N. experts asked for specific terms of the agreement and spelled out the U.N. sanctions that could bar such a deal.
The probe comes as U.S. sanctions on the South American country - intended to force out President Nicolas Maduro over allegations he rigged his 2018 re-election - and increasing diplomatic isolation are pushing Venezuela to deepen ties with U.S. adversaries like Iran and North Korea. 
""Taking into consideration that such cooperation is a recognized way for the DPRK to violate relevant U.N. resolutions, the Panel would like to request a response ... concerning information regarding above suspected cooperation,"" panel coordinator Alastair Morgan wrote on June 12.
North Korea's formal name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
The country has been subject to U.N. sanctions since 2006. The sanctions have been strengthened by the 15-member U.N. Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The U.N. panel of experts reports annually to the council on sanctions compliance. 
In its latest annual report, on March 2, the panel said it had started probing a possible military and technological cooperation deal signed by Diosdado Cabello - who leads the ruling socialist party and a legislative body known as the National Constituent Assembly loyal to Maduro - during a September 2019 Pyongyang trip.
Reuters could not verify whether a military and technological deal between North Korea and Venezuela exists and the U.N. report and letters did not provide any details. In an Oct. 2, 2019 tweet, Maduro congratulated Cabello for the ""tremendous agreements"" signed during his recent Asian tour, which included stops in North Korea and Vietnam. 
The investigators' October letter to Moncada includes a news report about the Maduro tweet as an exhibit; it is unclear whether their probe has unearthed further evidence beyond that report. 
During a conversation with Cabello on state television the night of the tweet, Maduro referenced military agreements but did not provide details or specify whether they were signed with North Korea or Vietnam.
""You were deployed with our brothers in North Korea and Vietnam, reaching great agreements for agricultural production, political formation, industrial production, commercial and energy exchange, for military support and cooperation,"" Maduro said. 
Venezuela's information ministry, which responds to media inquiries on behalf of the government, and Moncada did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the U.N. investigation. North Korea's U.N. mission in New York also did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
During the televised conversation with Maduro, Cabello described North Korea in almost utopian terms, praising the cleanliness of its streets and stating he did not see ""a single person with a bitter or sad face."" 
""On the streets, children walk home singing happily, they stop at corners to listen to orchestras playing for them as they pass. And who's in the orchestras? Children, as well,"" Cabello said. But he also made reference to a ""secret,"" adding, ""What I saw later I will tell you in person."" 
Maduro replied: ""All I can say is, tremendous agreement.""

The allotment, in the Hanover suburb of Seelze, is an hour's drive from the town of Braunschweig, the last fixed abode of Christian B., whom prosecutors last month named as their main suspect in the 3-year-old's presumed murder.
""I can confirm that the search is linked to our investigations in the Maddie McCann case,"" said Julia Meyer, a spokeswoman for Braunschweig prosecutors, who have jurisdiction over the case. She declined to give further details.
Reuters footage showed police and an excavator on the allotment on Tuesday morning. The premises were sealed off from public view with plastic sheeting.
McCann's disappearance, from her bedroom in a rented holiday home in the Algarve, sparked one of Europe's biggest international investigations. Last month, prosecutors announced they had phone evidence linking B., a rapist with convictions for abusing children, to her disappearance on May 3, 2007.
Under German law, police have not released the suspect’s surname and media in Germany are not permitted to report it, although it has appeared in some British outlets.
Earlier searches in the case have focused on an abandoned industrial site in eastern Germany that was owned by B., who is currently serving a prison sentence for drug dealing.

Prosecutors are also investigating whether B. might be connected to the disappearance of at least one other young child in Germany.

The group said Mohamad al-Bokari fled Yemen in June 2019 and was living as an undocumented migrant in Saudi Arabia when he was arrested on April 8 for a Twitter video that drew online condemnation from Saudis and calls for his arrest. 
In the video, seen by Reuters, Bokari was asked by one of his Twitter followers for his view of same-sex relations, to which he replied, ""Everyone has rights and should be able to practice them freely, including gay people.""
In a statement to Saudi-owned Al Arabiya confirming Bokari's arrest, the spokesman for Riyadh's police department said in April that the video contained ""sexual references"" which ""violate public order and morals"".
Bokari was charged with violating public morality, ""promoting homosexuality online"" and ""imitating women,"" said HRW, adding it showed authorities discriminated against Bokari for his ""perceived sexual orientation and gender expression.""
A Reuters request for comment to Saudi Arabia's government media office went unanswered.
Bokari was sentenced on July 20 and has 30 days from that date to appeal.
Saudi Arabia has no codified legal system and no laws regarding sexual orientation or gender identity. Judges have convicted people for ""immorality"", having sexual relations outside of marriage, and homosexual sex.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Moscow court fined Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation on Tuesday after finding it guilty of violating a ""foreign agent"" law.
The foundation specialises in publishing high-impact investigations into what is says is official graft. Those targeted have sometimes disputed its findings and taken successful legal action against it. 
The two fines, totalling 600,000 roubles ($8,300), included one for failing to mark one of the foundation's popular YouTube channels as belonging to a ""foreign agent"", according to Navalny and his associates.
""The fine is absolutely illegal,"" associate Lyubov Sobol wrote on social media, denying that the foundation should be classed as a ""foreign agent"". 
""The foundation has always received donations from Russian citizens only,"" she said. 
A 2012 law gives authorities the power to label non-governmental organisations and rights groups deemed to receive foreign funding for political activity as ""foreign agents"", a label that carries negative, Soviet-era connotations. 
Those organisations then have to attach this label to their publications and submit to spot inspections and bureaucratic scrutiny. They must also submit reports on their funding and expenditure. 
""Now they are just fining us on a daily basis,"" Navalny tweeted.
The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Navalny said this month he would shut the foundation because of accumulated fines amounting to more than $1.2 million, but try to re-launch it under a new name.

The authorities have carried out frequent searches of the foundation's offices and frozen its bank accounts. Its staff are routinely detained for organising and taking part in protests.

Turkey is at loggerheads with Greece and Cyprus over overlapping claims for offshore reserves. EU members Greece and Cyprus, along with France, have rejected Turkey's plan to explore between Cyprus and Crete.
The EU is keen to keep a lid on any tensions between a member state and Turkey. Last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel held separate discussions with both Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
""This has to be put into action. It's not enough to say you want to talk,"" Gonzalez Laya told a new conference in Athens following a visit to Turkey, where she said her counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, mentioned a will to pause exploration in the area for at least a month.
Following her visit, a top Turkish official said Erdogan had requested any operations be put on hold as a constructive approach to negotiations with Greece.
""I hope this message will materialise,"" Gonzalez Laya said.
Her Greek counterpart, Nikos Dendias, said Greece was open to dialogue but not under not under threats.

It was not immediately clear what the basis of a dialogue between the two sides would be since they hold fundamentally different views on where their continental shelves begin and end.

KYIV (Reuters) - Ukrainians in pretrial detention can upgrade to bigger cells with modern conveniences like air conditioning and a microwave if they buy vouchers that cost $72 a day, under an initiative aimed as much at pranksters as real-life detainees.
The vouchers, which do not need to have the name of the detainee on them and are valid for six months, can be bought on the justice ministry's website. They cost $72 a day for cells in Kyiv and less in other parts of the country.
The vouchers are an extension of a scheme introduced in May that allows detainees to pay for better cells. They make it easier to apply and move to new accommodation.
Justice Minister Denys Maliuska told Reuters that the vouchers could be bought by detainees or, more likely, as a joke gift for officials suspected of corruption.
""We do not expect that most of these certificates will be used by people who were detained for real in pre-trial detention facilities,"" he said in an interview.
""It is more ... for those who want to troll someone, for example, a former official, current official or simply a businessman who uses grey and black schemes for tax evasion.""
Not everyone likes the voucher scheme. The head of Amnesty International Ukraine, Oksana Pokalchuk, said justice should not be ""commercialised"".
""Authorities are obliged to secure human rights for all and everyone regardless of whether a person can pay for such services or not,"" she told Reuters.
Maliuska said such criticism was mistaken.
""There is a basic minimum which is secured by the state for free for all Ukrainian citizens,"" he said. ""But there is what's above this level and it cannot be secured by the state ... and an individual has to cover it as his cost.""
A 2019 U.S. government report described Ukraine's prison and detention conditions as ""poor ... and at times posed a serious threat to the life and health of prisoners.""
Money raised from the payment scheme since May has funded the renovation of three ordinary cells at Kyiv's pre-trial detention centre.
""There was fungus here. The toilet was not convenient at all. It was dark in the cell. Thank God the administration renovated it,"" said Danil, a detainee. ""It is a pleasure for a detainee to go and use the bathroom.""

Four vouchers were bought within hours of going on sale last week. The ministry may also launch gift certificates for people wanting to spend a night in detention for fun, Maliuska said, but more work was needed to guarantee guests' safety.

Whistleblowers in January accused Adesina, who has held the AfDB's top job since 2015, of abuses of office including favouritism in hiring fellow Nigerians, and giving out overly generous severance packages. He had denied the accusations.
A report by the bank's ethics board in April cleared him of malfeasance but the United States, AfDB's second-largest shareholder, rejected the internal investigation and demanded an independent panel review the case.
The panel, led by former Irish President Mary Robinson, agreed with the decision of the bank's ethics committee, according to its final report, seen by Reuters.
The allegations against Adesina ""were properly considered and dismissed by the Committee,"" it said.
The AfDB declined immediate comment. The U.S. Treasury could not be reached for comment. 
The United States pushed for the original decision to be reviewed over reservations about the integrity of the bank's process. This put it at odds with the lender's largest shareholder, Nigeria, which had voiced support for Adesina.
The exoneration of Adesina, a former Nigerian agriculture minister, frees him to seek re-election as the head of the multilateral lender. His first term ends on Aug. 31 and he is expected to run unopposed. 
The bank faces challenging economic problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Abidjan-based bank forecasts a 3.4% contraction in Africa's economy in 2020 compared with a pre-pandemic projection of 3.9% growth.
In April, the AfDB announced a $10-billion emergency credit facility to support the continent's coronavirus-hit economies.

(Reuters) - Students at a small boarding school in California received an unusual set of instructions this summer: return to campus in the fall armed with a portable chair, a sun hat and sunscreen.
Taking classes out into the open is one key part of Midland School's plans to get its roughly 85 students back to in-person lessons, while reducing the risk of spreading the novel coronavirus.
The move is not too big a stretch for the students, who grow much of the food they eat in the school's organic garden, heat water for their showers by lighting a fire, and hike miles of trails on the 2,860-acre campus. 
The school hopes that students will be tested for COVID-19 and will quarantine as much as possible before arriving at the campus in Los Olivos, about 45 minutes inland from Santa Barbara. 
""What I keep reminding everybody is we are crafting a special year. Don't expect it to be like any other,"" said Head of School Christopher Barnes.
Midland's return to school after the summer vacation was delayed to mid-September after California Governor Gavin Newsom barred counties with rising virus cases, including Santa Barbara, from resuming in-person instruction until they are taken off a state watch list.
Cases are still rising in California, and Barnes is prepared to further delay the semester or hold classes online if necessary.
He recognizes that Midland is in a privileged position compared to many other schools. Although almost half of students receive financial aid, full tuition is over $62,000 a year.
The school's resources per student and a 4:1 student-faculty ratio translates into academic and health benefits for students, said Barnes. 
""To say otherwise is disingenuous,"" he said.
President Donald Trump has pushed for schools nationally to re-open in the fall, a move he sees as key to economic recovery and a way to boost his re-election chances in November.
But school districts in Los Angeles and San Diego, citing ""skyrocketing"" coronavirus infection rates in California, have said instruction will resume with online teaching only in August.
While Barnes hopes the small residential community at Midland will help create a coronavirus-free bubble, he acknowledges the boarding school environment, where students often eat meals together and share bathrooms, poses unique challenges in the event of an outbreak.
""That's a blessing and a curse,"" Barnes said. ""It has some real opportunities that are associated with it and everything else, and it's also a little bit like a cruise ship.""
OUTDOOR CLASSES
Across the country, boarding schools are scrambling to rearrange campus life to get students back, and keep them as safe as possible.
The Association of Boarding Schools represents roughly 200 independent, nonprofit U.S. schools, with a combined total of 90,000 students, half of whom are boarders. 
At The Ethel Walker School in Connecticut, Head of School Meera Viswanathan said the school is purchasing tent cabanas and Adirondack chairs so students can attend some classes outdoors.
Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts, one of the country's oldest boarding schools, is modifying its accommodations so that every student can have a single room. It is also remodeling a building where students can quarantine if necessary, Head of School John Austin said.
At Midland, roommates will become de facto family members for the purposes of social distancing and wearing masks. And the school plans to cancel the usual October break to limit students' exposure.
Parents will be able to visit campus to see their child and hike, but not allowed in certain areas.
Melia Collard, a rising senior at Midland, said she is excited to return to campus, but worries the restrictions could take an emotional toll on new students.
""Homesickness is already hard when you know you'll see your parents in six weeks. But for a few months, that's going to be really, really difficult,"" Collard said.
Raymond Carr, an incoming Midland senior, recognizes that his final year in school may not look the way he hoped, but says he'll make more use of the 35 miles of hiking trails on campus.

""There were a lot of things I wanted to do as a senior that now I don't know if I'm going to be able to,"" Carr said. ""So, the fact that I still have the outdoors and I haven't really explored it is what I'm really holding on to.""

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam on Tuesday signed an agreement with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to borrow 36.63 billion yen ($348.2 million) to build six patrol vessels, state media reported, amid rising tensions in the South China Sea.
The vessels, to be delivered to the Vietnam coast guard by October 2025, would boost the country's maritime capability, Nhan Dan newspaper reported. It did not provide details of the vessels to be built.
Vietnam and other Asian states have for years been locked in maritime disputes in the South China Sea. China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich waters but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts.
The vessels are ""aimed at strengthening law enforcement and maritime rescue operations, ensuring security, maritime safety and freedom of navigation in Vietnam"", said the newspaper, an official outlet of the Communist Party of Vietnam.
Australia last week joined the United States in stating that China's claims in the South China Sea do not comply with international law.
Last year, the United States announced it would provide Vietnam with another coast guard cutter for its growing fleet, in addition to at least 18 ""Metal Shark"" patrol boats it provided to Vietnam in the last three years.
The 40-year loan has a grace period of 10 years, Tuesday's report said, adding that the vessels would be built by a Japanese contractor.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's former leader Najib Razak was found guilty of corruption and sentenced on Tuesday to 12 years in jail in the first trial over a multi-billion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB that stretched to the Gulf states and Hollywood.
In a case widely seen as a test of the southeast Asian nation's resolve to stamp out corruption and which could have big political implications, high court judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohamad Ghazali sentenced Najib to 12 years and a fine of 210 million ringgit ($49.40 million) on a charge of abuse of power.
Najib, 67, also received 10 years in jail on each of three charges of criminal breach of trust and three charges of money laundering for illegally receiving nearly $10 million from SRC International, a former unit of the state fund.
""After considering all evidence in this trial, I find that the prosecution has successfully proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt,"" Mohamad Nazlan said.
He ordered the jail terms to run concurrently, but Najib's lawyers immediately sought a stay of execution of the sentence.
Najib had pleaded not guilty, and flagged his intent to appeal to Malaysia's Federal Court if convicted.
The nearly $10 million involved in the SRC case is a fraction of the funds Najib is alleged to have misappropriated from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the state fund.
Prosecutors say more than $1 billion of 1MDB funds made its way into Najib's personal accounts, and over which he faces a total of 42 criminal charges.
U.S. and Malaysian authorities say a total of $4.5 billion is believed to have been stolen from 1MDB, a fund Najib founded to promote economic development, and used across the world by his associates to buy art, a superyacht and fund the ""Wolf of Wall Street"" movie. 
Prosecutors have also said $27 million was used to buy a pink diamond necklace for Najib's wife, Rosmah Mansor, and some of the money went into warchests for Najib's election campaigns.
Former U.S. attorney-general Jeff Sessions described the scandal as kleptocracy at its worst. 
Allegations of corruption over 1MDB have hung over Najib for more than five years. But the criminal charges came only after his defeat in the 2018 election when his successor Mahathir Mohamad reopened investigations.
""The conviction sends a strong message that leaders will be held accountable for wrongdoings in office,"" opposition lawmaker Charles Santiago said. 
'FAR FETCHED'
Najib's lawyers had argued that he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that the funds banked into his accounts were donated by the Saudi royal family, rather than misappropriated from SRC as prosecutors alleged. Low has denied wrongdoing.
Judge Mohamad Nazlan told the court it was ""far fetched"" to believe Najib could have been misled by Low and asked why he never questioned Low's claim that the money was a donation.
Dozens of Najib supporters, gathered outside the courthouse for hours, called for the former premier to be freed and were seen offering prayers. 
Since his ouster two years ago, Najib has enjoyed a resurgence in popularity after embarking on a makeover of his public persona, adopting a more personable tone to replace his image as a super-rich patrician.
His party returned to power in February as part of an alliance led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin.
The guilty verdict could boost Muhyiddin's credibility with the public, but create tensions within the coalition in which Najib's UMNO party is the biggest component. 
Sources have said if Najib is found guilty, there's a real threat of his camp withdrawing support for the government, which has a razor thin majority.
Exactly five years ago, Najib fired Muhyiddin - then his deputy - for questioning him about the money flows from 1MDB.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Negligence is behind Germany's steady rise in new coronavirus infections, the head of a state-funded research body said on Tuesday, adding it was unclear if a second wave was underway.
""The new developments in Germany make me very worried,"" Lothar Wieler, of the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases, said during his first news conference in weeks.
""The rise has to do with the fact that we have become negligent,"" he added, urging people not to flout social distancing rules. 
The number of daily new cases almost doubled on Tuesday to 633, and the RKI, which is Germany's most closely followed compiler of COVID-19 data, linked that to increased contact at parties and the workplace.
With 206,000 confirmed cases and just over 9,000 deaths, Germany wants to avoid a second wave, which would bring back lockdowns after economically crippling restrictions that closed many businesses for six weeks in March and April.
Europe's biggest economy withstood the pandemic with far fewer deaths than some large neighbours like France and Italy, owing to widespread testing, a well-equipped healthcare system and good adherence to social distancing.
The summer holiday season has prompted fears that tourists returning from destinations experiencing a surge in new cases like Spain could sow the seeds of a second wave.
But Wieler downplayed that.
""It is irrelevant if you are on holiday or at home,"" he said. ""The holiday is as much a part of the precautions against the spread of COVID-19 as your work and home life. The setting is irrelevant.""
Germany on Tuesday advised holidaymakers not to travel to several Spanish regions including Catalonia, home to Barcelona.

The port city of Hamburg is weighing a ban on selling alcohol in its red light district after revellers ignored social distancing rules at the weekend.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Mali's opposition coalition on Tuesday formally rejected a plan proposed by West African leaders for ending a political crisis, raising the prospect of more mass anti-government demonstrations in the coming weeks.
Tens of thousands of people answered opposition calls for protests in early June over contested local elections, perceived government corruption and incompetence. Police killings of protesters further inflamed anger against President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, who the opposition insists should resign.
Heads of state of members of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) proposed on Monday that the members of parliament whose elections were contested should step down and that by-elections be held. It also called for a government of national unity and an inquiry on the deaths. 
President Keita responded with a cabinet reshuffle late on Monday, naming six ministers to core positions, including Tiebile Drame as foreign minister and General Ibrahim Dahirou Dembele as defence minister. They are tasked with negotiating with the opposition to form the government of national unity.
But the plan was unlikely to be accepted by the M5-RFP opposition coalition, which has spearheaded anti-Keita protests and already flatly rejected an earlier version of the proposals from the bloc.
""The M5-RFP states with regret that the conclusions of the Heads of State Summit do not take into account the depth and gravity of the sociopolitical crisis that has Mali's future hanging in the balance,"" it said in a statement.
It said the proposals did not ""correspond to the expectations and aspirations of the people of Mali and violate the laws and constitution of Mali.""
The coalition has said it would restart the protests on August 3 if their demands are not met. 

The unrest has raised concerns that it could derail the fight against Islamist extremists in the region.

Kavala has been in jail since November 2017. He was initially accused of financing nationwide protests in 2013, but he was acquitted on those charges in February and was ordered to be released.
Hours after the acquittal, however, he was ordered to be detained for another case related to a failed 2016 coup attempt and later formally arrested again. The charge on the same case was changed in March to espionage but an indictment has not been prepared.
Kavala denies all charges.
U.S. State Department Principal Deputy Spokesperson Cale Brown called for Kavala's release given he has not been convicted.
""We call upon Turkey to comply with its own commitment to justice and rule of law and to release Osman Kavala from detention, while pursuing a just, transparent, and speedy resolution to his case,"" Brown said in a statement late on Monday. 
Nacho Sanchez Amor, the European Parliament's Turkey rapporteur, said Kavala had become a test for Turkey's sincerity with regards to human rights.
""We are pushing and pushing again for real justice in Turkey,"" he said.

In a statement marking his 1,000 days in detention, Kavala said: ""A parallel law enforcement system has been set in motion, which enables to keep in prison the persons who 'needed' to be punished, regardless of the established facts and concrete information about their activities.""
The European Court of Human Rights has also called for Kavala's release due to insufficient evidence related to both the abortive 2016 coup and 2013 protests.

In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations in the Gulf between the Guards and the U.S. military, which has accused the Guards' navy of sending fast-attack boats to harass American warships as they pass the Strait of Hormuz.
Tehran, which opposes the presence of U.S. and Western navies in the Gulf, holds annual naval war games in phases in the strategic waterway, the conduit for some 30% of all crude and other oil liquids traded by sea.
""The final stage of the drill called 'Great Prophet 14' with the participation of the Guards Navy and Air Force has started in the areas of land, air, sea and space in ... the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf,"" Fars reported.
The Guards, in a statement quoted by Fars, said its naval and air forces will use ""missile, UAV and radar units"" in the drill. 
Satellite images published on Monday showed Iran has moved a mock-up U.S. aircraft carrier to the Strait, suggesting it will use the fake vessel for target practice in war games there.
Tensions have spiked between Iran and the United States since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have sharply lowered Tehran's oil exports.

The Guards in April said Tehran would destroy U.S. warships if Iran's security is threatened in the Gulf. Iranian officials have repeatedly threatened to block Hormuz if Iran is not able to export oil or if its nuclear sites are attacked.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea and the United States have agreed to revise their joint missile guidelines to facilitate South Korea's plans to build a spy satellite by easing rules on rocket propellants, Deputy National Security Adviser Kim Hyun-chong said on Tuesday.
Under the current guidelines, last amended in 2017, South Korea cannot build rockets using solid-fuel engines, posing a setback for its plans to develop a military spy satellite by the late 2020s. 
The change in the propellant rules took effect on Tuesday, Kim said at a briefing in Seoul. 
""This revision would allow us to have an unblinking eye that monitors the Korean peninsula 24/7,"" he said.
""If we fire low-altitude launch vehicles based on our own solid fuel propellant as planned, it would dramatically improve our military's reconnaissance capabilities."" 
South Korea had initially sought to produce five of its own reconnaissance satellites this year to better monitor North Korea's activities but the project has been repeatedly delayed largely because of technological difficulties and government changes. 
South Korea operates several earth-imaging satellites but has relied heavily on U.S. intelligence to monitor North Korea's military movements. 
Last week, South Korea became the 10th country to launch a military communications satellite but it was conducted by U.S. private operator SpaceX. 
Kim also said Seoul is also ready to discuss another revision to raise the range of its missiles which are currently capped at 800 km (497 miles). 
In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to scrap a 500 kg (1,102 pounds) warhead weight limit on South Korea's missiles.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The case of a Singaporean caught spying for China in the United States has reawakened fears over China recruiting intelligence assets on an island state which has won trust among Western governments while keeping on good terms with Beijing.
Jun Wei Yeo, a 39-year-old academic who also goes by the name Dickson Yeo, pleaded guilty in a U.S. court on Friday to acting as an illegal agent of Chinese intelligence. He will be sentenced in October and faces up to 10 years in prison.
Singapore's home ministry said in a brief statement on Sunday that it had been aware of Yeo's case since his arrest by U.S. authorities in November, and he is receiving consular assistance.
Court documents show Yeo was lured into becoming a Chinese asset four years earlier while attending a forum in Beijing to give a presentation on Southeast Asian politics. He moved to the United States in January, 2019.
""One fool like this can get all Singaporeans suspected,"" academic and former Singaporean diplomat Bilahari Kausikan said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post in response to the spy's case. 
Initially claiming to represent China-based think tanks, Yeo's recruiters offered to pay him for political reports and information, but he learned later that some of his contacts were intelligence agents, the court records show.
Tasked with finding people with non-public information about politics, economics, and diplomacy, Yeo first focused on Southeast Asia, before switching to the United States.
When he moved to the United States his handlers gave him a bank card and told him to communicate with them using multiple phones to avoid detection.
Using a fake consultancy and business networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), Yeo reached out to individuals, targeting those with financial or work troubles, and paid them to write reports. 
Among those he lured was a civilian with high level security clearance working on a U.S. military fighter jet programme.
Yeo's former PhD supervisor at Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy was an ethnic Chinese U.S. citizen, who was accused by Singaporean authorities in 2017 of being an agent of foreign influence for an undisclosed country.
Huang Jing denied those allegations, and while never convicted he had his residency pass revoked.
Now working in Beijing, Huang said he was shocked and glad Yeo had been caught, noting that he had an ""obvious sense of insecurity and hunger for being somebody"".
Two former classmates said that Yeo had dreamed of becoming a diplomat but felt he had been shunned by the Singapore establishment. Yeo could not be reached for comment.
ASIA'S SWITZERLAND
The home ministry said investigations into Yeo ""had not revealed any direct threat"" to Singapore.
While Yeo may have drawn the line at betraying his own country, he was caught spying against the superpower with whom Singapore has the closest security ties, though the city-state is bound by its own rules to pursue a neutral foreign policy.
At loggerheads with the United States over trade and other issues, Beijing denied knowledge of Yeo's case on Monday and accused the United States of using espionage claims to smear China.
Deteriorating Sino-U.S. relations hit a new low during the past week, as the United States closed China's consulate in Houston and China retaliated by seizing the U.S. consulate in Chengdu. 
Yeo's case reinforced concerns raised in Western security think-tanks that Singapore was a soft target for China to recruit well-educated ethnic Chinese assets whose passports grant them easy access to countries almost everywhere.
""People might be more suspicious of Singaporeans if there is a perception that Singapore is compromised,"" said Chong Ja Ian, a visiting Singapore scholar at the Harvard-Yenching Institute in Cambridge, Mass.. Chong said the incident may also make it more difficult for Singapore to walk the diplomatic tightrope between Washington and Beijing.
Often described as the Switzerland of Asia because of its wealth, international finance network and neutrality, Singapore is one of the most politically stable countries in a region where the United States and China have competing interests.
China is Singapore's biggest trading partner, as it is for many countries in Asia.
A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute in 2018 found Singapore universities had among the highest level of collaboration globally with researchers from the China's People Liberation Army (PLA).
And U.S.-based think tank Jamestown Foundation last year said that China used business associations and other organisations in Singapore to spread propaganda about a ""greater China"" identity among Singaporeans, 75% of whom are ethnic Chinese.
Bilveer Singh of the National University of Singapore's department of political science, said the city-state's openness and strategic location has made it a hub for many countries to ""acquire intel"" and ""agents of influence"".
Yeo was ""definitely not an isolated case,"" he said.
A Mexican researcher from another Singapore university, Duke-NUS, was arrested in the United States earlier this year for acting on behalf of Russia.
Reuters asked the home ministry for comment on whether Yeo was an isolated case and, among other questions, whether there would be any restrictions on academics coming from, or visiting China.

The ministry said it would not be commenting further.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean women detained in prison camps suffered from torture, rape and other forms of ""multiple and serious"" violence by security and police officials, a U.N. human rights report said on Tuesday, citing accounts from over 100 women.
The women, detained between 2009 and 2019 after failing to flee the country, recounted in interviews with U.N. investigators in Seoul after their release, how they were deprived of food, sleep, daylight and fresh air while in the detention centres and prison camps.
Many also said in the report titled ""I Still Feel The Pain"" that they were subjected to torture, invasive body searches, forced abortions and even rape by authorities there. All of the women eventually managed to defect to South Korea.
""I did not sleep and worked because I did not want to be beaten. It was excruciating to a level that I even attempted to commit suicide,"" one woman was quoted as saying.
North Korea did not immediately react to the report but it has previously called criticism over its human rights record a ""plot to overthrow"" its regime. 
Another woman recalled one of her first nights in detention in 2010 when she was raped by an officer. 
""He threatened that ... I would be humiliated if I rejected him. He even told me he could help me to be released sooner if I did as he said,"" she said.
Gathering information in isolated North Korea is notoriously difficult, and the report acknowledged the lack of access to the country limited the agency's ability to verify the interviewees' accounts.
Daniel Collinge, a U.N. human rights officer who co-authored the report, said the project was aimed at putting pressure on Pyongyang to improve the situation, while urging other countries not to deport defectors who risk their lives to achieve freedom and prosperity.
South Korea's Moon Jae-in government, which is trying to improve ties with the North, recently came under criticism after revoking the licenses of defector groups and banning their campaigns to send anti-Pyongyang propaganda leaflets across the border.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israeli forces had thwarted an attempt by the Iran-backed Lebanese Shi’ite group Hezbollah to infiltrate across the Lebanese frontier on Monday. The Iranian-backed Shi'ite group denied this.
A Reuters witness in Lebanon counted dozens of Israeli shells hitting the disputed Shebaa Farms area.
""I call for caution in coming days because I fear the situation will deteriorate in light of heightened tensions on our border,"" Diab said on Twitter.
Israel was trying to ""change the rules of engagement,"" he said.
Israeli forces have been on alert along the northern border in anticipation of Hezbollah retaliation for the killing of one of its members a week ago in an alleged Israeli attack on the edge of the Syrian capital Damascus.
Occupied by Israel, the Shebaa Farms is claimed by Lebanon. The United Nations regards it as part of Syrian territory captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
Netanyahu has said any attacks from Lebanese territory will draw a powerful response. Hezbollah, which last fought a war with Israel in 2006, denied its forces had tried to cross the frontier and said the incident was ""one-sided"".
After the killing of two Hezbollah members in Damascus last August, the group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, vowed to respond if Israel killed any of its fighters in Syria. But Hezbollah's deputy leader said on Sunday all-out war with Israel was unlikely.

Hezbollah fighters deployed in Syria as part of Iranian-backed efforts to support President Bashar al-Assad. Israel sees the presence of Hezbollah and Iran in Syria as a strategic threat, and has mounted raids on Iranian-linked targets.

Taiwan's early response was effective in keeping the pandemic at bay, with just 467 infections and seven deaths. Most of the cases have been imported and have recovered. 
Until the Thai man's positive test, the island had not seen a local case of coronavirus infection since June 24. 
Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said it was probing where and how the man contracted the virus. The migrant worker arrived on the island in January and tested positive on July 25, shortly after returning to Thailand. 
More than 180 people who had contact with him in Taiwan have undergone health screenings, the centre said. 
""We will make all necessary checks, clarifying how he got infected and whether there is a possibility for further contagion,"" the centre's deputy chief, Chuang Jen-hsiang, told reporters in Taipei. 
Taiwan also reported five new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, all imported and marking the biggest daily rise in infections since mid-April. The new cases were people who had returned to Taiwan from the Philippines and Hong Kong. 
Taiwan has largely closed its borders since mid-March and the government has been cautious about reopening them in case of a second wave of infections. It now has only 20 active cases. 
Life in Taiwan has been less disrupted than in countries with strict lockdowns. The government, though, has encouraged social distancing and face masks are widely worn in public.

The march was planned to highlight the deaths of Aboriginal people in custody, building on momentum from global rallies for racial justice and against police brutality.
Police had said the gathering was unauthorised and in breach of coronavirus prevention measures, a position backed by a court ruling on Monday, as Australia tackles a spike in COVID-19 cases.
Police said they arrested six people before the scheduled start of the march in a public park and ordered others to leave the area, saying people had been given enough warning to stay away.
""Over the last 24 hours, we have said time and time again, do not turn up,"" New South Wales Assistant Police Commissioner Mick Willing told reporters in Sydney. ""We are in the middle of a pandemic.""
Of the six people arrested, five were each fined A$1,000 for defying the court order banning the gathering. The sixth was fined for using offensive language.
Reuters estimated there were about 50 people gathered on a rainy day in the city, well short of the 500 people that organisers had expected to attend.
Australia on Monday reported its highest ever single-day increase in cases after a flare-up of infections in Victoria state. Neighbouring NSW, of which Sydney is the capital, is also battling several virus clusters.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt had made a plea for people not to attend the rally, urging them to instead use social media platforms or arrange a silent vigil outside their homes.

Australia has recorded about 15,000 cases of COVID-19 and 167 deaths, though authorities fear both will rise.

Japan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshihide Suga, said if reports of the statue on display at a rural botanic garden were true, it would be an ""unforgivable"" breach of international protocol.
""If the reports are accurate, then there would be a decisive impact on Japan-Korea relations,"" Suga told a news conference in Tokyo.
The issue of comfort women, mostly Koreans forced to work in Japan's brothels before and during World War Two, and whether the surviving victims were adequately compensated, have long been a thorn in the two countries' ties.
Japan regards the matter as ""finally and irreversibly resolved"" by a 2015 agreement reached by Abe and then South Korean President Park Geun-hye under which Abe apologised and pledged a fund to support the survivors.
However, the current South Korean government of President Moon Jae-in has declared the 2015 deal flawed, effectively voiding it.
South Korean news reports said the statue was commissioned by a privately-run botanic garden, located in the rural county of Pyeongchang, and depicted a male figure resembling Abe kneeling and bowing to a figure of a seated young girl.
Similar statues of girls alone have been set up in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul and at other places to honour the women. 
The website of the garden, which displays Korean indigenous wild flowers, names the statue ""Eternal Atonement."" 
South Korean activists say there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims, only a few of whom have ever told of the abuse they endured at the hands of Japanese forces.
Ties were strained last year when Japan imposed restrictions on exports of key high-tech materials to South Korea following a ruling by South Korea's top court ordering Japanese firms to pay compensation to Koreans forced to work for them during the war.

""New Zealand can no longer trust that Hong Kong’s criminal justice system is sufficiently independent from China,"" Peters said in a statement.
""If China in future shows adherence to the ‘one country, two systems’ framework then we could reconsider this decision.""
Beijing imposed new legislation on the former British colony earlier this month despite the protests of Hong Kong residents and Western nations, setting the financial hub on a more authoritarian track.
Australia, Canada and the U.K. all suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong earlier this month. U.S. President Donald Trump has ended preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong.
Peters said New Zealand will treat military and dual-use goods and technology exports to Hong Kong in the same way as it treats such exports to China as part of a review of its overall relationship with Hong Kong.
Travel advice has been updated to alert New Zealanders to the risks presented by the new security law, he added.
In a website statement, the Chinese embassy in New Zealand called the decision a violation of international law and gross interference in China's internal affairs.
""The Chinese side has lodged its grave concern and strong opposition,"" an embassy representative said in the statement.
China is New Zealand’s largest trading partner, with annual two-way trade recently exceeding NZ$32 billion ($21 billion).

Dubbed the ""Abenomask"", which means Abe's mask and is a pun on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" programme, the washable gauze mask has been criticised as ill fitting with quality issues and as a waste of public money.
First introduced amid a mask shortage as the coronavirus spread in Japan, some 130 million have been distributed to households and the government is still working on sending out 80 million of a planned 157 million to facilities such as nursing homes and day care centres.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian police have warned universities and Chinese officials about a spurt in ""virtual kidnapping"" scams that coerce foreign students to fake their own abductions and trick families overseas into paying ransoms.
As tension has grown between Australia and China over trade, human rights and accusations of state-linked hacking, police said eight incidents of virtual kidnapping, involving a total payout of A$3.2 million ($2.3 million), were reported this year. 
""We have had a spate in the last few months where pretty much every weekend we have had a victim fall for one of these scams,"" said Darren Benett, director of the crime command in the state of New South Wales, whose capital is Sydney.
""If you get one of these phone calls, hang up, ring the police, ring your university, but just don't pay any money,"" he added in a televised news conference.
Scam perpetrators call intended victims in the guise of a local Chinese official to warn they have been implicated in a crime in China and must pay a fee to avoid legal action, arrest or deportation, police said.
Some scammers tell victims to sever contact with family and friends, rent a hotel room and take pictures or video recordings of themselves bound and blindfolded, and then send the images to their relatives overseas to exert pressure, the police added.
""We need to take into account the cultural factors and the fact that the scams are very polished,"" said state police official Peter Thurtell, explaining why victims are taken in. 
New South Wales has 212,000 foreign students enrolled, say police. Australian universities have warned they risk losing billions of dollars in annual fees because of border closures prompted by the coronavirus.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has suspended all flights to and from Danang for 15 days after at least 14 cases of the novel coronavirus had been detected in the city, the government said on Tuesday.
The Southeast Asian country is back on high alert after authorities on Saturday confirmed the first community infections since April, and another three cases on Sunday, all in or around Danang. 
A further 11 cases linked to a Danang hospital were reported late on Monday. 
All bus and train services to and from Danang have also been suspended from Tuesday, the statement said. The city, a tourism hot spot, had reintroduced social distancing measures over the weekend after the government confirmed the first domestically-transmitted cases of coronavirus in more than three months.
With over 95 million people, Vietnam is the most populous country in the world to have recorded no COVID-19 fatalities. Thanks to strict quarantine measures and an aggressive and widespread testing programme, Vietnam has kept its virus total to an impressively low 431 cases.
Two of the Danang cases were in critical condition, Vietnam's health ministry said.
Vietnam is still closed to foreign tourism, but there had been a surge in domestic travellers looking to take advantage of discounted flights and holiday packages to local resorts.
On Monday, the government said it had requested the Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam (CAAV) to allow domestic airlines to significantly increase the number of flights from Danang to 11 Vietnamese cities in order to help evacuate 80,000 people, mostly tourists.
""All evacuation flights now are cancelled,"" CAAV deputy director Vo Huy Cuong told Reuters by phone on Tuesday.

Lozoya, who was chief executive of the firm known as Pemex from 2012 to 2016 under Mexico's former president, Enrique Pena Nieto, faces accusations ranging from accepting bribes to money laundering. Lozoya, 45, has denied any wrongdoing.
The trial of Lozoya could expose years of alleged malpractice at the state oil company and provide a stage for President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to show graft at the heart of government, which he has vowed to clean up.
An official at the Federal Council of the Judiciary gave the time of Lozoya's hearing but no further details.
Mexican prosecutors contend that before he became Pemex's boss, Lozoya, among other things, solicited and obtained funds from Brazilian company Odebrecht, and funneled cash into the 2012 presidential election campaign of Pena Nieto.
Then, as Pemex CEO, he handed contracts to Odebrecht and did the same for steelmaker Altos Hornos de Mexico after receiving bribes, they allege. Odebrecht has admitted paying bribes in Mexico. The bosses of Altos Hornos have denied wrongdoing.
Lawyers representing Lozoya have said he acted on Pena Nieto's orders in conducting major transactions that have now landed him in trouble. Pena Nieto has not been charged and has rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing.

Lozoya, a former rising star of Mexican politics, arrived back in Mexico on July 17 following his extradition from Spain.

“China’s passage of its new national security legislation has eroded rule-of-law principles, undermined the ‘one country, two systems’ framework that underpins Hong Kong’s unique status, and gone against commitments China made to the international community,” Foreign Affairs Minister Winston Peters said in a statement Tuesday in Wellington. “New Zealand can no longer trust that Hong Kong’s criminal justice system is sufficiently independent from China.”
The move is likely to strain relations with China, New Zealand’s largest trading partner. However, New Zealand is following the lead of allies such as Canada, Australia and the U.K., who have already suspended their extradition treaties with Hong Kong for the same reason. The nations are all part of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance with the U.S., which is embroiled in a worsening diplomatic row with China.
China’s national security law for Hong Kong, an attempt to quell dissent in the former British colony, has drawn condemnation from around the world.
Peters said New Zealand’s review of its overall relationship with Hong Kong is ongoing, but announced two further outcomes of it.
Firstly, New Zealand will treat military and dual-use goods and technology exports to Hong Kong in the same way it treats those exports to China. Secondly, it has updated travel advice to alert New Zealanders to the risks presented by the national security law.
“New Zealand remains deeply concerned at the imposition of this legislation, and we will continue to monitor the situation in Hong Kong as the law is applied,” Peters said. “If China in future shows adherence to the ‘one country, two systems’ framework then we could reconsider this decision.”

""As you can see behind me, Hope the whale is getting her annual dusting, we have brought that forward this year, and she will look her magnificent best on the fifth of August when we re-open to the public.""
The museum, which has been based in South Kensington since 1881, shut its doors on March 17, six days before British Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered a nationwide lockdown.
Dixon said the closure had hit the world-renowned research center's finances, both through the loss of donations and the cancellation of events.
The museum would receive help from the government's 1.57 billion pound ($2 billion) package for the cultural sector, he said, but it would not be commercially viable longer term unless visitor numbers could be increased above the 20% capacity social distancing allowed.
However, those who do have a ticket will not have to jostle with the usual crowds to see the most popular exhibits.
""When people visit the museum over the next few months they are going to get a fantastic VIP experience because they will be able to see things without so many people around them, and I think that will be a wonderful experience for many, many people,"" he said.

86,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 06:18PM ET</span>",China Is Buying American But Not Enough to Hit Trade Deal Target,"(Bloomberg) -- China continues to lag behind the pace of imports from the U.S. needed to meet the terms of the two nations’ trade deal, amid a rapidly worsening diplomatic standoff that’s sparking global fears of a new Cold War.
By the end of the first half of this year, China had bought about 23% of the total purchase target of more than $170 billion for goods in 2020, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Chinese Customs Administration data. That has quickened on a month-over-month basis from May’s 19% marker, but it means China needs to buy about $130 billion in the remainder of the year to comply with the agreement signed in January.
China has promised to purchase an additional $200 billion of U.S. goods and services over the 2017 level by the end of 2021. The agreement paused a bruising trade war between the world’s two largest economies caused in part by the Trump administration’s concerns over the size of the U.S. trade deficit with China. The coronavirus outbreak and the first-quarter contraction in China’s economy set back progress toward achieving the target.
The deal remains one of the key anchor points between Beijing and Washington at a time of tit-for-tat accusations of spying, consulate closures and official U.S. rhetoric that calls securing freedom from the Chinese Communist Party as “the mission of our time.”
Pompeo Criticizes ‘Totalitarian’ China as Tensions Escalate
Observers are worried that even this agreement could become a victim of the worsening relationship, but China is still increasing purchases. Imports of manufactured goods took the lead in June, with vehicles, pharmaceutical products, optical and medical instruments all seeing big jumps. Purchases of integrated circuits remained above $1 billion.
While purchases of energy products are only at about 5% of where they need to be by year-end, imports of coal in June more than doubled from the average of previous months, reaching the highest this year.
Shipments of agricultural products also increased despite some slowdown in soybean and pork imports. Purchase of cereals more than tripled in June from May. The trend will probably continue in July as China made two massive purchases of American corn in July, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture statement.
“We of course hope that the deal reached can be implemented in earnest. China has always honored its words, and we will implement the agreement,” Hua Chunying, spokeswoman at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a press conference on July 16, when asked about China’s stance on the phase-one deal.
The phase-one agreement says that official data from both China and the U.S. will be used to determine whether promises have been met.

Kim made the remarks as he celebrated the 67th anniversary of the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, which fell on July 27, with a reception for veterans, the official KCNA news agency said. 
The country developed nuclear weapons to win ""absolute strength"" to stave off another armed conflict, Kim said in a speech carried by KCNA, emphasising the defensive nature of the programmes. 
""Now we are capable of defending ourselves in the face of any form of high intensity pressure and military threats from imperialist and hostile forces,"" he said. 
""Thanks to our reliable and effective self-defensive nuclear deterrent, there will no longer be war, and our country's safety and future will be firmly guaranteed forever."" 
The speech came amid stalled talks aimed at dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programmes in exchange for sanctions relief from Washington. 

Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes for a negotiated end to North Korea's nuclear threats. But their second summit, in 2019 in Vietnam, and subsequent working-level meetings fell apart.

Sudan and Egypt both fear the $4 billion hydroelectric dam could lead to water shortages in their own countries. The Blue Nile is a tributary of the Nile, from which Egypt's 100 million people get 90% of their fresh water.
Almost a decade of tortuous negotiations have failed to yield an agreement to regulate how Ethiopia will fill the reservoir and operate the dam while protecting Egypt's scarce water supplies.
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is being built about 15 km (9 miles) from the border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which provides the bulk of the water in the Nile after it meets the White Nile in Sudan.
Last week, Ethiopia, which says it needs the dam to generate electricity for its people, said it had already achieved its first-year target for filling the reservoir, thanks to a heavy rainy season.
Egypt and Sudan expressed concerns about the ""unilateral filling"", which they said ""cast a shadow on the meeting and raised many questions about the feasibility of the current course of negotiations and reaching a fair agreement"", Egypt's Irrigation Ministry said in a statement.
Sudan said Ethiopia's action was ""a harmful and disturbing precedent in the course of cooperation between the countries concerned"", according to a statement from its Irrigation Ministry.

There was no immediate word from Ethiopia. Among the issues at stake in the talks, being hosted by the African Union, are how the dam will operate during ""dry years"" of reduced rainfall, and whether the agreement and its mechanism for resolving disputes should be legally binding.

It was the first such deadly incident for months at Tahrir Square, which became a symbol of anti-government protests during months of deadly mass unrest last year.
The protesters had begun marching from Tahrir to nearby Tayaran Square chanting about worsening power cuts during a heat wave that has sent temperatures soaring above 50 degrees centigrade (122 degrees F) in Iraq.
Security forces tried to contain the march and fired tear gas, according to police, medics and protesters. The protesters threw stones and petrol bombs, a security source said.
Two protesters who were at the demonstration, and Ali Bayati, a member of Iraq’s semi-official High Commission for Human Rights, said security forces fired live ammunition to disperse the crowd.
Prime Minster Mustafa al-Kadhimi said in a televised speech later on Monday that the protests ""are a legitimate right and the security forces do not have the permission to fire even one bullet in the direction of the protesters"", adding that he has opened an investigation and demanded results within 72 hours. 
Military spokesman Yehia Rasool said in a statement that security forces were given strict instructions not to use force against protesters unless necessary.
Medics at two hospitals in Baghdad said two men were hit in the head and neck with tear gas canisters and died of their injuries. More than 26 protesters were wounded and several members of the security forces suffered minor injuries, police said.
Iraq's biggest anti-government protests in decades broke out last October and continued for several months with hundreds of thousands of Iraqis demanding jobs, services and the removal of the country's ruling elite, which they say is corrupt.
The protests caused the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who was replaced in May by incumbent Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief.
Nearly 500 people were killed during last year's protests.
Sporadic demonstrations have resumed in recent weeks in several Iraqi provinces, most recently over lack of electricity.
""When Latif was martyred, he was holding only the flag. He didn't drop the flag until he was shot at by the police,"" said protester Hussein, who gave only his first name, in reference to one of the protesters killed overnight. 

""He was just like any other young man at Tahrir Square, demanding rights for his family, for the people and for his children's future.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France plans to ban heaters used by restaurants and cafes on outdoor terraces from early next year, as it accelerates a shift to a low-carbon economy, the government said.
Because the ban could impact a sector hard-hit by the coronavirus crisis, it will not come into force until after the end of the coming winter to give business time to adapt.
""What's at stake is ending ecologically aberrant practices that lead to totally unjustified energy consumption,"" Environment Minister Barbara Pompili said on French TV.
On Jan. 1, Rennes became the first French city to ban heated terraces. Environmental NGOs estimate that France has least 12,500 heated terraces. 
""This is a courageous decision,"" said Thierry Salomon of energy conservation group NegaWatt, adding that in northern European countries with far colder climates, restaurants typically provide terrace clients with plaids. 
He said that as some restaurants introduced terrace heating, others were forced to follow in order not to lose customers. 
Negawatt estimates a 75 m2 terrace, heated with gas November to March, emits as much CO2 as a car circling the earth three times.
Restaurants say the ban will add to their worries. 
""The timing is very bad, in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, 80% of our turnover comes from terraces now,"" said restaurant owner Aurore Begue.
One Parisian enjoying a sunny terrace was less worried. 
""When heaters came, it was progress, but really, we do not need them. We can put on a coat or sweater,"" said Marie-Laure Bonnot, 77. 
Some restaurant owners too were philosophical. 
""This is a measure that could be expected, and, given the climate situation, it is hard to oppose it,"" said Stephane Malchow of brasserie Mollard.
Paris hotel and restaurant trade group GNI's Romain Vidal said the industry would find better ways to heat terraces, using efficient heaters, certified renewable energy and wind shields to reduce heat loss. 

""France created the terrace culture. We need to continue that culture without damaging the planet,"" he said.

Latin America, where economic growth has already been slowing in recent years, is expected to see an economic contraction of 8% to 10% in 2020 as a result of the coronavirus and associated quarantine measures, Moreno said.
The pandemic ""will impoverish not only Latin Americans, (but also) the world in general, but clearly Latin America is going to be hit much harder because we are an emerging (market) region,"" he said.
The IADB, which is Latin America's largest regional lender, this year will approve nearly $20 billion dollars in loans. 
Around $15 billion of those will go to governments to strengthen healthcare systems, he added.
'NOTHING' FOR VENEZUELA
Though the sharpest contraction in the region has been in Venezuela, Moreno said the IADB cannot provide any funding for the government of President Nicolas Maduro because his administration is in default on some $700 million in loans. 
Venezuela has been in recession for six years and annualized inflation exceeds 3,500%, according to the opposition-run National Assembly, which calculates economic indicators due to delays in the release of official figures.
""There is absolutely nothing we can do for Venezuela,"" Moreno said. ""There's no country in the history of humanity that has seen a contraction as deep as that of Venezuela without having had a war or a natural disaster or both."" 
Moreno added that Venezuela's vast oil reserves, as well as decades of infrastructure development thanks to oil income from previous years, means that it will have a better chance to turn its economy around after a change in government.

Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Without providing evidence, ZANU-PF spokesman Patrick Chinamasa told reporters that U.S. ambassador to Harare, Brian Nichols, was involved in subversive activities to topple President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government.
Chinamasa's comments echo the Robert Mugabe era, where the ZANU-PF government regularly accused the United States and Britain of seeking to dislodge it from power.
""He (Nichols) continues to engage in acts of undermining this republic and if he does so, if he continues engaging in acts of mobilising and funding disturbances, coordinating violence and training insurgents, our leadership will not hesitate to give him marching orders,"" Chinamasa said.
""Diplomats should not behave like thugs, and Brian Nichols is a thug.""
The U.S. embassy in Harare did not immediately respond to Chinamasa's comments.
Political tensions are rising fast in the southern African nation after activists called for demonstrations on July 31 against government corruption, which they blame for deepening the worst economic crisis in more than a decade.
Last month, the government summoned Nichols after a senior White House official said Zimbabwe was among ""foreign adversaries"" using the civil unrest in the United States following the death of George Floyd to interfere in U.S. affairs.
The U.S., Britain, E.U. embassies and the United Nations have all criticised Zimbabwe for the arrest of journalists and political challengers. 
Relations between Zimbabwe and the West were promising when Mnangagwa replaced Mugabe after a coup in 2017, but have soured over the government's human rights record.
Chinamasa urged party supporters to defend themselves from protesters and avoid a repeat of the deadly violence that followed post-elections demonstrations in August 2018 and the January 2019 protests over a steep fuel price hike.
""No, this time no. Use any means at your disposal to defend yourselves,"" Chinamasa said.

Organisers say this week's protests will be peaceful.

Concern is growing in Germany that potentially violent anti-immigrant nationalists may be gaining footholds in the uniformed services - a matter of huge sensitivity in a country still acutely aware of the World War Two genocide of millions of Jews and others by Hitler's Nazis.
The man and his wife were detained on Friday but then released while police searched seized computer storage devices.
The emails, including some sent to legislators of Turkish background, were signed ""NSU 2.0"", a reference to the ""National Socialist Underground"" neo-Nazi gang, which murdered 10 people, mainly immigrants, between 2000 and 2007.
""The suspects, a former Bavarian police officer, 63, and his wife, 55, had previously come to the attention of police in connection with racially motivated crimes,"" prosecutors in the city of Frankfurt said. ""They are suspected of having sent emails with offensive, inflammatory and threatening contents to legislators and others.""
Last week, the interior minister of the state of Hesse said he was aware of 69 such emails. One of the recipients was Aiman Mazyek, chair of the Central Council of Muslims, who published the text on Twitter: ""Heil Hitler. Yours, NSU 2.0"".
There have been reports that some emails contained restricted information about public figures, implying that the perpetrators may have had access to police databases.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A U.N. grain store that symbolised aid agencies' struggle to navigate the front lines of Yemen's war has finally been emptied and distributed to a starving population almost two years after fighting cut access, the U.N. food agency said on Monday. 
The Red Sea Mills, a milling facility rented by the World Food Programme (WFP) as part of an aid operation feeding 13 million people a month, had become a focal point of a frozen conflict in the strategic port of Hodeidah. 
Located in a complicated web of frontlines between forces loyal to Yemen's internationally recognised government and those of the Iran-aligned Houthi group, the grain store became inaccessible in September 2018 and suffered shelling damage.
Enough to feed nearly four million people, the grain risked rotting in the humid climate. It took a year of negotiations and risky cross-frontline operations to regain access and resume milling and distribution in September last year.
Aid agencies have repeatedly complained that the combatants in the five-year-old conflict across Yemen have restricted access to needy populations and aid supplies. 
The flour delivery comes as fears of famine in Yemen are resurfacing, the United Nations has said. 
Yemen is seen as the world's worst humanitarian crisis where 80% of the population relies on humanitarian aid. A recent U.N. report saw Yemen returning to ""alarming"" levels of food insecurity. 
Coronavirus restrictions, reduced remittances, locusts, floods and significant underfunding of this year's aid response have compounded an already dire hunger situation.
The WFP in April halved food aid to alternate months in Houthi-controlled north Yemen and says it needs $737 million to keep services running to December. 
Coronavirus restrictions are affecting aid operations. The WFP has had to charter extra vessels to keep food flowing as ships must observe a 14-day quarantine before docking in Yemen, the WFP spokesperson said. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 to restore the government ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by Houthi forces. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system. 
The U.N. has been holding virtual talks between the warring parties to agree a permanent ceasefire and confidence-building steps to restart peace negotiations last held in December 2018.
U.N.-mediated talks between warring parties in Hodeidah have so far failed to achieve a full troop withdrawal and ceasefire.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier expressed confidence at a closed-door meeting with member state envoys to the bloc last Friday that a new deal with Britain was possible, diplomatic sources have told Reuters. 
His comments after the latest round of EU-UK negotiations contrast with his downbeat public assessment that London's rigid positions on fisheries and the ""level playing field"" guarantees of fair competition meant a deal was unlikely for now.
More than four years after Britons voted in a referendum to leave the EU, and after tortuous divorce talks, the two sides are negotiating on all aspects of their ties, from trade to security, from 2021 onwards.
The two key stumbling blocks are access to British fishing waters and the EU's demand that Britain tie itself closely to the bloc's state aid, labour and environmental standards to ensure it does not undercut the EU's single market with poor-quality goods. 
The EU says a deal needs to be done by October to allow time for ratification by the end of the year. Both sides have said the talks may be stalling. 
""I remain confident that a balanced and sustainable deal remains possible, even if less ambitious,"" Barnier told the gathering, according to sources present, adding that London seemed more interested in pursuing only a ""low-quality, low-profile"" deal.
He said his recent encounter with Boris Johnson had left him with the sense that the British prime minister did want a deal, despite insisting that London was prepared for the prospect that there might be no agreement at all.
Barnier's comments were echoed by Ireland and the Netherlands, according to the sources.
Envoys for the two countries, likely to take the biggest hit from any change in trade rules after Dec. 31, said they remained confident that a deal would materialise.
""SWIMMING ACROSS THE CHANNEL""
The Dutch envoy quipped that a deal would eventually ""come swimming across (the English) Channel"", according to the sources.
They envoys all called for calm and unity, saying this strategy had already helped to narrow the gaps on agreeing ways to settle future disputes, an element regularly mentioned as a stumbling block in the past.
Barnier called the ""level playing field"" the biggest remaining problem, but also listed energy and transport cooperation, as well as rules for marking the origin of products.
""The level playing field is not for sale,"" the sources quoted Barnier as saying.
They also said Lithuania and Hungary had expressed concern that an overly tough stance on fisheries might lessen the chance of sealing an overall deal. 
France, whose fishing industry is economically and politically sensitive, called the comments ""unacceptable"", the sources said.
The French mission in Brussels said the French envoy had urged solidarity on all strands of the talks.
The EU's executive body, the European Commission, said it had nothing to add to Barnier's public comments. 

EU missions for Lithuania, Ireland and the Netherlands said they would not comment on confidential conversations. The Hungarian EU office did not respond to a request for comment.

By Ingrid Melander and Nathan Allen
MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Spain is safe for tourists and Spaniards, the government insisted on Sunday after Britain abruptly imposed a two-week coronavirus quarantine on travellers returning from there, a decision that filled holidaymakers with dismay.
Last year, Britons made up over a fifth of foreign visitors to Spain, which relies on heavily on tourism revenues, meaning the UK move could deal a hard blow to efforts to restart the Mediterranean country's economy after months of lockdown.
""Spain is safe, it is safe for Spaniards, it is safe for tourists,"" Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told reporters. 
The Spanish government will focus its efforts on trying to persuade Britain to exclude the Balearic and Canary islands from the quarantine measure, she said, adding that the prevalence of the virus in those popular travel destinations was much lower than in the United Kingdom.
Spain has seen COVID-19 cases rise in the last few weeks, and Britain announced late on Saturday it was taking the country off a safe-travel list. The quarantine took effect hours later. 
The measure upset the plans of many people either on holiday or planning to take one and caused more disruption for airlines and tour companies. 
While Gonzalez Laya avoided directly criticising the UK move, British tourists travelling in Spain were more blunt.
""It's a bit crazy considering the restrictions in place in Spain already are really good, with the masks, with disinfecting everything, with hand wash in the shops. That's better than what we have in London,"" Rich Lambert, a communications officer, said at Barcelona's airport.
Britain has also advised against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, leaving the islands out of the advice but including them in the quarantine measure.
TUI UK, part of the TUI (DE:TUIGn), holiday company, said it would cancel all holidays to mainland Spain up to Aug. 9, while maintaining flights to the Balearic and Canary islands.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the quarantine decision on Sunday, as a ""real-time response"" to a jump in infections in Spain. ""We can't make apologies ... we must be able to take swift, decisive action,"" he said on Sky News.
The opposition Labour Party's health policy chief, Jonathan Ashworth, slammed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government for its ""frankly shambolic"" handling of the measure.

Spain's rise in COVID-19 cases has prompted most regions to impose rules for masks to be worn everywhere and, in several areas including Barcelona, calls for people to stay at home.
Most new cases have been concentrated in the northeastern region of Catalonia and neighbouring regions, so a lot of the criticism focused on the fact that the quarantine also applies to areas which have been spared the brunt of the pandemic.
""This is ridiculous. There are almost no cases here and there's a far higher chance of contracting it when I get back to Britain,"" said John Snelling, 50, from Stratford-upon-Avon, who was on holiday in Menorca. 
Britain has been the hardest-hit country in Europe by the pandemic. Spain was also badly affected, with more than 290,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths. It imposed very strict lockdown measures, gradually easing them earlier in the summer.
Norway last week reimposed a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain, while France advised people not to travel to Catalonia.
But a collapse of tourism from Britain would have far more of an impact on Spain, where tourism accounts for 12% of economic output. Britons make up the largest group of foreign visitors by nationality.
""This decision is an absolute disaster for the recovery, there's no other way to see this,"" Angel Talavera, head of European Economics at Oxford Economics consulting, said on Twitter, referring to the quarantine measure. 
Maria Frontera, head of Mallorca's FEHM hotel association said she was shocked by the UK move ""just like the British citizens who were enjoying their holidays here in Spain.""

107,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Factbox: Why Mali is in turmoil again,"DAKAR (Reuters) - West African heads of state are meeting via video link on Monday to try to resolve a political crisis in Mali they worry could spiral out of control and derail the fight against Islamist extremists in the region.
Tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in recent weeks to demand that President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita step down. Following are details on the origins of the crisis and the risks it poses to the region.
WHAT IS CAUSING THE PROTESTS? 
1. Disputed elections 
Political tension has been simmering in Mali since Keita won reelection in August 2018 in a poll that opposition parties said was marred by irregularities. 
The government pushed ahead with a legislative election in March, despite the coronavirus outbreak, increasing jihadi attacks and the kidnapping by unidentified gunmen of Mali's main opposition leader, Soumaila Cisse. He has not been heard of since.
Protesters are angry about a decision by the constitutional court to overturn 31 of the results, handing Keita's party 10 more parliamentary seats and making it the largest bloc.
2. Islamist violence
Mali has struggled to regain stability since 2012, when ethnic Tuareg rebels and loosely aligned jihadists seized the northern two-thirds of the country, leading former colonial power France to intervene to temporarily beat them back. Attacks have increased in recent months, as militants seek to extend their reach, stocking ethnic tensions around central Mali. 
3. Corruption
Keita's opponents accuse the government of cronyism, pointing to the influence of his son Karim Keita, who stepped down from the powerful position of chairman of parliament's defense and security committee in July. The government denies the accusations. 
4. Economic hardship
Mali's economy, which depends on gold and cotton, has been hard-hit by the insurgency and COVID-19 pandemic. Striking teachers joined a protest in June to press demands for promised salary increases. 
WHY ARE MALI'S NEIGHBOURS AND ALLIES WORRIED?
1. Regional stability
Groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have used Mali as a launchpad for attacks in neighbouring countries, including Niger and Burkina Faso.
International powers are also anxious for the crisis to end, fearful it could undermine multi-billion-dollar efforts spearheaded by France to contain the militants.
2. Migration
European leaders worry that prolonged instability in Mali could see more people displaced, fuelling another wave of migration to their shores.
3. Coup fears 
Regional leaders are also concerned about the precedent set if Keita is forced to step down. Mediators from the Economic Community of West African States have proposed the creation of a unity government but draw the line at what they describe as an unconstitutional change in power in a region notorious for military coups.

Foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya, at a news conference in Ankara with Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, said an ""inflexion point"" had been reached on the dispute over drilling for oil and gas in the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
Turkey is at loggerheads with Greece and Cyprus over overlapping claims for offshore reserves and the two EU members, along with France, have rejected Turkey's plan to explore between Cyprus and Crete.
Paris and Athens have called for sanctions against Turkey for what they view as an encroachment on Greek and Cypriot waters, while Berlin has warned Ankara to cease ""provocations"". Turkey has rejected the criticism and said it is abiding by international law.
The Turkish lira has, meanwhile, slipped to near a record low versus the euro. 
""We have reached some inflexion point mainly on the drilling in the eastern Mediterranean and this was a useful dialogue with Mevlut to deescalate tensions that exist,"" Gonzalez Laya said.
""I think his will to pause exploration for at least a month to give space to dialogue between parties is a signal of confidence,"" she said.
Cavusoglu did not mention any plans to pause, and Turkey's foreign ministry was not immediately available to comment. 
Last week Turkey's navy issued an advisory for seismic surveys at sea in a move Greece said was an attempt to encroach on its continental shelf. The Turkish research ship is still anchored outside Antalya. 
Ibrahim Kalin, chief adviser to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, said last week that threatening sanctions ""will never fly here and will have no impact on Turkey's sovereignty or determination in pursuing the national interest.""

Last week, French President Emmanuel Macron said the EU should also take action against Turkey over its role in Libya's conflict.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is closely watching rises in coronavirus cases in other European destinations such as France and Germany after slapping a 14-day quarantine on travellers from Spain at the height of the summer vacation season.
The imposition of a British quarantine on Spain is one of the starkest indications to date that Europe could face a second wave of economic turmoil as governments scramble to head off a rise in cases from the Mediterranean to the North Sea.
Shares in airlines and travel companies - already on their knees due to coronavirus lockdowns - tumbled while Spain pleaded for Britain to exclude the Balearic and Canary islands from the quarantine.
The British decision, leaked ahead of an official announcement on Saturday, upset the plans of hundreds of thousands of British tourists and raised the spectre of limits on more countries.
""We have to keep the situation under review and I think that is what the public would expect us to do,"" junior health minister Helen Whately told Sky News when asked about Germany and France possibly being next to face quarantines.
""If we see rates going up in a country where at the moment there is no need to quarantine, if we see the rates going up, we would have to take action because we cannot take the risk of coronavirus being spread again across the UK,"" she said.
In Europe, Russia has reported 40,762 new cases in the past week, Spain has reported 12,166, France 5,858, the United Kingdom 4,662 and Germany 3,932, according to Johns Hopkins University.
As the coronavirus sows yet more economic chaos, a second wave of travel restrictions could destroy swathes of European tourism businesses. 
Germany, France and the United Kingdom are by far the biggest European tourism spenders while there are 9,835 flights scheduled to leave the UK for Spain between July 26 and Aug. 31.
Airline and travel shares tumbled: EasyJet fell as much as 14%, the biggest one-day intraday percentage fall since March when the rapid spread of COVID-19 forced flying to a near standstill. British Airways' owner, IAG (LON:ICAG), fell 8% and the TUI travel company fell 11%.
Ryanair Group Chief Executive Michael O'Leary said the British quarantine was ""a badly managed overreaction"". Ryanair is not planning to reduce flying capacity to Spain. 
""I have no doubt that we will see other localised outbreaks and we need to be flexible enough to deal with them as they arise over the next number of weeks and months,"" Chief Financial Officer Neil Sorahan told Reuters in an interview following the publication of quarterly financial results. 
ISLANDS TOO? 
Spain, long a favourite of British sunseekers, said it was safe for tourists and was trying to convince London that it should exclude the Balearic and Canary islands from the quarantine measure.
""For some of the islands, the rates are indeed going up, also there is some movement of travel between the islands and the mainland, so we had to do a clear policy that would best protect the United Kingdom,"" Whately told the BBC.
But The Sun newspaper reported that British ministers were considering removing quarantine measures for those coming from the Canary Islands and the Balearics after an outcry from tourists and the travel sector.
TUI UK, part of the TUI holiday company, said it would cancel all holidays to mainland Spain up to Aug. 9, while maintaining flights to the Balearic and Canary islands.

""What we'd really like - and I think we are going to need this going forward as the world evolves - is a nuanced policy,"" TUI managing director Andrew Flintham told the BBC.

The measures, which take effect from Wednesday, are the first time the densely populated city has completely banned dining in restaurants. Since late January, more than 2,700 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 20 of whom have died.
""The situation is very worrying,"" said Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung, adding that the current outbreak is the most severe the city has experienced.
The measures will be in place for seven days, he said.
The ban on dining at restaurants and food stalls threatens to complicate life for the many people in the city who depend on eating out for daily meals as their tiny apartments lack kitchen facilities.
The Chinese-ruled territory, with a population of more than 7 million, in July halted dine-in services from 6 p.m. as concerns grew of a third wave of infections but allowed restaurants and cafes to function through the day as normal. 
However, the city has seen a spike in locally transmitted coronavirus cases over the past three weeks, with Monday the sixth consecutive day of triple-digit infections.
Authorities reported 145 cases on Monday, a new daily record, of which 142 were locally transmitted cases. 
Authorities have warned that citizens have become too lax about wearing masks and social distancing. 
Over the weekend, they stepped up controls, sealing off popular beaches and introduced new rules to limit movements of ship and flight crews.
Hong Kong's Hospital Authority has said new cases are being found faster than public hospitals can take them in, according to public broadcaster RTHK.
China's liaison office in Hong Kong said on Sunday that the central government had made clear it would boost the city's capacity in coronavirus tests and help set up hospitals especially for infected patients.

Lee Hsien Loong, whose People's Action Party (PAP) has governed the city-state since independence in 1965, won all but 10 of 93 seats in parliament in the July 10 ballot but its share of the vote dropped nine points from the last election in 2015.
At the swearing-in of his new cabinet, Lee stressed the need to adapt to long-term changes in voter habits.
""The election has shown a strong desire among Singaporeans for greater diversity of views in politics. Voters want the PAP to form the government but they also want more robust debate of policies and plans. And this trend is here to stay,"" he said.
""We have to give expression to it and evolve our political system to accommodate it while maintaining our cohesion and sense of national purpose.""
Singapore maintains tight controls on free speech and public assembly and the mainstream local media scene has close ties to the government.
The PAP's election win was tainted by concerns about a generational voter shift after a youth backlash was reinforced by disaffection from middle-aged voters, who had not been expected to rock the boat given the dire economic outlook due to COVID-19.
Some voters criticised the government's decision to hold the vote during the pandemic as opportunistic and unsafe, while others took issue with targeting of opposition figures seen as high-handed. Calls by opposition parties to vote for them as a check on PAP power also swung some voters. 

After the vote, Lee for the first time named the head of the main opposition Workers' Party, Pritam Singh, as the official Leader of the Opposition, which analysts said signalled the city-state's gradual move towards a multi-party democracy.

112,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 09:51AM ET</span>","On Chicago's South Side, some violence-weary residents open to federal investigators","By Brendan O'Brien and Tom Polansek
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Many Chicagoans vehemently oppose President Donald Trump's pledge to send federal officers to the third-largest U.S. city, after seeing camouflaged agents deployed in Portland club and tear-gas anti-racism protesters. 
But in South and West Side neighborhoods hit hardest by a recent spike in gang violence, some Chicago residents welcomed the move and said federal agents may be able to help solve crimes.
""I appreciate it and I like it,"" said Cedrick Easterling, a former gang member, who was shoveling garbage scattered in the South Side neighborhood of Englewood as part of his work clearing vacant lots. 
""If you sit at that park, you will hear shots all over Englewood,"" said Easterling, who was once shot himself, pointing south toward Ogden Park. Like most in Chicago, Easterling is not a fan of Trump, who won just 51 of the city's 2,069 precincts in the 2016 presidential election.
Easterling, 54, has lived in Englewood since he was seven. He said crime is particularly bad this year and Trump should consider bringing in the National Guard and using drones to record evidence of crimes as they occur
Others were more cautious, saying they feared an increased federal presence would erode civil liberties in a city that has had long-standing problems with police brutality in poor, predominantly Black neighborhoods.
Trump said last week that hundreds of officers from the FBI and other federal agencies would help fight crime in Chicago. The city is suffering a spike in violent crime, including a drive-by shooting by suspected gang members at a funeral last week that wounded 15 people.
Trump has sought to project a law-and-order stance as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3, targeting cities controlled by Democrats who he says are soft on criminals. Critics say the administration is seeking to divert attention from its widely criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Eight of 10 people Reuters interviewed in wealthier and safer areas on Chicago's North Side opposed any form of intervention from Trump, saying federal officers could fan tensions in the city and would not address underlying issues such as unemployment.
""I don't see how the feds are going to help with anything,"" said Michael Flaherty, a 53-year-old architect who lives in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood.
""They're violent. Violence doesn't fix violence.""
The view was often more nuanced on the South and West Sides, where a much higher proportion of residents have experienced violent crime.
Junior Jaber, 28, recalled the day four years ago when his friend Paul Hamilton, then 47, was killed by a stray bullet while walking his dog in Ogden Park. 
""I was mad. He had nothing to do with anything,"" said Jaber, who runs Englewood Food Mart, where Hamilton worked as a butcher. ""We got to do something. It's almost like a war zone out here.""
Jaber said he was all for it when he learned of Trump's plan to send in federal agents. 
""They should clean it all up. Just do their job,"" said the 28-year-old father of two as he sold sodas, lottery tickets and pints of liquor. 
U.S. Attorney General William Barr has said the reinforcements to Chicago do not involve the type of forces that were deployed to Portland and have been accused of civil rights violations and using excessive force.
Protesters said uniformed personnel without name tags or agency badges snatched young people off the streets into unmarked vans before eventually releasing them. 
Protests have continued around the United States since the May 25 death of George Floyd, a Black man, in Minneapolis police custody. The U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday it would investigate the use of force in Portland and whether federal agents had proper identification.
Black Lives Matter activists, who have led protests against police brutality in Chicago, are suing federal officials to try to ensure agents do not violate civil rights. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has told residents all new federal resources would be ""investigatory in nature"" and vowed to pursue all available legal options if federal officers go beyond that. 
'INNOCENT BYSTANDERS'
While Chicago's murder rate had been falling in recent years, there were 116 murders over the 28 days through July 19, an increase of nearly 200% compared with the same period in 2019, police department data shows.
Some residents of East Garfield Park, a poor neighborhood on Chicago's West Side, support federal intervention after gang shootings hit unintended targets, said Damien Morris, director of violence prevention initiatives for local nonprofit Breakthrough. 
""When you have women and kids getting shot - innocent bystanders - you have residents that feel like something needs to happen,"" Morris said.
Trump sent a smaller number of special agents and law enforcement researchers to Chicago in 2017 after a spike in violent crime. 
Phil Bridgeman, 49, said he opposes all federal law enforcement in Chicago. Even if the federal agents could help solve high-profile cases, he said, they will not solve the root causes of violent crime. 
""It's not going to help, it's going to agitate,"" said Bridgeman as he sold ""Black Lives Matter"" T-shirts in the middle of a busy boulevard.
Vaughn Bryant, executive director of anti-violence group Metropolitan Peace Initiatives, was concerned by ""a greater threat to people's freedom,"" with the arrival of more agents. 
In Englewood, a man who goes by the name Joe Pug sat in a lawn chair with several other people on a sidewalk opposite a small police station. The 49-year-old, who has lived in the neighborhood for most of his life, supports federal agents investigating shootings.    
He said the South and West Sides also need massive investments in education and job creation, especially for young Black men. 

""There is nothing here, nothing for them,"" he said.

On Saturday the number of new infections rose by 584, its second-highest daily tally since the beginning of the pandemic, followed by another 780 on Sunday and Monday combined, bringing the total number to 43,402.
""We have big outbreaks in Silesia, mainly in three coal mines. This week we'll test 2,000 mine workers, then the number of new infections should fall to 300 daily next week,"" Health Ministry spokesman Wojciech Andrusiewicz said.
The Silesia mining region in southern Poland became the country's coronavirus epicenter in May with a rapid growth of the number of infections among miners.
For weeks the number of infections there accounted for more than half of total daily cases in Poland, prompting the government in June to temporarily shut 12 mines. Those mines have reopened, but in the past few days Poland reported another jump in new cases in Silesia.
Poland has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic relatively well, with fewer than 1,700 deaths so far out of a total population of 38 million. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said that COVID-19 had become a disease ""like any other"".
""The most important thing is to control the spread of the disease. The situation is stable and monitored ... Children are set to come back to school on September 1, and I hope they will,"" PM's Chief of Staff Michal Dworczyk told Polsat News broadcaster.

The health ministry will hold a meeting later on Monday to decide on measures to prevent a potential second wave of disease in Autumn. Experts may discuss whether to reinstate the wearing of face masks on the streets, Deputy Health Minister Waldemar Kraska told public radio.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to South Korea has shaved off his moustache to stay ""cool"" during the hot summer, months after his facial hair drew unusual criticism from anti-U.S. activists who likened it to those of former Japanese colonial leaders. 
The U.S. embassy on Saturday posted a video on Twitter of Harry Harris visiting a classic local barbershop in Seoul to remove his moustache, which he said together with a face mask makes him feel too hot and uncomfortable. 
""I haven't seen this face in years,"" Harris told the barber after the shave. ""I feel so much cooler now.""
""Glad I did this. For me it was either keep the 'stache or lose the mask. Summer in Seoul is way too hot & humid for both. #COVID guidelines matter & I'm a masked man!"" he said in a separate tweet. 
Early this year, his moustache became a source of criticism from some politicians and anti-U.S. activists who compared it with those of Japanese officials during their 1910-45 colonial rule. Some even linked it to his Japanese-American heritage, as Harris was born to a Japanese mother and an American father. 
The controversy came as the allies have been at odds over a raft of issues in recent years, including South Korea's desire to restart inter-Korean economic cooperation. Relations between North and South Korea have been dogged by stalled nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang, as well as by international sanctions imposed over the North's weapons programmes. 
Harris has urged Seoul to seek U.S. consultations before pursuing any initiatives with the North to avoid any ""misunderstandings"" that could trigger sanctions.

The envoy has said privately he does not plan to stay on beyond the November U.S. presidential election, regardless of whether President Donald Trump wins another term.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Within minutes of Chilean lawmakers approving a bill that allows citizens to draw down 10% of their pensions to help make ends meet during the coronavirus pandemic, a phrase started trending on Twitter: ""We're going for more.""
The bill's authors insisted the raid on the private retirement system introduced in the 1980s under the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship was just an emergency measure but as it snowballed in popularity, so have the ambitions of those backing it.
Lawmakers who voted in favor of the bill last Thursday included 53% of center-right President Sebastian Pinera`s ruling coalition, dramatizing the tectonic shifts underway in a country that has long been a bullwark of free market capitalism with aspects of its economy copied by neighbors from Peru to Brazil.
While the potential withdrawal from the accounts was set at 10%, economists and analysts said the bill had awakened many to the idea that the funds really belong to their contributors.
That could open the door for further raids on the accounts - until now jealously stewarded by their managers with strict rules for access - in times of crisis, they said. 
The privatized pension system was held up as the crowning glory of the economic shock treatment stewarded by a group of policy advisors called the Chicago Boys for their time studying at the University of Chicago under U.S.-based free marketeer Milton Friedman. 
As the region now quakes under severe unemployment and reduced incomes under quarantine, the anti-free market gospel is proving just as contagious. Peru passed a law in April allowing citizens to withdraw up to 25% of their pensions early, and there are moves in Mexico and Brazil to allow similar drawdowns, even as some experts warn of the long-term consequences for cash-strapped governments.
'NO WAY BACK'
""The latent threat of further unrest adds to the political pressure, while undermining the scope for more reasoned debate,"" said Nicholas Watson, of Teneo Intelligence, noting the influence of fierce and historic social protests in Chile last year over elitism and inequality even before the virus struck.
Pamela Jiles, a leftwing deputy representing some of the capital Santiago's poorest suburbs who charged through the Congress chamber in a pink cape and feathered fans to celebrate the pension bill's approval at an earlier stage, said Chile's free market system had reached a point of no return. 
""The people invaded Congress with a very specific and simple demand, but one that strikes at the heart of this discredited system,"" she said. ""There is no way back now."" 
Jiles said any longer-term financial worries could be addressed later. 
""What does long-term matter to me if I starve to death?"" she asked. ""That is not relevant today and I think the risks have been exaggerated. And if those terrifying prospects materialize, that's what the political class is for - to find solutions."" 
The individual capitalization Pension Funds Administrators (AFP) system promised payouts of up to 70% of final salary when it was introduced.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush called it an example from which his country could ""take some lessons."" 
Yet while the AFPs provided a pot of money to fuel a domestic economic boom by bringing a reliable pile of cash into equity markets, Chile's large informal workforce and an intermittent or partial contributions history particularly among women, coupled with high charges, meant that most payouts fall far short of pensioners' needs. In March this year, the average retiree received $289 a month.
CROSSING THE RUBICON 
Some economists said the remaining funds could be seen as fair game to make ends meet in future crises.
""You are basically opening a door that will be very hard to close because this move is so popular,"" said Hermann González, the head of macroeconomic policy at the Santiago-based Latin American Centre for Economic and Social Studies. 
""There's the risk that any future event, a natural disaster or another recession, will prompt a further use of these savings.""
Political scientist Cristobal Bellolio said the congressional upset meant crossing a symbolic Rubicon whereby the funds were obliged by law to hand over savings to anyone that asked for them, without penalties or tax. 
""Most people regardless of political position or social status just want to get back the money they have been saving for such a long time,"" he said. 
Among them is Maria Jose Manriquez Gonzalez, 32, who lost her job in the seaside city of Valparaiso in the pandemic and is struggling to support four children. 

""I would like to use that money to get away from where I live, which is basically a slum, to buy a home but right now I`m going to have to use that money for food,"" she said.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban wants all private companies and aid organisations operating in Afghanistan to register with the hardline Islamists, officials from the group said.
The order was issued last week and comes as the Afghan government and Taliban officials prepare to engage in intra-Afghan talks aimed at ending the fighting in the war-torn country.
The negotiations, slated to be held in the Qatari capital Doha, are part of a February deal between the United States and the Taliban to end the nearly two-decades-old war. Washington is trying to iron out difficulties and bring the Taliban and the Afghan government to the table.
The militant group has been running a armed rebellion since it was toppled from power in a U.S.-led invasion in 2001 and has regained control over thousands of check-points across a broad swathe of the country, with commanders overseeing distribution of foreign aid. 
A spokesman for the group said its officials had noticed that some companies and NGOs, including national and international organisations, were pursuing activities that they deemed were against the national interest.
""We will not allow any agency to work against the interest of our beloved Afghanistan, Islam...so we want to register all of them to have information about their activities,"" said the spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid. 
Foreign aid forms the backbone of Afghanistan's economy and over 2,200 NGOs operate in the country providing education, health and financial support to the poor. 
Last year, the Taliban briefly banned the International Committee of the Red Cross and the World Health Organization from operating in the country and accused them of conducting ""suspicious"" activities during vaccination campaigns.
Afghan government officials said the Taliban was making desperate attempts to assert control over government functions.
""Taliban is a terrorist group. They have no right to force companies, NGOs to register themselves with them,"" said Dawa Khan Minapal, deputy spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.

CHENGDU, China (Reuters) - China took over the premises of the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu on Monday, after ordering the facility to be vacated in retaliation for China's ouster last week from its consulate in Houston, Texas.
The seizure capped a dramatic escalation in tensions between the world's two biggest economies that began when employees at China's Houston consulate were seen burning documents in a courtyard last Tuesday, hours before Beijing announced that it had been ordered to leave the facility.
The U.S. consulate in Chengdu, in Sichuan province, was closed as of 10 a.m (0200) on Monday, and Chinese authorities had entered the building from the front door, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
On Friday, Beijing announced that it had asked the United States to close its Chengdu post, and gave the Americans 72 hours to vacate, the same amount of time China was given to leave its Houston mission, which was shut on Friday.
""We are disappointed by the Chinese Communist Party's decision and will strive to continue our outreach to the people in this important region through our other posts in China,"" a U.S. State Department spokesperson said in an email to Reuters.
At midday on Monday, police removed a roadblock that had restricted access to the Chengdu facility, and dozens of passersby stopped to take photos and videos.
One man stood across the street and played the Chinese national anthem from his phone.
“We feel very sad about the breaking down of the relationship between China and U.S.,” said a bystander outside the facility who said his surname was Li. He said he was worried about the impact of deteriorating relations on Chinese citizens who want to travel or study in the United States.
Grey sheet-like material was placed over the spot near the entrance where a plaque had been affixed, and over the place where there was large lettering saying ""U.S. Consulate General"".
The U.S. embassy issued a video in Chinese on its Twitter feed: ""The U.S. consulate in Chengdu has been proudly promoting the mutual understanding between Americans and the people in Sichuan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Yunnan and Tibet since 1985. We will forever miss you,"" it said.
The American flag was no longer flying at the consulate having been lowered at 6:18 a.m. on Monday, according to video shot by a journalist and shared by state broadcaster CCTV on its Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account.
The eagle on top of the flagpole remained.
On Sunday night, a crane was seen entering the consulate compound and hoisting at least one container onto a large truck. 
The Chengdu consulate opened in 1985 and had almost 200 employees, including about 150 locally hired staff, according to its website. It was not immediately clear how many had been working there at the time of its closure, after U.S. diplomats were evacuated from China because of the coronavirus pandemic.
U.S.-China relations have plunged to their worst in decades over a range of disputes, from trade and technology to the COVID-19 pandemic, China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.

On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave a speech calling a more assertive approach to China the ""mission of our time"".

120,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 27, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>",Tanzania opposition leader who survived 2017 gun attack to return from exile,"DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - A Tanzanian opposition leader and potential presidential candidate said on Monday he had started his return journey to the East African nation, days after police warned his supporters against gathering unlawfully to welcome him.
Tundu Lissu, a fierce critic of President John Magufuli's government, was shot 16 times in an attack by unknown gunmen outside his residence in the administrative capital Dodoma in September 2017.
At the time, Magufuli condemned the shooting and ordered the country's security forces to investigate, but no one has been arrested.
Lissu was arrested eight times in the year leading up to his attack and charged with incitement, among other alleged offences. His most recent arrest was in August 2017. He was released and shot more than two weeks later.
Since then, he has been living in exile in Belgium, where he had undergone treatment.
""Boarding Ethiopian Airlines flight ... Let's meet in Dar in slightly over three hours,"" Lissu said on his Twitter account. Lissu, vice chairman of the CHADEMA party, plans to vie for the presidency in October general elections and is waiting for his party primary.
CHADEMA is the leading opposition party in the East African nation. If nominated, Lissu will face incumbent Magufuli.
CHADEMA chairman Freeman Mbowe dropped out of the presidential race after he and three other party members who initially said they would contest the presidency failed to pick and return nomination forms. Mbowe will seek to retain his current the parliamentary seat.
Magufuli, nicknamed ""the Bulldozer"", for his ability to push through major projects, took office in November 2015 pledging to expand the East African nation's infrastructure and fight graft.
But international rights groups like Amnesty International have also accused him of curbing human rights including limiting free expression and cracking down on leading opposition figures.

The government has denied seeking to stifle dissent.

""The Land of Israel for the People of Israel,"" read part of a slogan sprayed in Hebrew on the mosque's wall, a reference to a biblical, historical and political claim to an area that includes the West Bank.
Israeli cabinet minister Amir Peretz condemned the incident on Twitter, calling for ""the criminals and hatemongers"" responsible for the blaze in the city of Al-Bireh to be brought to justice. He did not explicitly mention settlers in his tweet.
A Palestinian emergency services official said a bathroom area of Al-Bir and Al-Thsan mosque was burned after flammable liquid was poured through a smashed window before dawn.
He said residents living near the mosque and firefighters extinguished the flames, and the mosque's prayer area was undamaged.
The Palestinian Religious Affairs Ministry and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat accused Jewish settlers of setting the blaze.
""This is racism and apartheid,"" Erekat said in a statement.
Slogans in Hebrew similar to the one spray-painted in black outside the mosque have been used in previous attacks on Palestinian property which Israeli police suspect were carried out by Israeli ultranationalists in the West Bank.
Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, and more than 400,000 settlers now live there among some 3 million Palestinians.
Palestinians, who seek a state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, say the settlements - viewed by most nations as illegal - make a future country unviable.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A new Hong Kong ban on dining at restaurants and food stalls aimed at reining in a spike in coronavirus cases threatens to complicate life for the many people in the city who depend on eating out for daily meals.
Hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers live in subdivided tiny apartments, shared by multiple families and which often do not have kitchen facilities or even if they do, are too cramped to be used often.
""Many people don’t cook or cannot cook. Lots of old people cannot cook. Most of my friends don’t have kitchens - they eat out for every meal,"" said a car driver who gave his surname as Chong as he walked through the bustling Wan Chai district where food stalls line the streets.
For the seven-day duration of the ban, people without a kitchen will have to make do with takeout or food purchased at supermarkets.
The ban on restaurant dining is one of several new restrictions imposed to curb the virus - tightening a rule put in place earlier this month which forbade dining at restaurants after 6 p.m. Other restrictions announced on Monday include mandatory face masks in all public places and a ban on gatherings of more than two people.
The former British colony has seen a spike in locally transmitted coronavirus cases over the past three weeks, with 145 cases reported on Monday, a daily record and the sixth consecutive day of triple digit infection figures. Since late January, more than 2,700 people have been infected in Hong Kong, 20 of whom have died.
For the city's beleaguered restaurant sector already grappling with exorbitant rents and lost business due to anti-government protests last year, the new ban only promises more pain. 
Simon Wong, president of the Hong Kong Federation of Restaurants, said the sector would lose HK$5 billion ($645 million) in revenue in July if the government were to shut down dine-in services for the month.
""Even if we take subsidies from the government relief measures, we may not be able to survive this wave,"" he said.

Martin Luther King Jr.
A Democratic member of Congress from Atlanta since 1987, Lewis endured numerous beatings and arrests in his lifelong fight against segregation and for racial justice. He died on July 17 of pancreatic cancer at age 80.
Lewis' death came at a time of reckoning across the United State over racial injustice, with widespread and largely peaceful protests condemning unequal police treatment of Black Americans and institutions removing or renaming tributes to former leaders of the pro-slavery Confederacy. 
Last month, Lewis joined Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser on a street by the White House painted with a yellow mural - large enough to be seen from space - reading ""Black Lives Matter,"" honoring the social movement of that name.
The public school district in Fairfax County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, last week voted to rename the Robert E. Lee High School after Lewis. Lee was the commanding general of the Confederate army in the U.S. Civil War.
An invitation-only arrival ceremony for Lewis' casket at the Capitol will be held on Monday afternoon and a public viewing will be held on Monday evening and Tuesday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a joint statement.
Due to concerns over the coronavirus, the public viewing will be held outdoors on the East Front Steps of the Capitol and social distancing will be strictly enforced, the statement said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson used his own struggle with weight on Monday to urge the British to get fitter and tackle widespread obesity that could heighten coronavirus risks. 
New government measures to help people shed weight include banning TV and online adverts for junk food before 9.00 p.m., ending ""buy one get one free"" deals on such foods, and flagging calories on menus of large restaurants plus possibly on alcohol.
Johnson, 56, who has lost more than a stone (6 kg) since a life-threatening brush with COVID-19, was responding to research showing that those who are obese or overweight are at increased risk of death or severe illness from the disease.
The prime minister has a reputation as a bon viveur, who in the past has spoken of enjoying an expensive bottle of red wine and late-night binges on chorizo and cheese. But he has also championed cycling to work and introduced so-called ""Boris bikes"" in London for public use when mayor of the capital. 
Last month, Johnson said British people were fatter than most European counterparts apart from Malta and his government targeted ""tackling the obesity time bomb"".
""I WAS TOO FAT""
""I've always wanted to lose weight for ages and ages and like many people I struggle with my weight, I go up and down. But since I recovered from coronavirus I have been steadily building up my fitness,"" he said in a Twitter video on Monday.
""When I went into ICU (intensive care) when I was really ill, I was way overweight ... and, you know, I was too fat,"" he added, describing his new regime as a gentle run in the morning which gives him more energy during the day.
Johnson, who has often mocked state ""nannying"", said he hoped the new health campaign was not ""excessively bossy"" but rather a gentle nudge for Britain to get fitter.
With more than 60% of adults in Britain considered overweight or obese, according to Public Health England, a ""Better Health"" campaign will be introduced with weight management services expanded in the National Health Service.
The opposition Labour Party said it had heard ""big promises"" from the ruling Conservatives before and criticised them for past health service cuts. 

""An effective obesity strategy needs action, not consultation,"" said Labour's health and social care policy chief Alex Norris. ""The Tories (Conservatives) have pared public health to the bone and people are paying the price for ten years of this complacency.""

Ukrainian, Russian and OSCE negotiators last week agreed on a full ceasefire in eastern Ukraine from Monday, putting on hold the military conflict that has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2014.
The deal was backed by the presidents of Russia and Ukraine, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who agreed ""the need for an urgent implementation of extra measures to support the ceasefire regime in Donbass"".
Zelenskiy has sought to resolve the conflict since his election last year, arranging a number of prisoner swaps.
""We are talking about the possibility of a real ceasefire on both sides,"" the head of Ukraine's joint forces operation Volodymyr Kravchenko told a televised briefing.
""The situation is stable and controlled,"" he added.
On Sunday, Ukraine's defence ministry said in a statement that its forces ""stand ready to give a proper rebuff to the enemy in case of violation of the agreements"".
The separatists' DNA news agency said on Monday observers ""did not record any violations of the ceasefire by the security forces of Kiev, starting from 00:01 on July 27 this year.""
Ukraine and Russia have been foes since 2014, when Moscow seized Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and backed the rebellion in the east.

Major combat ended with a ceasefire agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015, but sporadic clashes still regularly kill civilians, Ukrainian soldiers and separatists.

The violence, mainly between Afghan government forces and the Taliban, killed 1,282 and injured 2,176 for a tally of 3,458 civilian casualties, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a report.
""The reality remains that Afghanistan continues to be one of the deadliest conflicts in the world for civilians,"" it said in the mid-year report.
Despite a drop of 13% in casualties from the corresponding period last year, UNAMA said the Taliban continued to cause the majority of civilian casualties, mainly through use of explosive devices, abductions and summary executions.
The Taliban were responsible for 43% of all civilian casualties and government forces caused 23%, chiefly from air strikes and indirect fire during operations, it added.
The UNAMA attributed the 13% drop to fewer operations by international forces, as well as fewer attacks by Islamic State militants.
In February, the United States and the Taliban signed an agreement in Doha, laying out plans for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the militants.
However, fighting has spiked in recent weeks, prompted by differences over an exchange of prisoners between the Taliban and Afghan government, as Kabul proved reluctant to free hundreds of jailed militants. 
The Doha deal provided for the government to release 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for hundreds of Afghan troops, the main plank in starting peace negotiations between the two sides in the effort to end the 18-year-old war. 
While the Afghan government has released more than 4,000 Taliban prisoners, it has refused to release another 600, saying they were involved in murder, illicit drug trafficking and major attacks.

The use of dummy American warships has become an occasional feature of training by Iran's Revolutionary Guards and its naval forces, including in 2015 when Iranian missiles hit a mock-up resembling a Nimitz-class aircraft carrier. 
Tehran, which opposes the presence of U.S. and Western navies in the Gulf, frequently holds naval war games in the strategic Strait, the conduit for some 30% of all crude and other oil liquids traded by sea.
One of the images taken on July 26 by U.S.-based space technology firm Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) showed an Iranian fast attack boat moving toward the model U.S. carrier in the strategic waterway. Another image showed model planes lined up on the deck of the fake carrier.
""We cannot speak to what Iran hopes to gain by building this mock-up, or what tactical value they would hope to gain by using such a mock-up in a training or offensive exercise scenario,"" said Commander Rebecca Rebarich, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Navy’s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet.
""We remain confident in our naval forces' ability to defend themselves against any maritime threat.""
Tensions have spiked between Iran and the United States since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that has sharply dropped Tehran's oil exports.
Iran's Guards in April said Tehran would destroy U.S. warships if its security is threatened in the Gulf. Iranian officials have repeatedly threatened to block Hormuz if Iran is not able to export oil or if its nuclear sites are attacked.
There have been periodic confrontations between the Iranian Guards and the U.S. military in the Gulf in recent years. U.S. officials have said closing the Strait would be crossing a ""red line"" and America would take action to reopen it.

Iran cannot legally close the waterway unilaterally because part of it is in Omani territorial waters. However, ships that sail it pass through Iranian waters, which are under the responsibility of the Iran's Guards naval force.

Five senior editors resigned last month from Vedomosti after complaints at the newspaper that acting editor-in-chief Andrei Shmarov was censoring coverage critical of President Vladimir Putin and had threatened to fire staff who broke his rules. 
At least four of those editors and several other journalists said they were setting up an online media outlet called VTimes that would launch later this year and cover many of the same areas as Vedomosti. 
""We believe Russia like never before needs independent sources of information that can be trusted, it needs platforms for the free exchange of opinions and for professional expertise,"" they said in a statement on the new outlet. 
Shmarov denies threatening to fire staff. He said his editorial decisions were his alone and were not dictated to him by outside parties.
Shmarov was appointed acting editor-in-chief in March following an announcement that two businessmen would be buying the paper. 
A Vedomosti editorial complained Shmarov had banned the publication of opinion polls carried out by a research firm this year that showed Putin's approval rating had fallen to a two-decade low. A reporter said Shmarov had banned negative coverage of Putin's constitutional reforms.
Shmarov said Vedomosti was continuing to publish news items on subjects which he had been accused of banning.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Whichever way the verdict goes on Tuesday in the first 1MDB corruption trial of Malaysia's former leader Najib Razak, the outcome will be fraught with risk for Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, political sources and analysts say.
A guilty verdict could boost Muhyiddin's credibility with the public, but weaken his coalition, which counts Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) as its biggest component - and potentially trigger snap polls.
An acquittal could turn public sentiment against Muhyiddin, and encourage the opposition to challenge the ruling coalition's two-seat majority in parliament.
UMNO lost a 2018 election amid widespread anger over allegations of graft on a massive scale. 
But the party returned to power in a coalition led by Muhyiddin in March, after veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad resigned as premier amid infighting within the alliance that toppled Najib.
While Najib no longer leads UMNO, he remains highly influential despite fighting dozens of charges over a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal at state fund 1MDB.
Prosecutors allege more than $1 billion went into Najib's accounts from 1MDB, but Najib has denied any wrongdoing and pleaded not guilty. 
The verdict on Tuesday is in a case that involves only around $10 million, but as it is the first of many its outcome is being especially closely watched. 
""A guilty verdict would be unacceptable to UMNO, and may further weaken Muhyiddin's administration or lead to snap polls,"" said Adib Zalkapli, Malaysia director with political risk consultancy BowerGroupAsia.
Najib's camp could withdraw support for the prime minister, a source close to UMNO and another close to Muhyiddin said. 
""There is a real threat,"" said the source close to the prime minister.
Spokesmen for Najib and Muhyiddin did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Mahathir and his uneasy ally in opposition, Anwar Ibrahim, have accused Muhyiddin of stealing power by shifting alliances to UMNO instead of earning it at the ballot box.
While agreed on the goal of ousting Muhyiddin, the opposition camp is split over who should be its prime ministerial candidate.
Muhyiddin was also helped last week by the $3.9 billion settlement reached with U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (N:GS) for its role in the 1MDB scandal. 
He has gained public support too for his administration's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. 
But opposition lawmakers reckon they could benefit from a backlash against Muhyiddin if Najib is acquitted. 
""People will be extremely angry, and we could gain momentum politically,"" said Chang Lih Kang, an opposition lawmaker with Anwar's party. ""It's not good to go into election with a baggage like Najib."" 
Yet, UMNO leaders, including Najib, have been pushing for snap polls to capitalise on perceptions among Malays, the country's ethnic majority, that Mahathir's administration had neglected their interests.
""If an election is held tomorrow, UMNO would win together with PAS, perhaps close to half the total seats,"" said Oh Ei Sun, a senior fellow with Singapore's Institute of International Affairs, referring to the main Islamic party.
In such a scenario, Muhyiddin and his Bersatu party, made up largely of former UMNO members, could also struggle to secure a relevant role, political analysts said.

Malaysia does not recognise refugee status, but the Muslim-majority country is a favoured destination for Rohingya Muslims seeking a better life after escaping a 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar and, more recently, refugee camps in Bangladesh.
Late on Saturday, one Rohingya swam ashore from a small boat off Langkawi's west coast. Officials had feared that the rest of the group had drowned while trying to reach the beach, but they were later discovered on an islet just off the coast. 
""They were found hiding in the bushes on the island,"" Mohd Zubil Mat Som, director-general of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) said in a text message.
Authorities have detained the refugees. Two more Rohingya migrants have also been arrested for suspected trafficking in connection with the people found, Mohd Zubil said.
The refugees were believed to have transferred to a small boat to sneak into Malaysia, having travelled on a ""motherboat"" carrying hundreds of Rohingya from Bangladesh, the coastguard official said.
In a statement, MMEA's provincial director Mohd Zawawi Abdullah said the refugees were smuggled in on local fishing boats that acted as ""transporters"" to bring them to Langkawi.
""Our investigations found that this syndicate transfers migrants from motherboats near the maritime border to local fishing boats to evade local authorities,"" Zawawi said.
Last month, Malaysia had detained 269 Rohingya who arrived in Langkawi on a damaged boat. Mohd Zubil had said at the time that dozens of people on the boat were believed to have perished during a voyage that lasted four months.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said last month Malaysia was unable to take in any more Rohingya, citing a struggling economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.

ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss pharmaceutical company has completed the first transaction under a new humanitarian trade channel with Iran, the government in Bern said on Monday.
The Swiss Humanitarian Trade Arrangement (SHTA) channel to bring food and medicine to Iran started trial operations in January, helping supply Swiss goods to the struggling population without tripping over U.S. sanctions.
""We would like to emphasise that the operationalisation of the SHTA is progressing and that a number of companies have already been approved, more companies will follow. Further transactions should be carried out shortly,"" the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) said by email.
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from the sanctions that Washington reimposed on Tehran after President Donald Trump walked away from a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear programme.
But the U.S. measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred several foreign banks from doing business with the Islamic Republic - including humanitarian deals.
SECO did not identify the Swiss drugmaker or give a value for the shipment, which it said involved a cancer drug used to treat iron overload caused by repeated blood transfusions.
The pilot deal in January shipped to Iran cancer drugs and drugs required for organ transplants worth 2.3 million euros ($2.7 million). Geneva-based bank BCP and drugmaker Novartis took part in the pilot deal.

GUWAHATI, India (Reuters) - When doctors in a flood-ravaged Indian state urgently sought plasma of a particular blood type for a COVID-19 patient this month, health officials sent a boat for a marooned donor who had recovered from the disease weeks ago.
With coronavirus cases surging in the northeastern state of Assam and critical medicines running low, local authorities are rolling out the red carpet for now-cured patients - all for their blood plasma believed to be rich in virus antibody, although research on its efficacy has not been conclusive.
Assam says that symptomatic patients who donate plasma four weeks after recovery will get preference in government jobs and housing. For example, a donor may get extra marks if he or she is tied in any test or interview for a job.
It is also offering to cover travel and other expenses for donors from outside the state, and has been making its frontline workers scour the state - sometimes wading through flood waters - to bring willing participants to plasma donation centres.
The success of the overall effort is crucial for Assam, one of India's poorest states that is short of remdesivir and tocilizumab to treat severe COVID-19 patients. Delhi and Odisha states are also courting plasma donors as India's total infections have leaped to 1.4 million with nearly 33,000 deaths.
""Recently, we wanted O-group plasma for a patient, a doctor,"" Assam Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told Reuters in an interview.
""When we learned that a person was willing to donate, people went to his house by boat, brought him to the hospital and got the donation done.""
He declined to identify the donor but said the recipient was doing well.
Plasma from a previously infected person can be used to treat up to two moderately ill patients, Sarma said. Without timely treatment, such patients' condition can potentially worsen, further straining the limited pool for medicines.
""We have seen that if you give plasma between moderate and critical stage, the results are very, very good,"" he said.
GREY MARKET
Assam, where floods have so far killed around 100 people and affected roughly 3 million, is predicting coronavirus infections will peak in mid-September. It has so far reported more than 32,000 cases with 79 deaths.
Its push for plasma comes as India, the world's biggest suppliers of generic drugs, scrambles to end a local shortage of remdesivir and tocilizumab.
Although U.S. drugmaker  Gilead Sciences Inc  (NASDAQ:GILD) has authorised six companies operating in India to make and sell generic versions of remdesivir, only three of them have so far been able to start making supplies available.
Sarma said that until recently, Assam was receiving only 12-16 remdesivir vials a day, compared with a demand for at least 100. But the situation eased when Assam got 400 vials from a local company some days ago, he said.

""Still, people are not doing enough production and obviously a grey market has emerged as a result,"" Sarma said.

Permata Hati Kindergarten, a private kindergarten with 135 pupils in the city of Semarang in Central Java province, is allowing six pupils per day to spend time in the classroom, giving children a chance to attend school once every two weeks.
Central Java has recorded Indonesia's fourth highest number of infections and at least 287 people have died in Semarang alone, according to government data. 
Accompanied by parents, the children sit within protective boxes made using plastic sheets that are disinfected after each classroom session to get guidance to direct their learning.
""The transparent box is one of our commitments for prioritising health protocols,"" said headmistress Hindarwati, who uses one name like many Indonesians.
Everyone attending the school is required to wear a mask, face shield, gloves and have temperature checks. 
Parents uncomfortable with risking sending their children to school can choose home learning with online sessions via video conferencing applications like Zoom. 
""I'm not bored at all, because I can do Zoom calls with all my friends, I can also meet my teacher. I love it,"" said five-year-old Jihan Notharisa.
The learning sessions include dancing, music and Koran reading and the kindergarten also sends teachers to visit students at their homes, with portable protective screens for social distancing.
""As parents, we strongly support this activity, so that our children can meet with their teacher in person even though the time is limited,"" said Nita Dwi Nurhayati, a mother of a pupil. 
Most schools in Indonesia have not resumed full-time physical classes yet unless in ""green zone"" locations with fewer coronavirus cases.

Overall, Indonesia has reported 98,778 COVID-19 cases and 4,781 deaths, the highest toll in East Asia.

PORT MANSFIELD, Texas (Reuters) - Hanna, the first hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic season, left a trail of destruction along the Texas coast on Sunday, downing power lines, flooding streets and toppling 18-wheeler trucks as torrential rains threatened the area. 
Hanna came ashore on Padre Island on Saturday afternoon as a Category 1 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity and later made a second landfall in Kenedy County, Texas. It swept through a part of the state hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic. By Sunday, it had weakened to a tropical depression.
Powerful winds from Hanna knocked over at least three 18-wheeler trucks and a recreational vehicle, with tow trucks trying to right the toppled vehicles on Sunday, shutting down a 2-mile (3.2-km) stretch of U.S. Route 77 in Sarita, Texas, near the Mexican border.
In Port Mansfield, 150 miles (240 km) south of Padre Island, winds flattened sugarcane fields and leveled trees. Deer roamed the streets, stopping to nibble downed branches in the yards of homes, some that lost their roofs.
Heavy downpours of more than a foot (30 cm) of rain flooded roadways and swelled streams and rivers across south Texas, the National Weather Service said.
There were no immediate reports of injuries.
""You could hear the wind blowing and the rain blowing and you looked outside you could see sheets of water blowing down the street,"" said Sharon Pecce, 75, a resident of Port Mansfield, whose roof was ripped off her house on Saturday night.
""It's scary to go through this at my age, a lot could have happened ... we could have been killed,"" added Pecce, who was at a friend's home with her 70-year-old husband when the damage occurred. ""We are lucky we weren't there.""
Roderick Kise, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Rio Grande Valley, told the Caller Times newspaper in Corpus Christi that his agency was looking into a report that winds toppled a newly constructed portion of the border wall built between the United States and Mexico.
At one point, more than 283,000 homes and businesses were without electricity. But that figure fell to 98,000 by Sunday night, according to poweroutage.us.
The storm was not expected to affect offshore oil-and-gas production. Energy companies have not evacuated workers or shut down production from their Gulf of Mexico platforms because of Hanna.
Some residents took advantage of the wild weather, with Alejandero Carcano, 16, and Jesse Garewal, 18, both of Galveston, surfing the high swells whipped up by Hanna.
Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement on Sunday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared the storm a federal emergency and would help fund evacuation and shelter efforts.
""I continue to urge Texans to heed the guidance from their local leaders and follow best practices to keep themselves and their loved ones safe as severe weather continues to move through our communities,"" he said.
The Texas area struck by Hanna has struggled to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 in recent weeks. Cases along the state's coast have soared into the tens of thousands. 
More than 440 people in the Corpus Christi area were hospitalized with the illness, according to the state health department.
STILL A THREAT
Weakening as it headed west over land, Hanna's center on Sunday was about 35 miles (55 km) from Monterrey, Mexico, as it moved 9 miles per hour (15 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a bulletin posted at 4 p.m. (2100 GMT).
The storm's top sustained winds were around 35 mph (56 kph), the center said.
The storm was forecast to lose more steam as it moved across Texas and northeastern Mexico. On Sunday, weather watch officials canceled a storm surge warning they had issued for the Texas coast.
Hanna still posed a threat, forecasters said, noting it could dump upward of 18 inches (45 cm) of rain in isolated areas of southern Texas through Monday.
""This rain will produce life-threatening flash flooding, rapid rises on small streams, and isolated minor-to-moderate river flooding,"" the NHC said.

In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was churning near Hawaii on Sunday, with torrential rains and damaging winds.

The decision to drop the charges against Vorayuth ""Boss"" Yoovidhya has stirred public anger about the country's entrenched culture of impunity for the rich and well-connected.
The charges had included speeding, hit-and-run and reckless driving causing death. 
""A committee has been set up to ascertain the facts for transparency and fairness to all parties with regards to actions of the police, ensuring they were acting in accordance with the law and regulations,"" the national police said in a statement. 
The committee will report its findings in 15 days. 
The announcement comes after the Office of the Attorney-General said it would also probe the decision.
Red Bull has sought to distance itself from Vorayuth, the grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, who created the energy drink Krating Daeng, or Red Bull. Calls have been growing to boycott its products amid anger on social media. 
Vorayuth, who was 27 at the time, was accused of crashing his Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) into a policeman and dragging his body under the car for dozens of metres before fleeing the scene.
He missed eight court summonses over the case before authorities issued an arrest warrant five years after the incident. He later disappeared, apparently abroad, according to some social media posts.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's office said on Sunday that news of the dropped case made him ""uncomfortable"" and stressed that he had never granted personal favors.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Victoria state on Monday reported the country's highest daily increase in coronavirus infections, prompting the authorities to warn a six-week lockdown may last longer if people continue to go to work while feeling unwell.
The second-most populous state reported 532 new cases of the virus which causes COVID-19, the most new cases in a day since the pandemic arrived in Australia, and six more deaths, taking the state toll to 77, almost half the national death toll.
Five of the latest deaths were people in aged care facilities, the authorities said.
Until recently Australia had avoided the high COVID-19 casualty rates of other countries, but a wave of community transmission in Victoria has prompted a lockdown in Melbourne, the only Australian city to make it mandatory to wear a facemask in public.
""If you've got a sniffle, a scratchy throat, a headache, fever, then you can't go to work,"" said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews in a televised news conference.
""This is what is driving these numbers up, and the lockdown will not end until people stop going to work with symptoms and instead go and get tested because they have symptoms.""
Melbourne, home to a fifth of Australia's 25 million population, is halfway though a six-week ban on movement other than for work, buying food, giving or receiving healthcare, or daily exercise. Andrews added that he may announce additional measures later this week.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the high number of new cases in Victoria showed how transmission of the illness among younger people, who were considered lower risk, could spread to aged care facilities through family members.
""In Victoria there is still a long way to go,"" Morrison told reporters.
""We are still seeing case numbers at elevated levels and ... when you get community-based transmission, it does take some time to get that down."" Victoria has had 8,173 cases.
Neighbouring New South Wales (NSW) state, the country's most populous, is also grappling with several virus clusters that have sprung up at a hotel, a Thai restaurant and a club. NSW reported 17 new cases on Monday. NSW has had 3,496 cases.
Australia has recorded a total 14,935 cases and 161 deaths.
More than 16.13 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 644,836​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian businessman Rami Makhlouf revealed on Sunday he had set up a web of offshore front companies to help President Bashar al Assad evade Western sanctions, in a social media post blasting the government for investigating his business empire.
One of Syria's richest and most powerful businessmen, Makhlouf said security forces were now targeting Cham Holding, the centrepiece of a vast business portfolio much of which has been seized by the cash-strapped government.
The former Assad loyalist who is also a cousin of the president said security forces were pursuing contracts signed by Cham Holding on suspicion he had embezzled funds abroad.
""They fabricated our embezzlement of funds and transferring it to our accounts abroad ... Stop these unjust claims and read well the contracts,"" Makhlouf said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. 
""These companies' role and aim is to circumvent (Western) sanctions on Cham Holding.""
Makhlouf, who has helped bankroll the ruling family and its supporters, brought in 70 investors nearly 15 years ago to set up Cham Holding. It is the largest Syrian company by capital and has a monopoly on key property developments.
Washington enacted sweeping sanctions on Syria last month known as the Caesar Act targeting new lists of individuals and companies who support Assad's government, among them entities owned by Makhlouf.
Makhlouf's estrangement with Assad first came to the open on April 30 when he denounced taxes imposed on Syriatel, the country's main mobile company which the Makhlouf family controls.
He later blasted the ""inhumane"" arrests of his aides in an unprecedented attack on the government from within Assad's inner circle, exposing a deep rift within the ruling elite. He added that he would not surrender his wealth under intimidation.
Businessmen and insiders familiar with the struggle say Assad is targeting Makhlouf's wealth abroad as Syria's economy collapses after a decade of war. Most of his onshore assets have been seized while his contracts to manage and operate duty free markets were abrogated.
The billionaire and others close to him are under U.S. sanctions for what Washington calls public corruption.

The European Union has also slapped sanctions on Makhlouf since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, accusing him of bankrolling Assad.

MAUI, Hawaii (Reuters) - Hurricane Douglas bore down on Hawaii on Sunday packing torrential rains and damaging winds as it churned just east of the islands in the central Pacific, forecasters said, with one local leader urging residents to be prepared for the worst.
Douglas was expected to make landfall or pass close to the main Hawaiian islands from Maui to Kauai later in the day or into the evening, the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center said. Sirens blared on Maui on Sunday morning as palm trees swayed in the wind and white-cap waves crashed against the island's shores, video aired on local television showed. 
In its latest update, the hurricane center said Douglas had maximum sustained winds of 85 miles per hour (140 km per hour), moving west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph) about 55 miles (90 km) east of Kahului. 
""We encourage everyone to hunker down, to be prepared for hurricane force winds. We prepare for the worst and hope for the best,"" Governor David Ige said during a news conference.
Storms of this magnitude are rare for Hawaii, with only five hurricanes and tropical storms causing major damage on the remote string of islands since 1950, according to researchers at the University of Hawaii.
As the hurricane interacts with the terrain, it will continue to shift and move, said Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell, who warned of a storm surge on the west side of the Island of Oahu. 
""This is a serious storm. We think back to Hurricane Iwa and the damage it did on the west side as the wind shifted,"" he said, referring to the 1982 storm that caused more than $300 million in damage. 
Maui County Mayor Michael Victorino told residents to put food in coolers and to stay indoors. 
""Pray that this impact will be minimal,"" Victorino said in comments aired by KHON2 News, a local Fox affiliate. 
Hurricane conditions, including several inches of rain, were expected during the day in Maui County and on Oahu Island and on Kauai and Niihau at night, forecasters said. 
The Hawaiian islands will experience large swells on Monday, producing life-threatening and potentially destructive surf along shores, the hurricane center said. The storm surge will lift water levels as much as three feet (one meter) near the hurricane's center, it added.

Hawaii has only a fraction of the number of tourists it would normally have at this time of year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

145,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>","Banned in China, some Falun Gong fear new Hong Kong national security law","HONG KONG (Reuters) - On Sunday July 5, five days after China enacted a new national security law in Hong Kong, Yang Xiaolan and three dozen Falun Gong members stood upright in a public park, their arms outstretched above their closed eyes as their meditation soundtrack blended with birdsong.
The spiritual group was banned in mainland China in 1999 but its members have been allowed to practice in Hong Kong freely, even though the group urges people to renounce the ruling Chinese Communist Party. Yang said she no longer feels safe in the city after the security law made the broadly defined crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. 
""In the mainland, my heart always trembled when I practiced Falun Gong. I constantly feared for my life,"" said Yang, who fled mainland China in 2009. ""Just like the mainland public security authorities, they can trample on the law and say anything is illegal,"" she said, talking about the new security law.
The Hong Kong government declined to comment on how the new law would impact Falun Gong, but said the law preserves ""the basic rights and freedom lawfully enjoyed by law-abiding citizens."" The law makes no mention of religious or spiritual groups. 
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the new Hong Kong law will sanction any behavior that endangers national security.
On Falun Gong generally, the ministry said in a statement: ""Falun Gong is a cult organization banned by the Chinese government in accordance with the law, which has also been spurned by the Chinese people for a long time. Banning this cult organization is an act of justice by the Chinese government, made in response to the people's demand and an effort to maintain social stability and to protect human rights. The alleged suppression is nonsense.""
Falun Gong was founded in mainland China in 1992, combining meditation, slow-motion exercises, moral teachings broadly based on Buddhism and Taoism and leader Li Hongzhi’s sometimes unorthodox theories, such as his belief that aliens have started to take over the world.
The Chinese Communist Party saw the group's growing popularity as a challenge to its rule and banned it after 10,000 practitioners silently protested in Beijing, calling it an ""evil cult"" that threatened national stability, and imprisoned some of its members.
""Of course we’re worried,"" said Sarah Liang, a journalist for The Epoch Times, a newspaper started by Falun Gong members that is heavily critical of the Chinese Communist Party and supports U.S. President Donald Trump. ""But we’re different from other groups in that we've already suffered 20 years of persecution.""
Ingrid Wu, spokeswoman for the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa, an alternative name for the group, said two members have already left Hong Kong because of fears for their safety. She identified one of those people only as Susan, and asked that the other not be named. 
""It is a hanging knife over our heads,"" Wu said.
Even though the new security law makes no specific mention of religious or spiritual groups, Maya Wang, senior China researcher at Human Rights Watch, described the law as wide and arbitrary. ""Anyone who is critical of the Chinese government can be construed as having violated the law,"" she said.  
TAKING DOWN BANNERS 
Yang and six other of the 300 or so Falun Gong devotees who regularly practice in various places across Hong Kong told Reuters they plan to continue as they did before the law.
Whether they will be able to is seen by some as a litmus test of ‘one country, two systems,’ the principle China adopted when it took back control of Hong Kong in 1997, granting the territory a high degree of autonomy and religious and press freedoms not available on the mainland.
Some Falun Gong members said they have already made changes. At one publicity stall outside the Star Ferry terminal in Kowloon, Falun Gong used to prominently display a poster saying ""Heaven will destroy the Communist Party."" About two weeks after the new law, it was gone. Wu said that after the law was passed, some police officers asked volunteers to take down such banners, and that some members had agreed to take them down temporarily. 
Hong Kong police declined to comment on Falun Gong and said it did not track national security complaints against specific groups. Reuters could not independently verify that the police were behind the removal of any banners.
""Who knows when they’ll call us illegal,"" said Wincy Chan, who operated the stall. 
Although largely left in peace by the Hong Kong government, Chan and her fellow members have for years faced opposition from certain pro-Beijing groups based in the city.
Next to her stall at the Star Ferry, an organization called Care for The Youth Group Association Hong Kong has a stall manned by two volunteers sporting neon vests with ""Exterminate evil cult Falun Gong"" emblazoned on them in red.
One of them, Paul Chan, a 52-year-old former civil servant, said he distributed pamphlets for personal reasons.
""My relatives in the mainland believed in Falun Gong, and fell under some sort of influence. They wanted to kill themselves, harm themselves,"" said Chan, who did not name his relatives. ""They’re not a religion. What they’re saying about healing powers is entirely false.""
Chan’s organization declined requests for comment. Reuters could not determine whether the group has made any complaints about Falun Gong to the police. 
Joanna Lau, a Falun Gong practitioner who organizes street stalls, said only a few members have stopped volunteering. Still, she said one member, whom she identified only as Ms Li, had replaced a banner in the Causeway Bay district accusing the Chinese Communist Party of harvesting organs of Falun Gong members, a claim Beijing has denied, to one promoting meditation.
""I think they will spare no effort in trying to stop our activities,"" said Yang. ""I don’t know if we will still be able to continue.""
Despite those fears, some play down the potential threat. The Hong Kong government has so far ""simply ignored"" Falun Gong, said Lau Siu-kai, vice president of the Chinese Association of Hong Kong and Macau Studies, Beijing’s top think-tank on affairs in those territories. 
""If they concentrate on the qigong (breathing exercise) aspect, or the religious aspect of Falun Gong and abstain from challenging Beijing or attacking the reputation of national leaders, I think the government might have less incentive or less legal reason to deal with them,"" he said.

Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called on Beijing to stop its mistreatment of Falun Gong members on the 21st anniversary of the crackdown.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party raced ahead of rivals in the latest opinion poll, putting the charismatic 40-year-old leader on track for a comfortable victory in the elections in September.
A Newshub-Reid Research Poll released late on Sunday showed the popularity of Ardern's Labour Party rose to 60.9%, the highest it has been in the poll's history. 
The popularity of the main opposition National Party, which has been embroiled in a series of scandals and leadership changes, plunged to 25.1%.
According to the survey the Labour Party, which is now in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, would win 77 of 120 seats in parliament. This means Labour would be able to govern without a coalition partner. 
Ardern's own popularity as preferred prime minister was sky high at 62%, while the National Party's newly elected 61-year-old leader Judith Collins stood at just 14.6%.
Ardern has consistently polled ahead of her rivals and her popularity has risen further this year as she won global praise for her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The country of 5 million people has had just 1,206 COVID-19 cases so far, and 22 deaths. 
Ardern's stratospheric rise in 2017 to become New Zealand's youngest prime minister and third woman to hold the office has been dubbed ""Jacinda-mania"" by some.
""I would like to think the message we can take from this is the general support for the government's COVID-19 recovery and response plan,"" Ardern told Newshub on Monday in response to the survey.
National Party campaign chairman Gerry Brownlee said the poll is a ""rogue"".
Collins told Reuters last week that she was confident her party would form the next government.

Ardern, who turned 40 on Sunday, told Newshub she celebrated with her partner and her two-year-old daughter doing normal things like going to the beach.

Trump raised the prospect last month of expanding the G7 to again include Russia, which had been expelled in 2014 following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.
But Maas told Rheinische Post that he did not see any chance for allowing Russia back into the G7 as long as there was no meaningful progress in solving the conflict in Crimea as well as in eastern Ukraine.
Russia itself could make the biggest contribution to becoming part of the G7 format again by contributing to a peaceful solution in the Ukraine conflict, Maas said.
Russia is still part of the G20, a broader grouping including other emerging-market economies.
""G7 and G20 are two sensibly coordinated formats. We don't need G11 or G12 anymore,"" Maas said in reference to Trump's proposal to invite not only Russia, but other countries to G7 meetings.
Maas described the relationship with Russia as ""currently difficult"" in many areas. ""But we also know that we need Russia to solve conflicts such as those in Syria, Libya and Ukraine. That will not work against Russia, but only with Russia.""
Germany, which took over the rotating six-month EU presidency on July 1, has taken on a mediating role in the conflict in Libya as well as in Ukraine.

""But Russia also has to make its contribution, which is very slow in Ukraine,"" Maas said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan said on Sunday it had detained opposition union leaders to prevent a campaign of protests that would have paralysed essential government services as the country grapples with the economic blow from the coronavirus crisis. 
The country's security force on Saturday arrested 13 leading members of the Teachers Syndicate on charges of incitement, corruption, criminal activities and financial irregularities in a surprise crackdown on one of the country's largest grassroots movements that has become a leading source of dissent.
""The teachers union were threatening again to stage protests, sit-ins and strikes that harm the state's essential services and their functioning,"" Amjad al Adailah, cabinet minister and government spokesman, told reporters.
Officials said those being questioned included union leader Nasser Nawasreh and others who last year organised a one-month strike over pay, the longest and one of the most disruptive public sector strikes in the country's history.
The government reluctantly agreed to a deal last October that ended the strike, which included agreeing to a 50% pay rise to come into effect this year in a bid to avoid a deeper political crisis. 
In recent weeks, the 100,000-strong union has accused the government of failing to honour the deal.
The government postponed all pay hikes for the public sector saying state finances were under severe strain.
Security forces have deployed around main government buildings where unions have called for protests in coming days in defiance of a government ban, witnesses said. 
Some activists have also demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz.
Razzaz said in televised remarks on Sunday he would not tolerate any attempt to break the law by any ""group, political party or union that sought to confiscate the rights of others.""
Some officials have accused union leaders of harbouring the Islamist opposition's political agenda. The union says this accusation is part of a government smear campaign.
Rights activists have accused the government of using draconian powers under emergency laws enacted last March to curb the pandemic as an excuse to limit civic and political rights. Scores of activists have been arrested over comments on social media.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - More than 60 people were reported killed and nearly 60 others wounded during an armed attack in a village in Sudan's restive Darfur region on Saturday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said late on Sunday.
The attack in Masteri village in the West Darfur state ""was one of the latest of a series of security incidents reported over the last week that left several villages and houses burned, markets and shops looted, and infrastructure damaged,"" the U.N. body added in a statement. It did not cite the source of its information.
There was no official word from the government on the incident and Reuters was not able to reach officials for comment.
Sudan said on Sunday it would deploy joint forces from various state security services in Darfur after renewed violence there recently, SUNA, the state news agency, reported.
The forces will be deployed to the region's five states ""to protect people and secure the agriculture season"", Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said during a meeting in Khartoum with a delegation of women from Darfur. No further details were given.
The country's Security and Defense Council stressed the importance of ""using the force necessary to save lives and property, confront all forms of lawlessness and support equal citizenship rights,"" it said after a meeting on Sunday.
In a separate incident, at least 20 people died and 22 others were injured after gunmen from an unidentified militia attacked a village in the state of South Darfur, witnesses and a local community leader said on Saturday. 
On Sunday, three people, including a woman, were killed during a renewed dispute between farmers and shepherds in the Al-Jarf area in North Darfur state, SUNA reported, adding that security forces intervened and separated the two sides. 
Recent violence by militias in North Darfur prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency on July 13.
""The escalation of violence in different parts of Darfur region is leading to increased displacement, compromising the agricultural season, causing loss of lives and livelihoods and driving growing humanitarian needs,"" the United Nations said.
The conflict started in Darfur, in the west of Sudan, in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against the Khartoum government. Government forces and mainly Arab militia, which moved to suppress the revolt, were accused of widespread atrocities. Some 300,000 people were killed in the conflict, according to U.N. estimates.
Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's ousted leader, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Darfur.
Sudan's transitional government is negotiating with some main rebel groups in Darfur aiming to reach a peace deal.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The deputy leader of Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah movement on Sunday dismissed the prospect of an escalation of violence between the Iran-backed movement and Israel despite increased tensions in the last week.
""The atmosphere does not indicate a war ... It's unlikely, the atmosphere of war in the next few months,"" Sheikh Naim Qassem said in an interview with pro-Damascus television station al Mayadeen.
Tensions rose along Israel's frontier with Syria and Lebanon after Lebanon's Hezbollah militia said a fighter was killed in an apparent Israeli strike on the edge of Damascus last week.
After two Hezbollah members were killed in Damascus in August 2019, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah vowed the group would respond if Israel killed any more of its fighters inside Syria.
The Israeli military has since boosted its forces on its northern front.
An Israeli drone crashed inside Lebanon during operational activity along the border, an Israeli military spokeswoman said on Sunday. 
Israel has stepped up strikes on Syria in recent months in what Western intelligence sources say is a shadow war approved by Washington that has undermined Iran's military power in the region without triggering a major increase in hostilities.
Hezbollah has deployed fighters in Syria as part of Iranian-backed efforts to support President Bashar al-Assad in a conflict that spiralled out of protests against his rule in 2011.
The bases in eastern, central and southern Syria which Israel has hit in recent months are believed to have a strong presence of Iranian-backed militias, according to intelligence sources and military defectors familiar with the locations.
Analysts say Hezbollah and Israel want to avoid an all-out conflict at a time of regional tensions and keep rules of engagement drawn up since the Iran-backed movement fought a one-month war with Israel in 2006.

""There is no change of rules of engagement and the deterrent equation with Israel exists and we are not planning to change it,"" Qassem said.

Valery Tsepkalo, who was this month barred from running in an Aug. 9 election against veteran President Alexander Lukashenko, fled to Russia with his two young sons, fearing they could be taken away, his campaign said on Friday. 
Authorities disqualified Tsepkalo, 55, from the race after saying they suspected some of the signatures he had collected in his support had been forged, an allegation he denies. 
His campaign said officials from the General Prosecutor's Office has visited his sons' school to try to strip him and his wife of their parental rights. The General Prosecutor's Office has denied trying to take his children away. 
Tsepkalo, who said he suspected he would meet the same fate as two other opposition figures who have been jailed, said he had no choice but to flee. 
""If I would be imprisoned, then I cannot speak openly about what is happening in Belarus,"" the former diplomat told Reuters at a cafe in central Moscow. ""Lukashenko's idea was to split us all and to destroy us one by one and he really did that."" 
Lukashenko has denied that any opposition figures have been jailed for political reasons, saying law-enforcement policies were aimed at preventing chaos in the country.
Tsepkalo, a successful entrepreneur, said he hoped the opposition had thwarted Lukashenko by uniting behind Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, the wife of an anti-government blogger who has taken her husband's place in the election.
Tikhanouskaya has joined forces with Tsepkalo's wife Veronika and a female campaign team member from another camp to try to unseat Lukashenko, who has dismissed women as being too fragile to run Belarus.
'JOAN OF ARC'
""Lukashenko couldn't expect that we would be able to organise behind one person who appears to be for Belarus society a symbol, like the symbol of the French resistance movement Joan of Arc,"" said Tsepkalo. He was referring to the 15th-century teenage girl who led the French to victory against the English army, which was besieging the city of Orleans.
Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former collective farm manager, has ruled for over a quarter of a century. He says he has delivered economic and political stability, with the state continuing to provide for many of people's needs.
He has accused opponents of plotting to overthrow him by force and accused Russian and Polish forces of trying to meddle in the election, something Moscow and Warsaw deny. 
Tsepkalo described how he had taken a 700-km minibus ride to Moscow from Minsk, the Belarusian capital, with his seven-year-old twins, with only a small suitcase and plastic bags filled with their belongings.
Lukashenko's refusal to take measures to mitigate the COVID-19 crisis had galvanised opposition against him, he said. 
The president has told people to drink vodka and take saunas to keep the disease at bay.
Tsepkalo added that the public was also fed up with economic stagnation.
A former ambassador to the United States, Tsepkalo said he hoped to travel to Ukraine and Poland to try to shape public opinion about his country's political problems.
Asked if he feared for his wife back home, Tsepkalo said he sensed Lukashenko's government had yet to determine how to handle female opposition figures. 

""I hope that I will be able to go back as soon as possible because I love my country,"" Tsepkalo said. ""I would like to see my country be a good, democratic and prosperous state.""

The rights group Provea, citing witnesses, said Carlos Chaparro, 47, died of a shot allegedly fired by a member of the National Guard as a crowd decried the shortage of fuel at a service station in the town of Aragua de Barcelona, in eastern Anzoategui state. 
Fuel shortages are crippling the OPEC country because of years of underinvestment and mismanagement at Venezuela's 1.3 million-barrel-per-day refining network, leaving it mostly idled, as well as U.S. sanctions designed to force out socialist President Nicolas Maduro that have complicated gasoline imports. 
While a flotilla of tankers bringing gasoline from ally Iran helped alleviate the shortages in June, fuel has again grown scarce. On July 16, Jose Luis Albornoz, 19, was killed during a gasoline protest in the fishing village of Toas Island in northern Zulia state.
""This is further evidence of the crisis our people are living through due to the lack of gasoline,"" Antonio Barreto Sira, the opposition-aligned governor of Anzoategui, wrote on Twitter. 
Venezuela's chief prosecutor, Tarek William Saab, said his office had ordered an investigation into the incident.

SELMA, Ala. (Reuters) - The body of civil rights icon John Lewis crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Sunday, decades after his ""Bloody Sunday"" beating there drew a national spotlight to the struggle for racial equality.
A military honor guard carried his American flag-draped casket from Brown Chapel AME Church to a horse-drawn carriage, which crossed the rose-petal strewn bridge where the battering of Lewis by a white state trooper during a voting rights demonstration in 1965 became a focal point of the movement. The carriage driver wore black top hat and a white face mask to guard against spread of the coronavirus.
Hundreds of people singing civil rights anthems watched ""The Final Crossing"" event. It was part of a multi-day celebration of the life of the congressman, whose body will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Monday. 
After his casket crossed the bridge, it was saluted by mask-wearing Black and white Alabama state troopers.
Lewis, who died on July 17 at age 80 after a battle with pancreatic cancer, was a fiercely determined champion of nonviolent protest and was inspired by civil rights giant Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Lewis, an Alabama sharecropper's son who strove for equality for Blacks in an America grappling with racial bigotry and segregation, played an outsized role in U.S. politics for six decades, first elected in 1986 to represent Georgia in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
The Edmund Pettus Bridge was a searing symbol of the civil rights struggle. On March 7, 1965 non-violent demonstrators calling for voting rights regardless of race marched across the bridge and were met by club-swinging Alabama state troopers at the direction of segregationist Alabama Governor George Wallace. Lewis was beaten so badly on what is now referred to as ""Bloody Sunday"" that his scars were visible decades later.
The brutality of ""Bloody Sunday"" inspired President Lyndon Johnson to demand Congress approve legislation removing barriers to Black voting, and lawmakers passed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965.
Currently, amid national anti-racism protests and a movement to abolish Confederate monuments and symbols, calls have grown to rename the bridge that is named for Edmund Pettus, who fought in the Confederate Army and robbed African-Americans of their right to vote after Reconstruction. 
In a surprise appearance at this year's ""Bloody Sunday"" march in Selma on March 1, Lewis implored voters to use the ballot box as ""a nonviolent instrument or tool to redeem the soul of America.""
Speaking at Sunday's church service, Democratic U.S. Representative Terri Sewell said Lewis never gave up hope.
""We are all infused with that optimism,"" she told the congregation. ""Can't you hear him? 'Find a way to get in the way -- good trouble, necessary trouble.'"" 

Barack Obama, the first Black U.S. president, awarded Lewis the presidential medal of freedom, America's highest civilian honor, in 2011.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has challenged a Supreme Court order that blocked several of his supporters' profiles on social networks amid an ongoing fake news investigation, the right-wing president said using his own social media accounts on Saturday evening.
The lawsuit, signed by the president and Brazil's Solicitor General José Levi, says the ruling granted by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes violates the constitutional rights of the owners of the accounts.
The blocking of the accounts was effective from Friday.
The Supreme Court suspended 16 accounts and 12 pages of digital influencers who defend Bolsonaro on social media, including politicians, businessmen and political activists with Twitter (N:TWTR) and Facebook (O:FB) accounts. None of the suspended accounts belongs to federal government employees or have an official connection with the federal government, while all belong to Bolsonaro supporters.
The solicitor general's role is to argue the current government's position on matters.
Moraes said his order to block the accounts sought to ""interrupt hateful criminal speeches.""
According to the president's claim -- the text of which was published by Bolsonaro on his own social media accounts -- he was challenging Moraes' order ""to ensure compliance with fundamental rights [including] the freedom of speech and freedom of expression...""

The president's lawsuit calls for the immediate unblocking of the affected accounts, arguing blocking them ""defies the Constitution.""

Multiple explosions could be heard in Baghdad on Sunday evening. Security sources said the depot, which is part of a military base used by both the police and paramilitary forces, was one that had caught fire in August last year.
That fire also set off explosions heard across Baghdad, killing one person and injuring 29 others. There were no casualties reported immediately on Sunday.
Iraqi paramilitary groups with links to Iran last year blamed a series of blasts at their weapons depots and bases on the United States and Israel as tension escalated between Washington and Tehran.
The U.S. killing of Iran's military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a missile strike in Baghdad in January raised the threat that Iraq could become a battlefield in a conflict between Washington and Tehran.

Ukrainian, Russian and OSCE negotiators agreed on a full ceasefire between government forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine from late July, putting on hold the military conflict that claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2014.
""The leaders agreed on the need for an urgent implementation of extra measures to support the ceasefire regime in Donbass,"" Zelenskiy's office said, referring to eastern Ukraine.
Zelenskiy came to power last year promising to end the conflict. Since then, Ukraine and Russia have implemented some confidence-building measures, including prisoner swaps and phased troop withdrawals in designated areas.
Putin told Zelenskiy in a phone call that Ukraine's decision to hold regional elections in 2020 contradicts the Minsk peace accords aimed at resolving the conflict.
Kyiv plans to hold local elections in October across the country apart from breakaway Donetsk and Luhansk regions.
Zelenskiy's office said the Ukrainian president told Putin that further steps were needed to free Ukrainian citizens being held in eastern Ukraine, Crimea and Russia.

Ukraine and Russia have been foes since 2014, when Moscow seized Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and backed the rebellion in the east. Major combat ended with a ceasefire agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015, but sporadic clashes still regularly kill civilians, Ukrainian soldiers and separatists.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya, grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya who created the Thai energy drink Krating Daeng, or Red Bull, was accused of crashing his black Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) into a policeman in 2012 and dragging his body for dozens of metres before fleeing the scene.
Police said on Friday his charges, which included speeding, hit-and-run and reckless driving causing death, were dropped in a case that has raised questions about crime and punishment for the well-connected.
TCP Group, which owns the Thai Red Bull brand, said it is run by Vorayuth's uncle and not directly associated with Vorayuth, whose father has part ownership in the international Red Bull brand that Chaleo had co-founded with an Austrian partner.
""TCP Group would like to clarify that Mr. Vorayuth Yoovidhya has never assumed any role in the management and daily operations of TCP Group, was never a shareholder, nor has he held any executive position within TCP Group,"" the company said in a statement on late Saturday. 
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's office said on Sunday that news of the dropped case made him ""uncomfortable"" and he had ordered relevant agencies to review previous steps, adding that he had never granted personal favors. 
The Office of the Attorney-General also said it would look into how the case was dropped. 
Many Thais were angered by the move to drop charges, which prompted allegations of impunity for the rich and sparked calls on social media to boycott Red Bull products. 
TCP Group said it was ""fully aware of the situation and truly understands consumer sentiments regarding the incident."" 
Vorayuth's grandfather was listed as the third-richest person in Thailand when he died in 2012 aged 88, with an estimated net worth of $5 billion, according to Forbes magazine.

Gulf states Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and non-Gulf state Egypt cut ties with Qatar in June 2017 over accusations it supports terrorism. Doha denies the charges and says the bloc aims to infringe its sovereignty.
The United States, along with Gulf state Kuwait, has so far unsuccessfully tried to mediate the dispute, which Washington sees as a threat to efforts to contain Iran.
""The dispute has continued for too long and it ultimately harms our shared regional interests in stability, prosperity and security,"" Hook told reporters from Qatar after meeting with the Gulf state's foreign minister. 
""Bringing an end to this dispute really will advance the collective interests of all the parties to this conflict.""
Hook is in the Middle East to urge the extension of a United Nations arms embargo on Iran. He has visited U.N. Security Council member Tunisia and will soon travel to Kuwait, he said.
Hook said he would raise the Gulf dispute with Kuwaiti officials and hoped that the hospitalisation of its 91-year-old ruler would ""not have any negative effect on diplomatic efforts"".

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai protesters sang a Japanese cartoon jingle on Sunday with lyrics mocking the government as hungry hamsters feasting on taxpayer cash, part of a new protest movement by youth who say they are using whimsical tactics for serious ends.
Thai youths have been defying a coronavirus ban on gatherings to hold rallies almost daily since last week. The first rally, by a group called the Free Youth Movement, drew more than 2,000 activists, one of the biggest anti-government protests since a coup in 2014.
At Sunday's demonstration, protesters sang new lyrics to the theme song for ""Hamtaro"", a Japanese cartoon about a hamster who loves sunflower seeds. They ran in circles around Bangkok's Democracy Monument, like hamsters running in a wheel.
""The most delicious food is taxpayers' money,"" they sang. ""Dissolve the parliament! Dissolve the parliament! Dissolve the parliament!"" 
Leaders of the Free Youth Movement have said they will return to the streets for another large-scale demonstration next week if their demands are not met, including dissolving parliament, revising a constitution written by the military and ending the harassment of government critics.
Some of the protests have been whimsical in tone, but the protesters say their political aims are serious. 

""The adults may think because we're doing this, they can't take us seriously. But this is the way for the new generation,"" said a 20-year-old protester who gave her name as Fah. ""We are doing this differently in hope that something will change.""

KEELUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan resumed an island-hopping ocean cruise on Sunday, joining a handful of places in the world to restart voyages after the coronavirus pandemic brought the industry to a virtual standstill.
Some 900 holiday makers are adapting to new safety measures when boarding  Genting Hong Kong 's (HK:0678) Explorer Dream embarking from Taiwan's northern Keelung port. The company now offers trips of up to five days from Taiwan to its scenic outlying islands of Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu.
The cruise resumption is part of a government effort to boost a tourism industry badly hit by the pandemic. Taiwan has largely closed its borders since mid-March and advised citizens against overseas travel unless absolutely necessary.
James Sun, sales manager of the cruise line, said a sea voyage could satisfy the desire for travel of people who are not permitted to go abroad.
The ship is carrying just a third of its maximum passenger limit, and is equipped with 22 COVID-19 wards to isolate passengers if any fall ill.
The 500-strong crew underwent a 21-day health screening before coming on board. All front-line service staff are required to wear masks and gloves. Buffet service has been dropped, the onboard casino and spa are shut, and dining tables are set apart and divided by screens.
Passengers must keep social distance and have their temperatures checked before coming onboard. 
""Due to the coronavirus, we can't go abroad but I still feel like travelling, so I signed up for the island-hopping trip,"" said passenger Cai Jiaru, 22. ""I don't worry about the epidemic too much, because I think it is pretty safe in Taiwan right now."" 

Taiwan has kept the pandemic well in hand with only 11 active cases and no local transmission for more than three months due to early and effective prevention.

PiS and its coalition partners closely align themselves with the Catholic Church have previously criticised the Istanbul Convention as too liberal but not adopted any policy for a withdrawal. 
On Saturday Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who represents a smaller right-wing party within the ruling coalition, said that his ministry would submit a request to the labour and families ministry on Monday to begin the process of withdrawing from the treaty.
Ziobro said that Poland has sufficient legal tools to protect victims of domestic violence and that the treaty violates parents' rights by requiring schools to teach children about gender.
But on Sunday PiS officials took a step back. 
""Decisions have not been taken. This is not our common stance. The minister has some idea. If he submits (his proposal) we will analyse it,"" PiS spokeswoman Anita Czerwinska said.
Also the government spokesman Piotr Muller said the cabinet has not decided over the treaty.
Quitting the treaty would likely become another bone of contention between Poland and the EU, which has been critical of PiS' policies that the union said undermine democracy.
PiS has long complained about the Convention, which Poland ratified under a previous centrist government in 2015. The government says the treaty is disrespectful towards religion and requires teaching liberal social policies in schools. 
It is unclear what the final government decision might be. PiS has pulled back from some of its proposals in the past, including a project to tighten already restrictive abortion rules. 
Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric said on Sunday that Poland should not withdraw from the treaty. 
Formally, the parliament will have to adopt new legislation to withdraw from the Istanbul Convention, which will then need to be signed by the president, Andrzej Duda. 

Duda has been critical of the treaty in the past.

MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Spain is safe for tourists and Spaniards, the government insisted on Sunday after Britain abruptly imposed a two-week coronavirus quarantine on travelers returning from there, a decision that filled holidaymakers with dismay.
The Madrid government is also trying to persuade Britain to exclude the Balearic and Canary islands from the quarantine measure, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said. 
She added that the prevalence of the virus in those destinations was much lower than in the United Kingdom.
""Spain is safe, it is safe for Spaniards, it is safe for tourists,"" Gonzalez Laya told reporters.
Last year, Britons made up more than a fifth of foreign visitors to Spain, which relies on heavily on tourism revenues.
The quarantine, coming just as the Spanish tourism sector emerges from months of lockdowns and travel restrictions, upset the plans of many people either on holiday or planning to take one and caused more disruption for airlines and tour companies.
""It ruins plans for everybody,"" Emily Harrison, from Essex, as she prepared to fly back home from Madrid's Barajas airport and faced two weeks of self-isolation. ""Everyone is now panicking."" 
Foreign minister Dominic Raab called the measure a ""real-time response"" to a jump in coronavirus cases in Spain.
""We can't make apologies...we must be able to take swift, decisive action,"" he said on Sky News.
The government announced it was taking Spain off a safe-travel list late on Saturday and the move took effect just hours later, leaving travelers with no time to dodge it or plan ahead.
It also advised against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, leaving the islands out of the advice but including them in the quarantine measure.
The opposition Labour Party's health policy chief, Jonathan Ashworth, slammed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government for its ""frankly shambolic"" handling of the measure.
TUI (DE:TUIGn), Europe's biggest holiday company, said it would cancel all holidays to mainland Spain up to Aug. 9, while maintaining flights to the Balearic and Canary islands. 
'ABSOLUTE DISASTER'
Spain has seen COVID-19 cases rise in the last few weeks, prompting most regions to impose rules for masks to be worn everywhere and, in several areas including Barcelona, calls for people to stay at home.
Most new cases have been concentrated in the northeastern region of Catalonia and neighboring regions, so a lot of the criticism focused on the fact that the quarantine also applies to other areas, which have been spared the brunt of the pandemic.
""This is ridiculous. There are almost no cases here and there's a far higher chance of contracting it when I get back to Britain,"" said John Snelling, 50, from Stratford-upon-Avon, who was on holiday in Menorca. 
Britain has been the hardest hit country in Europe by the pandemic. Spain was also badly affected, with more than 290,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths. It imposed very strict lockdown measures, gradually easing them earlier in the summer. 
Norway last week reimposed a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain, while France advised people not to travel to Catalonia.
But a collapse of tourism from Britain would have far more of an impact on the economy in Spain, where tourism accounts for 12% of GDP. Britons made up the largest group by nationality of foreign visitors.
""This decision is an absolute disaster for the recovery, there's no other way to see this,"" Angel Tavares, head of European Economics at Oxford Economics consulting, said on Twitter, referring to the quarantine measure.

Antonio Perez, mayor of the Mediterranean resort of Benidorm that is hugely dependent on British tourists, said it was a ""tough blow"".

The wildfire has been raging in the municipality of Oleiros since Saturday afternoon but it has now spread to two neighbouring municipalities and has already forced the precautionary evacuation of several people.
A 21-year-old firefighter died in a road accident on Saturday evening while fighting the fire and six others were injured. 
""I would like to send a word of solidarity, encouragement and thanks to the firefighters ... for the work they do for Portugal and for all of us,"" Prime Minister Antonio Costa said in a statement. 
Luis Belo Costa, commander from the Castelo Branco district, where the affected municipalities are located, told a news conference on Sunday morning that several houses were at risk as the fire raged near isolated villages. 
""There were houses hit by the flames,"" Belo Costa said, adding it was still too early to say how long it would take to bring the fire under control. 
""People were evacuated but most have already returned to their homes.""
The fires are small compared with a massive fire that hit the region in June 2017, killing 66 people and injuring more than 250.
European Union data shows that Portugal is one of the bloc's worst-hit countries by fires every year. 
One of the root causes of its frequent wildfires is that parts of the country's interior are deserted as people have left to live in cities or abroad, and the job of clearing trees and bushes is ignored, creating a fire risk.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday the Russian Navy would be armed with hypersonic nuclear strike weapons and underwater nuclear drones, which the defence ministry said were in their final phase of testing.
Putin, who says he does not want an arms race, has often spoken of a new generation of Russian nuclear weapons that he says are unequalled and can hit almost anywhere in the world. Some Western experts have questioned how advanced they are.
The weapons, some of which have yet to be deployed, include the Poseidon underwater nuclear drone, designed to be carried by submarines, and the Tsirkon (Zircon) hypersonic cruise missile, which can be deployed on surface ships.
The combination of speed, manoeuvrability and altitude of hypersonic missiles, capable of travelling at more than five times the speed of sound, makes them difficult to track and intercept. 
Speaking in St Petersburg at an annual naval parade that showcases Russia's best ships, nuclear submarines and naval aviation, Putin said the navy's capabilities were growing and it would get 40 new vessels this year. 
He did not specify when it would receive new hypersonic weapons, but suggested that day was drawing closer.
""The widespread deployment of advanced digital technologies that have no equals in the world, including hypersonic strike systems and underwater drones, will give the fleet unique advantages and increased combat capabilities,"" Putin said.
In a separate statement released via Russian news agencies, the defence ministry said testing of the Belgorod, the first submarine capable of carrying the Poseidon drones, was underway and testing of the weapons systems was nearing completion.
""Work is being successfully completed to create modern weapons systems for the Navy,"" it was cited as saying.
Putin last year threatened to deploy hypersonic missiles on ships and submarines that could lurk outside U.S. territorial waters if the United States moved to deploy intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.

Washington has not deployed such missiles in Europe, but Moscow is worried it might.

""We have relayed information to other rescue agencies and local fishing communities and will also inform the Thai authorities ... to assist in the search,"" Zawawi said in a statement.
Police detained the person who reached shore for questioning. They did not say what happened to the boat.
Last month, 269 Rohingya were detained on arrival in Langkawi. 
At the time, the head of the MMEA said the 269 were transferred from a larger ""motherboat"" on which dozens of people were believed to have died and were thrown into the sea over a four-month voyage.
Malaysia does not recognise refugee status. Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said last month the country could not take in any more Rohingya, citing a struggling economy battered by the coronavirus pandemic.

CHENGDU, China (Reuters) - Staff of the U.S. consulate in Chengdu made final efforts to clear the premises on Sunday as security remained tight outside, ahead of a Monday closure ordered by Beijing as China-U.S. relations continue to worsen.
A mini tourist atmosphere prevailed outside the facility on a tree-lined street on a hot Sunday, as onlookers shared sidewalk space with dozens of uniformed and plainclothes police opposite the entrance.
Consulate closures in Houston and Chengdu have escalated a sharp deterioration in ties between the world's two biggest economies, which were already their worst in decades amid disputes over trade and technology, the COVID-19 pandemic, China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.
Police asked people to move on when crowds formed outside the consulate, as onlookers took photos and videos of what they expected would be the last time to see the compound in U.S. hands. The street was closed to traffic, except for consular or police vehicles let through by police.
China on Friday ordered the closure of the Chengdu consulate in the southwestern provide of Sichuan. That means an evacuation deadline of 10 a.m. (0200 GMT) on Monday, according to the editor of a state-run tabloid.
In Houston on Friday a group of men accompanied by aU.S. State Department official were seen forcing open a door atthe Chinese consulate, shortly after the U.S. closure order took effect for a facility that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called ""a hub of spying and intellectual property theft"".
A coach that had been on the Chengdu consulate premises on Saturday left on Sunday morning. It was unclear who or what was inside. Since Friday, staff have been seen coming and going, including at least one with a suitcase. Removal vans entered and left on Saturday and Sunday.
""China's response was reciprocal,"" said a 63-year-old local resident who gave only his surname, Yang. The situation ""is quite regrettable.""
On the Chengdu police account on Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), similar to Twitter, some netizens were asking the authorities to be lenient toward to a man who lit a firework outside the consulate Friday.
""I believe our country is so powerful, so it has the ability to handle it properly, and provide me with enough safety,"" said a 25-year-old finance worker surnamed Zhao when she passed by the consulate.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Dozens were arrested and many police injured in clashes around Seattle's biggest Black Lives Matter protest in weeks on Saturday, police said, with a renewed energy sparked by violent clashes between activists and federal agents in nearby Portland, Oregon. 
Police said officers used non-lethal weapons in attempts to disperse the thousands of marchers in the late afternoon after some protesters set fire to the construction site for a King County juvenile detention facility and courthouse. 
By 10 p.m.(0500 GMT), police had ""made 45 arrests in connection with today’s riot in the East Precinct,"" the Seattle Police wrote in a Twitter post. 
It said ""21 officers sustained injuries after being struck by bricks, rocks mortars/other explosives. Most officers were able to return to duty. One was treated at a hospital for a knee injury.""
Earlier the police had said they were working to secure access for the city's fire department to the blaze, which it said was started by about a dozen people who were part of a large group of demonstrators.
President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he expanded the deployment of federal police to Seattle, enraging local officials and igniting anger among protesters. 
""We saw what was happening in Portland and we wanted to make sure in our city we were standing in solidarity with other moms,"" said Lhorna Murray, who attended on behalf of the newly formed Wall of Moms Seattle, replicating a tactic from the Portland protests where mothers, dressed in yellow, form a human wall between protesters and law enforcement. 
The tactics of federal officers in Portland have drawn the ire of local leaders and Democrats in Congress, who say those officers are using excessive force and complain of overreach by the Trump administration.
U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington Brian Moran said in a statement on Friday that federal agents are stationed in Seattle to protect federal properties and the work done in those buildings. 
The Trump administration has also sent federal police to Chicago, Kansas City and Albuquerque, New Mexico, over the objections of those mayors.

Premier Daniel Andrews also told a press briefing that Victoria had reported 10 COVID-19 deaths in past 24 hours, Australia's highest ever daily number.
The state's second wave is being driven by workplace infections, including at aged-care and healthcare facilities, big distribution centres, slaughterhouses, cold-storage facilities and warehouses, Andrews said.

The Southeast Asian country was back on high alert after the government on Saturday confirmed its first community infection since April, and another case early on Sunday, both in Danang, a tourist hot spot.
Authorities gave no more details about how the two infections were contracted and did not say if they were believed to be linked.
The city's social distancing measures would come into force until further notice, the government said in a statement on its website.
Danang would stop receiving inbound tourists for 14 days, while all religious, sports and cultural events would be suspended.
Wearing masks in public places in the city is now compulsory and gatherings of more than 30 people at public places were banned, the government said. 
The detection of the two new cases, which come as Vietnam is seeking to revive its economy and resume international commercial flights, has prompted authorities to step up a crackdown on illegal immigrants.
State media said dozens of migrants from China had been detected in Danang over recent days.
Thanks to strict quarantine measures and an aggressive and widespread testing programme, Vietnam has kept its virus total to an impressively low 418 cases, with no deaths.

176,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 26, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",Malaysia faces crucial graft test as Najib’s first 1MDB verdict looms,"By Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian former prime minister Najib Razak, fighting dozens of charges over a multi-billion-dollar graft scandal at state fund 1MDB, faces his first verdict on Tuesday in a landmark case that tests the country's efforts to stamp out corruption and could have big political implications. 
Najib was voted out in a historic 2018 election amid public anger over allegations that $4.5 billion was stolen in a globe-spanning scheme from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a fund he co-founded. Prosecutors allege more than $1 billion made its way into his personal accounts. 
His party returned to power this year in an alliance led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, prompting some to question how whether the return would affect several corruption cases against Najib and his allies. 
For Najib, the verdict in the years-long saga, which has seen a spectacular fall from extreme opulence and a dominant position in Malaysian politics, marks a reckoning for the urbane, British-educated politician - potentially decades in jail or a partial vindication.
It also comes just four days after the announcement of a $3.9 billion settlement with Goldman Sachs (N:GS) in return for Malaysia dropping criminal charges against the investment bank over its role in helping 1MDB sell $6.5 billion in bonds.
Najib will first hear the verdict on seven charges he faces over receiving 42 million ringgit ($9.9 million) from former 1MDB unit SRC International in 2014. He has pleaded not guilty to criminal breach of trust, money laundering and abuse of power.
Najib testified that he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials into believing the funds were donated by the Saudi royal family and not misappropriated from SRC, as prosecutors charge. Saudi Arabia's foreign minister said in 2016 that the funds were ""a genuine donation,"" but the government has not commented on the case since.
""We believe we have adduced more than enough evidence to cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's case,"" defence lawyer Harvinderjit Singh told Reuters.
If convicted, Najib could face hefty fines and jail terms of as much as 15 to 20 years on each charge.
It is unclear if he would be sentenced immediately if found guilty. Singh said sentencing could be delayed or suspended due to the complex nature of the case. 
The verdict and Friday's settlement, seen as a boost to Muhyiddin's fledgling four-month old administration, come amid speculation the prime minister may call elections soon. Muhyiddin has a slim majority in parliament, and the opposition is gearing up for polls.
Liew Chin Tong, an opposition politician, said a guilty verdict for Najib could boost Muhyiddin's popularity. But it could also create tensions within the ruling coalition - Najib's party is the biggest component - and increase calls for a snap election, he said. 
Najib no longer leads the party but remains highly influential. 
He declined to comment on the upcoming verdict but appeared relaxed on Thursday, celebrating his 67th birthday by sharing a cake with supporters at the Kuala Lumpur courthouse where he has become a regular presence the past two years. 
Low, who faces charges in Malaysia and United States over his central role in the case, also denies wrongdoing. The offices of the prime minister and the attorney-general did not respond to requests for comment. 
CORRUPTION TEST
Muhyiddin this month said he would work to implement broad anti-corruption reforms, amid concerns raised by activists over the fate of several high-profile graft trials. 
Prosecutors last month withdrew charges against Najib ally Musa Aman, shortly after settling a $248 million 1MDB-related case involving the ex-premier's stepson Riza Aziz.
""If you continuously have high-profile cases being dropped, people can't believe that,"" said Transparency International Malaysia director Muhammad Mohan. ""The real victory will come only when there are convictions.""
The global watchdog expects Malaysia's ranking on its corruption perception index to fall this year. 
The verdict also comes as Najib enjoys a resurgence in popularity after embarking on an extensive public makeover, adopting a more personable tone to replace his image as a wealthy elite. 
He maintains an active social-media presence, hitting out at the opposition and posting light-hearted updates on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), where he has over 4 million followers, more than any other Malaysian politician.

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - A group of heavily armed Black protesters marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in March by police officers who burst into her apartment.
Scores of the demonstrators, carrying semi-automatic rifles and shotguns and clad in black paramilitary gear, walked in formation to a fenced off intersection where they were separated by police from a smaller group of armed counter-protesters. 
The Black militia dubbed NFAC want justice for Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who died in a hail of gunfire when drug investigators bearing a ""no-knock"" warrant entered her Louisville home four months ago.
One police officer involved in the raid was fired by the city's police department in June. Two other officers have been placed on administrative reassignment. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three. 
The leader of the NFAC group, John ""Grandmaster Jay"" Johnson, called on officials to speed up the investigation into her death and to be more transparent.
""If you don't tell us nothing we going to think you ain't doing nothing,"" Johnson said in a speech, according to the Louisville Courier Journal.
Taylor's death, which returned to prominence following the May 25 suffocation in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, has become a rallying cry in nationwide protests against police brutality and racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system. 
The NFAC first drew attention on July 4 when they rallied in Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta to demand the removal of the giant Confederate rock carving at the site that civil rights activists consider a monument to racism. 

In Louisville on Saturday, three members of the group were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries when a weapon was accidentally discharged, police said.

""This week we have been reminded of the threat Russia poses to our national security with the provocative test of a weapon-like projectile from a satellite threatening the peaceful use of space"", Wallace wrote in The Sunday Telegraph newspaper, adding that China also posed a threat.
""China, too, is developing offensive space weapons and both nations are upgrading their capabilities.

The agreement aimed to pave the way for formal peace talks between the insurgents and the Afghan government, and Khalilzad's task is to try and bring both sides to the table.
Khalilzad plans to press for a deal on prisoner exchanges and a reduction in violence, two issues that have hampered progress toward starting peace talks.
""Although significant progress has been made on prisoner exchanges, the issue requires additional effort to fully resolve,"" the State Department said in its statement.

LONDON/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Britain abruptly imposed a two-week quarantine on all travellers arriving from Spain after a surge of coronavirus cases, a dramatic and sudden reversal on Saturday to the opening of the European continent to tourism after months of lockdown.
The quarantine requirement takes effect from midnight (2300 GMT on Saturday), making it almost impossible for travellers to avoid it by rushing home.
The British foreign ministry also advised against all but essential travel to mainland Spain, a move likely to prompt tour operators to cancel package holidays and trigger claims against insurers.
Europe's biggest travel company TUI (DE:TUIGn) (L:TUIT) said it was cancelling all departures on Sunday to Spain from the United Kingdom, and was urgently reviewing future flights.
""We're incredibly disappointed that we didn't get more notice of this announcement, or that this decision wasn't made yesterday, as many Brits travel on holiday at the weekend,"" said TUI's UK managing director, Andrew Flintham.
EasyJet (L:EZJ) and British Airways (L:ICAG) said they did not plan to cancel flights over the coming days.
Spain's Canary and Balearic Islands are not covered by the advice to avoid travel to the mainland, but holidaymakers returning to Britain from the islands will still be subject to quarantine on return.
Britain's government urged employers to be ""understanding"" towards staff who are unable to return to work for two weeks after coming back from holiday.
Transport minister Grant Shapps himself will be subject to quarantine, after a spokesman confirmed that he is currently on holiday in Spain.
The British move followed steps this week by other European countries. On Friday Norway said it would re-impose a 10-day quarantine requirement for people arriving from Spain, while France advised people not to travel to Spain's northeastern region of Catalonia.
But the total collapse of tourism from Britain would have far more impact. Britons made up more than 20% of foreign visitors to Spain last year, the largest group by nationality. Tourism normally accounts for 12% of Spain's economy.
Spain had been on a list of countries that the British government had said were safe for travellers to visit - meaning tourists returning home would not have to go into quarantine. 
The announcement of such lists just weeks ago had allowed Europe's tourism sector to begin to revive after the near total shut-down prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Responding to the British measures, Spain said on Saturday it was a safe country with localised, isolated and controlled outbreaks of the coronavirus.
A Spanish Foreign Ministry spokeswoman said Spain ""respects decisions of the United Kingdom"" and was in touch with the authorities there.
The British move will affect not just Spain's tourism sector but airlines and travel companies struggling to get back to business.
Britain's opposition Labour Party said the news was ""deeply concerning"" and called for support for British people affected.
A 'SAFE' COUNTRY
Antonio Perez, the mayor of Benidorm, a resort on Spain's Costa Blanca that is hugely dependent on British tourists, called the move ""another tough blow"".
""We have suffered a lot this year and then this happened. We thought that the British were going to come back but this makes things harder for now,"" he said. 
Spain was one of the worst hit countries in Europe by the pandemic, with more than 290,000 cases and over 28,000 deaths. It imposed very strict lockdown measures to contain the spread, gradually easing them earlier this summer.
But the last few weeks saw a surge of cases, forcing local lockdowns to be reimposed in some areas.
On Friday Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told CNN that like many countries around the world that have managed to control the disease, Spain ""has outbreaks but the governments -- both national and regional -- are working to isolate cases as soon as they appear"".
The Catalonia region reported 1,493 new coronavirus cases and three deaths on Saturday. The regional government has urged residents of Barcelona to stay at home, and ordered all discos to shut from Saturday for the next 15 days.

Britain itself has been the worst hit country in Europe by the pandemic, with more than 328,000 cases and an official death toll of more than 45,600.

Magistrates are investigating Attilio Fontana, 68, a member of the right-wing League party, over a 250,000 euro payment to the company, in which Fontana's wife has a 10% stake, Fontana's lawyer Jacopo Pensa confirmed on Saturday.
Pensa told reporters Fontana denied wrongdoing.
The Lombardy region had ordered 75,000 surgical gowns and 7,000 sanitising kits from the company in a contract worth about 500,000 in April. The company later decided to donate a first batch of 50,000 gowns instead of taking money for them.
Fontana then ordered a bank transfer of 250,000 euros from his own private account in Switzerland to his brother-in-law. The payment was blocked by one of the banks, which notified financial police.
Pensa said Fontana wanted to compensate his brother-in-law for the loss of profit he suffered by converting the purchase into a donation.
League leader Matteo Salvini, a former interior minister, defended Fontana, saying the magistrates were politically motivated. Opposition parties called on Fontana to resign.

About half of Italy's 35,000 deaths due to the coronavirus have been in Lombardy, Italy's northern industrial and financial heartland.

Hanna was about 75 miles (120 km) east-northeast of Port Mansfield, Texas, packing maximum sustained winds of 80 miles per hour, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Saturday morning.
""Additional strengthening is forecast before Hanna makes landfall later today,"" the Miami-based forecaster said, adding that the hurricane will rapidly weaken after it moves inland. 
Video footage on Twitter of Port Aransas in Nueces County, Texas showed gray skies and lashing waves that had already engulfed a beach ahead of the storm's landfall.
The storm was projected to hit the coast between Corpus Christi and Brownsville, a region that has struggled to contain outbreaks of COVID-19 in recent weeks. Cases along the state's coast have soared into the tens of thousands, and more than 400 people in Corpus Christi's city of 325,000 were hospitalized with the novel coronavirus on Friday, according to city data. 
On Friday, residents in several Texas communities in Kleberg County, south of Corpus Christi, were urged to evacuate their homes ahead of Hanna's arrival. 
Corpus Christi Mayor Joe McComb warned residents who live in flood-prone areas to heed coronavirus precautions when deciding to evacuate, the Texas Tribune reported. 
""Take several masks with you because you might be there a couple days if you're in a flood area,"" McComb said, according to the Tribune. ""We don't want to expose anyone during this storm. ... Even when you're in the house, I recommend wearing a mask if you're in crowded conditions.""
Hanna will be the second named storm this season to make landfall along the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, after Tropical Storm Cristobal, which hit Louisiana in early June. Hanna could bring a life-threatening storm surge and flash flooding, with up to 15 inches of rain in pockets of southern Texas and northeastern Mexico.

The storm is not expected to affect offshore oil and gas production. Energy companies have not evacuated workers or shut down production from their Gulf of Mexico platforms because of Hanna.

""The government failed in its promise on the preparation of a clear plan for the one man, one vote election,"" said Mohamed Mursal Sheikh Abdirahman, the speaker of parliament, referring to the first direct election since civil war erupted in 1991.
The Horn-of-Africa country has been holding elections through representatives like elders in the past decade, due to insecurity caused by al Shabaab militants in most areas. 
Mohamed Abukar Islow, the internal security minister and a key ally of Khaire, accused the speaker and the president of plotting to remove the prime minister to extend their terms.
""It is a dark day,"" Islow said, terming the move unconstitutional due to the requirement that an election be held every four years. Khaire, a former oil company executive, was not immediately available for a comment.
The president pledged to hold ""a satisfactory election"" within the schedule, but the Forum of National Parties, a leading opposition grouping, was sceptical.
""The president is breeding political chaos that will be difficult to manage... We warn against any attempt aimed at term extension,"" the group said.
Rashid Abdi, an independent Horn of Africa analyst, said Khaire's removal was inevitable because of differences with the president and the prime minister's ambition to be president one day.

""What was surprising was the swiftness with which it was done. There was no debate or negotiations,"" Abdi told Reuters.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Deposed former Central African Republic President Francois Bozize announced on Saturday his candidacy for the December presidential vote despite being under U.N. sanctions and subject to an arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity.
He made the expected announcement in a speech to a large crowd of supporters at a congress of his party Kwa na Kwa (Work, Nothing But Work) in the capital Bangui. 
The 73-year-old former general and army chief was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war and an acute and ongoing humanitarian crisis.
""The country needs a man of experience, peace and conviction,"" Bozize said in the speech that criticised the tenure of current president, Faustin-Archange Touadera.
Bozize first took power after a 2003 coup and served 10 years as president, before fleeing the country in 2013. The new administration sought his arrest for alleged crimes against humanity and incitement to genocide, but has not moved to detain him since he returned from exile late last year.
It is not clear how the warrant or foreign sanctions will affect his candidacy. In January, Bozize said he would ask the United Nations to lift the sanctions imposed in 2014 over his alleged support for 'anti-balaka' Christian militias.
Touadera, who was elected in 2016, is expected to seek a second term in the election but has not yet confirmed he will run. The first round of the race is scheduled for December 27. 

Most of the diamond-rich country remains beyond government control as rival militias continue to clash. The violence has forced more than 1.5 million people to flee their homes.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai LGBT activists and allies raised rainbow flags on Saturday evening as they called for democracy and equal rights, the latest in a series of youth protests calling for the government to step down. 
Several youth-led demonstrations have sprung up across the country since last week, when thousands of Thai activists defied a coronavirus ban on gatherings and staged one of the largest street rallies since a 2014 military coup.
The activists on Saturday danced and sang and performed stand-up comedy sketches making jabs at the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who ousted an elected government six years ago. Pride flags were waved against the backdrop of Bangkok's Democracy Monument. 
""We're here today mainly to call for democracy. Once we achieve democracy, equal rights will follow,"" said a 21-year-old activist who went by a made-up name, Viktorious Nighttime. 
""The LGBT group do not yet have equal rights in society, so we're calling for both democracy and equality,"" added Viktorious, who was wearing a glittery tiara and a face mask. 
The calls came after Thailand's cabinet backed a civil partnership bill earlier this month that would recognise same-sex unions with almost the same rights as married couples.
Saturday's gathering was the latest in a series of protests under the Free Youth movement, which has issued three demands: the dissolution of parliament, an end to harassment of government critics, and amendments to the military-written constitution. 

""Even if they don't step down from power today, we want to let them know that we won't go anywhere, we will be here,"" said a 21-year-old protestor who gave her name as Yaya. ""Even if they get rid of us, our ideology will never die, we will pass this on to the next generation.""

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish soldiers have been sent to build a camp for migrant strawberry pickers after a U.N. official criticised authorities for allowing seasonal farm workers to live in ""inhumane"" conditions, the government said on Saturday.
The U.N. special rapporteur on extreme poverty and rights, Olivier De Schutter, said in a statement on Friday that urgent action was needed to improve ""deplorable conditions"" in worker settlements before people died.
Three fires broke out in migrant shanty towns near the southwestern town of Huelva last week, injuring four people, and health officials have warned that the cramped settlements put workers at risk of catching the coronavirus.
Following appeals for help from local officials, a defence ministry spokeswoman said the troops were deployed on Saturday to look for a suitable location to build a camp to house the workers, most of whom are Moroccan.
""An army logistics team has been sent to try to help prevent possible coronavirus outbreaks in settlements which are in precarious conditions after fires,"" she said. 
Often dirty and dangerous, and lacking water, sanitation and electricity, such camps have been used as accommodation for Spain's seasonal fruit-pickers for years.
De Schutter said COVID-19 had worsened the situation.
""This reality of fires and inhumane conditions in the shanty towns cannot be tolerated any longer.
""The situation is deteriorating alarmingly each day, made worse amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"" his statement said.
On Thursday, the Health Ministry acknowledged that fruit-pickers were especially vulnerable to catching coronavirus due to overcrowded and insanitary living and working conditions. 
Spain is one of the European countries hardest-hit by the pandemic with more than 28,400 fatalities.
Since ending a three-month lockdown in June it has registered 281 new isolated outbreaks, over a quarter of which began in workplace environments.

Authorities in Catalonia imposed two localised lockdowns in Segria and Lleida after a spike in coronavirus cases linked to migrant fruit workers living in precarious conditions.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian security forces arrested leading members of the opposition-run teachers union on Saturday, raided its offices and shut it down for two years, escalating a confrontation with a group that has become a leading source of dissent.
Prosecutors charged Nasser Nawasreh, the acting head of the Jordanian Teachers Syndicate, with incitement over a speech to supporters last Wednesday that criticised Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz's government. State media said other charges related to allegations of financial and administrative wrongdoing. 
Riot police reinforcements were deployed on Saturday near the seat of government in the capital and in other areas where teacher activists were planning protests. Security forces raided the union's headquarters in the city of Karak.
Political opposition is often marginalized in Jordan, but protests have grown in recent years over eroding living standards, corruption and slow pace of political reforms.
Saturday's crackdown on the union would ""only further aggravate political tensions by the government at a time people are choked under hard economic conditions,"" said Murad Adailah, head of Islamic Action Front, the largest opposition party.
The 100,000-strong union went on strike last year, shutting down schools across Jordan for a month in one of the longest and most disruptive public sector strikes in the country's history. In recent weeks its leadership has accused the government of failing to honour a deal signed last October that ended the strike.
The deal included a 50% pay rise this year, which the government now says is unaffordable because of the economic blow from the coronavirus crisis.
Some officials have also accused union leaders of harbouring the Islamist opposition’s political agenda. The union says this accusation is part of a government smear campaign.
Opposition politicians say the government has been using draconian emergency laws enacted last March at the start of the coronavirus lockdown to limit civil and political rights. Activists have been arrested in recent weeks over comments on social media.

Jean Castex, appointed by President Emmanuel Macron in a government reshuffle earlier this month, announced the measures during a visit to Nice, where heavy gunfire was reported earlier this week, though no one was injured.
The new penalties will allow police to ""apply a sanction without delay"" and help in the struggle against drug dealing, said Castex, who also announced police reinforcements for the Riviera city.
The Nice shooting followed clashes in the eastern city of Dijon last month between rival groups and the killing of a bus driver in the southwestern city of Bayonne.
Social tension has increased during coronavirus confinement, when some police forces refrained from heavy-handed lockdown enforcement in areas with difficult community relations.
Police morale has also been sapped by understaffing, accusations of racism fanned by Black Lives Matter protests and by the slow pace of French judicial proceedings that can hamper efforts to tackle known delinquents.

The nationwide shift to on-the-spot penalties, following local pilots, will target low-level dealers and users of cannabis and other drugs as part of a broader law enforcement struggle against urban gangs and petty crime.

Attackers on horseback and camels opened fire on villagers in the Um Doss area, which is located around 90 kilometres (56 miles) from the state capital Nyala, said a local leader who gave his name as Nimr.
""Militias attacked us and took over our land years ago... and now they want to kick us out of our homes and farms once again. Where is the government and why has it not come to protect us?"" one witness said.
The incident follows recent violence by militias in North Darfur which prompted authorities to declare a state of emergency on July 13.
Conflict started in Darfur in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against the Khartoum government. Government forces and mainly Arab militia, which moved to repress the revolt, were accused of widespread atrocities. Some 300,000 people were killed in the conflict, according to U.N. estimates.
Omar al-Bashir, Sudan's ousted leader, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in the troubled Darfur region.
Civilian state governors were appointed this week for the first time since Bashir was toppled, a key demand of protesters hoping for more stability.

Zbigniew Ziobro told a news conference his ministry would submit a request to the labour and families ministry on Monday to begin the process of withdrawing from the treaty, known as the Istanbul Convention.
""It contains elements of an ideological nature, which we consider harmful,"" Ziobro said.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party and its coalition partners closely align themselves with the Catholic Church and promote a conservative social agenda. Hostility to gay rights was one of the main issues promoted by President Andrej Duda during a successful re-election campaign this month.
On Friday, thousands of people, mostly women, protested in Warsaw and other cities against proposals to reject the treaty. 
""The aim is to legalise domestic violence,"" Magdalena Lempart, one of the protest organisers said on Friday at a march in Warsaw. Some protesters carried banners saying ""PiS is the women's hell"".
PiS has long complained about the Istanbul Convention, which Poland ratified under a previous centrist government in 2015. The government says the treaty is disrespectful towards religion and requires teaching liberal social policies in schools, although in the past it has stopped short of a decision to quit.
Ziobro, the justice minister, represents a smaller right-wing party within the ruling coalition. A government spokesman was not available on Saturday for comment on whether Ziobro's announcement of plans to quit the treaty represented a collective cabinet decision.

The World Health Organization says domestic violence has surged this year in Europe during months of lockdown aimed at fighting the coronavirus.

The July 3 documentary on Malaysia's treatment of undocumented foreign workers during the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a backlash in the Southeast Asia nation, and an arrest warrant was issued for Mohammad Rayhan Kabir, the Bangladeshi worker quoted in the report.
Rights groups have accused the government of suppressing media freedom after Al Jazeera journalists were called in for questioning by the police.
Malaysia's immigration department said Rayhan had been arrested on Friday and would be expelled from the country. 
""This Bangladeshi national will be deported and blacklisted from entering Malaysia forever,"" Immigration Director General Khairul Dzaimee Daud said on Saturday. 
He did not say why Rayhan was arrested or whether he was suspected of committing a crime. His department did not respond to further queries from Reuters. 
Qatar-based Al Jazeera said it was disturbing that Rayhan had been arrested ""for choosing to speak up about some of the experiences of the voiceless and the vulnerable.""
Malaysia arrested hundreds of undocumented foreigners, including children and Rohingya refugees, when the country was under lockdown to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
Human rights activists have condemned the arrests as inhumane. Malaysian officials have said they were necessary to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Public opposition to migrant workers has been growing, with some accusing them of spreading the coronavirus and being a burden on government resources.
Activists have voiced concern that the four-month old administration of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is stifling dissent amid a series of clampdowns, an accusation it has denied.
Al Jazeera has said its staff and those interviewed in the documentary had faced abuse, death threats and the disclosure of their personal details on social media.

CHENGDU, China (Reuters) - Security was tight outside the U.S. consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday as staff inside prepared to leave, a day after China ordered it to close in response to a U.S. order for China to shut its consulate in Houston.
The tit-for-tat consulate closures have brought a sharp deterioration in relations between the countries, which have the world's two largest economies. 
Shortly after the Houston closure order took effect on Friday, a group of men who appeared to be U.S. officials were seen forcing open a back door to the facility.
China's ministry of foreign affairs said on Saturday that violated international and bilateral agreements and China would respond, without elaborating how. 
In Chengdu, a U.S. consulate emblem inside the compound was taken down and staff could be seen moving about. Three removal vans later entered the compound.
Police gathered outside and closed off the street to traffic in the southwestern Chinese city. 
A steady stream of people walked along the street opposite the entrance throughout the day, many stopping to take photos or videos before police moved them on.
Plain clothes officers detained a man who tried to hold up a sign. It was not clear what the sign said.
Neither the consulate nor the U.S. embassy in Beijing have responded to requests from Reuters for comment on the closure. 
MIXED FEELINGS IN CHENGDU
The order to close came after the Trump administration had given China until 4 p.m. on Friday to vacate its Houston consulate.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the consulate had been ""a hub of spying and intellectual property theft"".
The U.S. consulate in Chengdu was also given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. on Monday, the editor of China's Global Times tabloid said on Twitter.
The consulate opened in 1985 and has almost 200 employees, including about 150 locally hired staff, according to its website. It was not immediately clear how many are there now after U.S. diplomats were evacuated from China because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Residents in Chengdu expressed mixed views on the closure of the U.S. consulate there.
""What I fear the most is the U.S. won't just stop there, it might get uglier,"" said 19-year-old university student Zhang Chuhan.
""I approve. The U.S. closed our consulate, I think we should shut theirs too,"" said a man who identified himself as Jiang, 29.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated this year to what experts describe as their lowest level in decades over issues ranging from trade and technology to the coronavirus pandemic, China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.

China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin has said some personnel at the Chengdu consulate were ""conducting activities not in line with their identities"" and had interfered in China's affairs and harmed its security interests. He did not say how.

Iranian media said on Friday that several passengers on the Mahan Air flight heading from Tehran to Beirut were injured on Thursday after the pilot rapidly changed altitude to avoid collision with the U.S. jet.
The U.S. military said its F-15 was at a safe distance and the fighter was conducting a visual inspection of the airliner as it passed near the Tanf garrison in Syria, home to U.S. forces.
“All passengers on Mahan Air Flight 1152, Iranians and non-Iranian, can sue the terrorist U.S. military - commanders, perpetrators, supervisors and deputies - in Iranian courts for moral and physical damages,” Ali Bagheri-Kani, head of the judiciary's human rights office was quoted as saying by the semi-official ILNA news agency. 
He said complainants could also take an international legal route through the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N agency that oversees international civil aviation agreements.
He said Iranian courts follow laws that deal with human rights violations and “adventurist and terrorist acts of the United States in the region.” 
It was not clear if any passenger would sue the U.S. military.
Iran said on Friday it had lodged a complaint with the ICAO.
The incident was the latest in tensions between Tehran and Washington since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States in 2018 from Iran’s nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have battered Iran’s economy. 
Footage of the inside of the airliner broadcast by Iranian state TV on Friday showed a passenger lying immobile on the floor and another with a wounded nose and forehead.

Greek criticism of the move to convert the site from a museum has been scathing, underlining tense ties between Greece and Turkey. Church bells tolled in mourning across Greece on Friday as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan joined prayers at the building.
""Greece showed once again its enmity towards Islam and Turkey with the excuse of reacting to Hagia Sophia Mosque being opened to prayers,"" Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a written statement on Saturday.
The ministry strongly condemned hostile statements by the Greek government and parliament members to stir up the public, and the burning of a Turkish flag in the Greek city of Thessaloniki, it said.
Hagia Sophia was opened to prayer as a mosque in line with the will of the Turkish people and belonged to Turkey like all cultural assets in the country, it added.
The Greek Foreign Ministry responded with its own statement, saying ""the international community of the 21st century is stunned to observe the religious and nationalist fanatic ramblings of today's Turkey."" 
Friday's ceremony sealed Erdogan's ambition to restore Muslim worship at the site, which most Greeks view as central to their Orthodox Christian religion.
On Friday, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called Turkey a ""troublemaker"", and the conversion of the site an ""affront to civilisation of the 21st century"".

Greece and Turkey disagree on a range of issues from airspace to maritime zones and ethnically split Cyprus. This week they also exchanged barbs over the delimitation of their continental shelves in the eastern Mediterranean, an area thought to be rich in natural resources.

Residents of Khabarovsk, around 3,800 miles (6,110 km) and seven time zones east of Moscow, are unhappy about the July 9 detention of the wider region's popular regional governor, Sergei Furgal, who was arrested on murder charges he denies. 
His detention, which his supporters say was politically motivated, has triggered more than two weeks of street protests, creating a headache for the Kremlin which is trying to troubleshoot a sharp COVID-19-induced drop in real incomes and keep a lid on unrest as the economy stutters.
Footage of the protest showed people chanting ""Disgrace!"" and slogans demanding Putin resign because local people had lost trust in him.
City authorities estimated around 6,500 people had taken part. Local media put the number at up to 20,000 people. 
The protests have highlighted anger among some in the far east over what they see as policies emanating from detached Moscow-based authorities on the other side of the country.
Supporters of Furgal, the arrested governor and a member of the nationalist LDPR party, feel he is being belatedly punished for defeating a candidate from the ruling pro-Putin United Russia party in 2018. The Kremlin says Furgal has serious charges to answer. 
Such sustained demonstrations are unusual for Russia's regions, as is the fact that the authorities have not yet moved to break them up.

In an apparent move to defuse tensions, Putin on Monday named a new acting governor to head the region. But protesters said they felt insulted by the choice of Mikhail Degtyaryov, who has no connection with the region, and have called on him to step down too.

The United States this month rejected China's claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea, drawing criticism from China which said the U.S. position raised tension in the region.
Australia, in a declaration filed at the United Nations in New York on Friday, said it too rejected China’s maritime claims around contested islands in the South China Sea as being inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.
""Australia rejects China's claim to 'historic rights' or 'maritime rights and interests' as established in the 'long course of historical practice' in the South China Sea,"" it said.
Australia also said it did not accept China's assertion that its sovereignty over the Paracel Islands and the Spratly Islands was ""widely recognised by the international community"", citing objections from Vietnam and the Philippines.
China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich waters but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it.
About $3 trillion worth of trade passes through the waterway each year. China has built bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful.
Australia has long advocated for freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and for all claimants to resolve their differences in compliance with international laws.
Its more outspoken position on China's claims comes after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this month China had offered no coherent legal basis for its ambitions in the South China Sea and for years has been using intimidation against other coastal states.
The world would not allow China to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire, Pompeo said, adding that the United States would support countries that believed China has violated their maritime claims. 
The United States has long opposed China’s expansive territorial claims on the South China Sea, sending warships regularly through the strategic waterway to demonstrate freedom of navigation.
Australia's declaration on China's claims comes as its foreign and defence ministers prepare to travel to Washington to attend a bilateral forum on July 28, the government said.
Diplomatic tension between China and Australia has worsened recently over various issues including an Australian call for an international enquiry into the novel coronavirus, which emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

BEIJING/HOUSTON (Reuters) - China on Friday ordered the United States to close its consulate in Chengdu in response to a U.S. order for China to shut its Houston consulate, where staff packed up belongings watched by jeering protesters amid a sharp deterioration in relations between the world's two largest economies.
The order to close the consulate in Chengdu, a city in southwestern China, continued Beijing's recent practice of like-for-like responses to Washington's actions.
Beijing had threatened retaliation after the Trump administration gave it 72 hours - until 4 p.m. on Friday - to vacate its consulate in the Texas city, and had urged Washington to reconsider.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday the consulate had been ""a hub of spying and intellectual property theft"" and Washington and its allies must use ""more creative and assertive ways"" to press the Chinese Communist Party to change its ways.
Shortly after a U.S. closure order for the mission took effect at 4 p.m., a group of men who appeared to be American officials were seen forcing open a back door of the Houston consulate.
The men did not respond when asked who they were by reporters. Earlier, the same group of men was seen padlocking a door on another side of the building. 
After the men went inside, two uniformed members of the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security arrived to guard the door. They also did not respond to questions.
A Reuters witness saw consulate staff exiting the building shortly after 4 p.m. and leaving in vehicles before the back door was forced open.
The Chinese embassy and the U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on this activity.
Senior U.S. officials said earlier that activity by China's diplomatic missions was occurring all over the country, but that out of the Houston consulate went well beyond what was acceptable.
A senior State Department official also linked espionage activity from that consulate to China's pursuit of research into a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
About 100 Chinese activists gathered at the consulate on Friday, shouting slogans denouncing communism and heckling staff. 
Some held American flags as they watched workers loading belongings from the five-story building into trucks.
Protesters cheered when a tractor trailer circled the building with giant signs that read: ""Freedom from Communism,"" and ""God Bless America.""
Relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated this year to what experts say is their lowest level in decades over issues ranging from trade and technology to the coronavirus pandemic, China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.
China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said some personnel at the Chendu consulate were ""conducting activities not in line with their identities,"" had interfered in China's affairs and harmed its security interests. He did not say how.
Senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi, who is also foreign minister, blamed Washington for the deterioration in ties.
""The current difficult situation in Sino-U.S. relations is entirely caused by the United States, and its goal is trying to interrupt China's development,"" Wang said in a video conversation with his German counterpart.
CHINESE RESEARCHER IN U.S. CUSTODY
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration said the closing of the Houston consulate was aimed at protecting American intellectual property and personal information.
""We urge the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) to cease these malign actions rather than engage in tit-for-tat retaliation,"" said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the White House National Security Council.
In a related case, a senior U.S. Justice Department official said a Chinese researcher who took refuge at China's consulate in San Francisco was taken into American custody on Thursday.
He said Juan Tang was part of a network of associates who concealed their military affiliation when applying for visas. 
The U.S. consulate in Chengdu was given 72 hours to close, or until 10 a.m. on Monday, the editor of China's Global Times tabloid said on Twitter.
The consulate opened in 1985 and has almost 200 employees, including about 150 locally hired staff, according to its website. It was not immediately clear how many are there now after U.S. diplomats were evacuated from China because of the pandemic.
Global share markets fell after the announcement, led by a heavy drop in Chinese blue chips, which fell 4.4%, while the yuan hit a two-week low. [MKTS/GLOB]
Wall Street retreated, heading into the weekend with a broad sell-off due to weak earnings, surging coronavirus cases and concerns about U.S.-China ties. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI ended down 182.44 points, or 0.68%, at 26,469.89. 
A source had told Reuters China was considering shutting the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, where Washington withdrew staff as the coronavirus outbreak raged. 
""The Chengdu consulate is more important than the Wuhan consulate because that is where the U.S. gathers information about Tibet and China's development of strategic weapons in neighboring regions,"" said Wu Xinbo, an American studies expert at Shanghai's Fudan University.
Chengdu was less important though for economic activity than U.S. consulates in Shanghai, Guangzhou and Hong Kong.
Jonathan Pollack of the Brookings Institution think tank said Chengdu was the only U.S. consulate deep in China's interior and closing it would also affect Washington's ability to monitor the Sino-Indian border and other sensitive locations, including Xinjiang.
However, he noted that China's foreign ministry had avoided the sort of ""trash talking"" of some recent U.S. statements.

""The real question now is whether the events of the past few days are a one off, or a precursor of other steps the U.S. or China might undertake that would entail even larger dangers and risks in U.S.-China relations,"" he said.

DENVER (Reuters) - A Colorado transgender teenager who admitted to taking part in a shooting at a Denver-area charter school last year that left one student dead and eight others wounded was sentenced on Friday to life in prison plus an additional 38 years.
Alec McKinney, 17, was sentenced in Douglas County District Court for the shooting at the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, on May 7, 2019. 
A 19-year-old co-defendant in the shooting, Devon Erickson, has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges and faces trial in September. 
In February, McKinney pleaded guilty to murder, attempted murder, conspiracy and related charges. As a juvenile offender, McKinney is eligible for parole after 40 years under Colorado law.
Before sentencing, a sobbing McKinney apologized to the victims and said he took responsibility for the pain he caused.
""I don’t want a lighter sentence,"" McKinney said.
An 18-year-old student, Kendrick Castillo, was killed when he charged one of the shooters, police said. Eight of his classmates were wounded, one from a bullet fired by a security guard.
During the emotional sentencing hearing, Castillo’s father, John Castillo, called McKinney a coward and said he shed only ""crocodile tears.""
""These are real tears,” Castillo said, his voice choked with emotion. “I condemn you to hell.”
McKinney, born female, has admitted plotting the school shooting as revenge on classmates over bullying, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.
McKinney and Erickson consumed cocaine and stole three handguns and a rifle belonging to Erickson’s parents before storming the school, police said.

Erickson, who prosecutors said shot Castillo, faces a mandatory life sentence without the possibility of parole if convicted of first-degree murder as he was an adult at the time of the crime.

The book, entitled 'Finding Freedom', is due to be published in August and is expected to shed light on the couple's frustrations with the palace and press, local media reported on Saturday.
""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to 'Finding Freedom',"" a spokesperson for the couple said in a statement. 
""This book is based on the authors' own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting"", the statement added.
The book, authored by royal reporters Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie, is expected to detail how the couple felt the royal institution had failed to support them, according to The Telegraph newspaper.
The Times newspaper cited extracts from the book suggesting infighting among family members, with Harry believing Meghan was not liked by some of his relatives and others feeling that the popularity of the couple had to be ""reined in"".
The newspaper said Meghan described tabloid criticism as ""death by a thousand cuts"". 
According to The Telegraph, the book presents Harry and Meghan as disruptive forces with the ability to modernise the monarchy, only for them to be discouraged by the ""grey suits"" and hostile media coverage of their private life. 
The couple and their 14-month-old son, Archie, now live in Los Angeles after they stepped down from their royal roles in March to forge new careers. In January, they announced plans to lead a more independent life and to finance it themselves.

Harry and Meghan, a former actress, married in May 2018 in a wedding which was heralded at the time as infusing a blast of Hollywood glamour and modernity into the monarchy, and made them one of the world's biggest celebrity couples.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Friday signed into law a plan to allow citizens to withdraw 10% of their pensions savings as people queued at the administrator's offices in Santiago eager for relief from the economic effects of the coronavirus. 
The law, approved by two-thirds of legislators on Thursday, was created to give quick cash to millions of Chileans who lost jobs because of the economic shutdown aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.
The Office of the President said Pinera had signed the bill late on Friday but made no comment on its content. 
Pinera`s centre-right government had opposed the emergency relief measure, saying it would support citizens through the public purse instead. It has also warned about the longer-term impact on the profitability and already low average payouts of pensions. 
Despite those pleas, queues formed on Friday outside the offices of Pension Fund Administrators (AFP), with opinion polls indicating nearly nine out of every 10 Chilean planned to tap their funds. Most said they would use the money to pay for basic goods and services, but others said they planned to invest the money elsewhere.
Economists say that Chile's battered economy could get a short-term boost, with a total estimated $16.65 billion potentially being unleashed for consumption, according to think tank Ciedess.
However they also warn of the negative impact on the pensions funds, which hold assets of more than $200 billion, which may liquidate local stocks and bond holdings to pay out to savers.
As of December 2019, the AFPs had just over half of their investments in Chile, including 33% in Treasury bonds. 
Chile's Congress is weighing a quantitative easing bill that would allow the Central Bank to buy Treasury bonds on the secondary market, potentially cushioning any funds sell-off. 

In Peru, where congress approved a plan to let citizens draw down 25% of their pensions, fewer people than anticipated took advantage of the measure, and the impact on its economy was cauterized by the funds liquidating largely foreign assets, analysts say.

""A number of targets were struck, including SAF observation posts and intelligence collection systems located in SAF bases,"" the military said in a statement, referring to the Syrian Armed Forces.
Syria's state news agency SANA quoted a military source as saying Israeli helicopters targeted three outposts in Syria's southern Quneitra area with anti-tank guided missiles, causing two injuries and some forest fires. 
The strike came a few hours after the Israeli military said blasts were heard from the Syrian-held area of the Golan Heights. No casualties were reported but a building and an Israeli vehicle were damaged, it said.
Tension rose this week along the Israel-Syria frontier after a fighter of the Iranian-backed Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah was killed in an apparent Israeli strike on the edge of Damascus on Monday. 
The Israeli military said it has since boosted its forces on its northern front, where Israel borders Lebanon and Syria. 
Following the killing of two Hezbollah members in Damascus last August, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader, vowed it would respond if Israel killed any more of its fighters in the country.
Hezbollah has deployed fighters in Syria as part of Iranian-backed efforts to support President Bashar al-Assad in a conflict that spiralled out of protests against his rule in 2011.
Israel sees the presence of Hezbollah and its ally Iran in Syria as a strategic threat and has mounted hundreds of raids on Iranian-linked targets there. It captured the Golan Heights from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.

The visit comes almost a year after the end of an attempt by Oslo to mediate between Venezuela's bitterly divided government and opposition. 
In a statement, the opposition said Norway had informed it that the representatives would arrive ""in the coming hours"" and would observe the country's ""political and humanitarian"" situation. 
Norway's foreign ministry last year facilitated several rounds of dialogue between Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro and the opposition, led by National Assembly speaker Juan Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela's rightful leader by the United States and dozens of other countries. 
The opposition declared those talks dead in September, stating that Maduro - a socialist who is accused of rigging his 2018 re-election vote and has overseen a six-year economic crisis - was unwilling to seriously negotiate for a new election. 
In its Friday statement, the opposition said it reiterated to the Norwegian representatives that the dialogue process ended last year. 
""There is not any dialogue process underway at this moment, and we reiterated to the Norweigian delegation that only free and fair elections can solve this crisis.
Neither Norway's foreign ministry nor Venezuela's information ministry immediately responded to requests for comment. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.
The visit comes ahead of an expected Dec. 6 parliamentary election, which the opposition has warned that Maduro is trying to rig. The government-friendly Supreme Court has ousted the leaders of prominent opposition parties, and replaced them with politicians seen as shadow allies of the ruling socialists.
Earlier this year, allies of Maduro and Guaido secretly began exploratory talks about as concerns grew about the spread of the coronavirus in Venezuela.

(Reuters) - President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen left prison on Friday to finish his criminal sentence at home, an attorney for Cohen said, a day after a judge found he was sent back behind bars two weeks ago as retaliation for plans to publish a book about Trump.
Cohen was picked up at a prison in Otisville, New York, about 70 miles (110 km) northwest of New York City, about 1 p.m. by his son and his brother, the attorney, Jeffrey K. Levine, said. Cohen was expected to be fitted for an ankle monitor and then be driven to his Manhattan apartment. 
He had been returned to prison on July 9 after being furloughed in May because of concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein on Thursday ordered Cohen released by 2 p.m. EDT Friday.
“He looked exhausted, as one might think, when you come out of quarantine/solitary confinement,"" said Levine, who saw Cohen over FaceTime from the car. ""He hasn't slept in two weeks.""
On July 9, Cohen and Levine met with probation officials to convert his furlough to a home confinement for the final two years of his three-year sentence. After Cohen questioned a provision that barred him from publishing the book, engaging with news organizations and posting on social media, officials shackled him and returned him to prison.
Hellerstein said in Thursday's court hearing that he had never seen such a gag provision in his 21 years on the bench.
""It's retaliatory because of his desire to exercise his First Amendment rights to publish a book,"" Hellerstein said.
Cohen may file a lawsuit seeking compensation for his unlawful imprisonment and violation of his First Amendment rights, Levine said.
""The lawsuit will get deeper into how this happened and who ultimately was responsible,"" Levine said.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons, in a statement after the judge's ruling, said that the book played no role in the decision to return Cohen to prison. The bureau did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Cohen's departure from prison.
Cohen, who once said he would “take a bullet” for Trump, was sentenced in 2018 for crimes that included campaign finance violations for directing hush payments to pornographic film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal, who said they had affairs with Trump before he became president.
Trump has denied having the encounters and has called Cohen a ""rat.""
In court papers, Cohen said the book will contain his experiences and observations from the decade he worked for Trump, including both before and after he became president. Cohen said it would provide ""unflattering details"" of Trump's behavior.

While he turned on Cohen, Trump has voiced support for people who remained loyal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-justice/justice-department-appears-to-be-rewarding-trump-allies-punishing-enemies-legal-experts-say-idUSKCN24M2NT to him.

Carnival, a traditional multi-day holiday known for its colorful parades and raucous revelry, takes places in hundreds of cities throughout Latin America's largest nation. 
While the celebrations, originally scheduled for February, are more traditionally associated with Rio de Janeiro and cities in the country's northeast, Sao Paulo's Carnival has grown significantly in recent years.
In a Friday news conference, Sao Paulo Mayor Bruno Covas said possible revised dates included late May and July. June was unlikely, he said, as the separate festival of Sao Joao do Nordeste is scheduled for that month.
Earlier in the day, Formula One officials scrapped the November 2020 race in Sao Paulo, along with the body's three other stops in the Americas, citing the coronavirus pandemic.

Brazil registered another 1,156 coronavirus deaths in the last 24 hours, the Health Ministry said on Friday, bringing the total death toll to 85,238. There are now over 2.3 million confirmed cases in Brazil, making it one of the hardest hit nations in the world.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the state may seek damages after the Trump administration admitted making false statements in a U.S. lawsuit over New Yorkers being barred from a program that allows the use of expedited lanes at U.S. airports.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan admitted late Thursday it had made inaccurate statements in a lawsuit brought by New York state over the Trusted Traveler program. It said the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) would immediately lift the ban.
""I believe there are civil damages that New York State is owed and we'll be pursuing possible claims for that,"" Cuomo said. ""It was a clear abuse of government power for political purposes.""
Cuomo suggested the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, and the acting deputy, Ken Cuccinelli, ""violated their oath of office"" and said they could face ""possible criminal liability.""
DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Separately, Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York asked DHS's inspector general to investigate. ""We do not have a full accounting of why and how false statements were made by DHS officials,"" Schumer wrote. ""Lying to a federal court is a very serious matter and there must be accountability for the persons involved.""
""They got caught. It was all politics, all the time,"" Cuomo said Friday. ""You can't use the Department of Homeland Security as a political tool. It doesn't work that way. And it's not just not right, and unethical and immoral. It's illegal.""
In February, DHS cut off New York from the program in response to the state's passage last June of a law allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses and limiting federal access to license information.
The Trump administration acknowledged some other states and territories withheld driver information but had been allowed to participate.
New York sued DHS in February, saying the policy would prohibit 175,000 New Yorkers whose program membership expires this year from re-enrolling, and would ""cut off"" 80,000 New Yorkers with pending applications.

In April, the state amended a law that had limited federal immigration authorities from accessing some records from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

Methods applied by proponents of conversion therapy to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity have ranged from psychological counseling to religious instruction and even electroshock therapy. The practice has become widely discredited in recent years.
In a virtual session, Mexico City's lawmakers passed the bill, which received broad cross-party support. 
Conversion therapy providers now face up to five years in prison, with higher sentences for those who subject minors to the practice. 
Under the new law, conversion therapy is defined as psychological or psychiatric measures or treatments which intend to ""nullify, hinder, modify or undermine"" the expression of a person's gender identity or their sexual orientation.
Its approval makes the Mexican capital, which in 2009 was the first region of the country to legalize same-sex marriage, the first jurisdiction in Mexico to ban the practice.
Major efforts are underway in much of North America to outlaw conversion therapy. Several U.S. states, including California, Colorado, New York and Washington, have banned it.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Voters should be on high alert for foreign interference in the Nov. 3 U.S. election, the U.S. counterintelligence agency chief said on Friday in a rare warning that the public should screen information, check online sources and report suspicious actions.
William Evanina, chief of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), said that with just over 100 days to the election, it was ""imperative"" his agency share with voters some of the information about possible interference that U.S. spies have given to campaigns and legislators.
""The American public has a role to play in securing the election, particularly in maintaining vigilance against foreign influence,"" said Evanina, who directs the counterintelligence branch of the U.S. Office the Director of National Intelligence.
""At the most basic level, we encourage Americans to consume information with a critical eye, check out sources before reposting or spreading messages, practice good cyber hygiene and media literacy, and report suspicious election-related activity to authorities,"" he added in a written statement.
A January 2017 U.S. intelligence community assessment found Russia meddled in the 2016 election and its goals included aiding U.S. President Donald Trump, who has cast doubt on whether Moscow interfered in that vote.
Given the complexity of U.S. vote counting and auditing systems, Evanina said it would be ""extraordinarily difficult for foreign adversaries to broadly disrupt or change vote tallies without detection.""
However, Evanina said U.S. spy agencies now see foreign adversaries trying to compromise U.S. political campaigns and candidates, as well as elections infrastructure.
He said foreign nations are trying to influence U.S. voters via social and traditional media, using issues including the coronavirus pandemic and domestic protests as disinformation fodder.
Evanina said his agency was mainly concerned with interference by China, Russia and Iran, though other unnamed countries and non-state actors ""could also do harm to our electoral process.""
Leading Democratic legislators complained that Evanina's warning did not go far enough.
They said his statement ""gives a false sense of equivalence to the actions of foreign adversaries by listing three countries of unequal intent, motivation and capability together."" 
""The statement, moreover, fails to fully delineate the goal, nature, scope and capacity to influence our election,"" said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, and top intelligence committee Democrats Sen. Mark Warner and Rep Adam Schiff in a statement.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Coronavirus lockdowns for parts of the Chilean capital Santiago will be gradually lifted from Tuesday, July 28, Health Minister Enrique Paris said on Friday.
Residents in the less populous and wealthier eastern suburbs of the capital will be allowed to gather in small groups and leave their homes without the police permission previously required during weekdays and outside nighttime curfew hours, he said.
Nationwide, the number of cases and hospitalizations have continued to fall over successive days, health authorities said. On Friday, they confirmed 341,304 cases and 8,914 deaths. Chile is at present ranked eighth in the world for its coronavirus caseload, according to a Reuters tally.
Lockdowns will be lifted in the Santiago suburbs of Las Condes, Vitacura, Lo Barnechea, Vitacura, Nunoa and La Reina, the outlying towns of Colina, Til Til and San Felipe and the seaport of San Antonio.
The Chilean capital has been covered by one of the longest and strictest lockdowns in the world, with citizens banned from leaving their homes unless to run essential errands twice a week with a special police permit. 
It reported its first case of coronavirus on March 3, prompting the government to suspend classes, close its borders and introduce nighttime curfews and rolling lockdowns.
In mid-April, President Sebastian Pinera referenced a “new normal” and a plan to return Chileans to work and schools. But in May the virus extended around the country and from wealthier areas of Santiago, home to a third of Chile`s population, to poorer and more crowded communities.
Case numbers surged to several thousand each day and a general lockdown was announced for Santiago and swathes of the country.
The economic impact has been fierce, with Chile’s unemployment rate hitting 11.2% between March and May. Chile’s Budget Office has predicted the economy will shrink 6.5% in 2020. 
Paris said the move towards reopening could be reversed in the event of an uptick in test positivity and contagion rates and hospital admissions. 

""This is a step by step programme to recoup the health of Chileans, lifting the country back to its feet,"" he said.

The United States ordered the consulate closed this week, leading China to retaliate on Friday by telling the United States to shut its consulate in the city of Chengdu, as relations between the world's two largest economies deteriorate.
In a briefing for journalists, a senior State Department official linked espionage activity at the Houston consulate to China's pursuit of research into a vaccine for the new coronavirus.
The official said China had been very clear about its intent to be first to the market with a coronavirus vaccine.
""The medical connections here aren't lost on me and... the medical connection in Houston is also pretty specific,"" the official said, without giving further details.
A senior Justice Department official said it was accepted that consulates of all countries were bases of operations for foreign intelligence services.
""It's understood that there will be some activity here by those services,"" he said. But, he added, ""The sum total of the Houston consulate's activities went well over the line of what we're willing to accept.""
""At some point you say, 'enough is enough' and you decide which are one of the worst offenders,"" he said.
China has denied the allegations of spying and intellectual property theft as ""malicious slander.""
The Justice Department official said that while illegal, the activities were ""not necessarily amenable to criminal charges,"" due in part to the diplomatic immunity that consulate officials enjoy.
The senior State Department official said, despite the disagreement between the two countries, U.S. diplomats who had been withdrawn from China earlier this year due to the spread of the coronavirus would continue to return. 
""The Chinese side has been cooperative in that; they understand the need to get back to balance,"" he said.
A flight bound for Shanghai carrying U.S. diplomats left the United States on Wednesday as Washington pressed ahead with its plan to restaff its mission in China.
According to a July 17 internal State Department email seen by Reuters, more such flights are planned.

It said these included a tentative July 29 flight to Tianjin and Beijing that was in the initial planning stages, while a target date for another flight, to Guangzhou, was still to be determined.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Hundreds of Nicaraguans are stuck in limbo between Costa Rica and Nicaragua after their homeland refused to allow them back without proof that they are not infected with the coronavirus, authorities said on Friday.
Nicaraguans have been exiting Costa Rica since Wednesday through the border post of Penas Blancas but about 300 are now stranded, having been barred from entering Nicaragua by its government, Costa Rica's immigration department said.
Managua is demanding that the Nicaraguans, who are waiting for the impasse to end by the side of a road, show proof that they have taken a coronavirus test in the last 72 hours.
""They are stranded at the Penas Blancas border post, on the Nicaraguan side,"" Costa Rica's Migration Directorate said in a statement.
One Nicaraguan human rights organization put the number of Nicaraguans caught between countries at about 500. Nicaragua's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Those trapped were not using an official agreement between Nicaragua, Panama and Costa Rica to repatriate Nicaraguan citizens through Costa Rica in isolation on buses, according to Raquel Vargas, Costa Rica's migration chief.
So far some 800 Nicaraguans have been repatriated this way in July.
Costa Rica has criticized Nicaragua for what it has called a lax response to the pandemic, and tightened its border controls.
Many impoverished Nicaraguans live in wealthier Costa Rica, where they can earn higher wages than back home. Tens of thousands of Nicaraguans also fled to Costa Rica after waves of street protests and political violence in 2018.
About 18,000 Nicaraguans have been turned away at the Costa Rican border during the pandemic, say Costa Rican authorities, who worry Nicaraguan citizens are spreading the virus.
About 29% of over 12,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in Costa Rica have been foreigners, government data show.

Often dirty and dangerous, and lacking water, sanitation and electricity, such camps have been used as accommodation for Spain's seasonal fruit-pickers for many years. 
""The situation is deteriorating alarmingly each day, made worse amid the COVID-19 pandemic,"" de Schutter said.
On Thursday, the health ministry acknowledged that their living and working conditions made fruit-pickers especially vulnerable to catching the coronavirus.
Spain is one of the European countries hardest-hit by the pandemic with more than 28,000 fatalities.
Since ending a three-month lockdown in June it has registered 281 new isolated outbreaks, over a quarter of which began in work environments.

The decision follows a ruling earlier this month which is part of a tug-of-war over whether Guaido or Nicolas Maduro should control $1 billion of Venezuela's gold reserves stored at the Bank of England in London.
""It is incredibly rare for a trial judge to give leave to appeal against their own judgment, and we are pleased to have been granted a limited appeal,"" said Sarosh Zaiwalla, partner at Zaiwalla & Co which represents the BCV.
Guaido's legal team declined to comment. The court could not immediately confirm details. 
The case centers on which of the two rival presidents Britain now views as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
The British government in early 2019 joined dozens of nations in backing Guaido, head of Venezuela's opposition-controlled congress, after he declared an interim presidency and denounced Maduro as an usurper.
Guaido, at the time, asked the Bank of England to prevent Maduro’s government from accessing the gold, which the opposition claims Maduro wants to use to pay off his foreign allies. 
In May, Maduro’s central bank (BCV) sued the Bank of England to recover control, saying it was depriving the BCV of funds needed to finance Venezuela’s coronavirus response. The Bank of England then asked the court to determine who the British government recognized as Venezuela’s president.

""This step is about an effort to protect public safety and to preserve a safe space for an inclusive and democratic public dialogue about our city's symbols,"" Mayor Lori Lightfoot's office said in a statement.
Protesters for racial equality have targeted Columbus monuments across the United States, challenging heroic portrayals of him in American education that downplay or ignore the explorer's cruelty toward indigenous people of the Americas.
After consulting with ""stakeholders,"" Lightfoot ordered the removal of statues in Grant Park, Chicago's large recreation area, and another in the Little Italy district, the statement said.
Crews using cranes removed the statues in the predawn darkness, news video showed, leaving bare pedestals.
""It comes in response to demonstrations that became unsafe for both protesters and police, as well as efforts by individuals to independently pull the Grant Park statue down in an extremely dangerous manner,"" the statement said.
The Chicago demonstrations, which resulted in several arrests and injuries, were among those that broke out across the United States to protest for racial equality and against police brutality, sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.
Columbus, the 15th century Genovese-born explorer who sailed for the Spanish crown, remains a powerful symbol for some Italian-American groups that oppose the downgrading of his status.
""We as a community feel betrayed,"" Pasquale Gianni of the Joint Civic Committee of Italian Americans told Chicago's ABC7 television in reaction to the removals. ""We feel that part of our heritage has been stripped from us. These statues represent much more than just mere objects but the blood, sweat and tears of all the contributions of Italian-Americans to this great city.""

Chicago said it would soon announce a formal process to address all its monuments, memorials and murals, part of a review under way in many cities to diversify monuments that have overwhelmingly honored white men.

PARIS/MADRID (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Jean Castex advised people on Friday not to travel to the neighbouring northeastern Spanish region of Catalonia in a bid to help contain the spread of the coronavirus.
Castex's recommendation was the latest blow to Spain's beleaguered tourism sector after Norway announced that travellers returning from the country would have to undergo a 10-day quarantine.
The French border with Spain remains open, but Castex said he was in talks with Madrid to reduce traffic flow.
""Concerning the situation in Catatonia, which is displaying worsened indicators for infection, we strongly encourage French citizens to avoid going there until the health situation improves,"" Castex told reporters.
In Catalonia, 8,563 cases were diagnosed in the 14 days up to Thursday - almost half of the 17,842 detected throughout Spain - despite guidelines for residents of regional capital Barcelona to stay at home. 
A source in Catalonia's regional government said that the region, where wearing a mask is mandatory in public, was taking more stringent steps than France. 
""We are holding everyone to a much higher degree of security than is asked elsewhere in Europe, such as in France,"" the source said.
The Spanish prime minister's office declined to comment.
Castex, who was speaking on the sidelines of a visit to Charles-de-Gaulle international airport, north of Paris, also said the government planned to reinforce controls at borders.

People arriving from 16 countries outside the European Union where the infection rate is deemed to be high will be subject to compulsory testing on arrival at French airports and sea ports. Those who test positive will be required to enter quarantine.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan joined huge crowds on Friday for the first prayers at Hagia Sophia in nine decades, sealing his ambition to restore Muslim worship at an ancient site long revered in both Christianity and Islam.
After the call to prayer rang out from four minarets surrounding the mosque, whose rose-pink walls and huge grey dome have dominated Istanbul since Christian Byzantine times, hundreds knelt in prayer inside the building.
Outside, tens of thousands more prayed in a public square and on sidewalks, squeezing into spaces between cars or in cafes, joining a ceremony which many saw as righting a historic mistake when the mosque was converted to a museum in 1934 by modern Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
Hagia Sophia was the largest cathedral in the world for 900 years until its capture by Ottoman Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror in 1453, after which it was one of Islam's most exalted mosques for nearly another 500 years. 
""This is the opening of a place of worship that was conquered by the right of the sword by the holy conqueror,"" said worshipper Latif Ozer, 42. ""This is a source of great pride for us, great excitement.""
That excitement has not been universally shared. Church leaders and some Western countries have sharply criticised Turkey's move, saying the shift to exclusive Muslim worship at Hagia Sophia risks deepening religious divisions.
Pope Francis said he was deeply pained by the decision, which came after a Turkish court annulled Hagia Sophia's status as a museum two weeks ago. Erdogan immediately issued a decree converting it once again to a mosque.
In Greece, church bells tolled in mourning on Friday. Most Greeks consider the monument central to their Orthodox Christian religion. Greek criticism of the conversion has been scathing, underscoring the countries' tense relations.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called Turkey a ""troublemaker"", and the Hagia Sophia conversion an ""affront to civilization of the 21st century"".
""HEARTBREAK"" IS ENDING
Several hundred invitees joined Erdogan for the ceremony inside the sixth-century building.
The president, his head covered by a white prayer cap, read a Koranic recitation before the head of Turkey's religious directorate Ali Erbas addressed worshippers.
""The longing of our nation, which has turned into a heartbreak, is coming to an end today,"" Erbas said from the pulpit, holding a sword in his hand - a tradition for preachers in mosques which have been captured in conquest, he later said.
""God willing, we will continue this tradition in the future,"" Anadolu agency quoted Erbas as saying as he left the mosque.
New white curtains covered an image of Mary and Jesus which would have faced the worshippers, but pictures of angels were still visible on arches supporting the mosque's cavernous dome. 
Officials say that glittering mosaics and other art in the main hall will be concealed during prayer time, but will remain uncovered in other parts of the building.
Earlier, crowds formed at checkpoints around the historic heart of Istanbul where massed police maintained security. Once through the checks, worshippers sat apart on prayer mats in secured areas outside the building in Sultanahmet Square.
A large screen and speakers set up in the square broadcast proceedings to a crowd which Erdogan said was 350,000-strong.
CHRISTIAN ICONS CONCEALED 
""God is greatest,"" chanted people in the square. Some held Turkish and Ottoman flags. 
During his 17-year rule, Erdogan has championed Islam and religious observance and backed efforts to restore Hagia Sophia's mosque status. He said Muslims should be able to pray there again and raised the issue - popular with many pious AKP-voting Turks - during local elections last year.
Erdogan has reshaped Turkey's modern republic, established nearly a century ago by the secularist Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, lifting a ban on Muslim headscarves in state institutions, promoting religious education and taming Turkey's powerful military, once a bastion of Ataturk's secular values.
After leaving Hagia Sophia, Erdogan went straight to the nearby Fatih (Conqueror) mosque, named after Sultan Mehmet who seized Istanbul for the Ottomans.

""Hagia Sophia will continue to serve all believers as a mosque and will remain a place of cultural heritage for all humanity,"" Erdogan said, adding he wanted to ""visit the tomb of Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror, the real owner"".

State TV video footage of the inside of the Mahan Air airliner showed a passenger lying immobile of the floor and another with a wounded nose and forehead, presenting his bloodied face mask to the camera.
Several passengers, some seen screaming and shouting, were injured in the flight manoeuvre over Syria as the airliner rapidly changed altitude to avoid collision, according to Iranian media, but the U.S. military said its F-15 had kept at a safe distance.
The U.S. military’s Central Command, which oversees American troops in the region, said the F-15 was conducting a visual inspection of the Iranian airliner when it passed near the Tanf garrison in Syria, home to U.S. forces.
Captain Bill Urban, the senior Central Command spokesman, said the F-15 ""conducted a standard visual inspection of a Mahan Air passenger airliner at a safe distance of about 1,000 metres (3,280 feet)"" from the airliner.
""The visual inspection occurred to ensure the safety of coalition personnel at Tanf garrison,"" Urban said. ""Once the F-15 pilot identified the aircraft as a Mahan Air passenger plane, the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft.""
He added the intercept was carried out in accordance with international standards.
The pilot of the passenger plane contacted the jet pilots to warn them to keep a safe distance and they identified themselves as American, Iran's official IRIB news agency reported.
Iranian Transport Minister Mohammad Eslami was quoted by the semi-official ISNA news agency on Friday as saying Tehran had lodged a formal complaint with the International Civil Aviation Organization, describing Thursday's incident as a ""terrorist act, one of aggression"".
Laya Joneydi, vice president for legal affairs, was quoted as saying by Iranian media that the U.S. action was ""harassment of a passenger plane"" and a ""clear violation of aviation security and freedom of civilian aircraft"".
""The explanations provided so far (by the U.S. military) are unjustified and unconvincing,"" she was quoted as saying.
Iran's Foreign Ministry said the encounter may be linked to the upcoming U.S. presidential election, state media reported.
""The security of West Asia should not become a plaything in the U.S. election campaign,"" ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. He did not elaborate.
""Iran won't leave any hostile move against its nation unanswered and shall respond decisively and appropriately to any irrational move in due time,"" Mousavi said. 
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the United States of endangering civilian passengers.
""These outlaws must be stopped before disaster,"" he tweeted.
The Iranian plane was heading from Tehran to Beirut at the time. 
Video footage showed oxygen masks fallen from the overhead roof panels. One jet can be seen through a seat window flying some distance away in a clear blue sky.
""I saw a black plane approaching us, and then we lost our balance,"" one unidentified injured passenger told state TV.
""It was a jet. Almost so near our plane.""
One of the passengers was lying on the floor by the toilets and another passenger put a cushion under his head as cabin crew tended to others.

Hopewell Chin'ono and opposition politician Jacob Ngarivhume were arrested on Monday on allegations of promoting planned protests against corruption in government on July 31, which police say will turn violent.
The two, who deny the charges, face up to 10 years imprisonment if convicted.
Chin'ono's lawyer Doug Coltart said a Harare magistrate had ruled that the journalist ""is a danger to the public because he has not yet completed his mission of inciting people to demonstrate on 31 July.""
Chin'ono, who has gained a following on social media by being critical of the government's handling of the economy and corruption, told reporters as he was being taken to prison cells: ""Journalism has been criminalised. The struggle against corruption should continue. People should not stop, they should carry on with it.""
He will be kept in prison until a court hearing on Aug. 7. Coltart said he would appeal Friday's ruling extending his detention until that hearing.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement it was concerned by allegations that Zimbabwean authorities may be using the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to clamp down on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
""Merely calling for a peaceful protest or participating in a peaceful protest are an exercise of recognised human rights,"" it said.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa imposed an overnight curfew and tighter restrictions on movement from Wednesday to combat rising coronavirus infections. But activists say the measures are meant to stop the July 31 protests.

230,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",Exclusive: More than 40 countries accuse North Korea of breaching U.N. sanctions,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 40 countries accused North Korea on Friday of illicitly breaching a United Nations cap on refined petroleum imports and called for an immediate halt to deliveries until the end of the year, according to a complaint seen by Reuters.
The 15-member U.N. Security Council imposed an annual cap of 500,000 barrels in December 2017 in a bid to cut off fuel for North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. 
But in a complaint to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee, 43 countries - including the United States, Britain and France - said they estimated that in the first five months of this year Pyongyang had imported more than 1.6 million barrels of refined petroleum via 56 illicit tanker deliveries. 
The complaint said North Korean vessels continue to conduct ship-to-ship transfers at sea ""on a regular basis as the DPRK's primary means of importing refined petroleum."" North Korea's formal name is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
The countries asked the Security Council sanctions committee to make an official determination that North Korea had exceeded the cap and ""inform member states that they must immediately cease selling, supplying, or transferring refined petroleum products to the DPRK for the remainder of the year.""
Similar requests to the committee in 2018 and 2019 were blocked by North Korean allies Russia and China. They are also the only two countries to have formally reported deliveries of refined petroleum to the Security Council sanctions committee.
""China and Russia collectively have reported 106,094.17 barrels of refined petroleum product transfers ... January through May,"" the complaint said. ""The official accounting of the DPRK's imports vastly underrepresents the volume of refined petroleum products that actually enter the DPRK.""
The 43 countries also urged the committee to call on states to ""immediately exercise enhanced vigilance regarding the DPRK attempting to procure additional refined petroleum products and to prevent illicit ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to vessels owned, controlled, or acting on behalf of or working in cooperation with the DPRK.""
North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. While the Security Council has steadily strengthened sanctions, U.N. monitors reported this year that North Korea continued to enhance its programs last year. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have met three times since 2018, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions.
The complaint to the Security Council committee said: ""If the DPRK is able to flagrantly evade international sanctions, it will have little incentive to engage in serious negotiations.""

The North Korean mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Its Africa Command said there was mounting evidence from satellite pictures of Moscow's military cargo planes, including IL-6s, bringing supplies to fighters from the Russian Wagner Group. 
Both sides have been mobilising forces around Sirte where any major new escalation could risk drawing major regional powers further into Libya's messy conflict.

Both Russia and its LNA ally have denied previous U.S. military statements that Moscow has sent fighter jets to back Wagner forces there. 
The GNA earlier this year pushed the LNA from most territory it held in northwest Libya, including in Tripoli, destroying several Russian air defence systems. 
However, the LNA stopped retreating at the central coastal city of Sirte, which it took from the GNA in January, and the front line has solidified there.

MINSK (Reuters) - An opposition candidate who tried to stand against Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko in next month's presidential election has fled to Russia with his two sons, fearing they could be taken away, his campaign said on Friday.
Valery Tsepkalo, the country's former ambassador to Washington and later the founder of an office park for technology companies, worried that the authorities had started proceedings to deprive him of his parental rights.
Lukashenko has jailed two of his main election rivals and detained hundreds of protesters in a crackdown on dissent against his 26-year rule that has drawn Western criticism.
Tsepkalo's campaign said officials from the prosecutor's office had come to the boys' school asking for written statements that his family were not taking good enough care of the children. 
""We were left with no choice,"" Tsepkalo's wife Veronika, who stayed behind to campaign against Lukashenko, told a crowd of hundreds of people at a rally. 
""I was called by concerned people and they said: 'We do not want to sign these papers, but they force us (to sign), they collect something bad against you and the next step is to deprive you of parental rights, that you are a bad mother, do not take care of the children'.""
A spokesman for the prosecutor's office declined comment. Tsepkalo's camp has not disclosed the age of the children.
Tsepkalo's move abroad comes days after another opposition candidate, Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, moved her two children to an undisclosed location in the European Union. She received anonymous threats of her children being taken away.
Veronika has joined forces with Tikhanouskaya and a third woman representing another candidate, now in prison, to campaign jointly against Lukashenko.
Tsepkalo was barred from standing after the central election commission voided some of the signatures he needed to collect to become a candidate. 
Tikhanouskaya launched her campaign after her husband, a popular blogger who planned to run against the president, was arrested in May. 
Protests in support of opposition candidates are the biggest challenge in years to Lukashenko, amid anger over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances over the economy and human rights.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Young Thai political activists set fire to pictures of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha outside government house on Friday and called for his resignation, as pressure builds on the generals who orchestrated a 2014 coup to leave office.
In the past week there have been small protests seeking to drive him from office in at least six provinces, while internal party squabbles have led to six cabinet members resigning.
Friday's demonstrators burned images of Prayuth and his deputy, Prawit Wongsuwan, both former army chiefs. 
""We want to burn the bad things in Thailand,"" said protester Niwiboon Chomphoo, 20, adding that Prayuth remained in charge because of a constitution that was ""unreliable and unfair for our democracy"".
Opponents say the military drafted a basic law that all-but guaranteed junta leader Prayuth remained in power as a civilian premier after national elections last year, with members of his royalist military clique in key posts.
Prayuth also faces a tough challenge to revive an economy that the central bank says could shrink by a record 8.1% this year and may have seen 7-8 million job losses, largely from coronavirus impacts. 
Youth groups are planning more protests at the weekend. [nL3N2EU30X]
Last Saturday about 2,500 people rallied against Prayuth in one of the biggest demonstrations since the 2014 coup, during which there were veiled negative references to the powerful monarchy, [nL3N2ER3DD] [nL3N2EP02T] 
Such allusions would once have been unthinkable in a country where criticism of the king is against the law.

""We don't have to show force to disagree and argue. We are ready to support the military to protect the highest institution.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Three editors of Hungary's leading independent news website Index.hu and around 60 journalists resigned on Friday over the ousting of their editor-in-chief, which they said was an ""open attempt to exert pressure"" on Index.
The journalists, representing about two-thirds of the newsroom, said in a statement on Index they decided to quit after the chairman of the board rejected their request to restore Szabolcs Dull to his position.
His dismissal has increased concern among Hungarian journalists that Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government is intensifying what they say is an attack on press freedoms.
""We have been saying for years that we believe there are two conditions for the independent operation of Index: there should be no external meddling into the content published on Index, or its composition and structure,"" the Index journalists said.
""His dismissal is a clear interference into the composition of the editorial, and we cannot regard this anything else but an open attempt to exert pressure.""
Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference on Thursday in Portugal that his government was facing “untrue accusations” with respect to freedom of the media.
“How would the state intervene in the decisions of a media which is privately owned?,"" he said when asked about Dull's dismissal.
Index, which about a month ago had set its so-called ""independence barometer"" to ""in danger"" to signal what it saw as outside attempts to influence its content, is by far the largest media organisation that is critical of the government.
On Wednesday Laszlo Bodolai, chief of the foundation that owns the website's publisher, Index.hu Zrt., said Dull had been unable to control internal tensions that arose from perceived attempts to influence the newsroom. Bodolai said that led to disarray and a drop in revenue as advertisers stayed away.
He said the political independence of Index was not at risk.

Dull said he believed he was sacked because of columns he wrote on index.hu about attempts at outside influence and also because of the warning he issued on Index's independence gauge, a graphic it has published since 2018.

The requirement, announced on July 13, marks the latest step in Britain's slow acceptance of the benefits of face coverings in preventing the spread of COVID-19. 
""I don't like them, but if it keeps people safe you’ve got to do it,"" said retiree Michael James, wearing a black face covering. 
""I can't understand how I didn't have to wear one yesterday and I have to today. What's the difference in the two days? But, yeah, if it cuts it down, anything.”
Some retailers, including supermarkets and coffee shop chains, said they supported the rules and would ask customers to abide by them, but it would not be up to staff to enforce them.
The move comes as deaths and new cases drop and the government encourages people back to work.
Asked how the rules should work, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We should rely on the massive common sense of the British people... The people understand the value of face masks in confined spaces.""
Police can fine shoppers 100 pounds ($127) if they refuse to wear a mask, but the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said enforcement should be a last resort.
""I've been into the supermarket this morning. There were some people wearing masks and some people not wearing masks. I was,"" said former teacher Helen Curran.

Britons were initially told there was no compelling evidence masks helped to stop spread the virus, but that position has gradually been reversed, first with a requirement to wear them on public transport, and now in shops.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will add 4,000 medical students over the next 10 years to swell the number of its doctors and strengthen the response to future public health crises, government and ruling party officials say.
Authorities flagged the need to train doctors for potential outbreaks of infectious disease worse than COVID-19, which is caused by the coronavirus, pointing to the risk of more frequent epidemics and limited numbers of beds for the sick.
To fill the gap, officials said they plan to step up admissions to medical schools using a combination of new quotas, incentives for students in less lucrative specialities and those who complete a decade of public health work in rural areas.
""We will increase the quota for medical students to add more personnel in specialized fields,"" Kim Tae-nyeon, a lawmaker of the ruling Democratic Party of Korea, said at a policy meeting on Thursday. 
The plan is to boost medical school admissions by about 400 a year for the next decade, before returning to a quota of 3,058, which has stayed fixed since 2006.
The government said it would waive tuition and offer full scholarships to about 300 students in areas such as epidemiology, gynaecology or surgery, widely seen as unpopular in contrast with more lucrative plastic surgery and dermatology.
Authorities said South Korea's 2018 ratio of 2.4 doctors for every 1,000 people fell short of an average of 3.5 for nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The Korean Medical Association (KMA) called the government's plan unnecessary, however, saying it was a distraction from real problems in the public health system. 
A survey of 27,000 of its members showed 95% opposed the plan, it said, since South Korea has no shortage of doctors. It also aired concern that the rural service requirement would violate students' rights.
The National University Hospital Association welcomed the idea of more doctors, but expressed concern about the skewed distribution of doctors and medical facilities, with most hospitals centred on Seoul, the capital.
This week, health authorities warned that virus infections among arrivals from abroad could push new cases on Friday beyond 100 for the first daily tally in three digits since April.

LAMPEDUSA, Italy (Reuters) - About 100 migrants who crossed the Mediterranean in small boats landed on the southern island of Lampedusa during the night, the latest in a wave of arrivals straining an already overcrowded holding centre.
Officials said the migrants, arriving from Libya, were either rescued at sea or managed to avoid detection and reach the island.
The arrivals of small boats, some carrying as few as eight people, brought to nearly 1,000 the number of migrants who have reached the island from Libya in the last three days.
About 15 boats carrying some 300 migrants arrived during the night between Wednesday and Thursday.
They were put in a holding centre called the ""hotspot"". Designed to hold about 100 people, in recent days it has been home to nearly 10 times as many.
Provincial officials this week ordered the emergency transfer of about 300 migrants to another centre in Sicily.
The recent overcrowding in Lampedusa has also led to immigration resurfacing as a political issue.
Former interior minister Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant League party, visited Lampedusa and the ""hotspot"" on Wednesday and accused the government of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of being soft on illegal migration.
""I can't wait to return to a government with serious people so I can close the ports again to block delinquents and reopen them to law-abiding citizens,"" he told supporters on the island.
When he was interior minister in the previous government, which collapsed about a year ago, Salvini closed Italian ports to rescue ships run by charities.

In response, Enrico Borghi, of the governing Democratic Party, accused Salvini of being a ""demagogue"" and said the current government was not going to ""watch men and women drown"".

The blackouts have led to protests, and armed men storming electricity facilities to demand engineers bring back power, underscoring continued instability even after an assault by eastern forces on Tripoli ended last month. 
Conflict continues, fought between the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), backed by Turkey, and the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. 
The LNA assault on Tripoli added to the problems, damaging or destroying transmission lines and control stations for the grid. Theft of equipment is a problem too. 
Abdulfattah Mabrouk Emhamid, a farmer west of Tripoli, spent 25,000 dinars ($18,000) for a generator three years ago ""so that my farm will not stop work"" he said.
But while businesses and wealthier residents pay for private generators to cool their homes, poorer people have little choice but to sit out the hot nights without air conditioning or electric fans. 
Abdulmenam al-Hajaji, a cafe worker, spends the evenings with his family in a small park near their sixth-storey apartment because his meager wage stretches little further than rent and other necessities. 
STALLED PROJECTS
""We stay out here until the children get sleepy,"" he said, adding that the power cuts were getting worse each summer, when demand spikes. His wife, Mouna, said she waits to do housework until the electricity returns, sometimes at midnight. 
A major oil exporter, Libya once had a strong electricity network. But years of chaos and fighting since the 2011 revolution that ousted Muammar Gaddafi have wrecked infrastructure and weakened state institutions. 
The national Audit Bureau said Libya has lost 2,700 megawatts out of its original 3,363MW and that state power company GECOL spent 1.6 billion dinars last year without advancing dozens of stalled projects. 
GECOL tries to manage the blackouts by sharing power supply among different towns in western Libya, but says some of these have refused to accept cuts, using force to keep electricity running in their areas, causing problems elsewhere. 
In Misrata on the coast, the head of the power workers union said a colleague was killed last year in an attack on a control room. 
The GNA's Turkish backers have proposed bringing a floating power station to Libya like ones its electricity company has installed off other countries. 
GECOL's executive manager Ali Sassy, said that would help bring power back more quickly, but it would cost the Libyan state ""a lot"".

247,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>","Exclusive: UK's home testing dogged by delays, undermining push to reduce virus transmission","By Steve Stecklow and Tommy Wilkes
LONDON (Reuters) - When Rachel Holdsworth recently developed a fever, she went online and looked up the location of the nearest government coronavirus testing centre. It was an hour away by foot. So she ordered a home test kit through the National Health Service.
It didn't arrive for two days. Her sample wasn't delivered to a laboratory until two days after that. By the time she received the test result in a text message – it was negative – five days had passed.
""It could be so much shorter,"" she says. ""The idea of going somewhere nearby and having the result much more quickly makes a lot more sense.""
To expand badly needed COVID-19 testing, the UK government has bet heavily on home testing, a strategy other countries severely affected by the virus haven't tried. To date, the UK has dispatched 1,327,791 home test kits, the Department of Health & Social Care told Reuters on July 17.
The health department said mass home testing is ""one of the biggest innovations we have made"" and ""a game changer"" because it has greatly increased the availability of tests for the new coronavirus, including for those self-isolating and living in rural areas. Home tests are now offered to anyone who exhibits symptoms.
But since it began three months ago, the UK's home-testing experiment has experienced some significant issues – including delays that experts say can defeat efforts to reduce disease transmission, tens of thousands of delivered test kits that were never returned to laboratories for processing, and kits containing faulty sampling swabs.
The problems are among the latest to blight the UK's response to the COVID-19 pandemic. With the exception of Belgium, Britain currently has the highest per-capita mortality rate from COVID-19 among major economies. As Reuters has previously reported, the government's decision to abandon mass testing and widespread contact tracing in mid-March blinded it to the spread of the virus.
To read the story, click https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/health-coronavirus-britain-tracing
In the case of the UK's home-testing programme, as of June 3 – the most recent date the health department has provided figures for – only 62% of the kits were returned to labs. The department told Reuters it was consulting with leading behavioural science experts to help improve return rates.
On July 16, Health Minister Matt Hancock disclosed to parliament that some sampling swabs from one of the companies providing home-test kits were ""not up to the usual high standard that we expect"" and shouldn't be used. He didn't say how many home test kits were affected. The Northern Ireland-based company, Randox Laboratories Ltd, didn't respond to questions about the faulty swabs sent by Reuters.
Some medical scientists question whether untrained people are capable of conducting a swab test to detect COVID-19 correctly. ""Many of us believe that quite a substantial rate of false negatives is a consequence of inaccurate swabbing,"" said Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Warwick Medical School in Coventry. ""It's quite difficult to access the back of the nose and throat.""
Holdsworth, the Londoner who took the test at home, says: ""I may well have gotten it wrong.""
In Germany, which has been praised for its widespread early testing of the coronavirus, the German College of General Practitioners and Family Physicians recommends that tests be carried out by healthcare professionals.
Asked how it knows if people administering home tests are doing it correctly, the UK health department cited unspecified studies it said show self-swabbing is as effective as tests conducted by a clinician.
Meanwhile, a growing body of research, including at Oxford University, suggests that home testing often takes too long for effective contact tracing – a critical tool to reduce virus transmission in which people who have come into close contact with those who test positive are tracked down and told to self-isolate.
The research shows that contact tracing is most effective when it's done as soon as possible after a patient develops symptoms. The benefits greatly begin to decline after 48 hours, modelling studies show.
According to the health department, of those home tests in England sent to labs between May 28 and July 15, 45% of the results were received within 48 hours of the test being taken, and nearly nine in ten results were reported within three days.
But the department's figures don't include the time it takes to deliver the tests. That can add another day or two to the time between showing symptoms and receiving a test result. The department didn't explain to Reuters why it doesn't include delivery time in its statistics.
By contrast, the department's most recent statistics on COVID-19 tests performed at public testing sites show that almost all of those results are received within 48 hours after booking an appointment online.
Adam Kucharski, an associate professor at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who has studied the effectiveness of contact tracing on COVID-19 transmission, said that from the onset of symptoms, ""if it takes four or five days to get a result and then one or two days to contact trace, then in terms of contact tracing a lot of these contacts would have already infected others.""
Delays in COVID-19 test results aren't unique to the UK. Although more than 1,400 CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) pharmacies in the United States with drive-through facilities offer tests, results in some locations currently can take six to 10 days because of extremely high demand, according to the company.
UNRELIABLE ANTIBODY TESTS
Secrecy surrounds the UK's home-testing programme, including its costs. The department said it can't comment on contracts that have been awarded because ""they are commercially sensitive.""
In response to questions from Reuters, the health department also didn't say who first came up with the idea of home testing and when.
Government officials first began mentioning home tests in late March when they disclosed that the UK had purchased 3.5 million rapid antibody tests – a blood analysis that would be performed by a finger prick to see if a person has ever had the virus – that they hoped could be conducted at home in the near future.
By then, COVID-19 was sweeping through the country. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on March 23 put the UK into a lockdown, instructing people to stay at home to slow a surge in new cases. Health authorities had carried out nearly 84,000 tests at that point, with 6,650 positive cases recorded, according to official data released that day.
But the UK's failure to test widely – it had stopped community testing on March 12 to focus on hospital cases – meant the statistics didn't accurately reflect the real scale of the outbreak. A Reuters analysis using mortality statistics estimated that in Britain the number of newly infected people per week peaked at 899,000 in the final week of March.
On April 2, Hancock publicly conceded that the UK hadn't been testing enough. He announced a new goal of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month – roughly ten times more than the number of daily tests then being conducted.
UK researchers soon found that the antibody tests the government had purchased weren't reliable. But it didn't give up on home testing.
Instead of delivering antibody tests, the National Health Service that month began offering home viral tests – delivered by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) at no charge to the government – that can show if a person currently has the virus. Initially offered only to essential workers showing symptoms, by the end of April they became available to any symptomatic person over 65, and those who were required to leave home to work and their families.
With great fanfare, Hancock announced on May 1 that the government had blown past its target of 100,000 tests a day the day before. But it turned out the 122,000 tests his department reported for April 30 included more than 27,000 home tests delivered to private residences that hadn't yet been sent to labs for processing.
'A BIT FIDDLY'
Rachel Holdsworth's recent experience ordering a home test shows the programme's complexities.
After developing a fever on Monday, July 6, she said she followed the government's advice and began self-isolating for seven days. But she was hoping to attend a friend's birthday party that Saturday afternoon so she decided to order a home test.
""It just seemed overly complicated,"" she said. ""When the email instructions came through, I couldn't focus on them. I had a fever. I couldn't follow the instructions until I was feeling better.""
The instructions stated that when the test kit arrived, she needed to book a courier online to send it to a laboratory and, just before taking the test, to register the kit online.
She also was told to watch a five-minute video featuring a NHS doctor to learn how to perform the test, which involves inserting a swab up the nose and down the throat.
""Bear with me – it is a bit fiddly but we'll go through it together,"" the doctor says.
Holdsworth said she found that ""the most complicated bit"" wasn't taking the test, but assembling the box to send it to the lab. The courier arrived early Thursday and it was delivered early Friday. But she didn't get her negative result until Saturday evening – and missed the birthday party.
""I honestly felt like I shouldn't have bothered,"" she said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Mekong River has become a new front in U.S.-China rivalry, environmentalists and officials say, with Beijing overtaking Washington in both spending and influence over downstream countries at the mercy of its control of the river's waters.
It's a confrontation in which the Trump administration - which has largely maintained funding for an Obama-era environmental and development programmes in the Lower Mekong - is losing ground. 
The two powers' struggle recently moved into the realm of science - with the U.S. and Chinese governments each touting different reports about whether China's 11 dams on the river were harming nations downstream.
China's dams have given it extensive control of the waters that flow down to Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam, which have long depended on the river for agriculture, fisheries, and increasingly for hydropower in Laos.
That control enables China to set the agenda for development linked to the waterway, and to exclude the United States from a role after decades of promoting Mekong projects as a way to exert its influence in the region.
""This is becoming a geopolitical issue, much like the South China Sea, between the United States and China,"" said Witoon Permpongsacharoen of the group Mekong Energy and Ecology Network.
The state of the Mekong is an urgent worry for the 60 million people who depend on it for farming and fishing as it flows from China, where it is known as the Lancang, through Southeast Asia before emptying into the sea from Vietnam's delta.
Last year saw record drought, with Lower Mekong river levels the lowest in decades. Fewer and smaller fish catches have been reported for years.
A U.S. ambassador in the region described China as ""hoarding"" water in its 11 dams on its upper portion of the 4,350-km (2,700-mile) river, harming the livelihoods of millions of people in downstream countries.
China also has been stepping up activities of its Lancang Mekong Cooperation group (LMC), a relatively new intergovernmental body that a second U.S. ambassador decried as trying to ""sideline"" the 25-year-old Mekong River Commission (MRC).
The MRC traces its origins back to U.S. efforts to promote development during the Cold War. It works with the governments of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to foster the sharing and sustainable development of the river and its resources.
China’s foreign ministry told Reuters any U.S. suggestion that Beijing was trying to take over the Mekong conversation was groundless.
""Countries outside the region should refrain from stirring up trouble out of nothing,"" the ministry said.
'ILL INTENT'
The U.S.-China rivalry broke into a war of words after a Washington-funded study in April concluded that China’s dams held back waters during last year's drought.
The study by Eyes on Earth, a U.S.-based research and consulting company specialising in water, built a prediction model based on satellite imaging and MRC data that it said showed ""missing"" waters downstream, starting in around 2010.
U.S. Ambassador to Cambodia Patrick Murphy said he was ""quite surprised"" at the stark findings.
""That was the same here in the region,"" Murphy told Reuters, referring to the reaction to the revelation.
""To learn that a primary source for the diminished level of the Mekong, and changes in the Mekong in the Lower Mekong region, is what's happening upstream in China - with essentially the hoarding of water,"" Murphy said.
China reacted with outrage, with its embassy in Thailand denouncing the study as ""politically motivated, aimed at targeting China with ill intent"" - a charge its author and U.S. officials denied.
Then, last week, China's Global Times published an article about a Chinese study it characterized as disproving the Eyes on Earth report.
""River dams in China helped alleviate drought along Lancang-Mekong, research finds,"" read the headline in the newspaper published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party. 
However, the study by Tsinghua University and the China Institute of Water Resources in fact said China's dams could, in future, help alleviate drought, not that they actually did so in 2019, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.
""We are not meaning to compare with any other report. We aim to provide some basic facts to facilitate mutual understanding, trust and therefore cooperation in the basin,"" lead researcher Tian Fuqiang told Reuters in an email.
Researchers will argue about the science, but for the Lower Mekong countries, it comes down to trust and power.
Sebastian Strangio, author of a book on Southeast Asia's relations with China, ""In the Dragon's Shadow"", said China's downstream neighbours almost certainly trust China's narrative less - but Beijing's regional might can't be ignored.
""They rely on China now for a life-giving resource, and it's very difficult for them to openly challenge the Chinese government on its dam building,"" Strangio said.
Reluctant to take sides, none of the MRC countries has commented publicly in favour of either the Chinese or American study.
SEPARATE COOPERATION GROUPS
The United States has spent $120 million on its Lower Mekong Initiative since it was founded 11 years ago.
China appears to be spending more: in 2016, the Beijing-sponsored LMC set up a $300 million fund for research grants to be awarded for the five downstream countries.
The LMC did not respond to requests for an interview nor to questions about its 95 proposed projects, planned or underway, that are on a list reviewed by Reuters from its first Ministerial Meeting in Beijing in December.
The Chinese-led group is taking a higher profile with an annual foreign ministers' meeting and plans for a summit of leaders, possibly including Chinese President Xi Jinping, while less heavy-hitting water and environment officials typically go to MRC meetings, a Thai government official said.
The LMC drew criticism from the U.S. ambassador to Thailand, Michael DeSombre, who called it a ""parallel organisation"" to the MRC.
""We really would encourage the People's Republic of China to work together with the Mekong River Commission, rather than trying to sideline it by creating its own organisation that it controls,"" DeSombre said.
Despite the U.S. warnings, officials at the Mekong River Commission say it welcomes cooperation with the LMC and China.
One reason is that the commission and member governments want more data about operations of China's dams, which hold back a combined capacity 47 billion cubic metres of water.
In 2002, Beijing started notifying downstream countries of when it would release water that could cause flooding.
But China has disclosed little else to enable downstream countries to make plans and request adjustments in the river's flows.
China, at a February meeting of the LMC, promised more cooperation with its neighbours, but when speaking privately, regional officials are sceptical. 

""China hasn't shared any constructive data,"" said a Vietnamese official who declined to be identified.

254,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>","India, China set for more talks to de-escalate Himalayan standoff","By Sanjeev Miglani
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese diplomats were set for more talks on Friday to narrow differences on ways to pull back troops eye-balling each other across a disputed border in the western Himalayas, where 20 Indian soldiers died in a clash over a month ago.
There were no shots fired during the June 15 fighting in the Galwan Valley of India's Ladakh region when the Indian soldiers were beaten with rocks and clubs, but it still marked the worst clash in decades between Asia's nuclear-armed giants.
Since then the two sides have held several rounds of talks to restore calm, and reduced the numbers of troops in the valley, while still pouring reinforcements into the region.
Once they agree how to sequence a pull back from frontline positions, the next step would be for the withdrawal of all the additional forces and military equipment that were deployed in rear areas after the clash. 
Diplomats from both sides were set to hold talks through a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation & Coordination on India-China Border Affairs, a government source in New Delhi said.
The de facto border, called the Line of Actual Control (LAC), was established after a war in 1962, but it remains poorly defined, and there have been sporadic flare ups over the decades, without leading to cross-border firing.
India's foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said maintenance of peace on the border was the basis of bi-lateral relations.
""Therefore, it is our expectation that the Chinese side will sincerely work with us for complete disengagement and de-escalation and full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas at the earliest,"" Srivastava said.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters in Washington that the United States had seen a build-up of forces on the India-China border, estimating that each side had over 10,000 troops in the border area.
""We're still seeing actually troop reinforcements and weapon reinforcements moving towards the border. So by no means are we out of the woods yet,"" the official added.
India has also taken non-military retaliatory action against China after last month's clash. 
On Thursday, New Delhi said companies from neighbouring countries bidding for government contracts would need to register and obtain security clearance.
Citing security concerns, India has outlawed 59 apps of Chinese origin, including ByteDance's TikTok and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA)'s UC Browser.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Former Salvadoran defense minister General David Munguia was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of unlawful association and other crimes linked to the arrangement of a 2012-2014 truce between crime gangs, El Salvador's attorney general said.
An arrest warrant was also issued for former Salvadoran President Mauricio Funes, who sought political asylum in Nicaragua in September of 2016, saying he was facing political persecution in his country. 
Funes, who governed from 2009 to 2014, is also facing prosecution in five separate court cases.
According to prosecutors, Funes and Munguia allegedly organized a pact between two rival gangs - Mara Salvatrucha and Barrio 18 - in order to reduce the number of homicides between 2012 and 2014, in exchange for providing undisclosed benefits to the criminal organizations.
Manuel Chacon, a lawyer for Munguia, said there was not enough proof to warrant an arrest of his client, media reported. 
Funes criticized the warrant issued for him, saying in a post on Twitter he had not authorized the truce between the gangs or given them money.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 24, 2020 12:11AM ET</span>",Pompeo urges more assertive approach to 'Frankenstein' China,"By David Brunnstrom and Daphne Psaledakis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took fresh aim at China on Thursday and said Washington and its allies must use ""more creative and assertive ways"" to press the Chinese Communist Party to change its ways, calling it the ""mission of our time.""
Speaking at the Nixon Library in President Richard Nixon's birthplace in Yorba Linda, California, Pompeo said the former U.S. leader's worry about what he had done by opening the world to China's Communist Party in the 1970s had been prophetic.
""President Nixon once said he feared he had created a 'Frankenstein' by opening the world to the CCP,"" Pompeo said. ""And here we are.""
Nixon, who died in 1994 and was president from 1969-74, opened the way for the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations with Communist China in 1979 through a series of contacts, including a visit to Beijing in 1972.
In a major speech delivered after Washington's surprise order this week for China to close its Houston consulate, Pompeo called for an end to ""blind engagement"" with China and repeated frequently leveled U.S. charges about its unfair trade practices, human rights abuses and efforts to infiltrate American society. 
He said China's military had became ""stronger and more menacing"" and the approach to Beijing should be ""distrust and verify,"" adapting President Ronald Reagan's ""trust but verify"" mantra about the Soviet Union in the 1980s.
""The truth is that our policies – and those of other free nations – resurrected China’s failing economy, only to see Beijing bite the international hands that were feeding it,"" Pompeo said. 
""The freedom-loving nations of the world must induce China to change ... in more creative and assertive ways, because Beijing’s actions threaten our people and our prosperity.""
Recalling remarks he made after meeting British leaders in London this week, Pompeo said ""maybe it's time for a new grouping of like-minded nations, a new alliance of democracies,"" while adding: ""If the free world doesn't change, Communist China will surely change us."" 
Pompeo said ""securing our freedoms from the Chinese Communist Party is the mission of our time,"" and America was perfectly positioned to lead it. 
He said one NATO ally, which he did not name, was unwilling to stand up for freedom in Hong Kong because it feared restricted access to China's market. 
While some conservative commentators praised Pompeo's speech on social media and elsewhere, some other analysts were not impressed. 
Scott Kennedy, of Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said cooperation with other democracies on China would be easier said than done, given the Trump administration’s record of dealing with allies.
""How do you form a united front against China when the U.S. is bullying its allies, trashing multilateral institutions and pushing an economic decoupling (from China) that no one else supports?” he said.
LOW POINT
Pompeo's speech comes at a time when U.S.-China relations have dipped to their lowest point in decades and President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden have appeared to compete with each other over who can appear toughest towards Beijing ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Ties have deteriorated over issues ranging from the novel coronavirus pandemic, which began in China, to Beijing trade and business practices, its territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.
In a dramatic escalation, Washington on Tuesday gave China 72 hours to close its Houston consulate.
Pompeo said the consulate had been ""a hub of spying and intellectual property theft.""
China said the U.S. move had ""severely harmed"" relations and warned it ""must"" retaliate, without detailing what it would do.
The South China Morning Post reported China may close the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, while a source told Reuters on Wednesday China was considering shutting the consulate in Wuhan, where the United States withdrew staff at the start of the coronavirus outbreak.
Hu Xijin, editor of China's Global Times tabloid, posted on Twitter: ""Based on what I know, China will announce countermeasure on Friday Beijing time. One U.S. consulate in China will be asked to close.""
Earlier he said shutting the Wuhan consulate would be insufficiently disruptive and suggested China could cut U.S. staff at its large consulate in Hong Kong, which he called an ""intelligence center.""
""This will make Washington suffer much pain,"" he wrote.
The other U.S. consulates in China are in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang.
China has four other consulates in the United States - in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York - as well as an embassy in Washington.
Trump told a news briefing on Wednesday it was ""always possible"" other Chinese missions could be closed too.
Richard Grenell, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo who served until recently as acting director of U.S. national intelligence, told Reuters the U.S. strategy was ""very much start with one and move on to others if need be.""
""The whole goal is to change the behavior of the Chinese... this is emerging as the Trump doctrine, which is very harsh actions, sanctions and isolation while at the same time always offering a chance to exit if the behavior changes.""

Chinese state media editorials said the Houston move was an attempt to blame Beijing for U.S. failures ahead of Trump's reelection bid. Opinion polls have shown Trump trailing Biden.

The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, cited ""serial intrusions"" of privacy of the couple's 14-month old child, and came as a measure to protect him from the ""manufactured feeding frenzy.""
""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are filing this lawsuit to protect their young son's right to privacy in their home without intrusion by photographers, and to uncover and stop those who seek to profit from these illegal actions,"" the attorney for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex said in a statement.
The lawsuit also alleged that drones and helicopters entered the privacy of the airspace above the couple's residence.
The couple seeks ""no special treatment"" and is only seeking the right to be left alone in the privacy of their home as guaranteed under the laws of California, the lawsuit stated.
In June, Meghan sought a court order to stop the publisher of a UK tabloid from disclosing the names of friends who could be witnesses in an ongoing legal dispute citing their right to privacy.
The family is now living in Los Angeles after the couple stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March to forge new careers. They moved out of the UK after growing hostility to the media's intense coverage of their private life.

In April, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex told Britain's biggest tabloids, including The Sun, and Daily Mail, that there would be ""zero engagement"" with them in future because of their false and invasive coverage.

258,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>",'Crusher' Collins pulls no punches in bid to oust New Zealand's Ardern,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's hopes for an easy win in September elections thanks to her success in eliminating COVID-19 have been checked by the emergence of a new opposition leader known to friend and foe alike as Crusher.
Judith Collins was elected only last week to lead the National Party as it reels from a series of leadership changes and scandals that have it trailing in the latest opinion polls, with 38% support against 50% for Ardern's Labour Party.
She has wasted no time in making an impact, booting out a party colleague for sending a lewd image to a woman and going public with an allegation which led to the sacking of the immigration minister for having an inappropriate relationship.
Nicknamed Crusher after she brought in a law as police minister in 2009 allowing for illegal street racers' cars to be confiscated and destroyed, Collins said she preferred to be known for her determination to build a more vibrant economy.
""I prefer 'focused' because that’s what I am - absolutely laser-focused on giving businesses in this country the confidence to invest and grow to create more jobs,"" Collins told Reuters in an email.
""Our focus this election is on delivering an economic plan that gives hope to the more than 200,000 New Zealanders who are currently on unemployment benefits, as well as the tens of thousands more whose jobs are hanging by a thread."" 
The Labour Party, governing in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, is campaigning on its enviable record of bringing COVID-19 under control and stopping chains of community transmission.
But Collins - whose autobiography released this month is titled ""Pull No Punches"" - wants voters to think instead about the lacklustre economy, and what she calls Ardern's broken promises to fix a housing crisis and tackle child poverty.
Some analysts agree Ardern's government is vulnerable on domestic issues despite her global standing. The youngest female prime minister when she came to power in 2017, she has won international praise for her compassionate leadership, particularly in the aftermath of last year's massacre of 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch.
But she has backtracked on a key capital gains tax promise, while housing projects have floundered and an ambitious social welfare programme to end child poverty has achieved little. 
Business confidence is low and economic growth has stagnated despite the relatively quick lifting of coronavirus restrictions.
Ardern's office told Reuters in a statement the government was proud of its economic record, pointing out its investments in health, education and infrastructure ""while managing the books to keep debt as low as possible, and well below the levels seen in comparable countries like Australia and the UK"".
To be sure, Ardern is popular and polls suggest Labour is on track for a resounding election win, but some analysts see an opening for Collins to make inroads.
""Ardern has domestic issues, and that's always been a problem. Collins will tell voters (Ardern) is a great global leader but a bad domestic one,"" said Andrew Hughes from the Research School of Management in Australian National University.
NO HOLDS BARRED
In addition to the general election, New Zealanders will vote on Sept. 19 in two referendums on legalising voluntary euthanasia and cannabis.
The National leader has supported voluntary euthanasia but has said she is not in favour of legalising recreational use of marijuana, an issue that could shift some undecided voters her way.
In her maiden speech as opposition leader Collins praised Ardern's communication skills, but said she would not let the prime minister get away with any ""nonsense"". 
Grant Duncan, associate professor at Auckland's Massey University, said Collins could range from charming to tough to deliberately Machiavellian. 
""Discontented centre-right voters may see her as an antidote to Ardern’s genuine warmth and kindness,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government admitted late Thursday it had made false statements in a lawsuit brought by New York state and told a court it would immediately lift a ban on New York residents participating its Trusted Traveler Program.
The disclosure came hours after the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) had said it would reinstate New Yorkers in the program, which allows participants faster passage between the United States and either Canada or Mexico.
In February, the DHS cut off New York from the program in response to the state's passage last June of a law allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses and limiting federal access to license information.
The U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan in a court filing Thursday acknowledged some other states and territories withhold driver information but have been allowed to participate. The revelations, they said, undermined a central argument that the government ""is not able to assure itself of an applicant’s low-risk status because New York fails to share relevant DMV information.""
The government's court filing said the agencies ""deeply regret the foregoing inaccurate or misleading statements and apologize to the court and (New York) for the need to make these corrections at this late stage.""
New York sued DHS in February, saying the policy would prohibit 175,000 New Yorkers whose membership in the program expires this year from re-enrolling, and would ""cut off"" 80,000 New Yorkers with pending applications.
New York Attorney General Letitia James said Thursday the DHS decision to deny the state access was ""political retribution, plain and simple, which is why we filed our lawsuit to stop the president from targeting and punishing New Yorkers.""
In April, the state amended its law that had limited federal immigration authorities from accessing records from the state's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The change allowed the DMV to share information ""as necessary for an individual seeking acceptance into a trusted traveler program, or to facilitate vehicle imports and/or exports.""
The DHS policy had prohibited New Yorkers from joining or renewing participation in so-called Trusted Traveler programs including Global Entry and three others - FAST, NEXUS AND SENTRI.

Lewis, a Democratic member of Congress from Atlanta for 33 years and protege of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., died on Friday of pancreatic cancer at age 80.
An invitation-only arrival ceremony for his casket at the Capitol will be held on Monday afternoon and a public viewing will be held on Monday evening and Tuesday, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a joint statement on Thursday.
Due to concerns over the coronavirus, the public viewing will be held outdoors on the East Front Steps of the Capitol and social distancing will be strictly enforced, the statement said.
The public school district in Fairfax County, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, said on Thursday it had voted to rename the Robert E. Lee High School after Lewis.
Lee was the commanding general of the Confederate army in the U.S. Civil War. The rise of the Black Lives Matter movement has sparked a reconsideration of buildings, military installations and monuments named after soldiers who fought for the slaveholding Confederacy.

The Iranian plane, belonging to Mahan Air, was heading from Tehran to Beirut when the pilot staged a safety maneuver, in an incident that Iran's Foreign Ministry said would be investigated.
Tensions have spiked between Tehran and Washington since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have battered Iran's economy.
Iran's official IRIB news agency quoted a passenger describing how his head had hit the roof of the plane during the change in altitude, and video showed an elderly passenger sprawled on the floor.
All the passengers left the plane, some with minor injuries, the head of the Beirut airport told Reuters.
The plane arrived back in Tehran in the early hours of Friday, the Fars news agency reported.
The U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees American troops in the region, said the F-15 aircraft was conducting a visual inspection of the Iranian aircraft when it passed near the Tanf garrison in Syria where U.S. forces are present.
Captain Bill Urban, the senior Central Command spokesman, said the F-15 ""conducted a standard visual inspection of a Mahan Air passenger airliner at a safe distance of about 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) from the airliner this evening.""
""The visual inspection occurred to ensure the safety of coalition personnel at At Tanf garrison,"" Urban said. ""Once the F-15 pilot identified the aircraft as a Mahan Air passenger plane, the F-15 safely opened distance from the aircraft."" 
He added the intercept was carried out in accordance with international standards.
The pilot of the passenger plane contacted the jet pilots to warn them to keep a safe distance and they identified themselves as American, IRIB reported.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said the necessary legal and political actions would be taken, according to the ministry's website.
Israel and the United States have long accused Mahan Air of ferrying weapons for Iranian-linked guerrillas in Syria and elsewhere. 
The United States imposed sanctions on Mahan Air in 2011, saying it provided financial and other support to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Kurdish-Iranian exile and writer Behrouz Boochani, who was held in an Australian-run offshore island detention camp for about six years, has been granted refugee status in New Zealand, authorities said on Friday.
Boochani arrived in New Zealand about eight months ago to speak at a literary festival, and has stayed in Christchurch despite his visitor visa expiring.
Boochani has been recognised as a refugee under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugee and its 1967 Protocol, Fiona Whiteridge from Immigration New Zealand (INZ)
told Reuters.
""For legal and privacy reasons, INZ is unable to provide any further comment,"" Whiteridge added.
Boochani did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
The University of Canterbury said in a statement that Boochani will become a senior adjunct research fellow at the institute.
Boochani was held on Papua New Guinea's (PNG) Manus Island after being plucked from a refugee boat on its way to Australia in 2013.
He described his journey and the conditions in detention in his book, ""No Friends but the Mountains"", written on his phone and sent via Whatsapp to a publisher in Australia. The book won one of Australia's top literary prizes this year.
The Green Party, a coalition partner in Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government, welcomed the news.
“Today we celebrate New Zealand as a place where fairness and compassion prevails”, spokeswoman Golriz Ghahraman said. 
Asylum seekers intercepted at sea by Australian authorities are sent to Manus or the South Pacific island of Nauru, where many have languished for years. They are permanently barred from settling in Australia.
New Zealand's Ardern has made a longstanding offer to take 150 asylum seekers from Australia's offshore camps, but the Australian government has not taken up the request.
Amnesty International New Zealand said it was time for Australia to accept New Zealand's offer.
""Hundreds of people are still being held against their will in Australia, PNG and Nauru. Enough is enough,"" said Meg de Ronde, Executive Director of Amnesty International New Zealand.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A prominent South Sudanese economist fled to the United States on Thursday and accused South Sudan's President Salva Kiir of ordering a hit squad to kill or kidnap him in Kenya, an allegation immediately denied by the Juba government.
Peter Biar Ajak landed at Dulles Airport outside Washington with his wife and three small children after traveling from Nairobi. He told Reuters that top South Sudanese officials whom he declined to identify had warned him that Kiir had ordered a team to abduct or murder him in the Kenyan capital.
Ajak said SUVs with South Sudanese plates followed him in Nairobi, where he moved in February after about 18 months in prison in South Sudan. He was pardoned in January of charges he had disturbed the peace by speaking to the foreign media.
""About five weeks ago I received information that the president of South Sudan, Salva Kiir, had ordered the National Security Service... to either kill me in Nairobi or abduct me and bring me back to South Sudan,"" Ajak told Reuters.
Asked why Kiir may have wished to have him killed or captured, Ajak said he believed South Sudan's president felt threatened by his efforts to expose corruption and promote democracy in the country, which gained independence in 2011 and was mired in civil war from 2013 to 2018.
Ajak founded the South Sudan Young Leaders Forum, a non-profit group that has published scathing criticisms of the South Sudanese leadership and has sought to rally the country's young people to demand better governance and an end to violence.
South Sudan's government flatly denied Ajak's allegation that Kiir sent a hit squad after him in Nairobi.
""That is complete nonsense. He was here when he was pardoned by the president and allowed to go abroad. He should not associate anything that comes his way with the government of South Sudan,"" Ateny Wek Ateny, South Sudan's presidential press secretary, told Reuters in Juba.
""The government of South Sudan does not attempt, or even need, to kill anybody outside the country,"" Ateny added.
Reuters could not independently verify Ajak's claims that Kiir ordered a squad to kill or capture him.
Ajak's representative, human rights lawyer Jared Genser, provided a photograph of a white SUV with South Sudanese plates which he said had followed Ajak in Nairobi. Genser said the plates were not in South Sudan's car registry and were typical of those used by the government's National Security Service.
Reuters also reviewed emails from June that showed the U.S. State Department regarded Ajak's allegation as sufficiently credible to grant him a U.S. visa.
""The circumstances of Peter's case are clear,"" said one U.S. official in an email.
A State Department spokesman who declined to be identified said the agency was aware of Ajak's safe arrival and referred all questions about his immigration status to the Department of Homeland Security.
South Sudan plunged into civil war in 2013 after a political disagreement between Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar deteriorated into a military confrontation.
Ajak has been publicly critical of the way Kiir and Machar approached peace talks to end the civil war. He said South Sudan needed to hold elections but said it was too soon to say whether he might run.
In 2018, South Sudan ended five years of civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people, caused a famine and created a massive refugee crisis, but Kiir and Machar's disagreements have kept the peace process from being concluded.
In an opinion piece published in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Ajak accused Kiir of ""cruelty"" and said he had ""exploited the chaos to delay elections, first from 2015 to 2018, and then to 2021. They must not be delayed again.""
While thanking President Donald Trump for giving him refuge, he also called on the United States to impose additional targeted sanctions against South Sudanese officials who he said had committed atrocities.

The White House and the State Department did not immediately responded to requests for comment on the call for more sanctions.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan has found a mass grave that most likely contains remains of 28 army officers executed in 1990 for plotting an attempted coup against the former President Omar al-Bashir, the public prosecutor office said late on Thursday.
The officers were executed in mysterious circumstances after a quick military trial one year after Bashir himself took the power in a military coup in 1989. There burial site was not disclosed for decades.
""The public prosecution managed to find a mass grave that data indicates that it is most likely the graveyard where the bodies of the officers who were killed and buried in a brutal manner,"" the public prosecutor said in a statement. 
A team of 23 experts reached this result after an effort that lasted for three weeks, and more forensic and investigative measures will be taken in the site, the statement added.
The public prosecutor assured the families of the executed officers that ""such crimes will not pass without a just trial"".
Bashir appeared in court on Tuesday at the opening of his trial for leading the military coup that brought him to power in 1989. He could be sentenced to death if convicted.
Bashir's attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.
Bashir was ousted by the army in April 2019, after months of mass protests. 
Local media reports said earlier this month that prosecutors questioned Bashir over the 1990 executions. The prosecution has not publicly commented on the matter. 
Last month, Sudan's public prosecutor announced the discovery of a mass grave east of Khartoum suspected to contain the remains of students killed in 1998 as they tried escaping military service at a training camp.
Bashir already was handed down a two-year sentence by a court in December on corruption charges. Bashir also faces trials and investigations over the killing of protesters.
He is also wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC), which issued arrest warrants against him in 2009 and 2010 on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity in Sudan’s restive Darfur region.

A civilian transition government took over from Bashir under a three-year power-sharing deal with the military who helped remove Bashir, but the country's economy is still in crisis.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI has interviewed visa holders in more than 25 U.S. cities suspected of hiding their Chinese military memberships, the Justice Department said on Thursday, as part of what experts called the biggest known crackdown on the theft of U.S. know-how in more than 40 years of Sino-U.S. relations.
The Justice Department announcement likely will fuel tensions between the world's two largest economies that have grown since the Trump administration ordered China to shutter its consulate in Houston, Texas, by Friday.
The administration has intensified charges that China uses cyber operations and espionage to steal U.S. technological, military and other know-how in a strategy to supplant the United States as the world's leading financial and military power. Beijing denied the allegations.
The FBI recently has interviewed visa holders suspected of having undeclared Chinese military affiliations in more than 25 American cities, the Justice Department said.
""These members of China's Peoples Liberation Army applied for research visas while hiding their true affiliation with the PLA,"" the statement quoted Assistant Attorney General John Demers as saying. ""This is another part of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to take advantage of our open society and exploit academic institutions.""
The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, FBI Director Christopher Wray said almost half of the nearly 5,000 counter-intelligence investigations the bureau is conducting involve China.
Experts called it the largest known crackdown on the theft of American intellectual property since the two nuclear-armed powers began the process that led to the establishment of diplomat relations in 1979.
""This is by far the biggest response by the U.S. to China's theft of IP (intellectual property) since the opening to China,"" said James Mulvenon, an expert on the Chinese military and cyber operations with SOS International, a contractor that supports U.S. government agencies.
The Justice Department said the FBI recently arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly concealing memberships in the Peoples Liberation Army when applying for visas to conduct research at U.S. academic institutions.
The FBI is seeking to arrest a fourth research visa fraud suspect who sought refuge in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco after being interviewed by the bureau in June, the department said.

U.S. law enforcement cannot enter a foreign embassy or consulate unless invited, and certain top officials such as ambassadors have diplomatic immunity.

Plenkovic's new coalition government is supported by two smaller liberal parties and the representatives of the national minorities. Plenkovic also headed the former HDZ-led coalition over the last four years. 
Despite a tiny majority of 76 votes in the 151-seat parliament, Plenkovic's government is expected to receive steady parliamentary support.
""Our key task is to secure welfare for our citizens ... to preserve their health and the jobs at these times of the (COVID-19) pandemic,"" Plenkovic said in parliament. 
Most of the ministers from Plenkovic's previous cabinet remained in office, including Finance Minister Zdravko Maric who is seen as pivotal to keeping public finances on track for Croatia's bid to adopt the euro by 2024.
This month Croatia entered the European Exchange Mechanism (ERM-2), a waiting room of at least two years before the euro adoption.
Plenkovic said his government would work on raising living standards, vowing to increase an average wage by the end of the four-year term to 7,600 kuna ($1,171.14) from the current 6,655 kuna. 
His government plans to reduce the income tax rates to 20% and 30% from the current 24% and 36%, respectively, and reduce the profit tax to 10% from 12% for companies with annual earnings of up to 7.5 million kuna.
The value-added tax for food products is planned to be cut to 13% from the current 25%, one of the highest VAT rates in the European Union.
Boosting the business climate and investments in a tourism-dependent economy and keeping public spending under control will be among the key challenges in the efforts to restore growth after an economic downturn of around 10% expected this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The layoff ban was first imposed in April for three months. With the new law, Erdogan will be allowed to extend the ban by three months each time until June 30, 2021. 
Turkey's headline unemployment rate fell to 12.8% in the March-May period from 13.2% a month earlier. But analysts have said the data does not show the economic blow dealt by COVID-19.[nL8N2EH1AO]
According to another section of the law, Erdogan will have the authority to decide for each sector whether to extend the short labour pay benefit, a system that provides additional wages to employees whose hours are cut short.
The law also allows the payment of social security premiums from the unemployment fund for three months to private sector companies that return to normal working hours after benefiting from the short labour pay or cash support system.
The measures regarding the short labour pay and the social security premiums will expire at the end of the year.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean lawmakers punched the air and waved the national flag in Congress on Thursday after giving final approval to a government-contested bill to allows citizens to withdraw 10% of their pension savings to help ease the economic pain wrought by the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The bill has sped through several congressional votes with cross-party support despite staunch government opposition.
The bill required a three fifths majority, 93 votes, and 116 deputies voted in favor, with 28 against and five abstentions. A number of the 71-strong ruling coalition bloc - including the president of one of its parties - voted in favor. 
The chamber erupted in cheers and clapping amid chants of ""no more AFP"" - a reference to the long-running campaign to tear up Chile's much-mimicked defined contribution Pension Funds Administrators (AFP) system that was introduced during the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship.
Cristobal Bellolio, a political scientist, said the bill represented Chile's ""Brexit moment"", a symbolic blow dealt to the establishment, against the advice of experts, by an angry populace emboldened by social protests last year against inequality and state policies including the AFP system.
President Sebastian Pinera has 30 days to decide whether to veto the bill, sign it into law or refer it to the Constitutional Court. 
The bill's swift passage and surprise transversal backing has caught Pinera's centre-right government on the back foot as it battles one of the world's worst outbreaks of the pandemic and faces potentially more of the fiery social protests over inequality that erupted in October last year as well as the drafting of a new constitution. 
Economists and ministers have said that withdrawing from pension funds will diminish already low average payouts and deliver a shock to stock, bond and currency markets. 

The bill's supporters say alternative support offered by government to millions of citizens left unemployed and impoverished by the pandemic was insufficient and bureaucratic.

Carlos Vecchio, whom Guaido named his ambassador to Washington after being recognized as Venezuela's rightful president by dozens of countries, said President Nicolas Maduro's government was ""getting nothing back"" from its shipments to Cuba.
Guaido, the speaker of the opposition-held National Assembly, argues Maduro's 2018 re-election was a sham. 
OPEC-member Venezuela, whose oil exports have been crippled by U.S. sanctions meant to pressure Maduro to resign, sent 14.1 million barrels of oil to Cuba between January and June, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and internal documents from state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela [PDVSA.UL], known as PDVSA. 
""Cuba doesn't need that amount of oil,"" Vecchio told reporters. ""Probably part of that will be resold."" 
Washington has sanctioned vessels that transport Venezuelan oil to Cuba, arguing in exchange Havana sends security and intelligence assistance to help prop up Maduro, who has overseen a six-year economic collapse.
Neither PDVSA nor Venezuela's oil ministry responded to requests for comment. Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet and blames sanctions for the country's woes. Late former President Hugo Chavez, Maduro's mentor, said the shipments were payment for Cuban doctors who provided health services in Venezuela.
The Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vecchio said the oil sent to Cuba should instead be given to an international organization like the United Nations or Red Cross in exchange for humanitarian goods, but said an Iraq-style oil-for-food program - which some Venezuelan politicians have called for - would likely not work with Maduro in power.

""We need to give those resources to international organizations to provide humanitarian assistance in an impartial manner,"" he said.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The amount of plastic waste flowing into the ocean and killing marine life could triple in the next 20 years, unless companies and governments can drastically reduce plastic production, a new study published on Thursday said.
Single-use plastic consumption has increased during the coronavirus pandemic, according to the International Solid Waste Association, an NGO. Face masks and latex gloves are washing up daily on Asia's remote beaches. Landfills worldwide are piled high with record amounts of takeaway food containers and online delivery packaging. 
The new research, produced by scientists and industry experts for The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ, offers solutions that could cut the projected volume of plastic entering the ocean by more than 80%. 
The roadmap for stemming the runaway ocean plastic waste crisis is among the most detailed ever offered in a study. 
If no action is taken, however, the amount of plastic going into the sea every year will rise from 11 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes, leaving a cumulative 600 million tonnes swilling in the ocean by 2040, the equivalent weight of 3 million blue whales, according to the study published in the journal Science.
“Plastic pollution is something that affects everyone. It isn’t a ‘your problem and not my problem’. It’s not one country’s problem. It’s everyone’s problem,” said Winnie Lau, senior manager at Pew and co-author of the study.
“It’s going to get worse if we don’t do anything.”
The strategy laid out in the report includes redirecting hundreds of billions of dollars in plastic production investment into alternative materials, recycling facilities and waste collection expansion in developing countries.
This would require a U-turn by the energy industry, which is rapidly building new chemical plants around the world to boost plastic output as its traditional fuel business is eroded by a rise in cleaner energy sources.
OIL AND SODA
The amount of plastic produced annually has been climbing fast since 1950, when global production totalled 2 million tonnes. In 2017, that number was 348 million tonnes, and is expected to double again by 2040, the study estimates.
Big plastic makers, including ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Dow and  Chevron  (NYSE:CVX) Phillips Chemical, have said they are committed to tackling plastic pollution, despite increasing production. The projects they fund focus on cleaning up waste.
The paper recommends, however, governments implement laws to discourage new plastic production and provide subsidies for reusable alternatives.
The plastic industry has lobbied against government bans on single-use plastic.
Some of the biggest buyers of plastic are consumer goods companies like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Nestle and Unilever (NYSE:UL). They have all made commitments to use a greater amount of recycled content in products in the future.
But current government and corporate commitments will only reduce the amount of plastic flowing into the ocean by 7 percent by 2040, the Pew and SYSTEMIQ study finds.
To cut the flow of ocean plastic by 80%, paper or compostable alternatives to single-use plastic would be needed and packaging should be redesigned to more than double the share of recyclable material, the study says.
Some criticised the study's inclusion of incineration, chemical recycling and plastic-to-fuel plants as ways to dispose of waste, saying these methods involve the release of climate-warming carbon emissions while also helping to sustain plastic production. 
Instead, ""we would be putting more emphasis on the need for reduction and stemming production of plastics,"" said Von Hernandez, global coordinator at Break Free From Plastic, an NGO.

""If industry were allowed to continue with their projections of growth up to 2050, which quadruples production during this time, most of the recommendations from this report will be meaningless.""

""What remains now is for the French authorities to proceed with the trial of Nicolás Zepeda,"" Segovia said in a statement.

Kurosaki's body has not been found. According to Chilean media reports, the couple met in late 2014 in Japan, where Zepeda was living as an exchange student.

KYIV (Reuters) - The family home of a prominent Ukrainian anti-corruption activist burned down in what his organization on Thursday called an assassination bid, demanding that President Volodymyr Zelenskiy investigate the incident personally.
Vitaliy Shabunin's house was hit by an explosion that triggered a fire, the non-governmental Anti-Corruption Action Center (AntAC) said in a statement. Shabunin, co-founder of the group, was not at home, while his parents managed to escape the night-time blaze. 
The fire prompted concern from Western diplomats who have pressed Ukraine to tackle entrenched corruption and clean up its justice system. 
Police opened a case of suspected intentional destruction or damage to property.
But AntAC, a frequent critic of government officials and prominent businessmen, demanded that Zelenskiy take ""personal control the cases of attacks on activists including (this) assassination attempt.""
Zelenskiy's spokeswoman declined immediate comment.
AntAC called the fire ""part of a campaign aimed at intimidating ANTAC, its team members and stopping our activities,"" including physical assault, fabricated criminal cases and smear campaigns. 
There have been high-profile attacks on anti-corruption activists in Ukraine. 
Shabunin said he suffered chemical burns in 2018 when an assailant threw green liquid in his face while he was demonstrating outside a prosecutor's office. 
In the same year, activist Kateryna Handziuk died after attackers poured sulphuric acid over her.
""Very disturbed by the news that (Shabunin's) house ...burned down,"" tweeted European Union ambassador Matti Maasikas. ""...Civil activists must feel safe to carry on their mission.""

British ambassador Melinda Simmons said in a tweet it was ""important to investigate properly this and any attack on anti-corruption activists and those responsible held to account.""

NICE, France (Reuters) - France's new interior minister sought on Thursday to project a tougher stance on security after a shooting this week in a suburb of the Riviera city of Nice, saying the country would not bow to criminal violence.
Gerald Darmanin, a close ally of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron in a government reshuffle this month as the French leader sought to show he is tackling law and order.
The minister traveled to Nice on Thursday to visit the Moulins district, where on Monday drug gangs clashed in broad daylight outside a supermarket, firing assault weapons after police arrests and a major drugs haul a week earlier. 
""Those who want to make the Republic bow down will pay the price,"" Darmanin told reporters, echoing a similar response by Sarkozy when he was interior minister almost 15 years ago.
Since taking office, Darmanin has repeatedly defended police action and has rushed to the scene of several criminal incidents.
Macron, who faces a presidential election in less than two years, has been criticised by opponents over crime and public safety since he took power in 2017 and opinion polls show that the public see his government as weakest on those issues.
Prime Minister Jean Castex, who will also go to Nice at the weekend, promised concrete measures after what he called ""unacceptable"" acts.
Some areas around some of France's biggest cities have become no-go zones for police after dark, officials, politicians and experts have said. Drugs and arms trafficking as well as prostitution blight many housing estates, officials and analysts have said. 
A spate of public safety incidents since the end of the COVID-19 lockdown in mid-May has put the government on heightened alert for crime rising amid the economic fallout from the pandemic.

Perceived government weakness on this could benefit the far-right National Rally, which is seen by supporters as tougher on such issues.

The fresh accusations come after the federal police accused Alckmin last week of allegedly receiving unregistered campaign funding. The state prosecutors' charges against Alckmin, a veteran of the Brazilian Social Democracy Party, still need to be reviewed by a judge.
A four-time governor of Brazil's richest state, Alckmin's last term ended in 2018, when he ran for president, failing to reach a second-round runoff, which was won by far-right populist President Jair Bolsonaro. 
Alckmin also ran for the presidency in 2006, when he lost in the second round to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of the leftist Workers Party.
Representatives for Alckmin did not respond to a request for comment. Last week, the former governor told CNN Brasil there were no irregularities in his campaigns, saying he had ""an absolutely calm conscience."" 

Since Bolsonaro's 2018 election victory, which shifted Brazilian politics sharply to the right, traditional centrist parties have struggled to make a mark. Their reputations have also suffered from years of graft scandals revealed by the corruption-busting Operation Car Wash, which jailed scores of political powerbrokers and business leaders.

Thursday's ruling came after the owners of a parlour offering intimate massages and a BDSM studio sought an injunction to overturn a city-wide ban on all sex work.
The court agreed that the risk of spreading the virus in a brothel was far higher, and that the applicants' businesses could reopen, provided they adhered to all sanitation rules, including the wearing of masks.
""In (their) case ... there is no especially close contact between the service provider and the client,"" the court said. 
""The service is strictly limited to contact by hand, ensuring greater distancing as a rule.""
Brothels were different for other reasons, the court added, including the fact that sex involved a dramatically elevated breathing rate, which increased the risk of spreading infection.
Last month, sex workers in the port of Hamburg demonstrated in protest against rules preventing them from working during the pandemic. The ban was discriminatory since other entertainment businesses had been allowed to reopen, they said.

Serbia does not recognise its former province Kosovo's 2008 declaration of independence. But the European Union has said it must do so as a precondition for talks on its future membership of the EU.
Talks between the two parties, mediated by Germany, France and European Union diplomats, have restarted this month after having broken down almost two years ago. [L8N2EH2XX] 
""We are very interested for the talks related to the status of Kosovo,"" Milorad Dodik, the Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, said at a news conference with Vucic in Banja Luka, the de facto capital of the Serb region in Bosnia.
""It must become a part of public discourse that it is impossible to talk about a special status of Kosovo without talking about a special status of Republika Srpska,"" said Dodik, a pro-Russian nationalist who has repeatedly called for the secession of the Serb region from Bosnia.
The 1990s Bosnian war in which more than 100,000 died was ended by the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace deal, dividing the country into the Serb-dominated Serb Republic and a Federation dominated by Bosniaks and Croats, which are linked via a weak central government.
Under the provisions of the Dayton peace accords, no region can unilaterally secede from Bosnia. 
Vucic, who maintains close ties with ethnic kin in Bosnia but always underlines Serbia's respect for Bosnia's territorial integrity, said his duty was to listen to his Serb brethren and help them in any way he could.
""Dayton is a sacred letter for us. We are a guarantor of the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement,"" said Vucic, who is under international pressure to normalise ties with Kosovo while facing protests against his own government at home.
He pledged 100 million euros to help the Serb Republic build a section of the road connecting the eastern town of Bijeljina with the Serbian border, and added that Serbia has considered to build an airport in the Bosnian southeastern town of Trebinje.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of the World Health Organization said on Thursday that reported comments by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo questioning his independence were untrue and would not distract the organisation from its work in fighting the coronavirus.
Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has come under criticism, especially from U.S. President Donald Trump and Pompeo, who have accused him of being pro-China.
""And the comments are untrue and unacceptable and without any foundation, for that matter,"" Tedros said in response to a question at a Geneva briefing about remarks by Pompeo reported in London on Tuesday.
""Our sole focus - and the focus of the entire organisation - is on saving lives.
""...And WHO will not be distracted by these comments. We don't want the international community also to be distracted.""
A WHO advance team has been in China for nearly two weeks, organising a WHO-led international mission to investigate the origins of the virus. Scientists believe it emerged in a food market in the central city of Wuhan late last year.
""We are already beginning to reach out to experts at the international level to see who will be available and most appropriate to be able to support an international mission in the coming weeks,"" Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, said.
Tedros said the WHO was seeing intense transmission of the coronavirus in relatively few countries.
""Two-thirds of all cases are from 10 countries. Almost half of all cases reported so far are from just three countries,"" he said, referring to the United States, Brazil and India.
Worldwide more than 15 million cases have been reported and nearly 620,000 deaths, he said.
Recorded U.S. coronavirus infections exceeded 4 million on Thursday, with more than 2,600 new ones every hour on average, the highest rate in the world, according to a Reuters tally.
Infections in the United States have rapidly accelerated since the first COVID-19 case was detected on Jan. 21. It took the country 98 days to reach 1 million cases. It took another 43 days to reach 2 million and then 27 days to reach 3 million.
It has only taken 16 days to reach 4 million at a rate of 43 new cases a minute.
Tedros said that just because cases may be at a low level where someone lives, it doesn't mean they should let down their guard.

New cases had slowed to a trickle in June, before a nationwide lockdown was lifted, but since then more than 280 clusters have been detected, with wealthy Catalonia the worst affected, leaving hotels largely empty and bars shutting down.
Health ministry data showed 2,615 new cases across Spain on Thursday, compared with a daily average of just 132 in June.
In Catalonia, nearly 8,000 cases were diagnosed in the last 14 days - almost half of the 16,410 detected throughout the country - despite guidelines for residents of regional capital Barcelona to stay at home. 
Murcia, in the south east of Spain, sealed off 30,000 people in the town of Totana on Thursday, barring anyone from entering or leaving after 55 cases linked to a bar were detected there. 
And, in a deepening spat between regional and central authorities, Madrid is pushing the central government to impose stricter controls on the city's Barajas airport after more than 70 passengers landed in the capital while infected.
Madrid authorities also urged citizens to wear a mask even at home, when they are with people they don't live with.
Promoting a similar message, the Canary Islands launched a graphic publicity campaign in which a family party turns into tragedy when the grandfather ends up lying unconscious on a hospital bed after contracting COVID-19.
""A simple family gathering can bring you as a present 40 days in a coma, or even death,"" the slogan reads.
Failing to bring the epidemic under control could spell disaster for Spain's tourism sector, which accounts for some 12% of economic output and has begun a tentative reopening after hotel occupancy more than halved in the first six months of the year.
Since France's prime minister failed to rule out closing the border with Spain, the focus is now on what other European countries could do.
Norway's government is set to decide on Friday whether to impose a 10-day quarantine on people travelling back from high-risk countries, after warning that Spain might be included on that list.

Although infections are on the rise in Spain, officials point out that the majority are asymptomatic and the death rate remains well below the peak, partly because new cases are more concentrated among younger people.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Holding up messages on their tablets and waving their cellphone torches, hundreds of young protesters rallied on Thursday to demand the Thai the government resign and dissolve parliament, defying a coronavirus ban on gatherings.
A network of student groups called ""Free Youth"" joined forces on the outskirts of Bangkok, voicing a raft of complaints against the year-old civilian government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief who ousted an elected government six years ago.
""We are here to call for a new constitution. Because the current constitution doesn't support our rights and freedom. It was inherited from the military coup in 2014,"" student protester Thanachai Aurlucha, 25, said.
A student who identified herself with the nickname Fufu, 22, said the government had failed to boost the economy. ""We're about to graduate but we don't know how we will make a living. If I don't come out today, there will be no future."" 
A protester calling himself Ron, 39, said: ""I want to call for true democracy in Thailand."" Both declined to give their real names.
Despite officers warning the rally was unlawful for breaking the coronavirus ban, there was no visible police presence near the night-time gathering in which many held three fingers in the air in what has become a symbol of the protests.
Similar protests took place in four other provinces -- Ayutthaya, Khon Kaen, Sakon Nakhon and Pattani. Youths are also planning gatherings in Bangkok and other provinces at the weekend.
The rallies followed a protest in Bangkok on Saturday of about 2,500 people, in one of the biggest street demonstrations since the 2014 coup that ousted the last elected administration.
Public opposition to Prayuth has been growing in recent months. Since last year's election, a court has dissolved the second-largest opposition party, giving his ruling coalition a firmer grip on parliament. 
Thailand is to extend a state of emergency until the end of August but the National Security Council said the decree would be used only to contain virus outbreaks and not rallies. So far, there have been no arrests at the protests.

The outbreak was one of several surges of infections in the central European country of 10.7 million people. 
Public health officials have brought back restrictions on public activities in some areas including the industrial north-eastern region that is home to 10% of the population. 
The country reported 247 new cases on Wednesday, the highest number since a spike in late June, prompting Prime Minister Andrej Babis to say that face masks may be made obligatory again in selected indoor spaces.
Authorities suspect one woman with no symptoms was the source of the infection at a July 11 birthday party at the downtown Prague Techtle Mechtle club.
The Prague Public Health Authority said 68 visitors to the club, seven employees and 23 family members and contacts have tested positive. Another 273 others have been put in quarantine.
Following media reports that some of the visitors got infected by sharing a drink with one straw, hygienists urged people to keep social distancing.
""The Prague Public Health Authority emphatically recommends that everyone consumes their drink solely from their own glass and avoids consumption from a common container,"" it said in a statement.
Despite the growth in daily cases in the past several weeks to Wednesday's total of 14,570, the number of those hospitalised has grown only slightly to 141, just one third of the number during a peak in April. 
The country has reported 364 deaths from the disease caused by the coronavirus, a fraction of the toll in more severely hit west European nations.
The public health service did not name the sports clubs affected by the nightclub outbreak, but major soccer clubs Sparta Prague, Bohemians 1905 and Dukla Prague have said they had infections in their reserve or junior teams.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian on Tuesday said the situation for Uighur Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang was unacceptable, asking that the Chinese authorities allow independent observers to enter the region.
He said Paris was not only basing its position on testimonies relayed by rights groups, but that it drew its conclusions from its own sources that there were imprisonment camps for Uighurs, mass detentions, disappearances, forced labour, forced sterilisations and the destruction of the Uighur heritage.
The comments drew a rebuttal in China on Wednesday with its foreign ministry spokesman describing the claims as lies.
Le Drian said on Wednesday his position remained unchanged despite the Chinese reaction and that if Beijing wanted to avoid criticism the right thing to do would be to allow observers into Xinjiang.
In response, the Chinese embassy on Thursday published a long defence of its policy in Xinjiang on its website, denying the claims and saying French politicians were being misled. 
""Recently, some American, Australian and British politicians and a few so-called Western 'human rights organisations' have launched a new campaign of slander against China's Xinjiang,"" the embassy spokesman wrote.
""Driven by political ends, they fabricated a whole series of sensational lies which touched public opinion and even misled certain politicians in France."" 
The text dismissed as ""absurd"" reports of Xinjiang having established internment or re-education camps in which a million Uighurs were held.
""The reality is that the vocational education and training centres set up in Xinjiang under the law, and which are similar to de-radicalisation centres in France and other countries, are a useful counter-terrorism and de-radicalisation measure,"" the spokesman said.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said brothers Santiago Jose Moron Hernandez and Ricardo Jose Moron Hernandez, members of a family of ""trusted partners"" of Maduro and his son, help distribute assets for the Venezuelan president and his family.
The Treasury also said that the two brothers are central figures in Venezuela's gold industry and oversee the financial mechanism of an illicit gold scheme involving the Venezuelan president's son, also named Nicolas Maduro, who has previously been blacklisted by Washington.
Thursday's action freezes any U.S. assets of the brothers and generally prohibits Americans from doing business with them.
""The United States is committed to targeting individuals who facilitate and enable this corrupt regime as they continue to ignore the welfare of the Venezuelan people,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said.
The United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president, regarding Maduro’s 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country’s military and by Russia, China and Cuba.

""We stand firmly against any attempts by Russia to rewrite history in order to justify the 1940 occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote in a joint statement with the foreign ministers of the three Baltic countries.
The statement marked the 80th anniversary of a 1940 declaration by then-acting U.S. Secretary of State Sumner Welles condemning the Soviet takeover of the three countries.
The Estonian Foreign Affairs ministry said on Thursday it had summoned the Russian ambassador to protest ""recent statements seeking to portray the occupation of Estonia and its annexation to the Soviet Union as legitimate.""
""Russia is trying to give the impression that legitimacy can be born at the threat of a weapon, repression by mutual agreement - this is extremely cynical,"" Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said in a statement.
Putin wrote last month that incorporating Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia into the Soviet Union ""was implemented on a contractual basis, with the consent of the elected authorities.""
""This was in line with international and state law of that time"", he added in the article for U.S. magazine The National Interest.
The European Union and NATO have accused Russia of waging a campaign of disinformation to try to destabilise the West by exploiting divisions in society. Russia denies any such tactics.
The European Commission said in January it would not tolerate the distortion of historic facts after Putin suggested Poland shared responsibility for starting World War Two because it connived in Nazi German plans in 1938 to dismember Czechoslovakia.
Polish President Andrzej Duda accused Putin of ""historical lies"".
In 1989, during the period of glasnost, or openness, under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Moscow denounced the secret 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact to carve up Poland and the Baltic states which allowed the Soviet Union to annex the region.

Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia all won independence from the Soviet Union as it collapsed and now are members of both the EU and NATO.

With tourism accounting for around 12% of Spain's economy, the 33% average occupancy rate of hotels from January to June - compared with 73% during the same period last year - was especially damaging. 
An increase in domestic tourism as the lockdown eased has brought some relief, but with hotels slashing room rates to attract holidaymakers, the road to a more permanent recovery could take longer, said consulting firm Cushman & Wakefield and hotel benchmarking specialist STR, which conducted the study.
""Local holidaymakers' demand, especially during weekends, is the first step towards recuperation,"" said Javier Serrano of STR. ""The sector is moving in the right direction to begin a recovery which will inevitably be slow."" 
The northeastern region of Catalonia, a leading tourist hotspot, saw hotel occupancy dive 58% in Barcelona, while the capital Madrid lost 46% of its 2019 levels.
Hotels in the Balearic Islands, a popular destination for German and British tourists, suffered the steepest drain on their visitors, losing 65.6% occupancy in the period despite having been spared the worst of the coronavirus outbreak.
The pandemic has hit the world's second-most visited country hard, with 28,424 deaths so far. 

On Wednesday, Spain's Hospitality Industry Association said some 40,000 bars and restaurants had already shut down permanently as a result of the pandemic.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday threatened to expel foreign journalists whom he accused of inciting protests against him ahead of an August election, urging them to focus on the harvest instead. 
The 65-year-old former Soviet collective farm boss faces the biggest challenge in years to his iron-fisted rule of the eastern European country, as anger swells over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the economy and human rights. 
Two of his main election rivals have been jailed and another disqualified from standing against him at the Aug. 9 election, prompting the opposition to rally around the wife of one of the candidates standing in her husband's place.
""They are calling for riots. Why do you tolerate this?"" Lukashenko said at a government meeting, accusing the media of organising the protests and hurling ""insult after insult"". 
""There is no need to wait for any end of the electoral campaign. Expel from here if they do not comply with our laws and call people to the Maidans.""
Lukashenko has accused the opposition protesters of trying to overthrow him in the same way as the Russian-backed President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich was toppled by the Maidan street protests in 2014. 
He urged journalists to focus their coverage elsewhere.
""Let them go into the field where there is really a battle going on today, a struggle for the harvest,"" he said. 
They should ""take a picture of a combine harvester. Tell us about these ordinary people - hard workers who feed the country. They'll all run to the shops tomorrow, these hacks, to buy a piece of bread for themselves, relatives, friends, children.""
Hundreds of people were detained by police last week after the central election commission refused to register some opposition candidates, all but ensuring victory for Lukashenko, in power for 26 years.

Human rights activists say more than 1,100 people, including journalists, have been detained in a widening crackdown since the start of the election campaign.

Jacob Ngarivhume, who called for the July 31 street demonstrations with support from the main opposition party, was arrested together with freelance journalist Hopewell Chin'ono and charged with inciting the public to commit violence.
A magistrate said if released, Ngarivhume would continue to promote violent protests and urge the public to break a coronavirus lockdown. He will remain in prison detention until a routine court appearance next month.
Another magistrate separately deferred the bail hearing for Chin'ono to Friday. 
Businesses and courts close at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT) in Zimbabwe after a dawn-to-dusk curfew that came into effect on Wednesday to curb the COVID-19 crisis. 
Ngarivhume's lawyer said he would appeal the ruling at the High Court. The two men face up to 10 years jail if convicted. 
Critics say the duo is being persecuted for speaking out against corruption in government.

As European governments seek to open their economies after months of lockdowns, national authorities broadly acknowledge that masks or other face coverings can help limit the spread of the coronavirus. 
Here is an overview of regulations in place in the region's largest economies:
GERMANY - The rules are set state by state, but coverings are mandatory in shops and public transportation nationwide. In some states there are fines for not wearing them, in others not.
FRANCE - Mask-wearing is now compulsory in all enclosed spaces after a resurgence of cases. Some towns with lots of tourists have also opted to make masks mandatory in the busiest areas outdoors.
ITALY - Masks are always mandatory in closed public spaces, including on public transport, and whenever it is impossible to maintain social distancing outdoors. Regions can impose stricter rules if necessary. 
NETHERLANDS - Masks are mandatory on public transportation including at airports, and are not required otherwise. 
SPAIN - Masks are mandatory everywhere outside the home in Spain except - for now - in Madrid and the Canary islands. In those two regions, masks are not compulsory if you are outdoors and can keep a 1.5-metre distance from others.
POLAND -People must wear masks in public indoor spaces if they are unable to maintain a distance of at least 2 metres from others.
GREECE - Mask-wearing is mandatory on public transport, for frontline workers, and for anyone visiting a supermarket. In Cyprus frontline workers have to wear a mask. 

SWEDEN - Face masks remain a rare sight. There are no rules or recommendations regarding face masks with the public health agency favouring social distancing and saying studies are inconclusive regarding their benefits.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - When Yunus Genc prays at Hagia Sophia on Friday it will mark the triumphant culmination of decades-long efforts by Islamist-rooted groups like his to convert the ancient monument, revered by both Christians and Muslims, to a mosque. 
Genc's Anatolian Youth Association (AGD) held protests and organized prayers outside the 1,500-year-old Hagia Sophia, while another group waged a series of failed legal campaigns until a top Turkish court last month finally ruled in their favor, annulling its status as a museum.
President Tayyip Erdogan immediately declared the building - a Christian Byzantine cathedral for 900 years before it was seized by Ottoman conquerors and served as a mosque until 1934 - a mosque once more, with first prayers to be held this Friday. 
The decisions unleashed a torrent of criticism from church leaders, who said the conversion to exclusively Muslim worship risked deepening religious divisions. Turkey says the site will remain open for visitors and its Christian artworks protected. 
""We struggled for this for years,"" Genc said in front of the mosque, whose huge gray dome and rose-coloured walls and buttresses have marked the city skyline for a millennium and a half, joined later by four towering minarets. 
""Hagia Sophia is a symbol and we, like all Muslims, wanted it opened as a mosque...When Sultan Mehmet the Conqueror came to Istanbul he bought Hagia Sophia with his own money as a symbol of the conquest, endowed it and wanted it to be a mosque.""
Genc's AGD group is an offshoot of a movement founded by Turkey's first Islamist prime minister Necmettin Erbakan, whose political party was a forerunner of the AK Party which has ruled Turkey under Erdogan's leadership for 17 years. 
In that time Erdogan has reshaped Turkey's modern republic, established nearly a century ago by the staunchly secularist Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, lifting a ban on Muslim headscarves in public, promoting religious education and taming Turkey's powerful military, once a bastion of Ataturk's secular values.
Amid the chaos and uprisings which shook the Middle East since 2011, Erdogan also sought to position Turkey as a regional power and champion of Sunni Muslims. The Hagia Sophia move was a sign toward ""achieving freedom"" for al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem, Erdogan said earlier this month. 
ICONS COVERED
Erdogan, a pious Muslim, threw his weight behind the campaign to convert Hagia Sophia before local elections last year which dealt a painful blow to his ruling AK Party. Officials say the move addresses a deep-rooted wish within the country.
""The decision to turn the Hagia Sophia museum into a mosque is based on a long-standing demand by the vast majority of the Turkish people,"" presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said. ""We believe it makes more sense to use it... as a house of worship.""
He said under Erdogan's rule, churches and synagogues serving Turkey's minority Christian and Jewish communities had also been built, or rebuilt. 
In Hagia Sophia, the Christian frescoes and the glittering mosaics adorning the cavernous dome and central hall will be concealed by curtains during Muslim prayer times, but remain on display for the rest of the time. 
""That's part of the Islamic legal tradition, just like the Jewish tradition where you are not supposed to have many descriptions and paintings, while you're praying,"" Kalin said. 
""They will be covered during prayer times, and other times they will be open to everyone,"" he told Reuters. Icons and artwork in the building's upper floors and side galleries would remain uncovered, he added.

Pictures from inside Hagia Sophia this week have shown a large carpet being laid on the floor in preparation for the prayers.

LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain and the European Union clashed on Thursday over the chances of securing a free trade agreement, with Brussels deeming it ""unlikely"" but London holding out hope one could be reached in September.
Since Britain left the bloc in January, talks on the trade agreement and other future ties have all but stalled, with each side accusing the other of failing to compromise before a transition period runs out at the end of this year.
Those accusations grew louder after the latest round, with the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier saying London had shown no willingness to break the deadlock and his British counterpart David Frost describing the bloc's proposals as failing to meet the government's demand to be treated as an independent country.
But both sides agreed on one thing: there had been no movement on the main stumbling blocks to a deal on fair competition guarantees - the so-called level playing field - or on fisheries.
Without a deal to govern future trade flows, some companies fear costly disruption and confusion at the border from next year, which would hit at a time when many are already struggling with the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
""By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement - at this point - unlikely,"" Barnier told a news conference after the face to face talks in London.
""The time for answers is quickly running out,"" he said. ""If we do not reach an agreement on our future partnership, there will be more friction.""
""AREAS OF CONVERGENCE"" 
Frost was equally blunt, saying ""considerable gaps"" remained but he added: ""Despite all the difficulties, on the basis of the work we have done in July, my assessment is that agreement can still be reached in September, and that we should continue to negotiate with this aim in mind.""
Senior EU officials say they only expect possible breakthroughs by the end of August or in September, but some have also expressed concerns that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson might go for a no-deal split.
Both sides say they want to secure a trade deal before the end of the status-quo transition, and while being unable to breach the gap in positions on fisheries and competition, both Barnier and Frost noted some progress in other areas.
""Looking forward, there are large areas of convergence in many of the areas on which we are negotiating and ample precedents and texts on which we can base our work,"" said Frost.
Barnier also noted some progress this week on how to settle any future disputes over a new EU-UK agreement, an element he has regularly mentioned as another key stumbling block.
But he added that the EU would not seal an agreement that would damage its fishing industry and that the sides were still ""far away"" from each other with only a few weeks left to go.
Both negotiators seemed to agree a deal could be reached but only if the other side budged. One senior UK official described the negotiations as being equally close to a breakthrough or a breakdown.

""Obviously we must prepare for every outcome and it is possible that we won't reach an agreement, but we're going to work very energetically to try to do so,"" Frost said.

Bosnia is set to hold local elections on Oct. 15 if the national parliament passes the 2020 budget under which funding for the vote should be provided.
Mostar, where failure by the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslims) and Croat ruling parties to enforce a 2010 constitutional court decision on power-sharing had blocked the election of city councillors for the decade, was originally exempted from the vote. 
But a last-minute political deal, agreed under international mediation in June and passed in parliament last week, has enabled the state election commission to set the vote in Mostar for Dec. 20, commission head Zeljko Balakar said.
The deadlock in Mostar, famous for its Ottoman-era Old Bridge but divided between Bosniaks and Croats since the end of Bosnia's 1992-95 war, stems from the distrust between the two groups. 
The Bosniaks, who are the minority in Mostar, want safeguards to make sure they are not out-voted. The Croats, in the majority, want the town unified.
Bakalar said that 35 city councillors would be elected under new election rules for Mostar.

The king, who has ruled the world's largest oil exporter and close U.S. ally since 2015, will stay in hospital for some time to receive treatment, SPA reported.
King Salman, the custodian of Islam's holiest sites, was admitted to hospital in the capital Riyadh, suffering from inflammation of the gallbladder on Monday.
He has since chaired a cabinet meeting via video call from hospital in the capital Riyadh on Tuesday and could be seen in a video behind a desk, reading and leafing through documents.
King Salman was crown prince and deputy premier for over 2-1/2 years from June 2012 before becoming king. He also served as governor of the Riyadh region for more than 50 years.
Suaid Arabia's de facto ruler and next in line to the throne is the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is widely referred to as MbS and has launched reforms to diversify its oil-dependent economy.
The 34-year-old prince, who is popular among many young Saudis, has won praise at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom, giving more rights to women and pledging to diversify the economy.
To the king's supporters, this boldness at home and abroad was a welcome change after decades of caution, stagnation and dithering.
But state control of the media and a crackdown on dissent make it difficult to gauge the extent of domestic enthusiasm.
The crown prince's reforms have been accompanied by a purge of top royals and businessmen on charges of corruption, and a costly war in Yemen, which have all unnerved some Western allies and investors.
His prestige also suffered a blow after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the hands of Saudi security personnel seen as close to him.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's biggest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform(PO), said on Thursday it had petitioned the Supreme Court to declare the recent presidential election unfair to trigger an annulment and re-run. 
The nationalist incumbent Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, won the July 12 vote against PO candidate Rafal Trzaskowski by 51% to 49%.
But the opposition believes the government broke rules by too much campaign participation from the state administration and public broadcaster TVP, said PO spokesman Jan Grabiec. 
""The scale was comparable to campaigning in Belarus and Russia,"" he told Reuters, confirming the legal challenge.
Supreme Court spokeswoman Martyna Luczak said the PO's complaint had arrived, among ""more than 5,800 other protests"" from voters. ""It is registered but no date for court sitting regarding this protest was set yet,"" she said.
The government denies any electoral wrongdoing.
But European election watchdog - the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) - has said TVP was used as a campaign tool for Duda in a misuse of public resources.
His victory reinforced the government's mandate to pursue reforms of the judiciary and media which the European Commission says subvert democratic standards. The PiS has changed the structure of the Supreme Court so judges appointed under its rule will decide on the validity of elections.
Separately, Grabiec said his party believed secret services had wiretapped and monitored email of PO politician Slawomir Nowak. ""We want to know if any of the material gathered ... had been shared with the Duda campaign team,"" Grabiec said. 
Nowak was arrested on Wednesday on corruption charges, according to state news agency PAP. He denies any wrongdoing and the PO calls the arrest politically motivated.
Government spokesman Piotr Muller said criticism of the vote and wiretapping allegations were the unfounded claims of a bad loser. ""These are, unfortunately, examples of how difficult it is for Rafal Trzaskowski's staff to accept defeat,"" he told public radio.

Duda ran an acrimonious campaign laced with homophobic language, attacks on private media and accusations that Trzaskowski serves foreign interests.

Spain already has Europe's strictest rules on masks. In Madrid they are mandatory everywhere in public unless people are outdoors and can keep a 1.5 meter distance. In most of the country, they must be worn in public regardless of safe distances, but with no rules on wearing them at home. 
""We recommend, as a precaution, the wearing of masks in private spaces when there are meetings or gatherings of people who don't live together,"" Enrique Ruiz Escudero, the health chief of the Madrid region, told a news conference.

Madrid was one of the hardest-hit regions at the peak of the pandemic, but has over the past weeks reported far fewer cases than Catalonia and Aragon, where most of the new clusters have been reported.

With some polls suggesting a slim majority of people in Scotland now support independence from the rest of the United Kingdom, Johnson was keen to press the case for the whole country working together to tackle the coronavirus and economic crisis.
The pandemic and Brexit have badly strained the ties that bind the kingdom's constituent parts - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland's pro-independence government opposes leaving the European Union and accuses Johnson of mistakes in responding to COVID-19.
""The union is a fantastically strong institution, it's helped our country through thick and thin. It's very, very valuable in terms of the support we've been able to give everybody throughout all corners of the UK,"" Johnson told reporters after arriving in Orkney, an island group off the northern coast of Scotland.
Asked whether there was a growing case for a new independence referendum after Scotland voted in favour of the union in 2014, Johnson said: ""We had a referendum in 2014. It was decisive - it was, I think, by common consent, a once in a generation event.""
While in Scotland, Johnson will meet businesses and members of the military, marking a year since he took office by reaffirming a commitment to increase opportunity and prosperity for all parts of Britain.
Johnson will also thank members of the armed forces for their coronavirus response, which included setting up testing sites and transferring patients.
But he will also warn that the coronavirus crisis is by no means over, saying ""we've got to be very, very vigilant as we go forward into the colder months"".
The Scottish National Party, which runs the semi-autonomous government in Scotland, has accused Johnson of muddled messaging on coronavirus and implemented its own lockdown strategy independently of London.
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who was not expected to meet Johnson, said she welcomed the prime minister.
""One of the key arguments for independence is the ability of Scotland to take our own decisions, rather than having our future decided by politicians we didn't vote for, taking us down a path we haven't chosen,"" she said on Twitter.

Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin, speaking at a daily media briefing, described the U.S. allegations as ""malicious slander"". 
""In response to the U.S.'s unreasonable actions, China must make a necessary response and safeguard its legitimate rights,"" he said, declining to specify any measures.
""This is tearing down the friendly bridge between the people of China and the U.S.,"" he added.
The South China Morning Post reported that China may close the U.S. consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu, while a source told Reuters on Wednesday that China was considering shutting the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, where the United States withdrew staff at the start of the coronavirus outbreak. 
Hu Xijin, editor the Global Times, a tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, wrote that shutting the Wuhan consulate would be insufficiently disruptive. 
Hu said the United States had a large consulate in Hong Kong and it was ""too obvious that the consulate is an intelligence centre"".
""Even if China doesn't close it, it could instead cut its staff to one or two hundred. This will make Washington suffer much pain,"" he wrote.
The other U.S. consulates in China are in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Shenyang.
ELECTION 'GAMBIT'
U.S.-China ties have deteriorated sharply this year over issues ranging from the coronavirus and telecoms-gear maker Huawei to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its clampdown on Hong Kong.
Separately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has alleged in U.S. court filings that a Chinese researcher accused of visa fraud and concealing ties to the military was now holed up in China's consulate in San Francisco. 
Other Chinese researchers at U.S. universities have also been arrested for visa fraud, according to U.S. court filings.
Wang said China would safeguard its citizens.
""For some time, the U.S. has held ideological bias to continuously surveil, harass and even arbitrarily detain Chinese students and scholars in the U.S.,"" he said.
""We urge the U.S. to stop using any excuse to restrict, harass or oppress Chinese students and researchers in the U.S.""
Chinese state media editorials criticised the U.S. order to shut the Houston consulate as an attempt to blame Beijing for U.S. failures ahead of the November presidential election.
Polls show President Donald Trump trailing his challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, ahead of the Nov. 3 election as the worsening coronavirus crisis exacts a deep toll on the U.S. economy.
The official China Daily described the closure of the consulate as ""a new gambit in the U.S. administration's bid to paint China as a malevolent actor on the world stage, and thus make it an outlaw to the international community"".
""The move shows that lagging behind his presidential election opponent in the polls ... the U.S. leader is going all out in his attempts to portray China as an agent of evil,"" it said.

Infection rates in France are subsiding, but officials this week made the wearing of masks in enclosed public spaces compulsory after a series of localised flare-ups. To date COVID-19 has killed over 30,000 people in France. 
Early studies by scientists in The Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere suggest sewage sampling for signs of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could help estimate the number of infections in a geographic area, without having to test every person.
Laurent Moulin, who heads the research laboratory run by public water utility company Eau de Paris, cautioned the findings on their own did not mean a resurgence of the virus in the population since France eased its lockdown restrictions.
But, said Moulin, when used in conjunction with other data it can be a useful early warning sign of the virus spreading, even before people feel sick enough to seek medical help.
""We had the lockdown, which reduced the number of sick people, and then a little while later we saw a reduction of the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in the waste water,"" Moulin said, referring to the strain of virus behind the COVID-19 epidemic.
""What are we seeing since the end of June? We've seen some locations that were negative (for virus traces) and are becoming positive,"" he said. 
Infection rates in Paris are declining in line with the national trend.
Workers at a sewage plant in Noisy-le-Grand, on the eastern edge of Paris, fill plastic bottles with waste water and put them in a cool box. These are then ferried to the laboratory, on the southern outskirts of the city, where researchers in biohazard suits and masks analyse them.
The sampling of waste water detects coronavirus genomes, fragments of the virus's genetic material which are not infectious and can be emitted by people not displaying symptoms. 
Moulin said the evidence his teams gather from the sewage system would feed into models that are being used to analyse the progression of the virus.

Researchers in Paris posted findings in April that showed how sampling wastewater in the city for a month tracked the same curve of the rising and falling epidemic there.

Lawmaker Geert Wilders, whose anti-Islam Freedom Party is the second largest in Dutch parliament, lives under police protection because of death threats. He said in an email that he rarely sent private messages via Twitter but that he had received many over the course of years from supporters in countries including Iran, Saudi Arabia and Syria.
""My Twitter account was not only hacked for some days and the hacker also posted tweets on my account and sent direct messages in my name, but indeed got full access to my DMs, which of course is unacceptable in many ways,"" he said.
He said he had deleted some but not all such messages and did not know whether dissidents' identities had been revealed.
""I do hope they will not be in danger if their identity would be exposed because of this hack,"" he said.
Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It said on Wednesday that the hackers had likely seen private messages of 36 accounts, including one belonging to an ""elected official in the Netherlands"" 

The company previously said the attackers tweeted from 45 ""verified"" accounts, including those belonging to such well-known names as CEOs Elon Musk and Bill Gates and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.

CHIRIKOT SECTOR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's military this week said there had been an escalation in firing and shelling across the de facto border that separates Pakistani and Indian-controlled Kashmir, at a time of heightened diplomatic tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Major General Amer Ahsan Nawaz, the commander of Pakistani troops in Kashmir, accused the Indian military of trying to distract attention from unrest in its part of Kashmir.
""If you compare it to the past years, there is a definite increase in this year,"" he told reporters on Wednesday near the so-called Line of Control (Loc), across which the two sides' militaries have faced off for decades.
The Muslim-majority Himalayan region has been at the heart of more than 70 years of animosity since the partition of British-ruled India into Muslim Pakistan and majority Hindu India in 1947. Two of the three wars they have fought since have been over Kashmir.
Pakistan's military said that in 2019, when ceasefire violations hit a more than decade-high peak, there were just over 3,500 incidents. Already in 2020 there have been almost 1,800 violations, the Pakistan military said, adding that the surge during the more volatile summer season since June had been more pronounced than in previous years.
Indian army spokesman Colonel Aman Anand rejected Pakistan's allegations, saying Pakistan's military had violated the ceasefire on more than 2,500 occasions this year.
Tensions were exacerbated last year when India revoked the autonomy of its portion of Kashmir. In recent months the diplomatic relationship has worsened further as Delhi and Islamabad each ejected half of its neighbour's diplomats.
On Pakistan's side of Kashmir, which is relatively heavily populated close to the LoC, locals said that shelling or firing was becoming a near-daily occurrence. 
""It can start any time day or night,"" said Malik Mohammad Ayub, a local deputy commissioner, who said around four civilians were killed and 13 wounded in his district since he took the job four months ago.
Faiza Shabbir, 12, said she and her sisters had been afraid when shelling began in their area earlier this month.

""Firing was going on, so we hid in our house, then a shell hit our roof. Three of us sisters and our grandmother were injured,"" she said, adding that had spent four days in hospital being treated for shrapnel wounds.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Presidents from five West African countries arrive in Mali on Thursday to try to negotiate an end to a political crisis that has rocked the country and raised fears it could undermine a regional fight against Islamist militants. 
Infuriated by corruption, disputed local election results and army losses to jihadists, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets, sparking clashes with police in which the United Nations says at least 14 protesters have died this month. 
The opposition, a group called M5-RFP whose figurehead is Saudi-trained Muslim cleric Mahmoud Dicko, has said it will not quit until President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita steps down, raising concerns in neighbouring countries of a protracted crisis.
""M5-RFP demands the resignation of Keita or the satisfaction of our demands,"" which include the establishment of a committee of inquiry into civilian deaths and a transitional government, the group's spokeman Nouhoum Togo told Reuters on Thursday.
The leaders of Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana and Niger will meet with Keita and then Dicko and other opposition leaders at a hotel in the capital Bamako, according to the mission schedule. 
The leaders are expected to make a statement before departing early in the evening. 
They are acutely aware of the danger a destabilised Mali poses. The landlocked, semi-desert state has been used as a launch pad for groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State to attack neighbouring countries including Niger and Burkina Faso. 
Still, reaching a solution in such a short space of time will not be easy. Public opposition to Keita hardened after protesters were killed by police in early July. 

The M5-RFP rejected mediation measures proposed by a mission from the West African ECOWAS bloc last week, prompting the presidential mission.

What have you got? A pandemic precaution, yes, but also a luxury fashion statement that can cost anywhere from 75 to 160 euros ($87-185).
As mask-wearing becomes part of everyday defences against the coronavirus, Belgian designers are turning medical masks into chic accessories.
Brussels-based stylist Aude De Wolf has created a ""scarf mask"" that uses linen, cashmere and other high-quality materials to combine masks with luxurious shawls. 
""I was inspired by my mother because she doesn't like her neck,"" De Wolf, who has already sewn some 1,500 free medical masks for hospitals, told Reuters from her workshop. 
""You can slip the mask off when you're in the car and slip it back on in the shops ... You could say it's a luxury product,"" she said of the masks, which she is selling for 160 euros ($185) each.
Haut-couture garment and accessory maker Olivia Hainaut has turned her skills to creating masks with sequins, jewels and other flamboyant touches, such as silk flowers. They sell from 75 euros, depending on the work and materials involved. 
""These are not masks for everyday wear, perhaps for a party or a wedding ... the idea is to bring some joy to something that is very sad,"" she said of the pandemic.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - France told Lebanon on Thursday it had no alternative to an IMF programme as it wrestles with an acute financial crisis and Beirut must enact reforms urgently if it is to win international support.
""Help us to help you is the message of my visit,"" Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said after meeting Lebanese leaders in Beirut, adding that Paris stood ready to mobilise support but there must be concrete action on reform.
The financial crisis, rooted in decades of state corruption and waste, marks the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-90 civil war. A collapsing currency has led to soaring inflation and poverty and savers have lost free access to accounts in a paralysed banking system.
Former colonial ruler France has led international efforts to get Lebanon to reform, hosting a donor meeting in 2018 when more than $11 billion was pledged for infrastructure investment contingent on reforms which were promised but not delivered.
Lebanon began talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in May but these have been put on hold in the absence of reforms and as differences arose between the government, the banking sector and politicians over the scale of vast financial losses in the system.
One area donors want to see progress is in fixing the state-owned electricity grid which bleeds up to $2 billion a year in public funds while failing to meet the country's power needs. 
Le Drian said actions in the power sector so far were not encouraging.
Lebanon, with one of the highest public debt burdens in the world, defaulted on its foreign currency sovereign debt in March, citing critically low reserves. The Lebanese pound has lost some 80% of its value since October.

Le Drian also said it was essential for Lebanon to respect a policy of staying out of conflicts in the region, where the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah has supported Iran in its power struggle with Sunni-led Gulf Arab states.

Starting from January 2021, those in Hong Kong with such status would be able to apply for special visas to live in Britain that could eventually confer citizenship, interior minister Priti Patel said this week.
However, China opposes such a policy as interfering in domestic affairs, a spokesman for its foreign ministry said, calling the move a flagrant violation of Britain's promises, international law and principles of international relations.
""As the English side is the first to violate the promise, China will consider not recognising BNO passports as a valid travel document, and reserves the right to take further measures,"" the spokesman, Wang Wenbin, told a news briefing. 
Even before Britain's offer, China did not recognise such passports as a valid document for mainland entry by residents of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Instead, it required them to use travel permits issued by China.
London's decision, which could allow nearly three million Hong Kong residents to settle in Britain, came after Beijing imposed a new security law that democracy activists fear would end the freedoms promised to the territory in 1997.
In a statement, the British consulate in Hong Kong said the immigration route granting the right to live, work or study in Britain was offered following the Chinese government's decision to impose the new national security law.
Britain says the law breaches the terms of the handover treaty agreed in 1984. China accuses Britain of interfering in Hong Kong and Chinese affairs. 

""The Chinese side urges the British side to recognise the reality that Hong Kong has returned to China, to look at the Hong Kong national security law objectively and immediately correct its mistakes,"" China's embassy in London said in a statement on Thursday.

319,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 06:46AM ET</span>","With no Brits, cash-strapped Algarve fights for survival","By Catarina Demony
VILAMOURA, Portugal (Reuters) - In his near-empty pub in the Algarve in southern Portugal, Samuel Tilley is fuming that coronavirus regulations in his home country Britain are keeping tourists away, further jeopardizing an already gloomy summer season.
Usually packed with tourists at this time of the year, Vilamoura is quiet, leaving bar staff at Tilley's O'Neills pub without much to do but brood over Britain's decision to leave Portugal off a list of more than 50 countries safe enough for travel without restrictions.
""It was very shocking. I don't believe there's any logic behind it,"" Tilley said, while keeping an eye out for the rare thirsty customer walking in to have a refreshing pint by the harbour.
""There are some wonderful people here in the Algarve and beyond and I feel this decision by the British government really hurt them.""
Portugal initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic but a persistent count of several hundred new cases per day concentrated in and around Lisbon in the past two months has worried authorities at home and abroad, leading Britain and other European nations to impose restrictions on travel from the southern European nation. 
Last year, Portugal welcomed about 2 million Britons, with 64% of them heading to the sunny Algarve, famed for its sandy beaches and golf courses. So far in 2020, only 92,000 Britons have made it the region. 
Sunbeds are left empty and lonely waiters stand outside restaurants with menus in hand but no holidaymakers to speak to.
""It used to be so busy that you would stand shoulder to shoulder,"" Welsh tourist Nadine said as she walked around nearly empty streets in nearby Albufeira.
Eliseu Correia, head of the Algarve-based destination management company EC Travel, said not being included in the British safe travel list had been devastating for his business, with revenues dropping around 60% this year compared to 2019.
""It is obviously a tremendous hit on everybody,"" he said. ""We had no revenue in March, April, May, June...so we were counting on that.""
SILVER LINING?
Britons pumped around 3.2 billion euros into Portugual's economy last year and without that cash, the Algarve's businesses, which mainly rely on the busy summer months to make ends meet, will find themselves in a tight spot. 
The travel list, which allows holidaymakers to dodge a 14-day quarantine upon returning home, is expected to be reviewed by next Monday but, even if Portugal is put on the list then, it might be too late. 
""It is obvious part of the damage can't be reversed,"" said Eliderico Viegas, President of Algarve's AHETA hotel association. ""Many people have already opted for other destinations.""
On average, the Algarve's hotels, which are usually fully booked in July and August, are currently surviving with only 40% occupancy, according to AHETA.
The Algarve saw its number of registered unemployed in June rise 231% compared to the same period last year, increasing from around 8,000 to more than 26,000 people. 
Most relied on the so-called seasonal jobs, which were wiped out as demand collapsed and businesses closed doors. 
The government has acknowledged the Algarve needs urgent help, and announced on Tuesday it would spend 300 million euros to support its struggling economy. 
Francisco Melo, who runs boat tours along the coast, says his business is making 20% less compared to 2019.
But there is a silver lining to how quiet things are, which he hopes will in turn help bring tourists back:

""Things are hard but the sea is full of life, with dolphins, tuna, horse mackerel. We have never seen the sea like this.""

Emmanuel Macron's comments come after Turkey's navy on Tuesday issued an advisory for seismic surveys in an area of sea between Cyprus and Crete, a move Greece said was an attempt by Ankara to encroach on its continental shelf.
""In this part of the Mediterranean, which is vital for our two countries, energy and security issues are essential. What's at stake is a power struggle in particular of Turkey and Russia which are asserting themselves more and more and in the face of which the EU is still doing too little,"" Macron told reporters alongside his Cypriot counterpart Nicos Anastasiades. 
""It would be a serious mistake to leave our security in the Mediterranean in the hands of other actors. This is not an option for Europe and it is not something that France will let happen.""
The European Union has already imposed some sanctions on Turkey over drilling activities in the eastern Mediterranean, but Macron said more sanctions would be needed to stop the violations.
""I stand fully behind Cyprus and Greece in the face of the Turkish violations of their sovereignty. It is unacceptable that the maritime space of (EU) member states be violated and threatened. Those who are doing that must be sanctioned.""
Macron, who has criticised Turkey for months over Ankara's role in Libya, also said the EU should push for sanctions over those involved in the north african country's conflict.

""It is necessary to obtain a ceasefire and begin a real dynamic towards a political solution to the Libyan conflict,"" he said.

321,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 23, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",U.S. judge to consider making records in Ghislaine Maxwell civil lawsuit public,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge will consider whether to unseal records from a 2015 civil lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell, the British socialite and longtime Jeffrey Epstein associate facing criminal charges that she lured girls for the late financier to sexually abuse.
U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan scheduled a Thursday hearing to discuss unsealing more than 80 documents that Maxwell wants to keep under wraps.
They include flight logs from Epstein's private jets, deposition testimony in 2016 in which Maxwell's lawyers said she was asked ""intrusive"" questions about her sex life, and police reports from Palm Beach, Florida, where Epstein had a home.
The documents were part of Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre's defamation lawsuit against Maxwell, which was confidentially settled in 2017.
Lawyers for Maxwell and Giuffre did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Giuffre has accused Maxwell of enabling Epstein to abuse her when she was underage, a claim Maxwell has denied.
Maxwell, 58, is being held in a Brooklyn jail after pleading not guilty on July 10 to charges she helped Epstein recruit and eventually abuse girls from 1994 to 1997, and committed perjury by denying knowledge of his abuse in depositions.
She is trying to halt the dissemination of information that she believes could impede her defense in the criminal case.
On Tuesday, her lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan for a gag order blocking prosecutors, FBI agents and some accusers' lawyers from speaking publicly about the criminal case out of court.
Maxwell's lawyers have said several factors outweighed any presumption that the public be allowed to access the documents Giuffre wants unsealed. These include possible embarrassment, the risk that disclosures might ""inappropriately influence potential witnesses or alleged victims,"" and the possibility many ""non-parties"" linked to Maxwell or Epstein could be exposed.
Some records, including parts of Maxwell's deposition testimony, were unsealed on Aug. 9, 2019, one day after Epstein executed his will and one day before he was found hanged in his jail cell at age 66. His death was ruled a suicide.
Epstein before his arrest had socialized over the years with many prominent people, including Britain's Prince Andrew, U.S. President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton.
He agreed with U.S. prosecutors in Miami in 2007 to plead guilty to state prostitution charges and spend 13 months in jail rather than face federal sex trafficking charges, an agreement now widely seen as too lenient.
In excerpts from her April 22, 2016, deposition previously made public, Maxwell said a ""very small part"" of her job was to find ""adult professional massage therapists"" for Epstein, who had homes in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
Giuffre was 17 when she allegedly gave Epstein massages in Florida, the deposition said. 

""So she was 17. At 17 you are allowed to be a professional masseuse and as far as I'm concerned, she was a professional masseuse,"" Maxwell said in the deposition. ""There is nothing inappropriate or incorrect about her coming at that time to give a massage.""

Bruno D., who had been an SS guard in the Stutthof concentration camp near Gdansk in what is today Poland, was guilty of being involved in killings between August 1944 and April 1945, the Hamburg court said on Thursday. 
He had acknowledged his presence at the camp but argued that did not amount to guilt. 
About 65,000 people, including many Jews, were murdered or died at Stutthof, according to the museum's website. Prosecutors have argued that many were shot in the back of the head or gassed with the lethal Zyklon B gas.
As he was only 17 or 18 years old at the time of the crimes, he was subject to youth sentencing guidelines. Prosecutors had called for a three-year prison sentence. 
In his final testimony to the court earlier this week, Bruno D. apologised for the suffering victims went through but stopped short of taking responsibility, German media reported.
""I would like to apologise to all the people who have gone through this hell of insanity and to their relatives and survivors,"" he told the court this week, broadcaster NDR and many other media outlets reported.
The defendant's frail health has meant that court sessions were limited to two to three hours per day.

Although the number of suspects is dwindling due to old age, prosecutors are still trying to bring individuals to justice. A landmark conviction in 2011 opened the way to more prosecutions as it was the first time that working in a camp was sufficient grounds for culpability, with no proof of a specific crime.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea should postpone military exercises with the United States in the hope of drawing North Korea back into talks, the South Korean politician set to take over responsibility for relations with the North said on Thursday.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in wants to get dialogue with North Korea back on track after negotiations between the United States and North Korea on its nuclear programme broke down.
Regular military exercises between South Korean and U.S. forces have for years infuriated North Korea, which sees the drills as preparations for its invasion.
Lee In-young, who has been nominated as South Korea's next unification minister, said postponing, or at least scaling back, the exercises, which are due to start next month, might convince North Korea to reconsider negotiations.
""If the exercises take place as planned, North Korea's backlash will be strong but if they are completely postponed, it might take it as a fresh message,"" Lee told a parliamentary confirmation hearing.
""If we can show flexibility by scaling it back by around half or moving its location further south, North Korea would respond accordingly.""
South Korea and the United States are discussing the scale, scope and timing of the annual drills now that the novel coronavirus has disrupted the travel of U.S. troops. 
Questions over the exercises come after a period of rising tension with North Korea, which appears increasingly frustrated that talks with both South Korea and the United States, including three meetings between leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump since 2018, have brought no easing of sanctions.
Last month, North Korea blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border, severed hotlines with South Korea and threatened military action, angry about defector groups sending anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets.
Trump has in the past questioned the value of the drills and in 2018 even suggested to Kim that he would end them.
There are about 28,000 U.S. troops in South Korea.

Borissov dismissed the ministers of finance, economy and interior, whom he had asked to resign last week to stop speculation that they were working under the influence of a controversial businessman linked to another political faction.
Health Minister Kiril Ananiev will take over the Balkan country's coffers, replacing Vladislav Goranov as finance minister, Borissov said after a meeting with his junior coalition partners.

Since late June, several fires or explosions have been reported at military, industrial and nuclear sites in Iran as well as at oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials have said a fire at the underground Natanz nuclear facility this month may have been caused by cyber sabotage. Other incidents have gone unexplained.

But Mousavi also said fires in forests, refineries and other locations were common in summer.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - In the sweltering seaside port of Mogadishu, Sharif Ahmed tried to attack his relatives and neighbours, resulting in an emergency trip to a psychiatric hospital in handcuffs.
It is not the endless civil war making the 22-year-old restless, but withdrawal from the narcotic leaf khat that he has been chewing on since he was 15. 
Somalia is a major market for khat, which is grown in neighbouring Kenya's fertile central highlands and soon after harvesting driven at high speeds to Nairobi airports for distribution to consumers abroad.
Once the khat arrives in Mogadishu, men gather in groups to chew the leaf, a mild stimulant, and chat into the early hours.
Somalia shut down flights in late March to curb the spread of the virus, meaning the drug could no longer be imported by air from Kenya.
That affected users, causing some to go for long periods without sleep, said Abdirashid Abdulahi, a doctor at Mogadishu's Habeeb Psychiatric Emergency Hospital.

AMBO, Ethiopia (Reuters) - The white stone house with a paved floor stands out in the Ethiopian town of Ambo, a poor region where homes are mostly constructed of wood and mud. 
But the surrounding fence is incomplete - a constant reminder to the elderly inhabitants of their most famous son, political singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, who was shot dead by unknown gunmen in Addis Ababa last month. 
""My son was a hero like a lion, he roared about his people, but he was eaten by rats,"" Gudetu Hora, Haacaaluu's mother, tearfully told Reuters at the home.
Haacaaluu, 36, was a member of the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, and his songs were anthems for the young protesters who brought down one of Africa's most repressive regimes.
His death sparked protests in the capital in which 178 people were killed. Two people, including the suspected shooter, have been arrested over his murder.
""My heart won't heal until the day I go and join him,"" said Hundeessaa Bonsa, the late musician's father. ""My wound lives as it is, it won't heal. Haacaalu was the shining son of the house.""
Haacaaluu's songs, recorded in the Oromo language, were the soundtrack to a generation of protesters whose three years of anti-government demonstrations finally forced the resignation of the prime minister in 2018 and his replacement by Abiy Ahmed, whose father is Oromo.
His first album was released in 2009, after he had served five years in prison, where he wrote most of his songs, according to a profile in O Pride, an Oromo magazine. 
His most famous single was ""Maalan Jira?"" (What fate is mine?), which became a rally cry following its release just before a wave of government-backed evictions began around the capital in 2015. The song has been viewed more than 3 million times on YouTube.
In his home town of Ambo, some 100 kilometres (62 miles) west of the capital, where he is buried, Haacaaluu's family choose to remember the simple, selfless acts of the late singer, who is survived by a wife and three daughters.
The half-finished fence stands as a symbol as one of his brothers explains that Haacaaluu financed the construction of the home by selling a valuable necklace a fan gave him at a concert.

Parts of the eastern coast, including the Bohai Bay region, Shandong and the province of Jiangsu also face hurricane-force winds, the China Meteorological Administration said.
The port cities of Qingdao and Rizhao on the eastern coast were the latest to see record-breaking daily rainfall on Wednesday, and the provinces of Jiangxi and Anhui on the Yangtze river issued new red alerts early on Thursday. 
The Ministry of Water Resources said 93 rivers remained above warning levels, adding that the Three Gorges reservoir, China's biggest, will need to be closely monitored as incoming floodwaters surge.
""The current flood control situation remains severe and cannot be relaxed in any way,"" it said.
Regions throughout China have been ordering emergency evacuations as a result of landslides, burst riverbanks and mountain floods. 
China has vowed to take a scientific approach to controlling floods and has made use of early warning systems as well as its dams and reservoirs to try to minimise the damage.
More than 45 million people have been affected since flood season began in June, with 142 people dead or missing, but the figure is lower than usual, state news agency Xinhua said on Wednesday. Direct economic damage, at just over 160 billion yuan ($22.84 billion), was also lower than the five-year average. 
However, experts say the heaviest rainfall in decades has exposed the country's overreliance on giant feats of engineering like the Three Gorges Dam, to regulate and utilise its water supplies.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A temporary basic income for the world's poorest 2.7 billion people in 132 developing countries could help slow the spread of the coronavirus by allowing them to stay home, according to a U.N. Development Programme (UNDP) report released on Thursday.
The report suggests three options - top-ups on existing average incomes, lump-sum transfers linked to differences in the median standard of living across a country or uniform lump sum transfers regardless of where someone lives in a country.
""Unprecedented times call for unprecedented social and economic measures. Introducing a temporary basic income for the world's poorest people has emerged as one option,"" said UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner. ""Bailouts and recovery plans cannot only focus on big markets and big business.""
The coronavirus has infected at least 14.8 million people and there have been more than 610,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. The United Nations has warned that the pandemic and associated global recession could trigger an increase in poverty worldwide for the first time since 1990 and push 265 million people to the brink of starvation.
The UNDP report suggests that one way countries could pay for a temporary basic income would be repurposing billions of dollars that would have been spent servicing their debt. 
The Group of 20 major economies in April agreed on a suspension of debt service payments for the world's poorest countries until the end of the year. However, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for debt relief to be offered to all developing and middle-income countries.

The G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative has proven challenging to implement, with only 42 of 73 eligible countries expressing interest thus far, saving just $5.3 billion in service payments instead of the $12 billion initially promised.

DAKAR (Reuters) - When five West African presidents arrive in Mali on Thursday to try to defuse a political crisis that has alarmed governments in the region and beyond, the man whose assent they need the most will be one who has never held elected office. 
Mahmoud Dicko, a Saudi-trained preacher known for his Koranic erudition and social conservatism, is seen by admirers and detractors alike as the galvanizing force behind a protest movement now threatening the political survival of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.
International powers are anxious for the crisis to end, fearful it could undermine multi-billion-dollar efforts spearheaded by former colonial power France to contain insurgents linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the region.
Public opposition to Keita hardened, however, after at least 14 protesters were killed in clashes with security forces earlier this month. 
Infuriated by grievances ranging from disputed legislative election results to the army's repeated losses to Islamist militants, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent weeks. 
Stepping to the rostrum at the first rally in the capital Bamako on June 5, Dicko, 66, drew on his signature brand of religiously-infused nationalism. 
""This great nation of Mali, builder of empires and kingdoms, is not a submissive people,"" Dicko said, addressing the crowd of mostly young men in the local Bambara language mixed with French and Arabic. ""It is a people standing proud!"" he said, thrusting a fist into the air as they chanted his name. 
AGENT OF COMPROMISE? 
While protesters come from a diverse coalition of religious, political and civil society groups, Dicko is universally viewed as the driving force. Some of the president's supporters think that could be a good thing. 
Unlike others, Dicko has not explicitly called for Keita, whom he supported in the 2013 election, to resign. 
""I am convinced that Mahmoud Dicko is now determined to end all this,"" said Bajan Ag Hamatou, a lawmaker from Keita's coalition. ""If he stops, the others will have to stop."" 
But Dicko - who is expected to meet with leaders of Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Senegal, Ghana and Niger on Thursday - has not publicly proposed a compromise, leaving his endgame unclear. He did not agree to an interview but previously dismissed speculation he intends to seek political office. 
HARDLINER
Dicko's influence unnerves some in Mali, which is 95% Muslim but has a secular constitution, and France where some commentators have likened him to Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
He studied in Mauritania and Saudi Arabia in the 1970s, where he embraced conservative Salafist ideas. As head of Mali's influential High Islamic Council in 2009, he led successful protests against a family code that would have thrown out a requirement that women obey their husbands. 
His efforts to mediate with Islamist militant groups have also drawn suspicion. 
Mohamed Kimbiri, a member of the High Islamic Council, said Dicko was not challenging state secularism but wanted a less rigid version.

""Today, he alone can command the Malian ship,"" Kimbiri told Reuters. ""The politicians have disqualified themselves, and the Malian public is now really in favour of the religious leaders.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - ""Dark fleets"" believed to be from China have been fishing in North Korean waters, potentially netting Pyongyang millions of dollars in illicit fees and forcing smaller North Korean vessels further afield, a series of reports said this week.
The South Korean coast guard as well as independent experts monitoring the implementation of United Nations sanctions have reported for years that ships of Chinese origin have been observed fishing in North Korean waters, in some cases having paid to obtain rights from North Korean authorities.
In several new reports, including one published in the journal ""Science Advances"" on Wednesday, more than a dozen researchers from a number of maritime and fisheries groups used a machine learning algorithm to analyse satellite imagery to track so-called ""dark fleets"", ships that don't appear in public monitoring systems, that are suspected of fishing in North Korean waters from 2017-2019.
""Hundreds of large, industrial vessels originating from China likely violated United Nations (U.N.) sanctions and caught almost half a billion dollars worth of Pacific flying squid,"" one of the groups, Global Fishing Watch, said in a statement.
More than 900 such ships were observed in 2017, with more than 700 tracked in 2018 and 2019, the researchers said.
North Korea would not receive that money, but the U.N. panel of experts says Pyongyang has continued to sell fishing rights, providing it with an estimated $120 million in 2018, according to the panel's latest report in March.
The Chinese government says it complies with all U.N. sanctions, and told the United Nations that evasion tactics employed by the ships made it difficult to verify if a given vessel had engaged in illegal fishing.
The massive Chinese fishing boats are also forcing smaller North Korean vessels to roam further away from home, leading to international incidents around the region, the watchdog reports said this week.
Thousands of North Korean fishing vessels were tracked in Russian waters, leading to legal clashes with Russian authorities, the reports said.
The North Korean fishing vessels are rarely equipped for long-distance voyages, and by roaming far from home ports they may be contributing to a rise in so-called ""ghost ships,"" vessels that wash up on the shores of Japan and other countries with human remains or no one on board, the reports said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean senators on Wednesday voted to approve a controversial bill that allows citizens to withdraw 10% of their pension savings to help ease the economic impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak. 
The bill, which polls suggest has widespread public support, has been staunchly opposed by the government of President Sebastian Pinera but was approved by 29 votes to 13 with one abstention. 
Swift passage of the bill, and surprise cross-party support, has pushed Pinera's center-right ruling coalition to the brink of collapse and brought warnings of dire economic consequences. 
It also raised concerns about a swerve toward populism following months of rioting and protests last year over inequality and precarious living standards in one of Latin America's traditionally most stable and prosperous nations. 
Senators approved the vote with five government representatives crossing the floor to support the opposition in voting it through. 
On Wednesday night they continued to debate proposed amendments to the bill including who can access funds, and a provision that would see the government or employers replenish pensions after the COVID-19 crisis.
If all amendments are rejected, the bill can be signed into law. If any are approved, it will return to the lower house for a final vote as early as Thursday.
Once the bill is approved by Congress, Pinera can veto it, or it could be referred to the Constitutional Court. But either move would likely spark a resumption of last year's street protests.
The government has argued its own rescue packages - worth nearly 12% of gross domestic product - will buoy Chileans left unemployed or in poverty because of the four-month economic shutdown stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Removing funds from the defined contribution Pension Fund Administrators (AFP) system will reduce already low average pension payouts, and shock the local stock, bond and exchange markets, according to the government and mainstream economists, though opinion diverges on how much. 
The AFP system was introduced in the 1980s under the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet and has been the subject of public protest and reform pledges because of low payouts for years. 
In a Cadem poll published last week, 86% of respondents said they supported the pension withdrawals, and 82% said they would request access to their funds if allowed.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - The FBI believes that a Chinese researcher, accused of visa fraud for hiding her affiliation with the Chinese military, has been holed up in the Chinese consulate in San Francisco for a month, according to court filings.
The filings in U.S. District Court in San Francisco said that Juan Tang, who worked at University of California, Davis, falsely claimed on her visa application that she had not served in the Chinese military. But investigators found photos of her in a Chinese military uniform and discovered she had worked as a researcher at China's Air Force Military Medical University. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation questioned her on June 20 and afterward she went to the consulate where the FBI believes she has remained. 
She was charged with visa fraud on June 26. U.S. law enforcement cannot enter a foreign embassy or consulate unless invited, and certain top officials such as ambassadors have diplomatic immunity. 
The Chinese consulate in San Francisco and Tang could not be immediately reached for comment. The U.S. State Department did not reply to a request for comment. 
The news, first reported by Axios, comes as U.S.-China tensions flare, with the United States giving China 72 hours to close its consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying.
Prosecutors have argued against bail for another Chinese researcher, Chen Song, also arrested for visa fraud. Song worked at Stanford University conducting neurological research, the court filings said.
The court filings also mention two other recently charged Chinese researchers who worked at University of California, San Francisco and Duke University.
The FBI has warned universities for years about the risk of intellectual property theft by foreign researchers, and the United States has tightened restrictions on student visas as well.

337,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 07:25PM ET</span>",Explainer: What are the main areas of tension in the U.S.-China relationship?,"(Reuters) - The U.S. demand this week that China close its consulate in Houston is the latest in a string of disputes that have taken the relationship between the world's two biggest economies to its lowest point in decades.
Here are the main points of contention between Beijing and Washington: 
CORONAVIRUS 
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused China of a lack of transparency about the coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. He regularly refers to it as the ""China virus."" 
Trump said Chinese officials ""ignored their reporting obligations"" to the World Health Organization about the virus - that has killed hundreds of thousands of people globally - and pressured the U.N. agency to ""mislead the world.""
China says it has been transparent about the outbreak and the WHO has denied Trump's assertions that it promoted Chinese ""disinformation"" about the virus. The United States plans to quit the WHO in mid-2021 over its handling of the pandemic.
TRADE
The Trump administration began increasing tariffs on imports from China, its largest trading partner, in 2018 as part of an ambitious plan to force Beijing to curb subsidies on state manufacturing and tough demands on U.S. companies in China. 
After more than a year of tit-for-tat tariffs that slowed global economic growth, the countries signed a trade deal in January 2020 that rolls back some tariffs, but does not address the core issues. Beijing has pledged to increase imports of U.S. goods by $200 billion over two years.
The U.S. Commerce and State departments are pushing U.S. companies to move sourcing and manufacturing out of China.
SOUTH CHINA SEA 
The United States has hardened its position in recent weeks on the South China Sea, where it has accused China of attempting to build a ""maritime empire"" in the potentially energy-rich waters. 
Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam challenge China's claim to about 90% of the sea. A July 13 statement by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first time the United States had called China's claims unlawful and accused Beijing of a ""campaign of bullying"".
HONG KONG 
China and the United States have clashed over pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong, most recently Beijing's imposition of new security legislation on the former British colony, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Trump this month signed an executive order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, allowing him to impose sanctions and visa restrictions on Chinese officials and financial institutions involved in enacting the law.
China has threatened retaliatory sanctions of its own.
UIGHURS 
The United States has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials, companies and institutions over human rights violations linked to China's treatment of minority Muslim Uighurs in the country's western Xinjiang region.
China has been widely condemned for setting up complexes in remote Xinjiang that it describes as ""vocational training centers"" to stamp out extremism and give people new skills. 
JOURNALISTS AND CHINESE STUDENTS 
The United States has started treating several major Chinese state media outlets as foreign embassies and slashed the number of journalists allowed to work at U.S. offices of those Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160.
In response, China expelled about a dozen American correspondents with major U.S. outlets and asked four U.S. media organizations to submit details about their operations in China.
Washington in May introduced new rules restricting the granting of visas to Chinese graduate students believed to have links with China's military.
HUAWEI 
Chinese tech firm Huawei was added to the U.S. Commerce Department's ""entity list"" last year due to national security concerns, amid accusations from Washington that it violated U.S. sanctions on Iran and can spy on customers, allegations Huawei has denied. The listing greatly reduced its access to vital parts and supplies, like chips, from U.S. suppliers.
Huawei says Washington wants to frustrate its growth because no U.S. company offers the same technology at a competitive price.
The United States has been successfully pushing countries around the world to drop Huawei.
NORTH KOREA 
China is at odds with the United States over North Korea, even though they both want the country to give up its nuclear weapons. Washington has accused China of breaching U.N. sanctions on North Korea, assertions Beijing has denied. China wants to lift some sanctions, but the United States disagrees.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Trump have met three times, but failed to make progress on U.S. calls for Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and North Korea's demands for an end to sanctions.

The number-two diplomat at the State Department, Stephen Biegun, said on Wednesday Washington and Beijing could still work together against North Korea's development of weapons of mass destruction despite current tensions.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - World leaders will send videos instead of physically gathering at the United Nations in September due to the coronavirus pandemic, the General Assembly decided on Wednesday, a move that paves the way for people wary of traveling to the United States - like North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un - to participate.
The annual high-level meeting had been shaping up to be a week-long celebration of the 75th anniversary of the world body, but U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres suggested in May that leaders send video statements due to likely travel issues. 
The 193-member General Assembly agreed on Wednesday to the special measures. 
""Each Member State, observer State and the European Union can submit a pre-recorded statement of its Head of State, Vice-President, Crown Prince or Princess, Head of Government, Minister or Vice-Minister, which will be played in the General Assembly Hall ... after introduction by their representative who is physically present,"" according to the decision.
Traditionally hundreds of events are also held on the sidelines of the U.N. debate, but General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande wrote in a letter to states that they were ""encouraged to move all side events to virtual platforms to limit the footprint and number of people in the U.N. building.""
The coronavirus has infected at least 15.1 million people and there have been more than 619,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. New York was a global epicenter earlier this year for the virus, which emerged in China late last year. 
As U.N. host country the United States agreed to grant entry to leaders and diplomats from all U.N. member states. However, diplomats say it regularly limits the delegation size of some of its adversaries, like Iran. 
While North Korea's Kim has met three times with U.S. President Donald Trump since 2018 for now-stalled denuclearization talks, he has never traveled to the United States as leader or taken part in the U.N. General Assembly. 

The country's former foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, traveled to New York to address the United Nations from 2016 to 2018, but he did not attend last year. North Korea's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Kim would send a video statement for this year's high-level meeting.

Diaz's comments echoed remarks by Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez, who said Spain intended to reform its labor laws to reduce the structural unemployment rate as part of commitments tied to the disbursement of the European Union recovery fund.
""We will fulfill the government agreement because it is necessary,"" the labor minister told SER radio station when asked if the EU deal could affect the agreement between the Socialist Party and its far-left coalition partner, Unidas Podemos, to modify the 2012 labor legislation.
Diaz said it was necessary to correct what she called the ""enormous precariousness"" of Spain's labor market and its wage devaluation, but stressed those issues would be addressed in talks with unions and business associations.
Asked if public pensions would be lowered as a consequence of the EU deal, she replied: ""No"".
Introduced by a previous conservative government, the labor reform allowed far greater flexibility in the labor market, making it easier to cut wages and cheaper to lay off workers. 
Supporters of the reform argue it helped convert Spain into a more competitive market, but detractors say it eroded workers' rights and promoted the creation of more precarious low-wage jobs.
""Our pending task is to carry out reforms with the consensus of all the political and social forces of the country,"" Gonzalez said earlier on Wednesday in an interview with Spanish TV channel La Sexta, without elaborating on how the laws would be reformed. 
The number of people in Spain registering as jobless rose by 0.13% in June from a month earlier, or by 5,017 people, leaving 3.86 million people out of work as the coronavirus lockdown was lifted.

For the first time in the modern era, amidst efforts to curb COVID-19, Muslims from abroad will be unable to attend the pilgrimage. 
This year's event has been limited to about 1,000 pilgrims from within Saudi Arabia, 70% of whom will be foreign residents of the kingdom.
The remaining 30% will be drawn from Saudi healthcare workers and security personnel who have recovered from the coronavirus, as a gesture of thanks for their sacrifice.
""Haj this year is for the heroes who saved the country and saved our people, they deserve it ... I personally would have loved to go but there are priorities,"" said Saudi citizen Nour al Ghamdi. 
Those chosen will receive supplies including special ihram garments, toiletries, and a prayer rug in a suitcase from the Saudi haj ministry, as well as pre-arranged meals. They will be required to maintain social distancing.
Like many Muslims around the world, Egyptian Mahmoud Ali Mahmoud, 55, laments the restriction to domestic pilgrims. 
""As you can see, I had everything prepared. Here is my Quran, my ihram clothing, my garment,"" he said, opening his packed suitcase. 
""The time that one can spend there could be a time for us to pray that God rids the world of this pandemic,"" he said from his Cairo home.
Some 2.5 million Muslims typically visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long pilgrimage, due to start on July 28. A once-in-a-lifetime duty for able-bodied Muslims who can afford the cost, it is usually extremely crowded. 
Dhera Arizona, 31, had been saving up for seven years to travel to Mecca from Indonesia this year.
""We are disappointed and sad,"" she said, but ""we understand that in this kind of pandemic situation, it is impossible to hold the worship service"". 

Official figures show that the haj and the year-round umrah pilgrimage earn the kingdom about $12 billion a year. Minimizing the event will hurt government finances, already hit by falling oil prices and the pandemic.

BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States gave China 72 hours to close its consulate in Houston amid accusations of spying, marking a dramatic deterioration in relations between the world's two biggest economies.
The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday the Chinese mission in Houston was being closed ""to protect American intellectual property and Americans' private information.""
China's foreign ministry said Washington had abruptly issued the demand on Tuesday and called it an ""unprecedented escalation."" The ministry threatened unspecified retaliation.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington had received ""bomb and death threats"" because of ""smears & hatred"" fanned by the U.S. government, spokeswoman Hua Chunying wrote in a tweet. 
""The U.S. should revoke its erroneous decision,"" she said. ""China will surely react with firm countermeasures.""
Communist Party rulers in Beijing were considering shutting the U.S. consulate in the central city of Wuhan in retaliation, a source with knowledge of the matter said. 
U.S.-based China experts said Beijing could also opt to target more important consulates in Hong Kong, Shanghai or Guangzhou, something that could hurt American businesses.
The Houston move comes in the run-up to the November U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, have both tried to look tough towards China.
Speaking on a visit to Denmark, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo repeated accusations about Chinese theft of U.S. and European intellectual property, which he said were costing ""hundreds of thousands of jobs.""
While offering no specifics about the Houston consulate, Pompeo referred to a U.S. Justice Department indictment on Tuesday of two Chinese nationals over what it called a decade-long cyber espionage campaign that targeted defense contractors, COVID-19 researchers and hundreds of other victims worldwide. 
Pompeo also referred to recent speeches by the head of the FBI and others that highlighted Chinese espionage activities.
""President Trump has said: 'Enough. We are not going to allow this to continue to happen,'"" he told reporters. ""That's the actions that you're seeing taken by President Trump, we'll continue to engage in this.""
Republican Senator Marco Rubio, acting chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, described the Houston consulate on Twitter as the ""central node of the Communist Party's vast network of spies & influence operations in the United States.""
Trump was due to hold a news conference at 5.30 p.m. (2130 GMT), the White House said.
The New York Times quoted the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, David Stilwell, as saying that the Houston consulate had been at the ""epicenter"" of the Chinese army's efforts to advance its warfare advantages by sending students to U.S. universities.
""We took a practical step to prevent them from doing that,"" Stilwell told the Times.
Stephen Biegun, the State Department's number two diplomat, told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee the decision was made in response to ""longstanding areas of concern.""
He said these included intellectual property theft and commercial espionage, as well as unequal treatment of U.S. diplomats, exporters, investors and media in China and abuse by China's security services of the welcoming U.S. posture toward Chinese students and researchers.
A Chinese diplomat, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, denied the spying allegations and said the Houston mission acted like other Chinese consulates in the United States - issuing visas, and promoting visits and businesses.
'RACE TO THE BOTTOM' 
U.S.-China ties have worsened sharply this year over issues ranging from the coronavirus and telecoms-gear maker Huawei to China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and clampdown on Hong Kong.
Jonathan Pollack, an East Asia expert with the Brookings Institution, said he could not think of anything ""remotely equivalent"" to the move against the Houston consulate since the U.S. and China opened full diplomatic relations in 1979.
""The Trump Administration appears to view this latest action as political ammunition in the presidential campaign... It's part of the administration's race to the bottom against China,"" he said.
Overnight in Houston, firefighters went to the consulate after smoke was seen. Two U.S. government officials said they had information that documents were being burned there.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the consulate was operating normally.
But its closure within a short period of time by Washington was ""an unprecedented escalation of its recent actions against China,"" Wang said.
A source with direct knowledge of the matter said China was considering closing the U.S. consulate in Wuhan, where the State Department withdrew staff and their families early this year due to the coronavirus outbreak that first emerged in the city. 
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it would shut the consulate.

Wang said the U.S. government had been harassing Chinese diplomats and consular staff for some time and intimidating Chinese students. He said the United States had interfered with China's diplomatic missions, including intercepting diplomatic pouches. The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the Chinese accusations.

342,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 05:05PM ET</span>","As federal deployment looms, Chicago mayor calls for end of violence","By Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Wednesday called on witnesses to come forward with information about an overnight gunfight at a funeral and the shooting of a toddler, as the federal government stepped in to help the city curb a surge in violent crimes.
Hours after Lightfoot pleaded for an end to Chicago's ""carnage"" of gang violence, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that officers from the FBI and other federal agencies would reinforce the prosecution of criminals in the city.
Trump's announcement followed an alarming night of violence in Chicago which included a gun battle between gang members at a funeral that wounded 15 people and the shooting of a 3-year-old girl, who was shot in the head but is expected to survive.
Trump has sought to promote a law-and-order message ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election, targeting cities controlled by Democrats. Critics say the administration is seeking to divert attention away from its widely criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic, one of the reasons he is trailing Democratic challenger Joe Biden in opinion polls.
At a news conference, Trump criticized Chicago politicians for what he characterized as ""deadly,"" soft-on-crime policies and cited the recent spate of violence, including over the July 4 weekend, when 87 people were wounded by gunfire in the city and 17 were killed.
""For those people in Chicago and other cities where we’ll be: Help is on its way,"" Trump said. 
Trump had threatened earlier this week to send federal agents to Chicago, New York and other cities, sparking concern that the deployments would be similar to actions taken in Portland, Oregon, where federal agents without identifying badges have been accused of pulling protesters into unmarked vans, a possible violation of their civil rights.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr told the briefing that the reinforcements to Chicago were part of a program called ""Operation Legend."" The program was started this month to provide federal aid to officials in Kansas City, Missouri, in combating traditional violent crimes, and does not involve the paramilitary-type forces deployed to counter protesters in Portland.
The effort in Chicago will include 100 investigators from the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), more than 100 members of the U.S. Marshals Service Great Lakes Task Force and some 100 agents from a unit of the Department of Homeland Security already stationed in Chicago, the Justice Department said.
On Tuesday, Lightfoot had threatened to sue Trump if he sent unidentified federal agents to her city.
""The Trump administration is not going to foolishly deploy unnamed agents to the streets of Chicago,"" she said as she outlined plans for an influx of identified agents from the FBI and other agencies to combat crime. ""We have information that allows us to say, at least at this point, that we don't see a Portland-style deployment coming to Chicago.""
Chicago has seen an explosion in violence this summer. There were 116 murders over the 28 days through July 19, an increase of nearly 200 percent, police department data shows.
At a briefing earlier on Wednesday, Lightfoot pleaded with her constituents to help the city ""end this carnage,"" noting that the funeral involved in the shooting had been for a victim of gang violence himself.
Police superintendent David Brown blamed turf battles among the roughly 117,000 gang members in the city of 2.7 million people, where one shooting begets another in an endless cycle of revenge.
""This same cycle repeats itself over and over and over again. This cycle is fueled by street gangs, guns and drugs,"" he said at the briefing. ""Too many people in Chicago have been touched by gun violence.""
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday that he told Trump that his state was able and prepared to handle a spike in crime in New York City, noting that he had not declared a public safety emergency.

""And since the state hasn't made a declaration, I don't see why there's any reason why the federal government should take action,"" Cuomo said in a call with reporters, adding that Trump agreed with his assessment.

International Rescue Committee and Action Against Hunger, both aid groups, confirmed the killing of their colleagues and other humanitarian workers in statements condemning the executions.
Last month, the militants released a video in which the hostages identified themselves.
The execution underscores the increasing risk for aid workers in northeast Nigeria, where a decade-long conflict with Boko Haram and Islamic State's regional ally has fuelled one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
""You that are working for infidel organisations, you are working to deliver their mandate but they do not care about your plight,"" said a man wearing a balaclava in the video, with the five captives wearing red blindfolds and kneeling in a row in front of him.
""This is why whenever we abduct you, those organisations do not show any form of concern,"" he said. 
When the man finished his speech, he and four other men in balaclavas and military fatigues shot the captives.
Since Nigeria's military withdrew into garrison towns they call ""super camps"", the northeast has become deadlier for many civilians, leaving previously safe major roads, much of the countryside and smaller towns unprotected.

PORTLAND (Reuters) - Wearing bike helmets and yellow T-shirts, America's mothers are confronting federal agents in combat gear to protect anti-racism protesters in Portland and, soon, other U.S. cities where President Donald Trump has vowed to crack down. 
Wall of Moms groups have formed in at least six cities including New York and Chicago on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the four days since mainly white suburban moms in Portland started making human walls in front of demonstrators.
Carrying signs like ""Feds stay clear. Moms are here,"" and ""I'm so disappointed in you - mom,"" the Oregon women have been shoved and tear-gassed by agents. Some dads have joined too, bringing leaf blowers to blow away tear gas.
Images of federal agents wearing camouflage whisking away Portland demonstrators in unmarked vehicles last week mobilized the mothers. Protests against racial injustice have rocked the largely white city for nearly two months since the death of Black man George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody. 
The deployment of federal agents in Portland last week is a flashpoint in a national debate over civil liberties and what demonstrators and local officials see as a political ploy by Trump, who is facing an uphill re-election battle.
“This was a call to action. I was honest, and I said that I didn’t know how to protest but I knew that something had to be done,"" said Bev Barnum, a 35-year-old Portland mother of two who used Facebook to organize the group's first demonstration of several dozen moms. 
""It hurt me to realize that I was so stuck in my suburban mom life. Yeah, we’re going to take the kids to school and we’re going to go kayaking and then have dinner and I hadn't looked outside my own four walls.""
Within an hour of her posting, she was contacted by roughly 50 mothers interested in joining the protest, Barnum said. Within the next few hours, the number had doubled. Now her Wall of Moms Facebook group has 9,000 members.
Carrying sunflowers, large peace symbol cut-outs and signs like ""You need a time out,"" hundreds of mothers now link arms on the frontline of nightly protests at the city's federal courthouse, braving tear gas and other non-lethal munitions.
Trump threatened earlier this week to send FBI and other federal agents to several other cities to help local authorities crack down on a surge in violence in recent weeks. The program, known as Operation Legend, began in Kansas City, Missouri.
'WE GOT GASSED'
Denver mothers plan to stage their first action on Saturday, and a ""Wall of Moms"" group in Washington called on its members to gather at ""March Against Trump's Police State"" on Wednesday.
Portland's mothers thought agents from the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies would not act against them at their first demonstration Sunday at the courthouse. They were wrong.
“We got gassed and that was the most heinous, excruciating experience in my entire life,"" said Barnum. 
The Wall of Moms movement carries on a tradition of maternal activism, notably the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo in Buenos Aires who held weekly vigils for nearly three decades to draw attention to the disappearance of their children under a military dictatorship. 
In Portland, Barnum and other organizers are trying to ensure their fame does not eclipse the anti-racism, anti-police brutality messages of protesters they are defending. 
Barnum, who is Mexican American, and other organizers are coordinating with local Black leaders to see how they can best support the wider movement.
Still, some activists such as E. Gomez have broken away from the moms group, frustrated by what she calls ""boomer-aged white women and men"" leaders who do not listen to concerns that they are drowning out the voices of people of color.
""It's quickly turning into a #wallofkarens. It's feeling like a lot of optics and photo ops to make these white women feel better about themselves,"" said Gomez, using a pejorative term to describe entitled, middle-aged white women.
Gomez, a woman of color, plans to put on black clothing and return to the protests with another mother.
But Luna Jane, 27, a Black mother, is glad to have moms creating what she believes is a safer environment that has encouraged more protesters to come onto the streets. 
""I'm fighting for my daughter's rights to live in her own home safely,"" said Jane, using an alias out of fear of doxing and referring to the Louisville police killing of African American emergency medic Breonna Taylor in her apartment.

""If I have to get hurt or even lose my life in that process, I will do so.""

Mexico has struggled to sell the opulent Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner, which the leftist Lopez Obrador has cast as a symbol of excess and corruption under previous governments in a country where around half the population lives in poverty.
""It will arrive today,"" Lopez Obrador said during a regular press conference. ""It will arrive at the presidential hangar, the plane is coming.""
The jet was acquired by former President Enrique Pena Nieto in 2012 and fitted with marble-lined bathrooms. Reconfigured to fly only 80 people, the plane has a ""presidential suite"" and a private bath.
The sale has been hamstrung in part by Lopez Obrador's unwillingness to accept offers below a United Nations-backed valuation of $130 million, even as the plane was potentially losing value as it sat unused in southern California.
Lopez Obrador's unorthodox plans to sell the plane included a raffle, where the plane was going to be the prize. Later he said the raffle would be a lottery-style event, with 100 winners getting about $1 million each rather than the plane. 
Earlier this month, the government said Mexico was considering a $120 million bid for the jet after an unidentified prospective buyer offered to pay part in cash and part in medical equipment.

Mexico has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with hospitals running short on medical supplies and the country suffering the world's fourth highest death toll from the virus.

A simmering conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed rebels has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. Major combat ended with a ceasefire agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015, but sporadic clashes still regularly kill civilians, Ukrainian soldiers and separatists.
""The breakthrough... is the result of the effective work of the Ukrainian delegation with the support of our international partners in Berlin and Paris,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's press service said in a statement.
It said the full and comprehensive ceasefire, if observed by the other party, was a precondition for the implementation of the Minsk agreements.

Zelenskiy has sought to resolve the conflict since his election last year, arranging a number of prisoner swaps. Ukraine and Russia have been foes since 2014, when Moscow seized Ukraine's Crimea peninsula and backed the rebellion in the east.

(Reuters) - Amid demands for more police transparency after the killing of George Floyd, U.S. police departments are experimenting with a new way of capturing potentially deadly moments: putting small cameras on their guns.
The police department in King City, California last month became the state's first force to mandate cameras on all its officers' handguns.
""With (the) public's responses to officer-involved shootings, I really felt it was important to have that perspective of what the officer most likely can see and the best point of view to see that from is the barrel of the handgun,"" said Robert Masterson, King City police chief.
The cameras, about the size of a thumb, are mounted along a rail on the bottom of a firearm's barrel and automatically record when the gun is drawn from the holster.
According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, in 2016, almost half of U.S. law enforcement agencies had acquired body-worn cameras. The use of gun-mounted cameras, however, is far less common and the numbers less known.
Minnesota-based Viridian Weapon Technologies, said more than 500 agencies across 47 states are in various stages of trialing or implementing its gun-camera system, which is aimed at supplementing images from police body cameras.
The gun camera was used in a case in Texas earlier this year to prosecute a suspect who became involved in a shootout with an officer in April 2019. Video from the body camera showed the officer's arms in front holding the gun, whereas video from the gun camera showed the pistol's point-of-view. 
The gun camera would not be useful in cases of alleged police brutality where a gun is not drawn, and Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, warned that there were limitations to the technology, 

""Even when a gun is drawn, they're not going to capture the context of events leading up to the point where the officer draws their gun and often that is the most crucial part in evaluating an officer's action and whether that was abusive or professional,"" he said.

Ali Ahmad Faqir Yar, the governor of Adraskan District in the eastern Afghanistan province of Herat, said at least eight civilians were among the dead. 
""Forty-five people had been killed so far in airstrikes by security forces in the Kham Ziarat area, Taliban were among those killed,"" he said.
It was unclear how many of the remaining 37 were civilians and how many were members of the Taliban.
Afghanistan's Ministry of Defense said it was investigating allegations of civilian casualities in attacks by Afghan forces in the area. 
""The results of the investigation will be shared with the public and the media. The National Defense and Security Forces have the responsibility to protect the lives and property of the people, in this regard, they use all the opportunities and facilities and will not spare any effort,"" the statement said.
Habib Amini, a local official in neighbouring Guzara district, confirmed the incident and that 45 were killed and more injured.
A spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan said they had not taken part in Wednesday's airstrikes. 
The United States is winding back troops under an agreement with the Taliban struck in February, which was meant to pave the way to formal peace talks between the insurgents and the Afghan government. However, disagreement over the release of prisoners demanded by the Taliban and rising violence around the country have hampered progress, and talks have yet to start. 
Qari Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement that two airstrikes in Heart had killed eight civilians and wounded 12.

The FBI, in an emailed statement, said it was working with the sheriff's office in San Bernardino, California, and had evidence tying the lawyer, Roy Den Hollander, to the July 11 killing of Marc Angelucci, a former associate of Hollander in the men's rights movement.
Hollander, who was found dead on Monday in an apparent suicide, was the sole suspect in the Sunday attack at Salas' home. The attack killed the 20-year-old son of Salas, a judge on the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, and wounded her husband.
The FBI says it now believes Hollander was involved in the death of Angelucci, who was vice president of the National Coalition for Men (NCFM). Angelucci was found July 11 with apparent gunshot wounds in Cedarpines Park, California, which is about 75 miles northeast of Los Angeles.

NCFM President Harry Crouch told Reuters that Hollander and Angelucci had had a falling out several years ago around the time Hollander was dismissed from the organization.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - A Canadian court on Wednesday ruled invalid a pact that compels asylum seekers trying to enter Canada via the American border to seek sanctuary first in the United States, saying their detention there violates their human rights.
Under the so-called Safe Third Country Agreement between the two neighbors, asylum seekers at a formal border crossing traveling in either direction are turned back and told to apply for asylum in the country in which they first arrived.
Lawyers for refugees who had been turned away at the Canadian border challenged the agreement, saying the United States does not qualify as a ""safe"" country under U.S. President Donald Trump.
Nedira Jemal Mustefa, one of the refugees turned back, described her time in solitary confinement in the United States as ""a terrifying, isolating and psychologically traumatic experience,"" according to the court ruling. 
""We're all too familiar with the treatment that the U.S. metes out to asylum seekers,"" said Maureen Silcoff, president of the Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers. ""This case highlights the conditions that people face when Canadian officials turn them around at the U.S. border."" 
More than 50,000 people have illegally crossed the Canada-U.S. border to file refugee claims over the past four years, walking over ditches and on empty roads along the world's longest undefended border. 
Canada has sought to stem the human tide of asylum seekers that flowed into the country starting in 2016, after Trump promised to crack down on illegal immigration. Experts have said suspending the agreement would have huge implications for the Canada-U.S. relationship.
Federal court judge Ann Marie McDonald ruled that the agreement was in violation of a section of Canada's Charter of Rights that says laws or state actions that interfere with life, liberty and security must conform to the principles of fundamental justice.
She suspended her decision for six months to give Parliament a chance to respond to the ruling, which is not final and can be appealed to the Federal Court of Appeal and then the Supreme Court if necessary.

Canada's justice ministry and immigration ministry had no immediate comment, nor did officials in the U.S. embassy in Ottawa.

A restaurant 500 metres from his establishment had to close when they recorded cases of the virus, and he has had to turn away a small number of customers who refused to wear a mask.
""It's heavy,"" said Guillou, manager of the Fils de Maman restaurant, describing the challenges of juggling the summer season and its rush of holidaymakers with the fact France is still in the grip of an epidemic.
In total, France has recorded over 30,000 deaths linked to COVID-19. Months of strict lockdown have resulted in a big drop in the numbers of people getting infected, and the numbers in hospital with the virus. 
Guillou's restaurant, in La Baule-Escoublac on France's Atlantic coast, was one of hundreds of thousands of restaurants, cafes and bars allowed to re-open when restrictions were eased.
Yet there have been isolated flare-ups of the virus in parts of France, and in neighbouring Spain some lockdown restrictions have been re-imposed to contain a surge centred on the city of Barcelona.
In La Baule this week, the beaches thronged with sunbathers and tourists flocked to the shops. 
The town mayor, Franck Louvrier, said he would be vigilant to make sure people were respecting COVID safety precautions, especially the wearing of masks in enclosed public spaces.

GAZA (Reuters) - Gazans are thronging beaches and crowding markets filled with holiday sweets and clothes as they prepare to celebrate Eid al-Adha largely free of the coronavirus restrictions affecting the Muslim festival elsewhere.
The 360 sq. km. coastal strip has had little access to the outside world for years due to an Israeli-led blockade which many Palestinians say is like living in permanent lockdown.
No cases have been recorded in the towns and refugee camps where its two million Palestinian population live, although 75 infections and one death have occurred in quarantine centres. 
Arrivals spend 21 days in the centres on orders from Hamas, the armed Islamist group that has controlled Gaza for over a decade, but other coronavirus measures, such as restaurant and school closures and bans on large gatherings, have been lifted.
The result is that Gazans are preparing much as normal ahead of Eid, which begins at the end of July, with few people wearing masks in shopping centers that are packed after sunset.
The scenes contrast with restrictions elsewhere: Saudi Arabia has capped the number of its own citizens attending the upcoming haj pilgrimage; Oman has implemented a nightly curfew and Iraq has said its curfew will last through the holiday.
""God protected us from the virus,"" said Malkeya Abdallah, 62, as she relaxed on the beach near Gaza City.
But medics are alarmed by the risks inherent in Gaza's potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely packed refugee camps and limited hospital capacity.
""We see total relaxation within the communities, the malls, the supermarkets, wedding halls, the mosques, everything is working as normal with no precautionary measures whatsoever,"" said Abdelnaser Soboh, director of the World Health Organization's Gaza office, calling for more precautions.
""The virus will eventually get (in) ... you can't isolate Gaza from the world forever."" 
On Saturday, Hamas's health and interior ministries staged a COVID-19 drill, cordoning off a busy area of Gaza City and halting traffic between towns.
The economic impact of the coronavirus is already being felt.
Eighty percent of Gazans, who have seen three wars in a dozen years, already rely on humanitarian aid. Palestinians blame the closures, which neighbouring Israel and Egypt say are needed due to security concerns.
The World Bank expects poverty in Gaza to increase from 53% to 64% due to decreased consumer demand led by potential cuts in public sector wages across the Palestinian Territories, and the potential for losses from the Strip's earlier shutdown.
Meat merchants say far fewer Palestinians buying sheep to slaughter during the four-day Eid festival.

""We would have sold 500-700 sheep by this time last year... so far, we have only sold 30-35,"" said Mahmoud Abu Warda, a livestock breeder.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The owner of Hungary's leading independent news website, index.hu, said on Wednesday it had fired its editor-in-chief, a month after the editor warned https://index.hu/english/2020/06/21/independence_of_index_in_danger_hungary_press_freedom_media that its independence from the government was at risk.
The dismissal of Szabolcs Dull increased concern among Hungarian journalists that Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government is intensifying what they say is an attack on press freedoms in Hungary to win favourable coverage.
Index, which had set its so-called ""independence barometer"" to ""in danger"" to signal what it sees as outside attempts to influence its content, is by far the largest media organisation critical of the government.
Staff at index.hu said in a statement the sacking was ""unacceptable"" and that they ""cannot regard it as anything but an open attempt at pressure, which will lead to the end of independent editorial work.""
The government, which did not immediately comment, has denied interfering in the media, but the dismissal makes another clash likely between Hungary and the European Union's executive, the European Commission.
A senior Commission official expressed concern for the independence of index.hu on July 7, saying the values it was fighting for were ""essential for democracy"", and Orban is already at odds with Brussels on several fronts.
The Commission has accused Budapest of eroding the rule of law and has initiated a legal procedure that could lead to financial sanctions against Hungary. 
But at a summit that ended on Tuesday, EU leaders put off agreement on a mechanism for tying funding for member states to conditions on the rule of law, a compromise seen by political analysts as likely to embolden Orban.
In a statement, Laszlo Bodolai, chief of the foundation that owns the website's publisher, Index.hu Zrt., said Dull had been unable to control internal tensions that arose from perceived attempts to influence the newsroom. Bodolai said that led to disarray and a drop in revenue as advertisers stayed away.
""The political independence of Index is not at risk,"" he said in a letter to staff. He did not name a new editor.
""A STRONG FORT""
Dull said he believed he was sacked because of notices he wrote on index.hu about attempts at outside influence, and also because of the warning he issued on Index's independence gauge, a graphic it has published since 2018.
""I still think the staff's worries were reasonable and as editor-in-chief I did what my duty and conscience dictated under the circumstances,"" he told Reuters. 
""Index is a strong fort which someone clearly wants to blow apart,"" he was seen telling staff in video footage obtained by Reuters. 
Longstanding concerns https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hungary-orban-media-insight/gloom-in-the-newsroom-as-hungarys-independent-media-recedes-idUSKCN1M40SP about Index's independence deepened after pro-government businessman Miklos Vaszily acquired significant control over the website's funding this year.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia agreed on Wednesday to keep pushing for a ceasefire in Libya, but Ankara said the leader of the eastern forces was not legitimate and his forces must withdraw from key positions for any credible deal to emerge.
The two countries are the main power brokers in Libya's conflict, where they support opposing sides. Russia backs the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar, while Turkey has helped the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) repel Haftar's attempt to storm the capital.
""We've just reached an agreement with Russia to work on a credible and sustainable ceasefire in Libya,"" President Tayyip Erdogan's top security adviser Ibrahim Kalin told Reuters.
Kalin said any deal must be based on a return to what he said were the Libyan frontlines in 2015, requiring Haftar's forces to pull back from the Mediterranean city of Sirte, gateway to Libya's eastern oilfields, and Jufra, an air base near the centre of the country.
""For the ceasefire to be sustainable, Jufra and Sirte should be evacuated by Haftar's forces,"" Kalin told Reuters in an interview at the presidential palace in Ankara.
The United States has said Moscow has sent warplanes to Jufra via Syria to support Russian mercenaries who are fighting alongside Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). Moscow and the LNA both deny this.
Egypt, which also backs the LNA, has threatened to send troops into neighbouring Libya if the GNA and Turkish forces try to seize Sirte. The Egyptian parliament on Sunday gave a green light for possible military intervention. 
Kalin said any Egyptian deployment in Libya would hamper efforts to end the fighting and would be risky for Cairo: ""I believe it will be a dangerous military adventure for Egypt.""
Wednesday's joint agreement by Turkey and Russia on their ceasefire efforts included a call for measures to allow humanitarian access to those in need and efforts to promote political dialogue between the rival Libya sides. 
But Kalin said Haftar had violated previous ceasefire agreements and was not a reliable partner, suggesting other figures in the east should play a role. 
""We don’t take (Haftar) as a legitimate actor anyway,"" he said. ""But there is another parliament in Tobruk. There are other players in Benghazi. The negotiations will have to take place between them.""
The LNA has itself sent fighters and weapons to bolster its defence of Sirte, already badly battered from earlier phases of warfare and chaos since the 2011 revolution against longtime autocrat Muammar Gaddafi.
Russia's Foreign Ministry says it backs a ceasefire and political talks that would culminate in united governing authorities. Russia has received senior delegations from both sides of the Libyan conflict in Moscow and tried and failed to get Haftar to sign up to ceasefire agreement.

ANKARA/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Turkey is taking its decades-old conflict with Kurdish militants deep into northern Iraq, establishing military bases and deploying armed military drones against the fighters in their mountain strongholds.
The cross-border campaign has attracted less attention than Turkey's incursions into neighbouring Syria - partly because Turkish troops have long been in Iraq - but it is part of a strategy to push the fight beyond its borders after years of bloodshed at home.
Turkey has been battling an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast by Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants that has killed 40,000 people since the 1980s and which has largely been directed from within Iraq.
After the breakdown of peace efforts in 2015, heavy fighting erupted again in Turkey. Since then President Tayyip Erdogan's government has sought to address what it says is the root of the crisis.
""The new approach aims to destroy the threat from where it begins,"" a Turkish official told Reuters.
A ground assault launched on June 17 and dubbed Operation Claw Tiger has seen Turkish troops advance up to 40 km (25 miles) inside Iraq and establish over 30 ""temporary bases"", the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
It aims to deny PKK fighters any sanctuary near the border, cut their supply lines between Iraq and Syria, and prepare the ground for a possible offensive on the main PKK stronghold around the Qandil mountains, inside Iraq on the Iranian border.
Turkey's frequent claims of military gains in a conflict far from the spotlight are difficult to verify, but analysts and an Iraqi Kurdish official say the scope of the air and ground offensives extends beyond Ankara's usual operations.
Baghdad summoned Turkey's ambassador last month to formally complain, but the central government has limited authority in the autonomous region, while the Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq is wary of antagonising Turkey, which has NATO's second largest standing army.
""Baghdad has been very quiet and we are forced to be very quiet, otherwise we run the risk of escalation with Turkey,"" an official in the KRG said.
DRONE POWER
The Iraq operation comes after Turkey launched three incursions into northern Syria in three years to drive PKK and Islamic State fighters from its borders, and then deployed forces in Idlib province to halt a Russian-backed Syrian government offensive against Syrian rebels.
Turkey has also projected power in the east Mediterranean, turning the tide of Libya's conflict by helping to repulse an attack on Tripoli, and has established military bases in the Gulf and the Horn of Africa.
Turkey's interventions under Erdogan have alarmed regional rivals Egypt and the United Arab Emirates and led to accusations from domestic opponents that he is seeking diversions from an economic crisis and political setbacks after 17 years in power.
Much of the new military muscle comes from domestically produced armed drones. In Iraq, that means Turkey can attack militants in areas once beyond its reach.
PKK casualties in Iraq had risen in the last year, with increasing numbers of veteran fighters killed in targeted strikes, the International Crisis Group (ICG) says.
""The use of drone technology appears to have significantly shifted the balance of power on the ground, allowing Turkish forces to go after militants in areas previously difficult to penetrate,"" ICG Turkey analyst Berkay Mandiraci said.
The ICG says 5,000 people have been killed in Turkey's wider conflict with the PKK since the 2015 ceasefire collapse, one tenth of them in northern Iraq. So far this year, that proportion of fatalities in Iraq has leapt to 70%.
Turkish officials say the latest fighting targets several border districts including Haftanin and Metina near Syria to the west, and regions nearer Iran including Avasin and Hakurk, a possible staging post to Qandil further south.
""The operation in Iraq aims to secure Turkey's border, prevent the passage (of PKK fighters) to Syria, and from there infiltration to Turkey,"" a second Turkish official said. ""When the time comes, (targeting) Qandil will be evaluated.""
Turkey ultimately may be guided more by progress on the ground than any response from Baghdad.
The Iraqi government is hamstrung by political infighting, an economic crisis and the prospect of more mass unrest, and its own relations with the Kurds have often been fraught - especially when its forces halted a Kurdish bid for independence in 2017. 
""From the Baghdad point of view ... the (Turkish) incursion is headed for the KRG, so there's little harm in this,"" said Bilal Wahab of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. 

""Ultimately these things require some level of respect for Iraq's sovereignty and some sort of power,"" Wahab said. ""On both counts, Iraq has become so weak that it's hard to demand that kind of respect from anyone.""

Jacob Ngarivhume, an activist and opposition politician behind the July 31 demonstrations, and freelance journalist and government critic Hopewell Chin'ono were arrested at their homes on Monday.
In court, state prosecutors accused the two of using their Twitter accounts to mobilise Zimbabweans to commit public violence by encouraging citizens to demonstrate.
Activists have called for street demonstrations on July 31 against government corruption, which they say has deepened the worst economic crisis in more than a decade.
The two men, who appeared before different magistrates, were not asked to enter a plea. They face up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
State prosecutors opposed bail, saying if they were released Ngarivhume and Chin'ono would flee the country and continue using social media to rally citizens to take part in the planned demonstrations and expose many people to the coronavirus.
A lawyer for the two, Doug Coltart, said the facts presented by the state did not disclose any offence.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday announced a night-time curfew and tightened other measures to tackle rising coronavirus infections. He said curtailing freedoms was necessary to curb the pandemic.
But the opposition says the government is using health restrictions to trample on political rights.
Mnangagwa, without providing evidence, accuses the opposition of being part of a plot against his government with the support of some Western countries.

Alex Saab was arrested in June when a plane he was traveling on landed in the West African island nation. The United States last year charged him with money laundering and sanctioned him for allegedly orchestrating a corruption network that allowed him and Maduro to profit from a state-run food subsidy program.
The U.S. Department of Justice said in June that Saab, a Colombian who also has a Venezuelan passport, was arrested pursuant to an Interpol red notice issued with respect to his indictment.
Garzon, who won fame with his attempt to extradite former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in the 1990s, is also coordinating Wikileaks founder Julian Assange's defense to fight his extradition from Britain to the United States.
In a statement Garzon's Madrid-based law firm, ILOCAD, said Saab's arrest was an example of how the Trump administration was using legal process to ""pressure Venezuela on the level of international politics.""
ILOCAD said it would contact the United Nations and African Union to demonstrate that ""Mr Saab's rights are being violated by this extradition process.""
The U.S. government has imposed crippling sanctions on Venezuela's vital oil sector to deprive the government of funds, and has indicted Maduro and over a dozen other top officials for crimes including drug trafficking and corruption.
In a statement in June, Venezuela's foreign ministry called Saab's arrest a violation of international law and said he had been traveling as an ""agent"" of the state on business to obtain humanitarian supplies to help combat the coronavirus pandemic.

The row took place in 2019 under Labour's previous leader, far-left veteran Jeremy Corbyn, whose 4-1/2 year tenure as Britain's main opposition leader was marred by persistent allegations of anti-Semitism in party ranks.
Labour's current leader, former public prosecutor Keir Starmer, has sought to draw a line under that aspect of the Corbyn era.
Corbyn's Labour was badly beaten by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives in a December election, its fourth defeat in a row. Starmer is seeking to break with the past in time for the next election, in 2024.
Labour was being sued for defamation by seven ex-employees who said they were falsely accused of acting in bad faith after they cooperated with a BBC documentary entitled ""Is Labour anti-Semitic?"".
When the film was broacast, Labour had said the staff members had ""political axes to grind"" because they did not support Corbyn's leadership. The party had also accused the BBC journalist who presented the programme of maliciously seeking to mislead the public as part of an anti-Corbyn agenda.
In a settlement read out in court on Wednesday, Labour retracted the accusations against its former employees and the BBC journalist, apologised unreservedly to all of them and agreed to pay them a substantial sum to settle the case.
""Anti-Semitism has been a stain on the Labour Party in recent years,"" a party spokesman said. ""If we are to restore the trust of the Jewish community, we must demonstrate a change of leadership.""
Corbyn, who remains a Labour lawmaker, criticised the settlement and apology, saying they were ""a political decision, not a legal one"". 
In June, Starmer sacked one of his senior team members, staunch Corbyn ally Rebecca Long-Bailey, after she tweeted an article that he said contained an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's federal and state governments are in a political tug-of-war over the Trump administration's donation of the drug hydroxychloroquine, an unproven treatment for COVID-19, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has strongly advocated the use of the hydroxychloroquine for early treatment of the coronavirus, echoing U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. government announced in May it would send 2 million doses of the medication in response to Brazil's request for aid.
Yet arguments over the cost of dividing, repackaging and distributing the tablets have left the medicine sitting in storage at a Sao Paulo airport since it arrived in mid-June, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive talks.
Bolsonaro's administration expects state governments to handle the distribution costs, but many governors have disputed his claims about hydroxychloroquine and are refusing to pay, according to the sources.
A meeting aimed at resolving the issue is set for next week between Brazil's Health Ministry, state health secretaries and municipal representatives, they said.
The Health Ministry said under its guidelines for the use of hydroxychloroquine that the drug, currently in packages of 100 tablets, should be distributed to patients in packages of 12. 
The ministry said it is consulting with health regulator Anvisa and official laboratories on the matter.
Carlos Lula, the state health secretary in Maranhao, told Reuters his state does not have resources to cover the costs.
Lula is also the president of the association of state health secretaries Conass. The association has said that there is no basis for recommending the use of the drug for COVID-19.

Lula said in a text message that states should be given the option to use hydroxychloroquine for its proven uses, such as preventing malaria or treating autoimmune diseases, rather than on COVID-19 patients. For those treatments, the drug could remain in its current packaging, he said.

371,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 08:41AM ET</span>",United States and China enter a new cold war: Kemp,"By John Kemp
LONDON (Reuters) - The abrupt closure of China’s consulate in Houston marks the latest incident in a rapidly escalating conflict between China and the United States.
Future historians will probably focus on 2020 as the point when intensifying strategic competition between the United States and China turned into a new cold war.
The two superpowers are now engaged in conflict across multiple geographic theatres (South Asia, Southeast Asia, Australia, Europe, Africa and Latin America) and multiple vectors (trade, investment, technology, espionage, international institutions, health policy, naval, air power, missiles and territorial disputes).
The superpowers have articulated a lengthening list of grievances and almost no significant interests in common. Both are attempting to push third countries into an alliance system that would see the world carved into two decoupled blocs. Red versus Blue. With us or against us. Total confrontation. Basically the definition of cold war.
Some policymakers and strategic studies analysts still hesitate to employ the cold war concept, wary of the analogy with the decades-long U.S./USSR conflict and its implications for international relations in the medium and long-term.
But there is no doubt both countries increasingly see and describe the conflict in existential terms. If it looks like a cold war, and sounds like a cold war, it probably is a cold war, and the concept illuminates more than it hides.
ANTECEDENTS
The current U.S./China cold war has been building for some years, just like the U.S./USSR cold war experience which is commonly dated from 1947 but where antecedents were apparent in the latter part of the Second World War when the two countries were still nominally Allies in the United Nations.
There have been growing complaints about intellectual property theft, trade imbalances, espionage, diplomatic containment and encirclement and territorial disputes for almost a decade. So just as the U.S./USSR cold war really started much earlier (it was already evident in 1945) the U.S./China cold war began long ago.
But in terms of a point where intensifying strategic competition turns into outright cold conflict, 2020 seems to mark the qualitative and quantitative turning point, and serves as much as a convenient date as 1947.
The coronavirus pandemic and sharpest economic recession for a century have heightened tensions and the conflict has now become a central issue in the U.S. presidential election with both major candidates determined to appear tough on China.
However, like the U.S./USSR cold war, the U.S./China one is likely to span multiple U.S. administrations and generations of Chinese leaders, with periods of more intense conflict alternating with detente.
The conflict is not personal between U.S. President Donald Trump and China's President Xi Jinping. It increasingly encompasses most of the elite groups in both countries.
As patriotic hawks push for a tough line, there is diminishing political, diplomatic and intellectual space for pro-engagement viewpoints in the United States or China.
Changes in the top leaders on either side will not necessarily end the conflict, any more than the replacement of Truman and Stalin ended the U.S./USSR conflict.
RESOLUTION
Like the U.S./USSR cold war, the U.S./China conflict is likely to continue until the costs become intolerable for one or both sides.
The U.S./USSR conflict remained mostly a cold war, with actual military combat confined to proxy wars in developing countries such as Korea, Vietnam and Afghanistan.
The U.S./USSR conflict is often portrayed as a successful example of managing international tensions.
But at the time it was not obvious the conflict would remain cold and not escalate into a hot one, for example during the Cuban missile crisis.
The current U.S./China conflict is also a classic example of Thucydides Trap, where a rising power (ancient Athens now modern China) challenges an incumbent one (Sparta now the United States.
History suggests such conflicts often end in unintended but real military confrontation, such as that between Britain and Germany in the early 20th century (“Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap?” Allison, 2017).
Beyond the economic conflict, there is a long list of potential flashpoints that could spark actual fighting, including Taiwan and the South China Sea.
Some Cold Warriors on both sides welcome the “strategic clarity” of more open competition and conflict between the United States and China.
A Manichean conflict between two blocs, decoupled economically and diplomatically, offers a tempting re-run of the great conflict of the second half of the 20th century, which ended with the triumph of the United States and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
But that conflict dominated global politics for four decades and the eventual outcome was not obvious in the 1960s and 1970s.
There is no guarantee the U.S./China cold war will follow the same trajectory or end the same way.
Proponents of a confrontational approach between the two superpowers should be careful what they wish for.

MINSK (Reuters) - Dismissed by the incumbent as too fragile to run Belarus because of their gender, three women have joined forces to try to unseat President Alexander Lukashenko, a man the United States once called Europe's last dictator.
Lukashenko, who has ruled the country for over a quarter of a century, has cracked down to try to snuff out rare and sustained protests against him ahead of a presidential election next month, jailing rivals and arresting dissenters.
He faces his biggest challenge in years due to frustration over his hands-off handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances over the economy and human rights. 
With his male challengers either barred from running or in prison, two of their wives and a female campaign team member of another have united to try to beat him in the Aug. 9 election. 
Svetlana Tikhanouskaya, whose husband, Syarhei, spent time in solitary confinement, has become the surprise leading challenger to Lukashenko, a 65-year-old former Soviet collective farm boss.
Tikhanouskaya launched her candidacy after her husband, a popular blogger who campaigned against Lukashenko, was arrested in May on what she says were trumped up charges. 
Police say they also found an unexplained $900,000 hidden in their sofa. Tikhanouskaya said she knew nothing about the money.
Lukashenko is expected to extend his grip on power despite the challenge. Western observers do not judge elections in the country to be free and fair.
The EU delegation to non-EU member Belarus said in July that excluding two of Lukashenko's election rivals ""undermines the overall integrity and democratic nature of the elections"", while Europe's election watchdog expressed concern about ""key aspects of the electoral process"".
But a Lukashenko win may not quell public anger, say analysts, and Tikhanouskaya and her allies are well placed to continue to lead a protest movement.
As a candidate, Tikhanouskaya's first priority is to free all political prisoners and rerun the elections to include all candidates who were barred from standing.
SELFIES IN THE STREET
By Sunday, holding a bouquet of flowers in her left hand and punching the air with her right, she was standing on stage having amassed the largest opposition election rally Belarus has seen in decades.
The people of Belarus ""do not want to live in misery anymore, they want to live in a free country where they do not grab people in the street, put them into a police van and then send them to jail for an invented reason"", she said.
Tikhanouskaya's challenge is being supported by two other women who represent two different opposition campaigns.
They are Maria Kolesnikova, a member of the campaign team for Viktor Babariko, who was detained and accused of financial misdeeds, and Veronika Tsepkalo, wife of Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador to the United States who was barred from standing after the central election commission disallowed some of the signatures he needed to collect to become a candidate.
An image of the three women posing for the camera – Tikhanouskaya clenching her fist, Kolesnikova making a heart sign, and Tsepkalo making a 'V' for victory sign, has quickly spread. 
They attend events together, sparking jokes that they resemble a female rock band and people ask for selfies in the street.
Lukashenko has said he respects women but that ""society is not mature enough to vote for a woman"". The burden of the presidency would cause her to ""collapse, poor thing"", he said.

After receiving an anonymous threat that her children would be taken away if she pressed on with her campaign, Tikhanouskaya has sent them abroad to an undisclosed location.

375,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Former Ivory Coast minister to run for president in break with ruling party,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Marcel Amon-Tanoh, a longtime ally of President Alassane Ouattara and until recently his foreign minister, declared on Wednesday he would run in Ivory Coast's presidential election in October, breaking with the ruling party. 
The campaign was thrown into uncertainty earlier this month when Ouattara's choice to succeed him after a decade in power, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, died suddenly, leaving the ruling RHDP party scrambling to choose a replacement candidate.
The Oct. 31 election is seen as a key test of stability for Ivory Coast, the world's top cocoa producer. Ouattara's first election win in 2010 sparked a civil war fought largely along regional and ethnic lines that killed about 3,000 people. 
Political tensions have been rising in recent months. The RHDP said on Monday it had asked Ouattara to go back on his decision not to stand for a third term. His opponents say running again would violate constitutional limits. 
Late last year, the government accused another presidential hopeful, former prime minister and ex-rebel leader Guillaume Soro, of plotting a coup against Ouattara's government. He is now in exile in Europe. 
Amon-Tanoh resigned in March as foreign minister, a post he had held since late 2016, after Ouattara announced that Gon Coulibaly would be the RHDP's candidate. Amon-Tanoh had been widely seen as angling to be the candidate. 
""We have built bridges, but we have forgotten to construct bridges between men,"" he said in a speech announcing his candidacy, an implicit rebuke to Ouattara's record on reconciling Ivorians after the civil war. 
Source close to Amon-Tanoh said he would create his own political party in the coming days. It was not clear how much support he would be able to mobilise independent of Ouattara, to whom he has been a close ally for decades and previously served as presidential chief of staff. 
The RHDP said on Monday that Ouattara would announce whether he planned to run in the next few days. The other main declared candidate in the race is Henri Konan Bedie, who was Ivory Coast's president from 1993-1999.

(Reuters) - A Chinese giant panda at South Korea’s Everland amusement park has given birth to a cub, the zoo said on Wednesday, the first baby panda born in the country and a rare event for an endangered species.
The seven-year-old female panda named Ai Bao mated with eight-year-old male panda Le Bao, in late March and gave birth to a healthy cub at 21:49 local time (1249GMT) on Monday night in Yongin, the zoo said.
The panda couple’s first cub was confirmed to be a female measuring 16.5 cm (6.5 inches) and weighing 197 grams (7 oz), the zoo said, adding that both baby and mother pandas appear healthy.
In footage released by Everland, Ai Bao was seen crawling along the ground before giving birth and licking the wriggling cub.
The zoo made a special shelter for the baby panda, who will make her public debut in about five or six months' time, once she can walk and eat bamboo. Before that both she and her mother will stay behind the scenes for health reasons.
Giant pandas are one of the world’s most endangered species. Female pandas are able to conceive only once a year for one to three days in March to April, which makes reproduction difficult, the zoo said in a statement.
The pair arrived in South Korea from Sichuan Province of China on a 15-year loan in 2016, as agreed by the two countries during a summit in 2014.
China has been sending its black and white ambassadors abroad in a sign of goodwill since the 1950s as part of what is known as 'panda diplomacy'.

The pandas are the first to arrive in South Korea from China since 1994. The cub is expected to return to China in three or four years' time, the zoo said.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - A vote in Greenland showed on Wednesday a majority in favour of keeping up a statue of Danish-Norwegian coloniser Hans Egede that was vandalised as anti-racism protests reached the Arctic.
The statue had red paint and the word ""decolonize"" daubed on it last month when Black Lives Matter protests were sweeping the world over the death of African American George Floyd after a white policeman pressed a knee on his neck.
Critics say the statue in Greenland's capital Nuuk is a symbol of oppression by former colonial ruler Denmark and some want it put in a museum. 
But in the poll, 923 people voted for it to stay while 600 wanted it gone, according to the local municipality.
Greenland was a Danish colony until 1953, when it became a formal part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Today, it enjoys broad autonomy, but still relies heavily on grants from Denmark. 
Egede, also known as the ""Apostle of Greenland"", travelled there in 1721 to do missionary work among the Inuit inhabitants. His stay marked the beginning of Greenland's colonial era but was relatively unbloody compared with other European powers.
""It does not surprise me that there is a majority for the statue to stay, but that does not mean we should do nothing, because there is still a large minority who wants it removed,"" Greenlandic lawmaker Aaja Chemnitz Larsen told Reuters.
About 23,000 of Greenland's 56,000 people were eligible to vote in the poll that ran from July 3-21. Lack of publicity and summer holidays may have affected turnout.
The fate of the statue remains subject to a final decision by the local council. But Nuuk's mayor Charlotte Ludvigsen has said it would require a large majority of up to 75% in favour of removal for her to process the case.
Monuments are under scrutiny in various nations, including Britain where a slave trader's statue was toppled in Bristol and World War Two hero Winston Churchill's statue in London was daubed with graffiti calling him ""racist.""

Denmark's Egede, who founded Nuuk, formerly known as Godthåb (meaning ""Good Hope""), tried to teach Christianity to as many Inuits as possible, but smallpox killed many of the newly-converted. Following the death of his wife, also from smallpox, Egede returned to Denmark in 1736.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - A group of Palestinian cyclists say they were attacked by Israelis in the occupied West Bank after a popular trail app landed them on a remote path dotted with Jewish settlements.
Avid cyclist Amer Kurdi set out on Saturday with his brother and three others on what was supposed to be an 80-km (50-mile) ride, using the cycling, hiking, and mountain biking app Komoot to chart a path north from the Palestinian village of Birzeit.
The West Bank, captured by Israel in a 1967 war, is scattered with Israeli settlements which its 3 million Palestinians mostly cannot enter, as well as checkpoints and military bases that Israel says it needs for its security.
Over an hour into their ride, Kurdi said Komoot led them east towards a rocky path near the Israeli settlement of Shilo. He said a group of Hebrew-speaking men, whom the cyclists later took to be Israeli settlers, approached and asked where they were from.
Kurdi, 30, replied that they were from the Palestinian city of Ramallah. Soon after, the men -- Kurdi estimates there were five or six -- started throwing stones at them, using T-shirts to hide their faces, Kurdi and his brother, Samer, said.
""The others managed to run away, but I tripped and fell,"" Samer, 28, said. ""When I got up, a settler was behind me, and he started beating me with a metal rod.""
Photos the cyclists took after the incident, which they reported to Israel's police, show Samer's legs and arms bruised and bloodied. 
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said they are investigating.
Palestinians complain that navigation apps fail to grasp the West Bank's complexity.
Asked for comment, Komoot said it regretted the incident but that its service is not specifically optimised for route planning ""through areas of political unrest"".
Amer Kurdi says the incident will not keep him from cycling.
""I'll wear a camera. I'll be more careful when using apps,"" he said. 

""But we won't stop. We will stand up for our right to bike.""

The British parliament's intelligence and security committee said in a report published on Tuesday that Russia had interfered in the 2014 Scottish independence referendum but it had not seen hard evidence of Russian meddling in the Brexit vote.
While the lawmakers noted allegations of meddling in Brexit, and some studies pointed to Russian attempts to influence the campaign, they said the British government and intelligence agencies had not sought out evidence of Russian interference.
""There needs to be some evidence that there's an issue there - which there isn't,"" Shapps told Sky when asked if there should be a further investigation of possible Russian meddling in the European Union referendum.
""I don't think it's the case that the intelligence services took their eye off the ball,"" Shapps told Sky.
The victory of opponents of EU membership in the 2016 referendum result sent shockwaves across the world as it signalled that one of the pillars of the West would split from the post-World Two attempts at European integration. 
Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in the West, casting the United States and Britain as gripped by anti-Russian hysteria. The British government has repeatedly said there is no evidence of successful Russian interference in Brexit. 
The so-called Russia Report by parliament's intelligence committee called for British spies to produce an assessment of Russian interference in the EU referendum.
The report casts Russia as a hostile power which posed a significant threat to Britain and the West across a range of fronts, from espionage and cyber to election meddling and laundering dirty money.
""The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions - if any - were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth,"" the report said. ""The UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money.""
""It offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London 'laundromat',"" the report said.

Asked about dirty Russian money, Shapps said: ""This is not the place to come and launder money.""

Mlangeni, who spent 26 years in jail and was the last of the eight defendants in the trial to die, had been admitted to hospital following an abdominal complaint, South Africa's presidency said in a statement.
President Cyril Ramaphosa, who fought with Mlangeni for racial equality and an end to white minority rule, described him as a ""beacon of ethical leadership and care for humanity"" whose death marked the end of a generation of history and left the future in the hands of those who remained. 
""With his passing... Mlangeni has indeed passed the baton to his compatriots to build the South Africa he fought to liberate and to reconstruct,"" he said.
Mlangeni championed the values needed to do this, including dignity and opportunity for all, and his ""dramatic life was a unique example of heroism and humility inhabiting the same person,"" Ramaphosa said.
Mlangeni was born in 1925. In 1951, he joined the youth wing of the African National Congress (ANC), which is now in power, and was later sent abroad for military training.
On his return in 1963, he was arrested and stood trial alongside seven others including Mandela in what became known as the Rivonia trial, named after the suburb of Johannesburg where some of them were arrested.
Mlangeni was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent with Mandela to Robben Island prison, the main jail used at the time for Black male anti-apartheid prisoners.
After his release, he served as a member of parliament and lived in the township of Soweto, outside Johannesburg, until his death.

Defeated in the 2018 general election amid widespread outrage over allegedly rampant graft in his government, Najib is facing multiple charges of corruption and abuse of power linked to billions of dollars Malaysian prosecutors say was siphoned off from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
A separate U.S. Department of Justice investigation to track down assets bought with funds allegedly stolen from 1MDB was the biggest case pursued by the department under its kleptocracy programme.
Najib has denied all wrongdoing.
In his ruling, High Court judge Ahmad Bache said former premiers are not exempt from paying tax and that Najib must pay his ""debt"" to the government, according to the Bernama report. Tax authorities filed the suit last June to recover unpaid taxes accumulated by Najib between 2011 and 2017, plus penalties and interest.
Najib had served as prime minister from 2009 to 2018. He co-founded 1MDB, from which some $4.5 billion in assets were stolen, according to U.S. and Malaysian authorities.
A separate court will deliver its verdict in a case against Najib on July 28, the first of several corruption trials he faces linked to the 1MDB scandal.
Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) unexpectedly returned to power in a coalition led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin nearly five months ago, though Najib no longer leads the party.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Keitumetse Modise was already struggling to juggle her appointments as a freelance beautician while home-schooling her daughter during South Africa's nearly four-month-old COVID-19 lockdown. The last thing she needed was the lights going out.
But after being forced to turn kitchen tables into classrooms and bedrooms into home offices, pandemic-weary South Africans now face an added challenge in the form of a familiar headache: rolling blackouts. 
Months of pandemic-induced shutdown and reduced demand had actually resulted in uncharacteristically reliable electricity for those stuck at home, as South Africa's creaking grid was given some respite.
Since last week however, with restrictions easing and businesses cautiously reopening, planned blackouts - known locally as loadshedding - are back and with them the frustration of unstable internet, lost revenue and disrupted schedules.
Modise, a 33-year-old single mother, has had to push back work appointments to ensure she can help with online schoolwork when there is power. ""You do what you have to,"" she said.
South Africa, the continent's most advanced economy, suffered its worst ever power cuts late last year as debt-crippled state utility Eskom imposed cuts to ward off a grid overload. 
After nearly four months without nationwide outages, Eskom conducted a fresh round in July, with a spokesman saying ""it would be naive to think we are done."" 
Many South Africans now expect them to again become a part of daily life, complicating efforts to work and learn online. Focused power cuts targeting mainly poor townships with unpaid electricity bills have meanwhile continued. 
The timing could hardly be worse. Now a global COVID-19 hot spot, South Africa is hurtling towards the peak of its outbreak, topping 380,000 total infections this week.
Schools reopened for some year groups but millions of children are still trying to follow lessons from home.
Primary school teacher Ronald Maswanganyi has faced two weeks of power cuts, sometimes in the middle of his teaching.
""There's nothing I can do except call my boss, the principal, and tell him I can't continue with the lesson,"" he said. 
The return of loadshedding also threatens to deepen economic misery in a country already in a recession, with the unemployment rate topping 30% before the pandemic hit. Things have only worsened with widespread layoffs. 
Wellness firm Body20 lost 30% of its revenue due to the lockdown, so began offering personal trainer sessions online. 

""Our frustration is that no matter how much you try to adapt and innovate to cope with something as catastrophic as COVID-19, suddenly you don't have electricity,"" said Body20's CEO Philip Hughes.

Ali Kamel Mohsen, from south Lebanon, was killed by an Israeli air strike near Damascus airport, according to a death notice declaring him a martyr with the Islamic Resistance, a reference to Hezbollah, and which was confirmed by the group.
It was an apparent reference to a strike on Monday night that Western intelligence sources said hit a major Iranian-backed ammunition depot on the edge of the Syrian capital.
Syrian state media said air defences had intercepted a new Israeli ""aggression"" above the capital Damascus.
Hezbollah has deployed fighters in Syria as part of Iranian-backed efforts to support President Bashar al-Assad in a conflict that spiralled out of protests against his rule in 2011.
Following the killing of two Hezbollah members in Damascus last August, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader, vowed it would respond if Israel killed any more of its fighters in the country.

Putin named Mikhail Degtyaryov, 39, as the new acting governor of the Khabarovsk region on Monday after Sergei Furgal, the previous regional head, was arrested on murder charges he denies and taken to Moscow seven time zones away to be tried.
Hundreds took to the streets on Tuesday to protest the Kremlin's handling of the political crisis after Degtyaryov, who is not from the region, flew to Khabarovsk to take the helm.
The tensions are a headache for the Kremlin, which is trying to troubleshoot a sharp COVID-19-induced drop in real incomes and keep a lid on unrest as the economy stutters. 
""To those shouting 'Degtyaryov - leave!', I won't leave. There's work to do, you understand?"" Degtyaryov said, adding that a huge backlog of work had built up since Furgal's arrest. 
""If I leave, someone else will come,"" he said in a video clip posted on Instagram. 
Furgal's detention has unleashed an unusual and sustained series of anti-Kremlin protests.
Born in the Far East and a member of the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR), Furgal came to power in 2018 after defeating an opponent from the ruling United Russia party that backs Putin and dominates regional and parliamentary politics. 
Some of his supporters see his prosecution as political retribution for dealing the party a rare defeat. 
The case has highlighted anger among some in the Far East over what they see as policies emanating from detached Moscow-based authorities on the other side of the country.

The two adult men were carrying weapons when they were fatally shot by troops on Saturday near the district capital of Nduga, said Colonel Gusti Nyoman Suriastawa, a military spokesman, adding that a gun, cash, and a phone that belonged to a soldier were retrieved from their bodies. 
The military in a statement said the two men were linked to an armed separatist group led by Egianus Kogoya, a leader from the Free Papua Movement.
""Why would they carry a pistol with them? Why would they snatch the weapons and a backpack belonging to the military?"", Suriastawa said, insisting those killed were not civilians.
Papua has been plagued by long-running separatist tensions since the former Dutch colony was incorporated into Indonesia after a U.N.-backed 1969 referendum called the Act of Free Choice, which has been widely criticised by human rights groups. 
Sebby Sambom, a spokesman for the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), said the victims had no connection to the separatist movement.
It followed a similar incident in February, when the army said it killed a 18-year-old Papuan separatist in a shootout. The TPNPB said was victim was a civilian and no gunfight happened. [nL4N2AJ1OL]
Indonesian human rights lawyer Veronica Koman told Reuters the separatist label was irrelevant and the men should have been arrested. 
""That was just (an) express killing. Even if they were members of the TPNPB, they were supposed to be tried then served justice,"" she said. ""Those were extrajudicial killings.""
Records by rights group Amnesty International showed the father and son were refugees among thousands who fled a military crackdown in 2018 in the Nduga area, in response to a separatist attack on a group of construction workers.

The Rohingya men were among 40 refugees convicted last month by a magistrates court on the northwestern island of Langkawi for entering Malaysia by boat without a valid permit. All 40 were also sentenced to seven months' jail. 
Muslim-majority Malaysia has long been a favoured destination for Rohingya seeking a better life after escaping a 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar and, more recently, refugee camps in Bangladesh.
But Malaysia, which does not recognise refugees, has recently turned away boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya, saying it cannot take in more migrants because of a struggling economy as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Alor Setar High Court, in Kedah state, set aside the caning penalty after reviewing the cases against 27 Rohingya men, said Collin Andrew, the refugees' lawyer. 
In its review, the court decided caning would be inhumane as the men were refugees and did not have any prior history of crime or violence, Andrew said in a statement. 
""Today's decision is laudable as it demonstrates the promotion and protection of human rights by the High Court,"" he said. 
Under Malaysia's Immigration Act, anyone who illegally enters the country can face a 10,000 ringgit ($2,345) fine, up to five years' jail as well as six strokes of a cane.
In the past, courts have normally opted for caning when accused had committed an act of violence, a repeat offence, or threatened public order, Andrew said. 
Several rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch had urged Malaysia not to cane the refugees. 
The court also ordered for six Rohingya teenagers, who had been convicted as adults and sentenced to seven months' jail, to be released to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR following the completion of their detention on Monday, Andrew said.

Taiwan has complained that China has stepped up threatening military activities near Taiwan in recent months. Beijing has not renounced the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control.
""Looking on the long-term trend, China appears to be gradually stepping up its military preparedness, especially in air or on the waters near Taiwan,"" Wu told reporters. 
""What China is doing now is continuing to ramp up preparedness to solve the Taiwan issue,"" he said.
""The threat is on the rise."" 
Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country's determination to defend its sovereignty.
Taiwan's defence ministry in June reported eight incidents of intrusion of Chinese military planes in its air defence identification zone, in which Taiwan jets gave radio warnings to usher the intruders out of the airspace.
Wu said such intrusions ""happened almost every day"" in June and were ""much more frequent"" than what the government had disclosed to the public. He said China has also made several ""simulated"" military attacks on Taiwan. 
""These behaviors worry us,"" Wu said, adding that Taiwan was deepening its security ties with allies, including the United States which has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer and main arms supplier.
Wu said attacking Taiwan could be a ""very convenient scapegoat"" for the Chinese government to divert domestic pressure, which he said is struggling with a fast-slowing economy amid the coronavirus pandemic and the current wave of floods. 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who won re-election by a landslide in January pledging to stand up to China, has made military modernisation a priority. The island unveiled its largest defence spending increase in more than a decade last year.
Taiwan, one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship, conducted live-fire exercises simulating the repulsion of an invading force last week, with Tsai saying it showed their determination to defend the island.

""Go To Travel"" - dubbed ""Go To Trouble"" by some local media - offers subsidies of up to 50% on trips to and from prefectures excluding Tokyo, which was removed from the programme last week after infections surged to new highs.
But many of Japan's governors wanted the campaign delayed or amended out of fear it would spread the virus to rural areas with low infection numbers, while a Mainichi newspaper poll this week showed 69% of the public wanted the programme cancelled entirely.
The criticism underlines the public's growing exasperation with what critics say are mixed messages as the government tries to boost the economy while containing the virus. 
""There is no change to our stance to cautiously restart economic activity, while asking the public to cooperate in preventing the spread of the coronavirus,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters on Wednesday when asked about the campaign.
Governor Yuriko Koike, however, urged Tokyo residents to stay home during a four-day weekend beginning Thursday.
""It's essential for the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions to refrain from making unnecessary outings,"" Koike said on Tuesday evening.
Many in the travel industry were frustrated with what they said was a lack of clarity.
""It's clear the government is scrambling and was totally unprepared. It's also so hard to get information about this scheme because things change a lot,"" said a general manager of a mid-sized business hotel in Osaka, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.
Hiroaki Gofuku, the president and general manager of Hotel Nikko Osaka, said he hoped that the campaign would be a boost for the ailing tourism industry, but that he was also cautious not to be overly optimistic.
""Tokyo is our big market,"" he said. ""With this mess, we're actually seeing more cancellations.""
Economic Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura is also widely expected to announce a delay to the phased reopening of stadiums and events at a meeting on Wednesday.
The government was planning to ease restrictions for stadiums and concert venues starting in August, allowing them to operate at half of maximum capacity. But they are widely expected to reverse their plans with daily infections rising.
Tokyo announced on Wednesday morning that daily infections were expected to reach over 230.

Japan has not seen the kind of rapid spread of the coronavirus that has killed tens of thousands in other countries. But new cases in Tokyo and other cities have sounded alarm bells for a country that had thought it had the virus under control.

Ressa, a Time Magazine Person of the Year in 2018 for fighting media intimidation, is facing several government lawsuits that have caused international concern about harassment of journalists in the Philippines, a country long seen as a standard bearer for press freedom in Asia. 
Ressa, 56, who is chief executive of the news site Rappler, was convicted of libel last month and sentenced to up to six year in prison, a ruling widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms under Duterte's increasingly popular authoritarianism. She was freed on bail.
Ressa's latest court appearance is over accusations Rappler falsified tax returns by omitting the proceeds of a sale of depositary receipts to foreign investors, which later became the securities regulator's basis to revoke its license. 
""These charges are politically motivated, it is meant to harass and intimidate, it is meant to be a war of attrition to try to make us afraid to keep reporting,"" Ressa, a dual U.S.-Filipino citizen, told reporters after she pleaded not guilty to the charges. ""The best response to it is to keep reporting.""
Rappler has repeatedly challenged the accuracy of Duterte's public statements and his justification for his controversial foreign policy.
It has also reported on alleged atrocities in his war on drugs and probed what it says are massive, state-orchestrated social media hate campaigns against Duterte's critics.
Duterte has publicly lashed out at Rappler, calling it a ""fake news outlet"" sponsored by American spies. 
In the tax evasion case, the securities regulator alleges that Rappler allowed foreigners to illegally own shares in a domestic media firm.
Rappler, a startup, has maintained foreigners never owned shares, but were allowed to invest without voting rights or involvement in operations. Rappler is still operating pending its appeal against its license being revoked.
Media watchdogs and human rights activists say the charges against Ressa are part of a broader strategy to silence or humiliate opponents of Duterte.
Earlier this month, his allies in Congress voted overwhelmingly in favour of denying top broadcaster ABS-CBN's bid to renew its 25-year license, an outcome that Duterte had repeatedly promised would happen because of its refusal to air some of his election campaign commercials.
""It is shocking where we are right now,"" Ressa said.
""It is unthinkable that ABS-CBN shut down. This is the perfect storm where the pandemic and lockdown enabled the government to quickly consolidate power."" 

Presidential spokesman Harry Roque did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but he has repeatedly said Duterte supports freedom of speech and any media facing legal cases are for breaking the law, not for their reporting.

The landslide occurred on Tuesday when 1.5 million cubic metres of earth fell into a tributary of the Yangtze river near the city of Enshi in Hubei province, the Xinhua news agency said, citing local flood control authorities.
China's state weather bureau said on Wednesday that the country was hit by fresh rounds of torrential rain this week, further raising flood risks throughout the country. 
Red alerts have been declared in the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi, which are bisected by the Yangtze. China's water resources ministry also warned on Tuesday that water levels in the Yangtze and adjoining lakes would continue to rise. 
Ministry officials said they needed to keep a close eye on water levels at the Three Gorges Dam, which has been storing huge volumes of water in order to ease downstream flood risks and is now 16 metres higher than its official warning level.
China's giant dams, designed to contain floods and generate electricity, have come under heavy scrutiny in recent weeks. While officials have talked up their role in reducing flood peaks, critics say they not only fail to protect against extreme weather but also end up cutting flood storage capacity.
Dams block the flow of sediment and reduce the ability of downstream flood plains and wetlands to absorb flood waters, said Darrin Magee, a professor at the Hobart and William Smith Colleges who specialises in China's water issues. 
The need to generate power can also undermine flood control efforts, he added.

""Flood control requires retaining water, and power production requires letting it out,"" he said.

The case of Yin Zi Qin, 23, is the latest in a series in the city-state involving university students where the punishment has been viewed by some as light.
Widespread public criticism of last Friday's sentencing has seen women's rights group AWARE warn that it could have a detrimental impact on public perceptions of violence against women.
Law minister K Shanmugam said on Tuesday he had asked for a review of penalties for such cases, the relative punishment for different offences and the extent to which educational background should be a relevant factor in sentencing.
Yin's attack happened after his girlfriend had broken up with him via WhatsApp in May 2019, case records show.
The following day, the dentistry student went to her house with roses to ask her to take him back. After she declined, he gripped her by the neck, pressed his thumb against her eye causing it to bleed, and she blacked out and fainted.
Yin was charged for voluntarily causing harm, an offence punishable by jail of up to two years. His short detention means he will not have a criminal record. He will have to perform community service and undergo rehabilitation.
Yin could not be immediately reached for comment. The public prosecutor said it does not plan to appeal the case.
Earlier in the year, probation for a student who molested a woman on a train sparked a similar outcry, and he was jailed for two weeks after the prosecution appealed. 
The case of a student who protested against what she perceived as a light sentence for a male peer who filmed her in the shower sparked a debate on sexual harassment last year.

NIAGARA FALLS, Ontario (Reuters) - The tourist hotspot of Niagara Falls has gained a new photo-op for social distancing Canadian visitors on board ferries taking them into the mist of the falls: crowds of Americans.
Although cases of COVID-19 continue to rise across the United States, neighboring Canada has largely managed to contain the spread of the virus, helped by strict social distancing measures and mandatory masks in several jurisdictions.
At the famous waterfalls on the U.S.-Canadian border, Canadian ferries are limited to just six passengers per boat, out of a 700 person capacity. But on the U.S. side, the ferries are operating at 50% capacity, according to Maid of the Mist boat tours.
""We actually took a picture of the (American) boat,"" said Julie Pronovost, visiting from Quebec with her family on Tuesday. ""I don't find that it's very safe to be on a boat like that. It's much better here.""
Maid of the Mist could not immediately be reached for comment but its website said it was following the guidance of New York State public health officials. The boats contain markers to keep visitors spaced out, and face coverings are compulsory, among other safety changes, it said.
Mory DiMaurizio, general manager and vice president of Canada's Hornblower Niagara Cruises, said the limits placed on its business by the Ontario provincial government were ""disappointing"" and that it was ""frustrating"" to see the American boats relatively full.
""However we've made lemonade out of lemons,"" DiMaurizio said, referring to a new VIP cruise the company has created - a near-empty boat, plus a meal and funicular ride included with the ticket. Health precautions include temperature checks and mandatory masks.
The popularity of the C$69.95 ($52.00) per person cruise has ""actually surprised us,"" DiMaurizio said.
The United States reported 57,777 new COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday, compared with Canada's 786. Since the outbreak began, the United States has reported around 118 coronavirus cases per 10,000 residents, while Canada has around 30.
Canadian authorities are dealing with both unwanted tourists slipping though the border and permitted travelers - including essential workers, those en route to Alaska, and families reuniting - who break the strict quarantine laws, causing concerns about possible outbreaks in several provinces.
Tourists at the falls on Tuesday said they felt much safer with the six person per boat limit.
""I'm glad I'm in Canada,"" said Amanda Barnes of Brampton, Ontario. ""You can see why the pandemic is raging in the United States and not in Canada when you look at the difference between the boats.""

401,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 22, 2020 12:05AM ET</span>",Russian court to rule in trial of historian who found Stalin-era graves,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court is set to deliver its verdict on Wednesday in the closed-door trial of a historian accused of sexually assaulting his adopted daughter, a case his lawyer says was fabricated to punish him for documenting Stalin-era crimes. 
State prosecutors have asked the court to jail Yuri Dmitriev, who denies wrongdoing, for 15 years. The 64-year-old was cleared of similar charges in 2018, but that ruling was annulled and he was arrested on a new charge the same year.
Wednesday's verdict will also be handed down in camera.
Viktor Anufriev, Dmitriev's lawyer, told a news conference this month that his client had done nothing wrong. In June, he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that Dmitriev was being tried and held on trumped-up charges.
Rights groups and other supporters believe the case is politically motivated and that Dmitriev has been targeted for his work exposing state repression that took place under dictator Josef Stalin in 1937-38.
They say his work is no longer welcome in a modern Russia where the dominant state narrative is of a great nation rising from its knees. 
After the Soviet breakup, Dmitriev found a mass grave containing thousands of bodies in the forest of Sandarmokh in northwest Russia dating from the Stalin-era Great Terror. He has worked to identify individual victims. 
The Kremlin has said it is not involved in the case. Asked about whether it is driven by politics, state prosecutors have said it based on real evidence. 
The European Union has said the charges against Dmitriev are questionable, and human rights advocates have campaigned for Dmitriev's release since he was arrested in 2016 on child pornography charges also involving his adopted daughter. 

He was acquitted of those charges in 2018, but the supreme court in the Karelia region overturned the ruling after an appeal by the prosecution and state investigators opened a new criminal case into suspected sexual assault.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A small South Korean survey of people with no history of COVID-19, but living in a city with the most cases, showed that one in nine had antibodies to the novel coronavirus, indicating the virus may have spread more widely than thought.
The study said based on the survey, roughly 185,290 people could have contracted the virus in Daegu city, which is the country's fourth-largest city with a population of 2.5 million.
""It was estimated that the number of undiagnosed missing cases may be 27-fold higher than the number of confirmed cases based on PCR testing in Daegu,"" the study said.
Daegu city recorded 6,886 coronavirus cases alone as of June 6, said the study published in the Journal of Korean Medical Science (JKMS) on July 16, but announced by the journal on Tuesday night according to local media.
The study done between May 25 and June 5 followed 198 people in Daegu city who had never been tested for COVID-19, and found 15 of them, or 7.6%, had antibodies.
That is a much higher infection rate than that found in a survey of more than 3,000 people in South Korea that excluded Daegu, in which only one person showed neutralising antibodies to the novel coronavirus earlier this month.
Antibody, or serology, tests show whether a person has been exposed to the virus. Similar studies have shown infection rates ranging from 0.1% in Tokyo to 17% in London and 5.2% in Spain nationwide.

South Korea, an early success story in containing the virus among its 51 million population after a severe outbreak in Daegu in March, has reported 13,879 cases and 297 deaths. The country is now battling small but persistent clusters of infections with 63 new cases reported on Tuesday.

HONG KONG/TAIPEI (Reuters) - The Hong Kong government said on Tuesday that Taiwan had rejected the visas of two of its officials, underscoring rising bilateral tensions after Taipei criticised a security law imposed on the financial hub by Beijing.
The two Hong Kong Economic, Trade and Cultural Office (HKETCO) staff have returned home after their permits for residence in Taiwan were rejected, the government's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said.
It declined to specify if the visas were existing ones or documents relating to new applications.
Taiwan’s China policy Mainland Affairs Council declined to confirm the visa rejections, but said Taiwan needed to react accordingly to ""defend the nation’s dignity"" based on equal and bilateral considerations, following ""unreasonable limitations"" set by the Hong Kong authorities.
It did not elaborate in a written response to Reuters.
The acting chief of Taiwan's de facto consulate in Hong Kong returned to Taiwan on Thursday after refusing to sign a document supporting Beijing's claim on the island under its ""one China"" policy as a condition for his visa renewal.  
A senior Taiwan official told Reuters on Friday that Taiwanese officials in Hong Kong had been told their visas will not be renewed unless they sign the document. 
Beijing views Taiwan as part of a single China and has never renounced the option of using of force to bring the island under its control.
The Beijing-drafted law for Hong Kong, which took effect last month, punishes what China broadly defines as subversion or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. It has been widely condemned abroad.
According to Hong Kong media, HKETCO had 13 staff positions in Taiwan. It was unclear which two staff had left.  
The Bureau said its work to promote economic and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and Taiwan was ongoing and had not been ""seriously affected at the moment"" by the visa rejections.

KYIV (Reuters) - All 13 people taken hostage on a bus in western Ukraine were freed unharmed on Tuesday after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy spoke by phone with the hostage-taker and agreed to his demand to endorse a 2005 animal rights documentary. 
Police arrested the suspect, whom the state security service (SBU) identified as 44-year-old Maksym Kryvosh, who seized the bus in the city of Lutsk, saying he was armed with guns and explosives. 
Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said Kryvosh had served time in prison and the SBU said he had propagated ""extremist views"". Police said Kryvosh threatened to blow up the bus and detonate another explosive in a crowded area in the city. 
In a move to secure the hostages' release, Zelenskiy said he spoke to Kryvosh for seven to 10 minutes and agreed to one of his demands, to promote the documentary ""Earthlings,"" narrated by Hollywood actor Joaquin Phoenix. 
Zelenskiy did so in a six-second clip posted on the presidential Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, which was subsequently deleted.
The president said he had persuaded Kryvosh to first release three of the hostages, including a pregnant woman. 
""We agreed that he would release three people and after that I will record a video,"" Zelenskiy said. 
Zelenskiy had been given the option of launching an assault on the bus, but did not want to risk hostages dying during the attack. ""We have the result - everyone is alive,"" he said.
The SBU published a picture of Kryvosh sprawled on the ground with security personnel standing over him after his arrest. Avakov said an accomplice of Kryvosh was detained in the eastern city of Kharkiv. 
Police had blocked off the city centre with armed officers, cars and an armoured personnel carrier while they tried to persuade Kryvosh to free the hostages in a day-long standoff. 
Photos and footage showed a small bus parked in the middle of an empty street, with at least two windows smashed and others covered with curtains. Police said Kryvosh threw a grenade out of the bus. Avakov said Kryvosh had fired shots out of the bus at police.
In posts on social media, Kryvosh had also demanded that senior Ukrainian officials publish statements saying that they were terrorists. 

""The film this man is talking about is good. And you don't have to ... create such a nightmare for people all over the country. The film can be watched without it,"" Avakov said.

Melvin Theuma, a former taxi driver, was granted a presidential pardon in November to reveal all about the car bomb murder which shocked in the Mediterranean island in October 2017.
His evidence so far has implicated top businessman Yorgen Fenech, the alleged mastermind who was arrested in late November and accused of complicity in the murder. He is awaiting trial and denies the charge.
""First indications are that Melvin Theuma self-harmed but investigations are continuing,"" police said in a statement, suggesting attempted suicide.
The statement said Theuma was found late Tuesday in a pool of blood at his residence by officers who were mounting a round-the-clock guard outside. They were alerted by a lawyer who said he could not reach Theuma by phone. 
Media reported Theuma's wounds included serious injuries to his vocal cords and abdomen. 
The incident happened hours before Theuma was due to continue to give evidence in a Valletta court.
In evidence so far, Theuma has alleged he was paid by Fenech to contract three men – currently under arrest - who carried out the car-bombing. 
He also described how he has since lived in fear of his life and how he had gone to a seminary for confession. 

""My life ended at 3 p.m. on October 16, 2017,"" he told a magistrate, referring to the time and date of the murder.

Three Saudi sources had previously told Reuters that the king was in stable condition.
A video of the king chairing the meeting was broadcast on Saudi state TV on Tuesday evening. In the video, which has no sound, King Salman can be seen behind a desk, wordlessly reading and leafing through documents. 
The king, who has ruled the world's largest oil exporter and close U.S. ally since 2015, was undergoing medical checks, state media on Monday cited a Royal Court statement as saying without further details.
Three well-connnected Saudi sources who declined to be identified, two of whom were speaking late on Monday and one on Tuesday, told Reuters the king was ""fine"".
An official in the region, who requested anonymity, said he spoke to one of King Salman's sons on Monday who seemed ""calm"" and that there was no sense of panic about the monarch's health.
King Salman received phone calls from the leaders of Kuwait, Bahrain and Jordan on Monday, state media reported.
A diplomatic source said the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman flew back to Riyadh on Monday from his palace in the Red Sea city of NEOM, cancelling a planned meeting with a visiting Iraqi delegation.
The diplomatic source and the third Saudi source said the crown prince was still in the capital.
King Salman last spoke publicly on March 19 in a five-minute televised address about the coronavirus pandemic. State media have published pictures and videos of the king chairing online weekly cabinet meetings. Media have also carried images of the crown prince attending those meetings online. 
King Salman, the custodian of Islam's holiest sites, spent more than 2-1/2 years as the Saudi crown prince and was deputy prime minister from June 2012 before becoming king. He also served as governor of the Riyadh region for more than 50 years.

He named his young son Mohammed as crown prince to become next in line to the throne after a 2017 palace coup that ousted then-Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef.

""Nine bodies were found,"" President Ivan Duque said in a television address. ""It is a difficult moment. We recognize the heroism that our soldiers and police officers demonstrate in bringing us peace of mind."" 
Dissident former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) - who rejected a 2016 peace deal to end conflict with the government - have a strong presence in the region where the accident happened. 
FARC dissident groups focus on drug-trafficking activities and the illicit exploitation of minerals including gold, according to security sources.
The Colombian army, air force and national police have dozens of UH-60 helicopters that are used to transport troops, supply ground units, and fight guerrillas and criminal gangs across the South American country. 
In recent years most helicopter incidents have been caused by bad weather or mechanical failure. In a few cases such events have been attributed to attacks by guerrillas or criminal gangs.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern dismissed Immigration Minister Iain Lees-Galloway on Wednesday over allegations he had an inappropriate relationship with a former staffer.
""The minister has shown a lack of judgment over a period of 12 months. In undertaking this relationship he has opened himself up to accusations of improperly using his office,"" Ardern said in a surprise news conference. 
She said the minister had told her the relationship was consensual.
The announcement comes after opposition National Party leader Judith Collins said she had passed on an allegation about a Labour Party MP to the prime minister.
Ardern confirmed she was informed of the matter by Collins and said her office later received an email from a third party making the allegations. 
Lees-Galloway said he accepted the prime minister’s decision and apologised.
“I have acted completely inappropriately in my position and cannot continue as a minister,"" he said in a statement.
Ardern said the minister had also decided not to stand at the next election, due on Sept. 19.
The prime minister's popularity has skyrocketed due to her response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has left the country largely unscathed, making her the favourite to win the election.
Her Labour Party, governing in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, will face the National Party in what is expected to be a pandemic-dominated campaign. 
But Labour has faced some turbulence in the recent weeks.
Lees-Galloway is the second senior minister to leave Ardern's office this month, after Health Minister David Clark quit following slip ups in the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and personal mistakes.
A National party lawmaker also quit parliament on Tuesday after being accused of sending a sexually explicit image to a young woman.

In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of the chief justice of Venezuela's supreme court was being offered through the State Department's Transnational Organized Crime Rewards Program. 
The sanctions imposed on Moreno, an ally of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, bar him and his wife from traveling to the United States over accusations of his involvement in significant corruption.
In a statement, Moreno said Venezuela's judiciary would not accept ""tutelage"" from a foreign government. 
""This is not the first time that the mouthpieces of the North American empire seek to attack me with their clumsy attacks, full of manipulations and lies,"" Moreno said. 
The United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, regarding Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country's military and by Russia, China and Cuba.
The United States charged Moreno in March with money laundering under a round of indictments against Maduro and more than a dozen other top Venezuelan officials on charges of ""narco-terrorism"" in an escalation of the Trump administration's campaign aimed at ousting the socialist leader.
Pompeo on Tuesday said that in his position, Moreno ""has personally received money or property bribes to influence the outcome of civil and criminal cases in Venezuela.""
The United States previously blacklisted Moreno and seven other members of Venezuela's Supreme Court in 2017 as punishment for annulling the opposition-led Congress earlier that year, freezing his U.S. assets and generally prohibiting Americans from doing business with him.

Turkey and Greece are at loggerheads over overlapping claims for hydrocarbon resources, brought into sharper focus by attempts of EU member Cyprus to also explore for natural gas in the Eastern Mediterranean amid strong Turkish objections.
An advisory known as a Navtex was issued by Turkey's navy on Tuesday for seismic surveys in an area of sea between Cyprus and Crete. The advisory is in effect until Aug. 20.
Seismic surveys are part of preparatory work for potential hydrocarbons exploration. The Greek foreign ministry said the advisory covered part of the Greek continental shelf.
""We call on Turkey to immediately cease these illegal actions which violate our sovereign rights and undermine peace and security in the area,"" it said in a statement.
A protest had been lodged with the Turkish foreign ministry while the United Nations, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, NATO and the European Union had been informed.
There was no immediate comment from Turkey. Ankara says it is within its sovereign rights to explore for resources in areas it considers its continental shelf. 
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said earlier on Tuesday that unless Turkey backed down, European Union sanctions against its NATO ally could be inevitable. 
""As long as Turkey continues to take this path, sanctions on Turkey will be a one-way street,"" he told German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, who was visiting Athens.
Greece and Turkey have had testy relations for decades, with occasional flare-ups. There was a sharp exchange of words earlier this year when thousands of migrants Turkey hosts tried to force their way into Greece. 

They disagree over ethnically-partitioned Cyprus as well. Greece is also angry over a Turkish-Libyan deal carving out maritime boundaries that skim the southern Greek island of Crete.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The military should take over responsibility for keeping Israel's spreading coronavirus epidemic in check, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main coalition partner said on Tuesday, in comments likely to fuel tensions within the government.
Israel lifted a partial lockdown in May, but a second surge of infections has seen cases rise above 50,000 and deaths above 400, while Netanyahu's approval ratings have plunged to under 30% and employment soared to 21%.
Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi, of the centrist Blue and White party, said he expected a decision ""this week"" to hand the running of anti-coronavirus containment measures from the health ministry to the armed forces' Homefront Command.
""This virus will not leave us for an entire year. Therefore there needs to be a change in management,"" Ashkenazi told Ynet TV. ""Put ego aside ... I am saying this to Bibi (Netanyahu) ... I am saying we need to shift responsibility to the defence establishment.""
Netanyahu's office had no immediate comment, but he may be reluctant to empower Defence Minister Benny Gantz - who is also the Blue and White leader - when they are already at odds over proposed Israeli annexations in the occupied West Bank and budgets.
Formed primarily to protect citizens from missile attacks, the Homefront Command is also trained to help during natural disasters and well equipped to communicate quickly with Israel's ethnically diverse sectors.
Its troops have already helped out during the epidemic with evacuations and food distributions. A Blue and White source said Gantz and Ashkenazi want that role expanded to include testing and contact-tracing. 
Deputy Health Minister Yoav Kish warned against drawing the conscript military into controversy among Israel's 9 million population akin to what met the use of counter-terrorism technologies to track coronavirus carriers.
""You understand what it would mean if soldiers were to begin questioning people, with: 'What have you been doing, who have you been meeting with?'"" Kish, of Netanyahu's conservative Likud party, told Army Radio.
""This is a super-sensitive matter, a health issue ... There's no ego element here,"" he said, calling current cooperation between the health ministry and the military ""excellent"".

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Men in plainclothes and uniforms of Pakistan's anti-terrorism police on Tuesday abducted a senior journalist who has been a vocal critic of the powerful military, according to his family and the information minister.
""My husband was abducted this morning outside the school (in the capital Islamabad) where I work,"" Kaneez Sughra, the wife of 51-year-old Matiullah Jan, told Reuters. 
She said school security camera footage showed Jan, who had arrived to collect his wife from work, had been bundled into a car after being cornered by five vehicles - three of them unmarked, one with police markings and the other an ambulance.
Sughra added that he had told her about threats from intelligence agencies after he survived two attacks by unidentified assailants in the past.
The military's public relations wing did not respond to a request for comment on Jan's reported abduction. Police declined official comment. A senior police officer who declined to be identified said, ""We are following this through as per law.""
""It is clear that he has been abducted. It's the government's duty to trace him,"" Information Minister Shibli Faraz told reporters in Islamabad. 
""We are extremely concerned for the fate and wellbeing of Matiullah Jan,"" London-based Amnesty International tweeted. 
Jan, a former television anchor, told Reuters in an interview last year he was forced out of his job after criticising army generals' interference in politics. The army denies the accusations.
Jan is among thousands of journalists and media workers who were laid off during a security crackdown in the run-up to the 2018 general election. Opposition parties accused the army of tipping the scale in favour of Prime Minister Imran Khan's party in the election, a charge the military denies.
Some journalists and bloggers critical of the government who were rounded up in 2018 blamed the army's intelligence arm, the Inter Services Intelligence (ISI), for their detention.
Jan was facing a contempt of court case for a critical Twitter post about Supreme Court judges, and he was due to appear in court on Wednesday. 
""My husband had told me that he could be arrested in the case, but we never expected a kidnapping,"" Sughra said.

421,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 21, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",UK government failed to find out whether Russia meddled in Brexit vote: report,"By Elizabeth Piper and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government failed to find out whether Russia meddled in the 2016 referendum on membership of the EU, a parliamentary report released on Tuesday said, saying the intelligence services should investigate and make their findings public.
The long-anticipated report by parliament's intelligence and security committee found that Russia had tried to influence a separate referendum in 2014 when voters in Scotland rejected independence.
But it said the committee was unable to determine whether Russia had attempted to influence the European Union referendum, which led to Britain's exit from the bloc this year.
When asked for evidence on suspected Russian meddling in the vote, Britain's main domestic intelligence agency MI5 produced just six lines of text, the committee said.
""It is nonetheless the Committee's view that the UK Intelligence Community should produce an analogous assessment of potential Russian interference in the EU referendum and that an unclassified summary of it be published,"" it said in the report, which was produced more than a year ago and shelved until now.
The government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who came to power as one of the leading figures in the victorious campaign to leave the EU, rejected the call for a further review. A spokesman for Johnson said the prime minister was confident the referendum result to leave the EU was fair.
The report cast Russia as a hostile power which posed a significant threat to Britain and the West across a range of fronts, from espionage and cyber to election meddling and laundering dirty money.
""It appears that Russia considers the UK one of its top Western intelligence targets,"" the report said.
It said there were open source indications that Russia had sought to influence the Brexit campaign. But hard evidence had not been produced.
""The key point is ... they had not sought even to ask that question and that is at the heart of this report,"" Stewart Hosie, a Scottish National Party member of the committee, told reporters.
British foreign minister Dominic Raab rejected claims that the government had avoided investigating Russia.
""We have a long period recognising the enduring and significant threat posed by Russia,"" he said. ""We are not for a second complacent."" 
Russia has repeatedly denied meddling in the West, casting the United States and Britain as gripped by anti-Russian hysteria. 
""Russia has never interfered in the electoral processes of any country in the world - not the United States, not Britain, nor any other countries,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova cast the report as ""Russophobia in a fake frame"".
RUSSIAN MEDDLING AND MONEY
Relations between London and Moscow plunged to post-Cold War lows after Britain blamed Russia for poisoning former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia with a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury.
Last week, the British government said it believed Russian actors had tried to meddle in last year's general election, which was held after the report published on Tuesday was finished.
When discussing the EU referendum, the report is heavily redacted and there was a classified annex that was not published.
The committee also cast Russia as a source of corrupt money that had been welcomed in London, the world's premier international financial capital.
""The UK welcomed Russian money, and few questions - if any - were asked about the provenance of this considerable wealth,"" the report said. ""The UK has been viewed as a particularly favourable destination for Russian oligarchs and their money.""

""It offered ideal mechanisms by which illicit finance could be recycled through what has been referred to as the London 'laundromat',"" the report said.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday the United States wants to build a global coalition to counter China as he accused Beijing of exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to further its own interests.
U.S. President Donald Trump identifies China as the United States' main rival, and has accused President Xi Jinping of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which Trump calls the ""China plague"".
Pompeo, on a visit to London, lauded Prime Minister Boris Johnson for ordering a purge of Huawei gear from its 5G mobile phone network, saying it was the right decision as data could have ended up in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party.
The secretary of state cast China as an aggressor, saying it had made illegal martime claims, bullied Himalayan countries, covered up the coronavirus outbreak and exploited it to further its own interests in a ""disgraceful"" way.
""We hope we can build out a coalition that understands the threat and will work collectively to convince the Chinese Communist Party that it is not in their best interest to engage in this kind of behaviour,"" Pompeo told reporters alongside British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. 
""We want to see every nation who understands freedom and democracy...to understand this threat that the Chinese Communist Party is posing to them.""
Pompeo offered no evidence of how China had exploited the coronoavrius. 
As Britain toughens its stance on China due to its handling of the coronavirus epidemic and a crackdown in the former British colony of Hong Kong, Pompeo's visit is an attempt to stiffen Johnson's resolve and dangle the potential reward of a post-Brexit free trade deal, diplomats say.
Pompeo said a deal could be finalised before too long.
""A third round (of negotiations) scheduled for later this month, a primary focus for the United States is to see that we can make progress on this and bring this to a closure just as quickly as possible,"" Pompeo said, adding that he had discussed this with Johnson.
Beijing says the West - and Washington in particular - is gripped by anti-Chinese hysteria and colonial thinking about the communist state. 
China, whose $15 trillion economy is five times the size of the United Kingdom's, says the decision to exclude Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment manufacturer, will hurt Britain's economy, set back trade and discourage investment.

Pompeo is also due to meet Hong Kong democracy activist Nathan Law and the last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten.

The legislation, which still needs approval by the upper house of parliament and signing by President Vladimir Putin before becoming law, would also let election authorities hold voting outside of normal polling stations. 
The legislation's backers say it will be easier for people to find time to vote, but critics say it will become harder for monitors and polling station officials to do their jobs ensuring there is no malpractice. 
""It's extremely dangerous given current electoral practice and in the absence of guarantees of public control over multi-day voting,"" the Golos election monitor said in a statement last week.
The bill sailed through its third reading on Tuesday in the lower house of parliament, which is dominated by the ruling United Russia party that supports Putin. 
Russia held a nationwide vote on sweeping reforms over the course of a week ending on July 1 and allowed voting to take place outside normal polling stations in what authorities said were precautions against the coronavirus.
The reforms, now passed, cleared the way for Putin to run for the presidency two more times instead of stepping down in 2024. 
Despite their opposition to the reforms, some of the Kremlin's critics told their supporters to ignore the vote altogether, describing it as a sham.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Hundreds of residents of the far eastern Russian city of Khabarovsk protested on Tuesday against President Vladimir Putin's handling of a regional political crisis that has sparked rare and sustained anti-Kremlin street protests.
In an apparent move to defuse tensions, Putin on Monday named a new acting governor to head the region of Khabarovsk from the same party as the popular previous regional leader, Sergei Furgal, who was arrested on murder charges he denies.
Furgal's July 9 detention has triggered more than a week of unrest from supporters who feel he is being belatedly punished for defeating a candidate from the ruling pro-Putin United Russia party in 2018.
Others see it as the latest example of a detached federal centre located seven time zones to the west getting it wrong. The Kremlin says Furgal has serious charges to answer.
Putin appointed a member of Furgal's ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR), in his stead. [nL5N2ER37S] 
But some locals said on Tuesday they were angry that the Russian leader had yet to speak publicly about the crisis and had appointed someone who was not from the region. 
""The people will keep protesting until they get what they want,"" a man called Vyacheslav said, when interviewed on a livestream organised by the daily Novaya Gazeta. Protesters are demanding Furgal be freed or flown home to face trial. 
An elderly woman told an online TV channel run by Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny that Putin's appointment of a new acting governor was an insult. 
""We didn't vote for the LDPR,"" she said. ""But for a person (Furgal)."" 
Footage of the protest showed people chanting ""Putin has lost our trust"" and ""Putin resign.""
The protests come three weeks after Russians voted to back reforms clearing the way for Putin to run for two more presidential terms after 2024. 
The size of the protests - some have attracted over 10,000 people - is unusual for Russia's regions, as is the fact that the authorities have not yet moved to break them up.

KAMPONG KHLEANG, Cambodia (Reuters) - Crucial water flows to the Tonle Sap, Southeast Asia's largest lake, have been delayed for a second consecutive year according to river experts, severely disrupting fishing and threatening the food supply of more than a million people.
The river reversal vital for Tonle Sap Lake may not happen until next month, officials said, owing to drought conditions and more than a dozen hydropower dams in China and Laos which are blamed for disrupting the natural flow of the Mekong River.
The Mekong typically swells in rainy season where it converges with Cambodia's Tonle Sap River, causing an unusual reversed flow into the Tonle Sap Lake, filling it up and providing bountiful fish stocks.
But that hasn't happened yet and people who depend on the lake are struggling to get by. 
""I went out fishing for two nights and couldn't catch enough,"" said 37-year-old Khon Kheak, repairing a fishing net under his stilt house at Kampong Khleang, a floating village with little water to float in.
That trip earned him 12,000 riels, or about $3, compared to $12-$25 a day last year, enough to support his family of six.
His wife Reth Thary worries those days may be over.
""If it continues like this we would be finished, we also owe people money,"" she said, referring to a $1,000 loan.
Water typically flows into the Tonle Sap lake for 120 days, swelling it six-fold before running back into the Mekong as the monsoon season ends, usually in late September.
Based on rain forecasts and rainfall data, the river's unique reverse flow should happen in August, said Long Saravuth, a Deputy Secretary General of Cambodia's National Mekong Committee.
The Mekong River Commission (MRC) attributes the delay to lower 2019 rainfall and operations of upstream Mekong hydropower dams, two of which are in Laos and 11 in China. 
""From now on, the reversed flow timing will likely not be the same as it used to be,"" the MRC said.
Laos and China say the dams bring vital economic benefits and regulate water flow, helping to prevent severe floods and droughts.
But fisherman San Savuth, 25, wants Cambodia's government to negotiate the release of water from those dams to help Kampong Khleang's 2,000 families.
Savuth may go to Siem Reap, a city 55km (34 miles) away, to find construction work.
""We can't catch anything. There is no water, there is no fish,"" he said.
Even without the coronavirus squeezing international travel, there is no hope of attracting local tourists for boat trips from Kampong Khleang, which would normally handle 600 passengers a day.
There is a padlock on the abandoned tourism office surrounded by overgrown grass and about 130 tour boats are lying idle.

""People in Kampong Khleang are fishermen without fish,"" said tour boat owner Ly Sam Ath. ""There is no farming for them to do.""

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A Georgia judge is scheduled Tuesday to hear arguments in an emergency motion brought by Governor Brian Kemp to stop the city of Atlanta from enforcing a mandate that people wear masks in public to help stop the spread of coronavirus.
The motion, pending before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Kelly Ellerbe, is the latest salvo in a clash between some Georgia mayors and Kemp over the issue of mask mandates, which the Republican governor opposes.
It asks the judge to halt Atlanta's efforts while a lawsuit Kemp filed Thursday works its way through the courts.
Earlier this month, Kemp issued an order that bars local leaders from requiring people to wear masks, but a handful of Georgia cities, including Democratic-led Atlanta, Savannah and Athens, have bucked the governor and continued to require them in public.
The governor's office filed a lawsuit on Thursday against Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and the city council that argues local officials lack the legal authority to override Kemp's orders.
""Kemp must be allowed, as the chief executive of this state, to manage a public health emergency without Mayor Bottoms issuing void and unenforceable orders which only serve to confuse the public,"" the 16-page complaint reads.
The governor's office has not yet filed lawsuits against the other mayors.
Kemp, one of the first governors to ease statewide stay-at-home orders and business closures following the early stages of the U.S. outbreak, has suggested that mandating masks would be too restrictive. 
Bottoms has said she planned to defy Kemp's order and enforce a mandatory mask ordinance.
""I take this very seriously and I will continue to do everything in my power to protect the people of Atlanta,"" the mayor said on NBC News' ""Today"" on Friday, and she added that the lawsuit is ""a waste of taxpayer money.""

Bottoms, who has announced publicly that she and members of her family have tested positive for COVID-19, remains in quarantine at her home office. Judge Ellerbe's hearing will be conducted by video conference later Tuesday morning.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Small groups of Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrators gathered on Tuesday to mark the first anniversary of an attack in a train station by an armed crowd wearing white shirts, and demanded justice for victims of the violence and broader freedoms.
The Yuen Long attack, and the police's apparent failure to prevent it, exacerbated tensions during protests last year, plunging the global financial hub into its deepest crisis since Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Scattered individuals around the Yoho mall and Yuen Long train station chanted slogans including ""Hong Kong independence, the only way out."" An elderly lady pasted small ""HK Add Oil"" stickers on to walls. 
Hundreds of riot police cordoned off areas and urged people not to gather because of coronavirus social distancing restrictions. 
Groups of youngsters roaming the malls cursed police from a distance and chanted: ""Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our Times"", a slogan the government has warned might violate new national security laws. 
Police fired pepper spray during at least one skirmish.
Tuesday's protest followed the imposition of the new security laws by Beijing that have provoked international criticism and raised fears for the city's liberties and autonomy under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" formula. 
Some protesters held blank sheets of paper to oppose the ""evil"" law they say has criminalised free speech.
""I've had lots of feelings of disappointment in these past few weeks,"" said Lok, an 18-year-old student dressed in a black shirt and shorts, conceding the turnout was less than he had hoped. ""But Hong Kong people should still keep the revolutionary spirit, and fight for their freedoms.""
PROTESTERS DEMAND JUSTICE 
Beijing says the law, which punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, was needed to plug national security loopholes left by the city's failure to pass such legislation on its own. Hong Kong authorities say it will help bring stability. 
On July 21 last year, 45 people were injured after more than 100 men in white swarmed the train station.
Police have been criticised for not responding quickly enough to calls for help, and for not immediately arresting any alleged culprits at the scene.
A recent documentary by public broadcaster RTHK showed the police had been aware of the white-shirted crowd gathering hours before the attack. Police later acknowledged plainclothes officers were present, but said investigations are continuing and further arrests were likely to be made. 
Protesters are still demanding justice. So far, 37 people have been arrested, with seven charged with participating in riots and conspiracy to injure others with intent.
In May, an Independent Police Complaints Council report into the year-long protests found no evidence of collusion but identified deficiencies in police deployment during the incident.

ROME (Reuters) - A well-known Italian senator is set to launch a political movement with a mission to take Italy out of the European Union, seeking to capitalise on anti-Brussels sentiment as the country struggles to revive its coronavirus-hit economy.
Gianluigi Paragone, a former TV journalist, met Brexit architect Nigel Farage in London on Monday before announcing the formal birth of his ""Italexit"" party later this week.
""We can no longer be blackmailed by countries that offend the great prestige of Italy,"" Paragone said, adding that only a ""really sovereign state"", like Britain, can address the economic crisis the pandemic has provoked.
It remains to be seen if Paragone's movement can tap into the well of anti-EU sentiment which has grown among Italians in recent years but lacks an obvious political home.
Paragone left the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement soon after it formed a government with the pro-European Democratic Party (PD) last year, moderating its critical attitude towards Brussels institutions.
Even Matteo Salvini's right-wing League, until recently the main rallying point for eurosceptics, has softened its line against Brussels and the euro in a bid to gain respectability.
The timing of Paragone's move looks questionable, coming as the EU reached a deal on Tuesday to launch an economic Recovery Fund worth 750 billion euros, which the bloc's supporters say shows its renewed cohesion and vision. 
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said earlier on Tuesday that 28% of the fund would be for Italy in a mix of grants and loans that could ""change the face of the country"".
""The others want to change Europe, we want to quit,"" Paragone said after the EU deal was struck.
The European issue has dominated Italian politics in recent years, with eurosceptics blaming the EU for the country's chronic economic stagnation and its difficulties in handling migrant arrivals from Africa.
A Eurobarometer survey in 1998 showed 69% of Italians supported EU membership, while in 2002, after the introduction of euro notes and coins, Italy was the second most pro-euro nation after Luxembourg, with 79% expressing a positive opinion.

(Reuters) - A Minneapolis judge will hold a hearing on Tuesday to consider a request from media outlets and defense lawyers to relax a gag order in the case against four officers accused of killing George Floyd, which launched a global anti-racism movement.
Hennepin County District Court Judge Peter Cahill issued a gag order on July 9 prohibiting parties from speaking publicly about the case and restricting access to case records. Cahill said pretrial publicity could taint a jury pool and impair the right to a fair trial. 
One of the former officers, Derek Chauvin, 44, pinned his knee into Floyd's neck on May 25 when he and the three other former policemen were arresting Floyd in a Minneapolis neighborhood. Floyd was later pronounced dead at a hospital. 
The incident, caught on video by bystanders, sparked massive and continuing protests against racial injustice and calls for police reforms.
Several local news organizations, along with CNN, CBS and the New York Times Co, are arguing that the order intrudes on their constitutional free speech rights. 
The gag order restricts not only an ""incredibly broad array of speech by the parties and their lawyers, but also subjects a staggering number of individuals not involved in these prosecutions to the same restrictions,"" the organizations said in a court document. 
Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder. J. Alexander Kueng, Tou Thao and Thomas Lane, the three other former officers, are charged with aiding and abetting in the case.

Attorneys for the four men also filed objections to the gag order, arguing it is depriving their clients of their right to free speech. They argued that restricting the media from viewing videos and other records of the incident can cause the public to have a one-sided view of the case that could benefit the prosecution.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A pioneering academic at Lebanon's most distinguished university, Charlotte Karam has enjoyed professional success that has made her decision to leave the country all the more heart-wrenching.
An associate professor at the American University of Beirut (AUB), she has founded a centre to facilitate career success for women across the Arab world and with her team helped draft legislation against sexual harassment in Lebanon, the first of its kind. 
But like many of Lebanon's brightest people, Karam is on her way out of the country as it sinks ever deeper into crisis, part of a brain drain that points to crushed hopes and fear for the future.
""Leaving Lebanon is leaving a part of me. It's a huge conflict,"" said Karam, 45, a mother of two with a PhD in Applied Social Psychology.
""Every fibre in my body is telling me I have to stay to continue my work from Lebanon, but my fear is for the kids and their future,"" said Karam, who was born in Canada to Lebanese parents.
In August, she will move back to Canada with her family, a decision shaped by the turmoil that has swept Lebanon since its financial system collapsed last year, shattering lives nationwide. 
The crisis is widely seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
Professionals including doctors, academics, entrepreneurs, and designers are planning to leave. Some have already gone. In many cases, they are drawing on second nationalities acquired by parents or grandparents who left Lebanon in emigration waves of the past.
The brain drain is stripping Lebanon of the kind of talent needed to bring about recovery. 
It is a testament to the failure of Lebanese politicians to chart a path out of a crisis of their own making, and signals widely shared concern for the stability of a country that never fully recovered from its last war. 
""Every time I sit with Lebanese colleagues, children of the civil war, they tell me to leave. 'No-one should have to live the way we lived'. They are encouraging me to leave while they are stuck here. It's heart-breaking,"" Karam said.
She is moving to Ottawa, joining her brother who left Lebanon in 2015 as its slowing economy forced the sale of a once successful construction equipment business he ran with her husband. She will continue her work for AUB from Canada.
BUBBLE OF HOPE 
Karam's family have moved between Canada and Lebanon since the beginning of the last century. Her grandfather moved there from Lebanon in the 1950s, helped by an aunt who was the first to emigrate to Canada decades earlier.
Her parents brought the family to Lebanon in 1993.
""Lebanon was entering into high spirits and hope of rebuilding,"" she said. ""There were people who were returning, from North America, Australia, England, the Gulf, it was beautiful."" 
""It was really a wonderful time.""
Lebanon has since endured numerous crises, including war with Israel, assassinations and political conflicts. Yet the current crisis is seen as the most dangerous of all.
The Lebanese pound has sunk by around 80%. Poverty, unemployment and prices are soaring, and depositors have lost access to their life savings.
The crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and bad governance, came to a head last October as the country was swept by protests demanding the reform of the sectarian system.
Karam took part and with colleagues drew up plans for the kind of competence-based governance many in Lebanon dream of.
""There was a big bubble of hope then the economic collapse, coupled with COVID-19 burst it,"" she said. 
""I blame the government and every single politician. We are done with the entrenched political class ... It is shameful that they could allow the country to spiral so badly out of control.""

Kadhimi's visit was meant to come after a trip to Saudi Arabia but that was cancelled after Saudi's King Salman bin Abdulaziz was admitted to hospital suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder.
The Iraqi premier faces a tough balancing act between Iran and the United States who have come close to open conflict in the region, including on Iraqi soil over the past year.
At home, Kadhimi is coming under increasing pressure from Iran-aligned parties and paramilitary groups who perceive him as siding with the United States because he has indicated he wants to curb the power of Iran-backed militias and political groups.
In his first two months in office security forces carried out two arrest raids against militias but most of those detained were quickly released.
The United States praised those moves and supporters welcome several appointments he has made in the security forces, including reinstating Iraq's Counter Terrorism Service chief Abdul Wahhab al-Saidi, whose dismissal under the previous government fuelled mass anti-government unrest last year.
Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif visited Baghdad on Sunday, making a stop at the site where a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and Iraq's paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January.

That action brought the region to the brink of a full U.S.-Iran conflict.

NEW DELHI/TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States is conducting two military exercises in Asian waters this week involving allies Japan, Australia and India, the U.S. navy said on Tuesday.
The exercises come as military rivalry between the United States and China is intensifying and days after the United States said China's claims of sovereignty in the disputed South China Sea were illegal.
The United States has long opposed China’s expansive territorial claims on the South China Sea, sending warships regularly through the strategic waterway to demonstrate freedom of navigation.
China opposes such exercises and said the U.S. rejection of its claims in the South China Sea raised tension and undermined stability in the region.
The USS Nimitz and the USS Ronald Reagan were deployed to the South China Sea twice this month but this week, the Nimitz was in the Indian Ocean for exercises with the Indian navy, the U.S. navy said, in the latest sign of growing cooperation between the forces.
Rear Admiral Jim Kirk, commander of the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group, said in a statement that Monday's drills with the Indian navy helped improve the interoperability of their forces. 
""While operating together, the U.S. and Indian naval forces conducted high-end exercises designed to maximize training and interoperability, including air defense,"" the U.S. navy said.
India's relations with China have also been strained after a deadly clash on their disputed border in the Himalayas last month, prompting calls in India for closer security ties with the United States and its allies including Japan. 
The drills were carried out near India's Andaman and Nicobar islands, off the north end of the Malacca Straits, one of the world's busiest shipping routes for trade and fuel, an Indian source said. India has a military base on the islands.
The U.S. navy said the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was in the Indian Ocean in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region.
Separately, the U.S. strike group led by the Ronald Reagan was carrying out drills with naval forces from Japan and Australia in the Philippine Sea, U.S. and Australian officials said on Tuesday. 
The exercises are due to end on July 23, Australia's defence department said.

Later this year, the United States will hold naval exercises with India and Japan in the Bay of Bengal and Australia might join.

The suspect, identified as Stephan B., is accused of murder on two counts plus attempted murder and incitement. If convicted, he faces a life sentence.
Prosecutors say he has confessed to the crimes. He has not yet responded in court to the charges.
Wearing a coronavirus face mask, Stephan B. took his seat in the court room in handcuffs and looked around the room. The start of the trial was delayed by two hours due to strict security measures. 
The gunman shot at the synagogue in the eastern city of Halle last October, and prosecutors have said he aimed to kill as many as possible of the more than 50 worshippers inside. 
However, after failing to get into the building he went on a rampage outside, fatally shooting a woman passerby and a man inside a kebab shop. The attacker live-streamed his attack.
Josef Schuster, President of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, said the killer must face the full force of the law and that the Halle attack showed how right-wing populists and extremists had become more brazen.
""The state must not slacken in its battle against right-wing extremism, anti-Semitism and racism. A clear verdict on the deeds of Stephan B. would send a clear signal against violence and right-wing extremism in Germany,"" said Schuster.
Anti-Semitic crimes are particularly sensitive in Germany due to the legacy of the Holocaust. Local police have drawn criticism for leaving the house of worship unprotected and not realising it was Yom Kippur, the holiest day in the Jewish year.

The number of anti-Semitic crimes committed in Germany rose by 13% last year, Germany's interior minister said in May, laying the blame on right-wing radicals.

The weekly cabinet meeting inside Johnson's Downing Street office was ditched when the COVID-19 crisis threatened to run out of control. Johnson, his health minister and other top officials all caught the virus early in the pandemic.
But in recent weeks, Johnson has called on people to return to their workplaces, concerned that the economy, already poised for recession, could be crushed over the long term by a lockdown that has kept millions at home for several months.
Supplied with hand sanitizer and individual bottles of water, ministers were asked to attend a socially-distanced meeting in a larger room inside the foreign office rather than the traditional cabinet room in Downing Street.
Several were seen walking to the foreign office, just across the road from the prime minister's Downing Street residence, after weeks of the meetings being held via video conference. 

Johnson has pushed ahead with easing the lockdown, lifting advice from next month to avoid public transport -- one of the main reasons deterring people to return to work -- while encouraging workers to use alternative means where possible.

On Monday, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament the extradition treaty would be suspended immediately and an arms embargo would be extended to Hong Kong.
""We will not consider re-activating those arrangements, unless and until there are clear and robust safeguards, which are able to prevent extradition from the UK being misused under the new national security legislation,"" Raab said. 
The decision appeared to infuriate Beijing.
""China will make a forceful counter-attack to the UK's wrong actions,"" said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a daily news conference on Tuesday. 
""China urges the UK to give up its fantasies of continuing colonial influence in Hong Kong and immediately correct its mistakes,"" he said. 
London has been dismayed by a crackdown in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and the perception that China did not tell the whole truth over the coronavirus outbreak.
Raab said he would extend a longstanding arms embargo on China to include Hong Kong, meaning no exports of weapons or ammunition and a ban on any equipment which might be used for internal repression, like shackles and smoke grenades.
Australia and Canada suspended extradition treaties with Hong Kong earlier this month. U.S. President Donald Trump has ended preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong.
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered equipment from China's Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] to be purged completely from Britain's 5G network by the end of 2027.
China - once courted as the prime source of investment in British infrastructure projects from nuclear to rail - has accused Britain of pandering to the United States.
Britain says the new security law breaches the guarantees of freedoms, including an independent judiciary, that have helped keep Hong Kong one of the world's most important trade and financial centres since 1997.

Officials in Hong Kong and Beijing have said the law is vital to plug gaps in national security exposed by recent pro-democracy and anti-China protests. China has repeatedly told Western powers to stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's long-serving President Yoweri Museveni has collected papers to seek nomination as the ruling party's candidate in next year's presidential election, the party said on Tuesday.
Securing a new term would potentially extend the 75-year-old Museveni's rule of the east African nation to four decades. 
""Yes, we can confirm he has picked nomination forms for our flagbearer position,"" Rogers (NYSE:ROG) Mulindwa, spokesman for the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM), told Reuters, adding that no-one else had yet shown up to contest him within the party.
Though no date has yet been fixed for the 2021 vote, it is typically held in February. The strongest opposition presidential aspirant is pop star and lawmaker Bobi Wine, 38, whose music endears him to the young.
Critics complain Museveni has been using anti-coronavirus measures like bans on public gatherings to secure an advantage and stymie preparations by opponents. 

Uganda has been relatively sheltered from the pandemic so far, with just 1,065 cases reported and no deaths.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Wednesday will hear a bid to set aside caning sentences handed down to 27 Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, lawyers said, a punishment that rights groups have decried as vicious and tantamount to torture. 
Muslim-majority Malaysia has long been a favoured destination for Rohingya seeking a better life after escaping a 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar and, more recently, refugee camps in Bangladesh. 
But Malaysia, which does not recognise refugee status, has recently turned away boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya, saying it can not take in more migrants because of a struggling economy as a result of the novel coronavirus.
In June, a court on Malaysia's Langkawi island sentenced 40 Rohingya refugees to seven months' jail for arriving in the country by boat without a valid permit, Collin Andrew, a lawyer representing the refugees, told Reuters on Tuesday. 
Twenty-seven men among them were also sentenced to caning, a penalty that Andrew was seeking to overturn in court on Wednesday. 
The immigration department and the attorney-general's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Under Malaysia's Immigration Act, anyone who illegally enters the country can face a 10,000 ringgit ($2,345) fine, jail for up to five years as well as six strokes of a cane.
Courts can choose not to hand down the caning sentence on humanitarian grounds if the migrant charged is a refugee and does not have any prior criminal history, Andrew said. 
""So it's quite unusual for the court to impose caning against Rohingya in this case,"" he said.
The rights group Amnesty International this week urged Malaysia not to cane the refugees, saying it was ""cruel and inhumane"". 
Lawyers have also sought a review of a case against six Rohingya teenagers, including two girls, who Andrew said had been wrongly tried and convicted as adults.
This month, the court had dismissed a case against 51 Rohingya minors who were also charged for violating immigration laws, he said.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A lawmaker from New Zealand's main opposition party resigned on Tuesday after being accused of sending a sexually explicit image to a young woman.
It was the latest in a series of resignations and scandals at the National Party, which faces the challenge of trying to unseat the centre-left Labour coalition led by popular leader Jacinda Ardern in the September general election.
The lawmaker, Andrew Falloon, said in a statement on Monday that he will not be contesting in the September polls, and apologised for a ""number of mistakes"" without giving details. He said he had been dealing with some mental issues following the suicide of a friend.
But Falloon quit parliament immediately on Tuesday after it was revealed in the media that he had sent an unsolicited and indecent image to a 19-year-old woman.
""I am absolutely appalled by what I have been hearing this morning,"" National's newly elected leader Judith Collins said. 
The matter came to light after a university student made a complaint to Ardern's office last week, who passed it on to Collins, the Prime Minister's office said. 
Falloon was not immediately available for comment and the National Party declined give details of his whereabouts.
Collins was handed reins of the National party just last week amid a series of scandals and an exodus of senior leaders, which threaten to damage National's chances at the polls. 
Earlier this month, National Party member Hamish Walker resigned after admitting to leaking names of coronavirus patients to the media. 
Shortly after, former National Party Chief Todd Muller quit just over 50 days into the job, saying it was affecting his health. Just two days later Muller's deputy Nikki Kaye and senior leader Amy Adams also said they will not contest in the elections.

(Reuters) - Former Fox News employee Jennifer Eckhart filed a lawsuit on Monday in a New York federal court against Fox News and former network anchor Ed Henry, accusing him of raping her.
The complaint says Henry “groomed, psychologically manipulated and coerced [her] into having a sexual relationship with him, and that, when she would not comply voluntarily, he sexually assaulted her on office property, and raped her at a hotel.""
In a statement on Henry's behalf, his lawyer Catherine Foti said evidence would show that Eckhart ""initiated and completely encouraged a consensual relationship.""
In a separate statement, a Fox News spokeswoman said Eckhart and co-plaintiff Cathy Areu, a network guest, can pursue their claims against Henry directly with him, as the network “already took swift action as soon as it learned of Ms. Eckhart’s claims on June 25 and Mr. Henry is no longer employed by the network.”
The cable news network, owned by Rupert Murdoch’s  Fox Corp  (O:FOXA), said on July 1 it had dismissed Henry after receiving a complaint from the lawyer of a former employee and retained a law firm to investigate.
Monday’s complaint alleges the network knew Henry had engaged in sexual misconduct as far back as early 2017.
Areu alleges Henry sent her “a slew of wildly inappropriate sexual images and videos” and suggested he would assist her career if she had sex with him.
Areu also alleges that Fox News anchors Sean Hannity and Tucker Carlson, host Howard Kurtz and political analyst Gianno Caldwell sexually harassed and retaliated against Areu.
Asked to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit, Foti said: “Ed Henry looks forward to presenting actual facts and evidence, which will contradict the fictional accounts contained in the complaint.""
In its statement the network said that based on an outside law firm's investigation that included interviews with numerous witnesses, it was determined that Areu’s claims against the network, its management, Carlson, Hannity, Kurtz and Caldwell are ""false, patently frivolous and utterly devoid of any merit.""
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Carlson, Hannity, Kurtz or Caldwell but Fox News said its statement was a response on behalf of all four men.
In 2016, Roger Ailes resigned as chairman and chief executive of Fox News after former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson sued him for sexual harassment, charges he denied.
The network agreed to pay $20 million to settle Carlson’s lawsuit.

(Reuters) - A self-described anti-feminist lawyer who investigators say killed a federal judge's son in New Jersey and wounded her husband was found dead on Monday after a manhunt, the FBI said. 
The FBI's Newark office said in a statement that attorney Roy Den Hollander was the sole suspect in the attack on the North Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey, home of Esther Salas that killed her 20-year old son and left her husband with gunshot wounds. 
Hollander was found earlier on Monday in an apparent suicide about 90 miles (145 km) north of New York City, the Daily Beast and other media reported, citing law enforcement sources.
While the motive for the shooting remained unclear, Hollander had once had a case in front of the judge and had published an online screed filled with misogynistic and racist remarks in which he derided her ethnicity and career.
The attack occurred Sunday evening. Investigators say a man dressed in a FedEx (NYSE:FDX) uniform approached the home and opened fire, killing the son, Daniel Anderl, and injuring her husband, 63-year-old defense attorney Mark Anderl. Salas, who was in the basement, was not hurt.
Salas, 51, was nominated to her position by President Barack Obama in 2010 and in the following year became the first Latina to serve on the District Court of New Jersey, a seat from which she presided over a number of high-profile cases.
Those cases included the sentencing of members of the Grape Street Crips, a gang charged with selling drugs and other crimes in 2015, and the convictions of co-stars of ""The Real Housewives of New Jersey"" reality TV show.
She also presided over a 2015 case brought by a New Jersey woman seeking to register for the male-only military draft. Hollander appeared for the plaintiff before being replaced in June 2019, court records show.
It is not clear if that case was connected to the shooting in any way. In 2019 Salas ruled the lawsuit against the Selective Service System could go forward, raising the prospect of a future change to the draft.
Yet in more than 2,000 pages of writings online Hollander disparaged Salas' ethnicity and dismissed her achievements as the product of affirmative action. ""Female judges didn't bother me as long as they were middle age or older black ladies,"" he wrote. Latina judges, on the other hand, were driven by an inferiority complex and ""usually trouble,"" he said.
It also included some violent references. In advising on the merits of carrying a firearm, he wrote: ""When a lunatic shows up with a gun, what do you want for a defense—PC ideology or a six-shooter?"" 
Hollander's body was found in a car in the town of Rockland, New York on Monday, ABC News reported. A FedEx package addressed to Salas was discovered in the car, ABC News said.
Mark Anderl is in stable condition after undergoing surgery at a local hospital, North Brunswick Mayor Francis Womack said. 
The son was an aspiring lawyer who was a student at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. He had just finished celebrating his 20th birthday with visiting university friends, according to Marion Costanza, a family friend who lives three houses away.
""Now they are never going to see him again,"" Costanza said. ""I want people to know what a good kid he was.""
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy and U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey were among political leaders who expressed concern about the incident on Twitter.

456,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Global Banks Look to Taiwan Expansion in Shift Away From Hong Kong,"(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan’s top financial regulator said global banks are looking to expand on the island after China’s passage of a controversial security law in Hong Kong prompted some firms to rethink their Asian strategies.
Some U.S. securities firms are considering an expansion in Taiwan while other international banks plan to start new operations, said Huang Tien-mu, chairperson of Taiwan’s Financial Supervisory Commission. He didn’t name any of the companies that have expressed interest in Taiwan.
“We aren’t trying to replace anyone, but that doesn’t mean we have no ambition,” Huang said in an interview. “We hope to appeal to the capital and talent from the rest of Asia, not just Hong Kong.”
Hong Kong has been embroiled in unprecedented political turbulence after more than a year of anti-government protests, and is now in the cross-hairs of a broader fight between the U.S. and China. The former British colony faces intense competition from cities including Singapore, Shanghai and Tokyo to maintain its status as the key Asian finance hub.
Taiwan’s government sees a potential exodus of financial professionals from Hong Kong as a chance to reinvigorate an economy grappling with a peaking population, a shortage of skilled workers and shrinking exports. Its minister for Mainland Affairs Council in July welcomed Hong Kong and multinational companies, establishing an office dedicated to easing immigration.
Foreign banks with the most assets in Taiwan include  Citigroup  Inc (NYSE:C)., Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Plc and  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA), according to financial commission data.
President Tsai Ing-wen is also looking for concrete measures to help Hong Kong residents after her support for last year’s pro-democracy protests contributed to her overwhelming election victory in January. Taiwan saw record immigration and investment from Hong Kong in 2019, a trend that’s continued this year. The number of Hong Kongers settling in Taiwan in the first five months of the year almost doubled from the same period in 2019.
Hong Kong’s top finance official Paul Chan sought to reassure financial institutions on Sunday that the new national security law doesn’t affect their ability to conduct business, allocate capital and trade securities. He also asked regulators to relay the message to brokers, banks and insurers to ease their concerns.
“As long as the financial industry continues to operate normally under the framework of Hong Kong’s existing laws, their business operations will continue as usual,” Chan said in a blog post.
Offshore Accounts
Taiwan plans to relax some rules to raise its competitiveness, such as expediting a policy to allow domestic companies to open offshore banking accounts to win back Taiwanese capital from tax havens, Huang said. He would also align the island’s financial regulation to international standards to lure foreign investment.
The commission is currently in talks with Nasdaq Inc. about cross-listing options once a new trading venue for technology startups and small stocks is in place this year, according to Huang, who took over the job in May. The regulator would also allow more products for financial institutions to cope with low interest rates, including wealth management tools for retirement, and reverse mortgages, Huang said.
Meanwhile, the agency plans to amend local insurance laws to encourage more green investment. Huang said he will also talk to the central bank about insurers and fund managers’ need for hedging tools. About two thirds of life insurers’ investments were made overseas as of May, according to the Taiwan Insurance Institute.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>","Syria says Israel strikes southern Damascus, sources say Iranian bases hit","By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian air defenses on Monday intercepted a new Israeli ""aggression"" above the capital Damascus, state media said, in the latest wave of attacks that Western intelligence sources have said were Israeli strikes on a major Iranian-backed ammunition depot on the edge of the capital.
State television said Israeli missiles had flown over the Syrian Golan Heights where they conducted raids around the capital and live footage showed blasts across the skies of the capital. 
There was no immediate Israeli comment.
A Syrian military spokesman was quoted on state television as saying its air defenses thwarted most of the missiles that targeted southern Damascus suburbs, areas that Israel had hit in the past, before reaching their targets and inflicted only ""material losses"".
Syrian military defectors said the strike targeted a major Iranian-run ammunitions depot in Jabal al Mane near the town of Kiswa, where Iranian Revolutionary Guards have long been entrenched in a rugged area almost 15 km (9.3 miles) south of the center of Damascus. Other strikes hit Muqaylabiya and Zakiya towns near Kiswa where Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah militia are deployed with other pro-Tehran militias in strength, according to two senior army defectors.
An official in the regional alliance that supports Iran said that there were no Iranian or Hezbollah casualties. 
The severity of the blasts were heard in the capital and shook windows of several neighborhoods there, according to residents.
""The Israelis have targeted a major ammunitions depot. There were several strikes and the blasts were huge. There are reports that Iranian personnel have been killed,"" said Zaid al Reys, a Syrian analyst in touch with sources on the ground.
The bases in eastern, central and southern Syria which Israel had hit in recent months are believed to have a strong presence of Iranian-backed militias, according to intelligence sources and military defectors familiar with the locations.
Syria never publicly acknowledges that the strikes target Iranian assets in a country where Tehran's military presence has covered most government-controlled areas. 
Western intelligence sources say Israel’s stepped up strikes on Syria in the last few months are part of a shadow war approved by Washington and part of the anti-Iran policy that has undermined in the last two years Iran’s extensive military power without triggering a major increase in hostilities.
Israel has acknowledged conducting many raids inside Syria since the start of the civil war in 2011 where it sees Iran's presence as a strategic threat. 
Israeli defense officials have said in recent months that Israel would step up its campaign against Iran in Syria where, with the help of its proxy militias, Tehran has expanded its presence.

A regional mission of West Africa's ECOWAS bloc last week failed to appease an influential opposition group called M5-RFP that has denounced Keita's failure to contain a growing jihadist insurgency or address contested local election results.
Protestors have raided government buildings and blocked off sections of the capital Bamako in recent weeks, raising concerns among neighbouring leaders that a long-running crisis in Mali could destabilise the whole region.
Niger's President Mahamadou Issoufou will head to Mali, said spokesman Issa Mahamadou Mourtala. Issoufou will be accompanied by Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo and Ivory Coast's President Alassane Ouattara, said high-level government sources in those two countries. 
It was not yet clear who the delegation would meet or on what day they would arrive. The source in Ivory Coast said that Ouattara was going on Thursday. 
Regional leaders are acutely aware of the danger a destabilised Mali poses. The landlocked, semi-desert state has been used as a launchpad for groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State to attack neighbouring countries including Niger and Ivory Coast. 
Keita has offered concessions, including dissolving the Constitutional Court, but the opposition has hardened since police fired on protesters and leading members were arrested this month.
The coalition has said that 20 people have been killed in the protests in July. The Health Ministry puts the toll at 11. 
In a post-mission statement on Sunday, ECOWAS proposed that Mali's Constitutional Court examine the contested elections and that Keita create a new government including opposition members and civil society. 
M5-RFP rejected the proposal, said they wanted Keita gone and launched a week-long civil disobedience campaign starting Monday.

HAVANA (Reuters) - State-run stores in Cuba began selling some food and hygiene products in U.S. dollars on Monday as the import-dependent country faces a grave shortage of tradable currency to purchase goods abroad.
Cuba last had to open such dollar stores for basic goods in the 1990s when the fall of the Soviet Union plunged the Communist-run island into a deep economic depression. 
This time it is the coronavirus pandemic, which has shuttered tourism and hit other revenue earners, worsening an existing liquidity crisis due to the implosion of ally Venezuela’s economy and the tightening of U.S. sanctions on old foe Cuba.
Lines formed in front of the stores on Monday and Cubans packed banks to obtain the bank card needed to purchase dollar goods although most residents resigned themselves to obtaining the basics in local currency.
“Not all Cubans can buy there, we don’t all have family abroad,” Lazara Rodriguez, 43, a dancer who lives near one of the stores, said.
The government said 62 stores were opening across the country with more to follow in the coming months.
Some 80 outlets selling domestic appliances, car parts and other items such as motorbikes opened late last year, and used cars went on sale for greenbacks earlier in 2020. 
The Cuban state monopolizes retail and foreign trade but pandemic fallout has worsened shortages of food, medicine and other goods and there are long lines at retail outlets.
Consumers said the dollar stores provided an option amidst scarcity for some, but complained they still lacked many products.
""Its good, the prices are acceptable, but it does not have many products like detergent, oil and ham,” retiree Guillermo Antigua said, exiting a store in Havana.
Cuba is reopening with no new cases of COVID-19 reported on Monday, but private eateries with no access to wholesale markets have been finding it difficult to put together an offer.
The new stores are an option for some.
""This is good. We have options to keep working. At least they are selling us products,"" cafeteria owner Daniel Gonzalez said as he packed cheese and other items into his car.
Cuba legalized the dollar after the fall of the Soviet Union but it was taken out of circulation in 2004.
Since then, there have been two currencies, the peso and the convertible peso, which is valued at 24 pesos, circulating although possession of the dollar and other tradable currencies remained legal.
Cubans who patronize the dollar stores need a dollar-denominated bank card from an account opened with tradable currencies which may be obtained through offshore remittances or other means such as exchanging local pesos on the street.
The government claims the convertible peso is equal to the dollar, but imported goods, when available, have huge mark-ups as they are purchased in tradable currencies. The peso and convertible peso have no value abroad.
""As in the 1990s, national currencies have lost their convertibility and do not allow companies to pay debts and import inputs,"" Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Colombia’s Universidad Javeriana Cali, said.

""To ensure that at least some sectors and markets work, they have to dollarize them.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium may have to head to the polls again if two advisers appointed by King Philippe on Monday fail to find agreement on forming a coalition government over the next fifty days, one of the advisers said.
Belgium has been run by a caretaker administration with limited powers for more than a year as a May election failed to resolve the standoff.
The king earlier on Monday tasked Bart De Wever, leader of the centre-right N-VA, the largest party in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, and Paul Magnette, Socialist party leader in the French-speaking Walloon region, with the job.
They will look into the possibilities and the requirements for forming a government. Various teams appointed by the king in recent months went back to him empty handed.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's justice minister said on Monday the European Union may be in a position to force Warsaw to legalize gay marriage if EU leaders make financial aid conditional on upholding democratic norms, and warned that this was unacceptable.
At talks in Brussels on the next EU budget and an economic recovery plan, some leaders have demanded that payouts be blocked to member states which the executive European Commission (EC) deems to be undermining democratic values.
Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro said this would give Brussels the possibility of ""arbitrarily"" blocking payments worth billions of euros.
""There is a real risk that we may find ourselves in a situation where the EC will effectively force us to introduce the so-called homosexual marriages with the right to adopt children,"" he told a news conference.
""Well, we cannot agree to this under any circumstances."" 
The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power five years ago on a pledge to defend traditional family values. Gay marriages are illegal in Poland and President Andrzej Duda was re-elected this month after saying he would not allow adoptions by gay couples or permit classes on gay rights in state schools.
Gay rights activist Alicja Sienkiewicz of the Lublin Equality March Association, which supports lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, said members of the LGBT community were being portrayed as enemies of the state.
""This is bizarre. If you want to get these (EU) funds, you should automatically accept how the EU expects them to be spent, because adhering to the rule of law means adhering to basic human rights and it is about respecting them,"" she said.
Poland is at loggerheads with the European Commission over several issues, including judicial reforms which Brussels says undermine the independence of the judiciary. The government says the reforms are needed to overhaul the communist-era system.

466,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Special Report: China expands amphibious forces in challenge to U.S. beyond Asia,"By David Lague
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China launched its military build-up in the mid-1990s with a top priority: keep the United States at bay in any conflict by making the waters off the Chinese coast a death trap. Now, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) is preparing to challenge American power further afield.
China's shipyards have launched the PLA Navy's first two Type 075 amphibious assault ships, which will form the spearhead of an expeditionary force to play a role similar to that of the U.S. Marine Corps. And like the Marines, the new force will be self-contained - able to deploy solo with all its supporting weapons to fight in distant conflicts or demonstrate Chinese military power.
The 40,000-tonne Type 075 ships are a kind of small aircraft carrier with accommodation for up to 900 troops and space for heavy equipment and landing craft, according to Western military experts who have studied satellite images and photographs of the new vessels. They will carry up to 30 helicopters at first; later they could carry fighter jets, if China can build short take off and vertical landing aircraft like the U.S. F-35B.
The first Type 075 was launched last September and the second in April, according to reports in China's official military media. A third is under construction, according to the May edition of a Congressional Research Service report.
Eventually, the PLA Navy could have seven or more of these ships, according to reports in China's official military press.
Chinese military commentators quoted in official media say China's shipyards are now building and launching amphibious ships so rapidly it is like ""dropping dumplings"" into water.
The military rivalry between China and the United States is only growing sharper. Last week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared most of Beijing's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea illegal, throwing Washington's weight behind the rival claims of Southeast Asian nations over territory and resources in the strategic waterway that were supported by international law. China said the U.S. position raised tensions in the region and undermined stability.
China's nascent amphibious forces still lag far behind those of the United States, but the speed of China's military rise has already shifted the balance of power in Asia. Over the past two decades, China has deployed an arsenal of missiles and a massive surface and sub-surface fleet to deter potential enemies from sailing in its coastal waters. Now, as part of an accelerated modernization of the PLA since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, these new amphibious ships and the specially trained marines they carry will boost Beijing's firepower and political influence far from its shores, according to Chinese and Western military analysts.
As shipyards churn out amphibious vessels, China is expanding its force of marines under the command of the PLA Navy. These troops are being trained and equipped to make landings and fight their way ashore. China now has between 25,000 and 35,000 marines, according to U.S. and Japanese military estimates. That's a sharp increase from about 10,000 in 2017.
""Without an amphibious force, any military force is greatly constrained in where and how it can conduct operations,"" said Grant Newsham, a retired U.S. Marine Corps colonel and researcher at the Japan Forum for Strategic Studies. Newsham advised the Japanese military on the formation of Tokyo's own Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade, formed in 2018. ""Jets can drop bombs and ships can fire missiles at the shore - but you might need infantry to go ashore and kill the enemy and occupy the ground.""
China's Ministry of National Defense and the Pentagon did not respond to questions from Reuters.
At home, too, the PLA marines have become an important tool in the ruling Communist Party's efforts to showcase China's increasingly powerful military to its domestic audience. The state-controlled media regularly reports on the gruelling training and military skills of the Jiaolong, or Sea Dragon commandos - a unit from the marines special forces brigade based on Hainan Island off southern China.
""We should be the point of the sword in joint operations to strike terror into the heart of the enemy,"" said Gong Kaifeng, a Jiaolong commandos company commander, in a report last year on the unit's training broadcast on state television.
When the Type 075 ships enter service, China will have the capacity to combine them with its other new amphibious and support vessels, Chinese and foreign analysts say. These self-contained fleets can be sent to distant conflicts, deployed as a show of force to deter potential enemies or to protect Chinese investments and citizens abroad. They would also allow the PLA to provide disaster relief and humanitarian assistance, competing with the U.S. for prestige and soft power.
INVADING TAIWAN
For Beijing, these amphibious forces will also contribute to the PLA's mounting capacity to make a landing on Taiwan or seize other strategically important or disputed territory in China's offshore regions, according to specialists in amphibious warfare.
Beijing regards self-governing Taiwan a province of China. Xi Jinping has said unifying Taiwan with the mainland is a vital step in realizing the Chinese people's dream of a powerful, rejuvenated nation. In a key speech early last year calling on Taiwan to open talks on peaceful reunification, Xi warned that this long-standing dispute could not be deferred indefinitely. ""We make no promise to renounce the use of force and reserve the option of taking all necessary means,"" Xi said.
China has this year stepped up military operations and exercises around Taiwan, according to U.S. and Taiwanese military analysts. PLA Air Force jets, including at least one bomber and a fighter, briefly entered Taiwan's air defense identification zone on June 22, before being warned off by the Taiwanese air force, the island's military said. It was the eighth such encounter in two weeks, the military said.
Taiwan launched its annual Han Kuang defense exercise on July 13 with an emphasis on joint operations between land, sea and air forces to defend the island from attack, according to the island's military. The exercise also involved an expanded role for reservists as the military strives to boost its firepower, senior Taiwan government officials said.
""Our military is always working hard to prepare for war, closely monitoring the dynamics of the Chinese Communist's military and the development of the situation in the Taiwan Strait,"" Taiwan's Defense Ministry said in response to questions from Reuters. ""We have a complete defense plan and appropriate actions to deal with the threat of the Chinese Communists attacking Taiwan and the seizure of offshore islands, which can ensure national security.""
Experts on amphibious forces note the PLA already has powerful army units that are trained and equipped to make the kind of landings necessary for an invasion of Taiwan. In expanding the marines, they argue, PLA military planners are looking at operations across the globe, in places where China has extensive offshore investments. These commercial interests are likely to multiply as Beijing presses ahead with its Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious bid to put China at the center of global trading routes.
China's marines will also be important to man what is expected to become a network of strategic military bases around the world, including fortifications on territory Beijing has seized in the South China Sea, according to Chinese and Western military commentators.
Beijing has already deployed marines and their armored vehicles to its first overseas base at Djibouti on the Horn of Africa, according to Pentagon reports. Marines are also deployed on the flotillas China sends on naval anti-piracy missions to the Gulf of Aden, these reports said.
""We are currently only seeing the tip of the iceberg,"" said Ian Easton, the senior director of the Project 2049 Institute, an Arlington, Virginia-based security research group. ""Ten years from now, China is almost certainly going to have marine units deployed at locations all over the world. The Chinese Communist Party's ambitions are global. Its interests are global. It plans to send military units wherever its global strategic interests require.""
Short of war, capable amphibious forces will also become a powerful diplomatic or coercive tool for Beijing, military analysts say. So far, Washington has had a monopoly on this type of engagement with other governments, routinely sending marine expeditionary units abroad for port visits, joint training exercises and disaster relief.
U.S. expeditionary flotillas, packed with marines, all their heavy equipment and air support, are a potent reminder of American power. A raw demonstration came in the tense period in 1999 when an Australian-led United Nations peacekeeping force intervened to stop violence in what was then Indonesian-controlled East Timor. American forces didn't become heavily involved on the ground. But the presence of the USS Belleau Wood, a 40,000-tonne amphibious assault ship carrying 900 marines and heavy lift and attack helicopters, served as formidable back-up as the UN troops restored order without any significant resistance from Indonesia.
SEIZING ISLANDS
China's first two Type 075 amphibious assault vessels are now berthed together undergoing final fit-out at a state-owned Shanghai shipyard, China's official military media has reported. Photographs in the official media and commercial satellite images show that the 250-meter-long vessels appear similar to flat-top amphibious assault ships in service with other advanced navies, including the U.S. fleet. America currently has a fleet of eight Wasp and two America-class amphibious assault vessels.
However, in a blow to U.S. efforts to blunt the challenge from China, the Wasp-class amphibious assault ship USS Bonhomme Richard caught fire on July 12 while tied up at its home port in San Diego. The ship was extensively damaged in the fire which burned for four days. It was unclear if the ship would be salvaged, the U.S. Navy said.
Since 2005, China has also built a fleet of six Type 071 amphibious ships, according to a 2019 report from the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency. These vessels can carry up to four air-cushion landing craft, similar to the hovercraft carried on U.S. amphibious landing ships, as well as four or more helicopters, armored vehicles and troops on long-distance deployments, the report said. A seventh Type 071 is under construction, according to Western military analysts.
China's official shipbuilding industry journals have reported the 29,000-tonne Type 071 has command and control capabilities, a medical unit and accommodation for hundreds of marines. The 210-meter long vessel has a range of 10,000 nautical miles and reached a speed of 25 knots in trials, these reports said.
To build the force that will embark on these ships, China began a rapid increase in the size of its marine force in 2017, according to Pentagon reports. Earlier, marines had been a low priority in the decades when China's military built a massive ground force to defend the mainland. A regiment of marines was formed in 1953 and expanded to a division but then disbanded in 1957, according to an official timeline of major events in PLA history. It was reformed in 1979, the timeline shows.
The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency report said China's marine force is now organized into seven brigades, each with armor, infantry, artillery and missiles, and is the strongest force of this type among the rival claimants to disputed territories in the South China Sea. China's marines ""can simultaneously seize multiple islands in the Spratlys,"" the report said, referring to a contested group of islands and reefs in the South China Sea. They could also rapidly reinforce China's outposts in the Paracel Islands, another disputed territory in the same waterway. China does not publish detailed accounts of the disposition of its forces.
Amphibious warfare specialists say these marines would also be useful for seizing other disputed territory, including the uninhabited group of isles in the East China Sea that are claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing - known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China.
Selected army units are being transferred to the marines to boost the force's capability, according to reports in the official Chinese military media and Western defense analysts. China's official military newspaper, the PLA Daily, reported in April that two army units trained in aerial assault had been transferred to a marines brigade dedicated to helicopter landings.
The Pentagon's annual report on Chinese military power in 2018 revealed that a newly established headquarters under the command of the navy was responsible for staffing, training and equipping the expanding force. And, the report said, a new commander had been appointed to lead the marines. China's state-controlled media has identified him as Major General Kong Jun, a former army officer who transferred to the marines in early 2017.
Despite this build-up, the Pentagon and other Western military experts argue the PLA marines remain far less capable than the 186,000-strong U.S. Marine Corps, with its extensive experience of amphibious and land operations.
In its 2019 report on China's military power, the Pentagon said most of the new PLA marines brigades were not yet manned and equipped to be fully operational. It said China's marines lacked sufficient armored vehicles, helicopters and training to conduct complex amphibious operations.
Some Western military experts suggest one reason for this: The top priorities for the PLA brass are the army amphibious units and air force airborne troops that would spearhead an attack on Taiwan. So, the marines ""don't have priority when it comes to things like amphibious tanks and helicopters,"" said Easton of the Project 2049 Institute, who has written a book, The Chinese Invasion Threat, on the PLA's preparations to conquer Taiwan.
The ruling Communist Party has long wanted control of Taiwan for political reasons. The island also has huge strategic importance. It would give the PLA a key foothold in the so-called first island chain, the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas. From bases on Taiwan, Chinese warships, strike aircraft and missiles would dominate the sea lanes vital to Japan and South Korea. And Taiwan would be an ideal jump-off point for operations aimed at seizing further territory in the island chain.
Newsham, the retired U.S. Marine colonel, said the PLA had assembled a formidable army amphibious force and sufficient ships, military and civilian, to probably land enough troops on Taiwan as part of a full-scale attack that includes air, missile, naval and cyber assaults. ""The PLA already has a lot lined up,"" he said.

A video purportedly shot by the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), showing dozens of armed gang members in bullet proof vests in front of armored cars painted in military-style camouflage, went viral on social media on Friday.
Lopez Obrador said he would not repeat the mistakes of previous administrations that failed to contain cartel violence, which surged after former President Felipe Calderon launched a military-led crackdown on the gangs in late 2006.
""Violence cannot be confronted with violence, fire cannot be extinguished with fire, evil cannot be confronted with evil,"" he said. ""Evil must be confronted with good.""
Lopez Obrador said his government would face down gangs with intelligence rather than force, focusing on poverty and other root causes of crime.

468,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 20, 2020 02:10PM ET</span>","'We are a battleground now': In Southeast Asia, U.S.-China tensions flare on social media","By Poppy McPherson and Karen Lema
(Reuters) - Tensions between the United States and China over the South China Sea have erupted into a war of words on social media, in what analysts see as a change in U.S. strategy amid a burgeoning superpower rivalry in Southeast Asia.
After Washington last week hardened its position by explicitly rejecting Chinese maritime claims in the South China Sea, U.S. embassies in the region produced an unprecedented flurry of op-eds and statements criticising Beijing's actions.
China's response was fiery, accusing Washington of ""defaming China with untrue words so as to mislead the public"" in the region.
""We are a battleground now,"" Renato de Castro, an analyst with the Albert Del Rosario Institute for Strategic and International Relations in the Philippines, told Reuters by phone. ""It will be a long game.""
A week ago, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Beijing's claim to about 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea ""completely unlawful"" and accused Beijing of seeking a ""maritime empire"".
U.S embassies in Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines and Cambodia followed up with comments on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and in editorials in local news outlets saying that Beijing's actions fitted a pattern of encroachment on others' sovereignty.
The U.S ambassador to Thailand accused Chinese dams of holding back water from the region's Mekong river during a drought last year.
The embassy in Yangon drew parallels between the South China Sea and ways it said China was interfering in Myanmar, citing investments it said could become debt traps, the trafficking of women to China as brides, and the inflow of drugs into the country.
In a swift counterattack, China's ambassador to Thailand accused Washington of ""attempting to sow discord between China and other littoral countries"".
In a Facebook post that twice referred to the United States as ""dirty"", China's Myanmar embassy said its agencies abroad were doing ""disgusting things"" to contain China and showed a ""selfish, hypocritical, contemptible, and ugly face"". 
The statements attracted thousands of regional social media comments, many attacking China while questioning the motives of both countries.
""Thank you USA for doing what is the law requires,"" commented Chelley Ocampo under the U.S embassy in the Philippines' Facebook post. 
After someone wrote on the U.S. embassy in Malaysia's page, ""Imperial Yankee Go Home !!!!!!"", American diplomats replied, ""Are you saying that you are ok with the PRC's bullying tactics in the SCS?""
'CLARIFICATIONS AND REBUTTALS'
Wang Wenbin, China's foreign ministry spokesman, told a news conference in Beijing it was the ""U.S. that first published comments attacking and condemning China"" and its diplomats were issuing clarifications and rebuttals in response.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the apparently coordinated social media offensive.
The war of words marks a strident new tack for U.S diplomacy in the region, analysts said.
The U.S. statements aimed to tie the South China Sea to local concerns ""to depict Beijing as an unequivocal threat to the sovereignty of the Southeast Asian nations"", said Sebastian Strangio, author of an upcoming book on China's regional influence.
Meanwhile, China's response was consistent with ""pugnacious 'Wolf-Warrior' diplomacy"" since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, he said, referring to increasingly nationalist Chinese rhetoric.
Strains have become more evident in the South China Sea recently, with U.S. and Chinese navies holding simultaneous exercises in a waterway that China claims over smaller rivals, including the Philippines and Vietnam, on the basis of history.
China ""couldn't afford allowing the U.S to make appreciable gains in turning regional opinion"", said Collin Koh Swee Lean, a research fellow at the Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

""At least some of the Southeast Asian governments... may secretly, if not publicly, welcome the latest Pompeo statement and thereby possibly be emboldened to resist its moves in the disputed waters.""

ABUJA (Reuters) - A Nigerian official collapsed on Monday during a televised parliamentary hearing held as part of an investigation into allegations of mismanagement at an organisation with a remit to foster economic development in the oil-rich Niger Delta region.
Daniel Pondei, acting managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), was taken to hospital after slumping forward in his chair during the session, in which he gave evidence to the panel.
Lawmakers in the House of Representatives, the lower chamber of parliament, are investigating alleged corruption around procurement at the NDDC, a government body, over 20 years. The probe was ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari in October.
Nigeria's oil-producing Niger Delta heartland remains impoverished despite providing most of the oil produced in Africa's biggest crude exporter. Oil is Nigeria's main export and the mainstay of its economy, the continent's largest.
Earlier, Pondei told the panel: ""There is no money missing in NDDC since I took over in February this year. Everything we have done are in accordance with the laid-down procedures."" 
After he fainted, people around Pondei rushed to sit him upright, using handkerchiefs as fans and forcing his mouth open in an apparent attempt to ensure he was not choking. 
""I have asked my doctor to follow, go to the hospital where he is and report back,"" House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila later told the panel.
Giving evidence to the panel for the first time, Minister for Niger Delta affairs Godswill Akpabio said Nigeria's Bureau for Public Procurement (BPP) had given its approval for an audit by international firm Ernst & Young.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's King Felipe was greeted by hundreds of chanting protesters during a visit to Catalonia on Monday as pressure mounted on him in Madrid to respond to corruption allegations swirling around his father, former king Juan Carlos.
While the demonstrators squared off with police and shouted ""We don't have a king"" as Felipe and Queen Letizia visited a monastery near Tarragona, ministers are demanding action amid calls for a parliamentary investigation.
In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened an investigation into Juan Carlos' involvement with a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia after Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi King.
Through his lawyer, Juan Carlos, 82, has repeatedly declined to comment on the allegations.
The newspaper added that Juan Carlos later gave $65 million to Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a businesswoman with whom he had a relationship that led to his abdication in 2014. Her representatives have said she's done nothing wrong.
Juan Carlos was popular for his role in the country's transition to democracy in the late seventies, before various scandals eroded public approval a decade ago and forced him to pass the throne to his son.
This time, the focus is on the rail contract affair.
""We want a pretty intense investigation into the activities of the citizen Juan Carlos de Bourbon,"" Consumer Affairs Minister Alberto Garzon, of the leftist Izquierda Unidad party, told reporters on Monday, referring to the former king.
A government source told Reuters that the cabinet ""expects some gesture from King Felipe, something that will distance his father even more from the Royal House."" 
""The options are various ... It's something that must be decided by the royal house. Looking for a way out of the (royal family's) Zarzuela palace, as some media have said, may be an option. The decree of abdication could also be studied to reduce privileges. Whatever it is must be announced now, imminently.""
Another option raised by Spanish media is whether Juan Carlos could lose the title of King Emeritus, which he has had since abdicating following outrage over a secret luxury elephant-hunting trip and a corruption scandal centred on his daughter and her husband. 
The monarchy itself, or any change in the constitution, is not at stake at this stage, experts said. There is no majority for that in the Spanish parliament and the constitution gives the former king immunity for his time on the throne.
Javier Perez Royo, professor of Constitutional Law at the University of Seville, said it was ""science fiction"" to think the constitution could be changed. 
He said one possibility would be for Felipe to tell his father to leave palace and stop being a member of the royal household. But voters were likely to want more than that, so no immediate resolution of the problem was in sight.
The Royal House and a representative for Juan Carlos did not immediately respond to requests for comment. They have repeatedly refused to comment in recent weeks.
A friend of Juan Carlos, Jaime Carvajal Urquijo, said on Twitter: ""The government's pressure on Felipe VI to take action against his father, without waiting for the courts to rule and without respecting the presumption of innocence, is outrageous!"" 

In mid-March, when latest the corruption allegations surfaced, Felipe had already renounced any inheritance from his father and ended the former king's palace allowance.

The prosecutors added that the suspect had confessed to the crimes during their investigations.
The anti-Semitic gunman last October opened fire outside the synagogue in the city of Halle on Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish year.
After failing to enter the synagogue, he fatally shot a woman passing by and a man inside a nearby kebab shop. The attacker livestreamed his attack.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement he was concerned that Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen leader and a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, was using the novel coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to inflict further human rights abuses on people in the region.
""The Department has extensive credible information that Kadyrov is responsible for numerous gross violations of human rights dating back more than a decade, including torture and extrajudicial killings,"" Pompeo said.
Kadyrov responded to Monday's announcement on his Telegram channel with a photo of him smiling and standing in what appears to be an armory filled with weapons, holding light machine guns with tripods.
""Pompeo, we accept the fight. This will get interesting,"" he said. 
Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in response to the sanctions: ""It will be difficult to respond tit-for-tat, but we will think of something.""
Washington's action also bars Kadyrov's spouse and daughters from traveling to the United States.
The United States has previously blacklisted Kadyrov, including under a 2012 law known as the Magnitsky Act, which imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death in prison of Sergei Magnitsky, a 37-year-old Russian auditor and whistleblower.
Kadyrov became head of Chechnya in 2007 in the aftermath of two brutal wars between Russia's military and separatist and Islamist forces following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.

Moscow credits Kadyrov with reining in a radical Islamist insurgency in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus region, but human rights advocates accuse him of presiding over widespread abuses.

About 200 demonstrators denounced the government and the army, accusing it of inappropriate defence spending and of interfering in politics by backing Prayuth's bloodless 2014 putsch, which saw him installed as prime minister.
Though Prayuth now leads a civilian government following an election last year, critics say the military ensured the deck was stacked in his favour by writing a constitution that virtually guaranteed victory for his party.
The rally followed a protest in Bangkok on Saturday of about 2,500 people, who demanded the government dissolve parliament, step down and end harassment of its critics, in one of the biggest street demonstrations since the 2014 coup that ousted the last elected administration.
That rally and subsequent, smaller protests on Sunday in Chiang Mai, Ubon Ratchathani, were in defiance of a coronavirus ban on gatherings. Though police were present, there were no arrests.
Demonstrators on Monday displayed signs of detained or missing dissidents and carried placards saying ""no coup"" and reminding soldiers their duty was to the public. 
One leader tore up a large poster of the army chief, General Apirat Kongsompong. 
Prayuth, a former army chief, has seen opposition to him grow recently. Since Thursday six of his Cabinet members have resigned.

Their exit comes as Southeast Asia's worst performing economy, which the central bank says could shrink by a record 8.1% this year, tries to recover from the impacts of the coronavirus crisis.

PARIS/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Investigators examining the black boxes from the Ukrainian jet accidentally shot down by Iran have recovered its cockpit voice data, France's BEA accident investigation bureau said on Monday.
Iranian forces say they downed the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 jet on Jan. 8 after mistaking it for a missile amid heightened tensions with the United States. All 176 people on board - including 57 Canadians - were killed. 
""CVR data - including the event itself - has been successfully downloaded,"" the BEA said in a tweet, referring to the cockpit voice recorder.
It did not elaborate on the content of the audio, which records pilots' verbal communications and other cockpit sounds. The release of any further information is a matter for Iranian authorities leading the investigation, a BEA spokesman said.
Iran agreed in June to send the recorders to the BEA for analysis, ending a long standoff with Canada, Ukraine and France.
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Iran's transfer was a much-needed and long-overdue step.
But he expressed doubt over an interim report by Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation that blamed a misalignment of a radar system and lack of communication between the air defence operator and his commanders.
""I don't put much credibility into that report. It's not just the result of human error - I think that would be an oversimplification of what really happened,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
""We need to understand who the responsible people are, who gave that order, how could the airspace still be open, how were these missiles fired?""
The aircraft was shot down hours after Iran fired missiles at Iraqi air bases housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the U.S. drone killing of a senior Iranian commander.

The data extraction is being carried out with an Iranian investigator and observed by Canadian, U.S., Swedish and British experts and representatives from UIA, Boeing (N:BA) and engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF).

The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) said it feared the arrests were the start of a crackdown and intimidation of government opponents to stop the July 31 protests.
Many citizens say their economic prospects have worsened since President Emmerson Mnangagwa took over from the late Robert Mugabe following a coup in 2017. Mnangagwa says the economy is being sabotaged by local and foreign opponents.
Police said they had arrested Jacob Ngarivhume, leader of a small opposition outfit who called for the protests, which are being backed by the MDC. They also detained freelance journalist Hopewell Chin'ono.
The two were being held in police custody and faced charges of ""incitement to participate in public violence,"" police spokesman Andrew Phiri said in a statement.
Chin'ono has gained a following on social media by being critical of the government's handling of the economy and corruption. Earlier, he posted a video of armed police entering his room and ordering him to put his phone down.
The government is wary of demonstrations after the last major protests in January 2019 turned violent and scores of people died after a crackdown by security forces. 
Authorities have warned that protests violate coronavirus rules that outlaw large gatherings. They have said they plan to tighten the lockdown in opposition strongholds Harare and Bulawayo.

Mexico has been blighted by gang violence for many years, with successive governments failing to tackle the problem. According to the latest data available, more than 34,600 murders were registered last year, a record.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised to reduce the violence with a new strategy after taking power in December 2018, but homicides have continued to tick up.
In the first six months of 2020, there were 17,439 murders, a 1.7% increase on the same period last year, according to figures presented by Security Minister Alfonso Durazo at a regular news conference with Lopez Obrador.
While murders fell in June by 2.2% compared with the previous month, the third consecutively monthly drop, Durazo conceded the figures remained ""very high in absolute terms"".
Murders of women because of their gender, categorized as femicides, increased more swiftly during the first six months, rising by 9.2% from last year to 489, the figures showed.
Bringing about a lasting reduction in Mexico's murder rate would take time as the government works to tackle poverty and other root causes of crime, Durazo noted.
""If (the) increase (in murders) was the product of a long social process, its decrease will also be the product of a long social process,"" he said.
Still, other serious crimes, including kidnappings and robbery, have fallen during the coronavirus pandemic.

""While many Danes have used the corona crisis to spend more time with the family, many Danish sailors have had to do without family and friends for much longer than usual,"" Business Minister Simon Kollerup said. 
Sailors will be granted visas to enter or travel through Denmark in controlled settings, the ministry said, to allow them to embark or disembark ships in Denmark or neighbouring countries.
The U.N. International Maritime Organization (IMO) has called the situation a ""humanitarian crisis"" and maritime welfare charities had warned of an increase in suicides at sea.
Upon landing in Denmark, home to the world's biggest container shipping group, Maersk, seafarers will be isolated in hotels and airports will establish special transit areas to avoid contact with other people, the ministry said.

MINSK (Reuters) - The leading opposition presidential candidate in Belarus has sent her children abroad to an undisclosed location in the EU after receiving threats they would be taken away unless she quits the race, an opposition journalist said.
Svetlana Tikhanouskaya launched her bid to unseat President Alexander Lukashenko in the Aug. 9 election after her husband, a popular anti-Lukashenko blogger, was arrested in May.
She has since become Lukashenko's surprise main challenger, earning the endorsement last week of two leading opposition figures who were barred from standing themselves. On Sunday, she held her first official election campaign rally, attended by thousands of people.
""We brought the kids out because they genuinely threatened her. They threatened to arrest her and take away her kids,"" opposition journalist Nataliya Radina said in a video posted on YouTube.
Radina said the children were abroad with their grandmother. She gave no further details of how the children had left the country or where they had gone.
A Belarus news portal, tut.by, quoted Tikhanouskaya as saying her 4-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son were in a ""safe place"". Tikhanouskaya could not be immediately reached for further comment.
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 while tolerating scant opposition, but faces the biggest challenge in years to his authority amid anger over his dismissal of the COVID-19 pandemic and grievances over the economy and human rights. 
Tikhanouskaya decided to run after her husband Syarhei Tikhanouski was detained amid a crackdown by Lukashenko's security forces.
She was initially hesitant about standing, releasing a video in June in which, fighting back tears, she said she had received an anonymous phone call threatening that her children would be taken away unless she abandoned her campaign.

Protests in support of opposition candidates have flared in towns and cities across the country. Hundreds of people have been detained. Lukashenko has compared the protesters to criminal gangs.

Officially called Yeoman Warders and instantly recognisable with their distinctive red and blue hats and uniforms, the Beefeaters live with their families inside the fortress which houses the Crown Jewels, glittering symbol of the British monarchy.
Historic Royal Palaces, which manages the Tower along with Hampton Court Palace, Kensington Palace and other sites said the coronavirus had knocked a 98-million-pound ($124-million) hole in its finances. 
""The closure of our six sites for almost four months has dealt a devastating blow to our finances, which we expect to continue for the rest of the financial year and to be compounded by the slow recovery of international tourism,"" said John Barnes, chief executive of Historic Royal Palaces.
""We simply have no choice but to reduce our payroll costs,"" said Barnes. ""We urgently need the public to support us by visiting our sites now they have re-opened.""
The Tower of London, founded by William the Conqueror, has been a symbol of English royal power, wealth and terror for nearly a thousand years, acting variously as a fortress, a magnificent lodging and a prison to torture and execute enemies of the state.
But the coronavirus has ravaged its finances. Historic Royal Palaces said its income had fallen by 87% and that it did not expect tourism to fully recover until 2023-2024.
There are currently 37 Yeoman Warders, a unit created by the founder of the Tudor dynasty Henry VII in 1485 as personal guard. Henry's son, Henry VIII, decreed that some of them would stay and guard the Tower permanently.
The Beefeaters have been included in a voluntary redundancy scheme which was launched in June and closed last week, though Historic Royal Palaces said a compulsory redundancy process will follow.

The foundation has specialised in publishing high-impact investigations into what is says is official graft. Those targeted have sometimes disputed its findings and taken successful legal action against it. 
Navalny said the latest court fines, which amounted to 88 million roubles ($1.23 million), were the last straw for the foundation. 
""What to do...?"" Navalny said. ""Everything we had was already seized in previous police raids. Now they're going to take away the organisation itself.""
He said the group had no option but to shut down and re-launch under a new name, registered as a new business and called on his supporters, who he said donate around 6 million roubles a month to the organisation, to re-subscribe.
Authorities have subjected the foundation's offices to frequent searches, frozen its bank accounts, and its employees and volunteers have been routinely detained for participating in protest rallies.
Authorities have also accused it of money laundering, an allegation Navalny has said is trumped up. 

Navalny was barred from running in a presidential election in 2018 and jailed last summer after calling for mass opposition protests in Moscow which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets.

At least 10,000 people demonstrated in Khabarovsk on Saturday to demand Moscow release Sergei Furgal, a member of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic Party (LDPR) who won election in 2018 after beating a rival from the ruling pro-Putin party.
Furgal, born in Russia's Far East, was detained on July 9 and flown to Moscow to face charges over the murder and attempted murder of multiple businessmen 15 years ago. He denies wrongdoing. 
Protests broke out soon afterwards and have continued for over a week. Their size is unusual for Russia's regions, as is the fact that the authorities have not yet moved to break them up.
Putin on Monday formally removed Furgal from his post and appointed Mikhail Degtyaryov, 39, a lawmaker and also an LDPR member, to take over as the acting head of the region, according to a decree published on the Kremlin website.
The Kremlin has so far publicly played down the protests which have highlighted anger among some in the Far East over what they see as policies emanating from detached federal authorities located in Moscow seven time zones to the west. 
The unrest also comes less than three weeks after Russians voted to back a set of sweeping reforms clearing the way for Putin to run for two more presidential terms, potentially remaining in the Kremlin until 2036 rather than stepping down in 2024. 
Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, whose allies in the region have backed the demonstrations, cast Degtyaryov as a detached Kremlin appointee whose selection he predicted would fail to appease protesters.

Khabarovsk will hold regional elections to choose a fully-fledged new governor in September next year, Russia's election commission said.

The company is now operating three vessels for the six to eight-day trips from Passau, in Germany, to Budapest, passing scenic hills and old castles along the way.

Guests come mostly from Germany, Austria and Switzerland as there are still travel limitations on groups coming in from the United States, United Kingdom and Israel, he said. 
Passengers must take a COVID blood test before coming onboard, and wear masks when moving around. Tables are placed well apart with dividing screens and waiters wear masks and gloves.
Guests have their temperatures checked daily, and special safety rules apply for excursions.
""I don't think they booked the cruise fully ... it seems like it is a safe experience so I don't have any worries,"" said Kilian Weber, an English teacher from Switzerland travelling with his partner.
Another couple from Germany, Pia and Michael Rusp, booked their trip in January, well before the pandemic started spreading in Europe.

Seasonal workers were permitted into the country in early May under a three-month special licence. 
Petsas added that land entry to Greece will be allowed only via six northern border crossings to better control imported COVID-19 cases. 
Greece started easing lockdown measures in early May, but social-distancing rules still apply. It toughened rules for visitors at the border with Bulgaria earlier this month and stepped up spot checks inside the country.
The Mediterranean nation has so far managed to contain the spread of the virus to just over 4,000 cases, faring better than other European Union countries mainly due to an early nationwide lockdown.

The whale was spotted on Saturday struggling to get free of a net usually used for fishing illegally for swordfish.
The coastguard said in a statement that operations were hampered by the large size of the whale, which had become highly agitated.
Due to its energetic efforts to free itself, the whale had been given the name ""Fury"".
It is the second time in less than a month that the Italian coastguard has had to intervene to free a sperm whale tangled in a fishing net.
""These damn fishing nets are doing huge damage. I haven't slept in 36 hours ... divers managed to take off some of the net but then it started to move and it became too dangerous,"" biologist Monica Blasi told daily newspaper La Repubblica.

Blasi said they attached a light to Fury's tail so as not to lose sight of it as they tried to remove the rest of the net.

Ouattara, 78, had said he would step down and named his close ally, Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, as the RHDP party's candidate for the Oct. 31 ballot.
But Gon Coulibaly died on July 8, leaving the party without a candidate in the run-up to an election that is expected to test political stability in the world's top cocoa producing nation.
The vote is expected to be the most hotly contested since 2010, when Ouattara's victory over incumbent Laurent Gbagbo sparked a brief civil war in which 3,000 people died. 
Coulibaly's death, less than a week after he returned to Ivory Coast from an extended medical leave in France for heart issues, had raised fears of a scramble for power. 
""A majority of our supporters have turned to President Alassane Ouattara. He is our solution, and I have explained this to him,"" the party's executive director, Adama Bictogo, told RFI radio.
Ouattara's candidacy would help avoid bitter succession battles, Bictogo added. 
""Why should we take the risk when we have this certainty,"" he said. ""If he (Ouattara) refuses, we then we'll look into it and make a decision. For now, I have no other candidate in mind.""
Ouattara would announce his decision in the next few days, Bictogo said. 
Ouattara has previously said he would prefer to hand over power to a new generation, although he also says he has the right to run again under a new constitution adopted in 2016.

Octogenarian ex-president Henri Konan Bedie of the former ruling PDCI party has declared that he will run in the election.

""I will bear responsibility ... I apologise to Kenyans and I will face the full consequences of the law,"" Johnson Sakaja, who represents Nairobi county and is a close ally of President Uhuru Kenyatta, told reporters on Monday. 
Police said Sakaja was caught in the early hours of Saturday morning drinking with about 10 others, long after a 9 p.m.-4 a.m. curfew had set in. He is the first Kenyan official to lay on his sword after breaking the myriad lockdown rules. 
His lawyer and fellow senator Mutula Kilonzo said Sakaja would appear in court on Tuesday to face undisclosed charges. 
Kenya began easing its lockdown earlier this month, but kept the curfew in place as well as a prohibition on bars. There have been a string of arrests for people drinking illegally. 
The East African nation has so far reported just over 13,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 234 fatalities.

The victims, mainly prisoners from the wartime detention camps for non-Serbs near the town of Prijedor, were told they were being released in a prison exchange but instead were driven to the Koricani Cliffs in central Bosnia, lined up on the edge of the ravine and shot by Bosnian Serb forces in August 1992.
Five were recovered from under rocks piled over their bodies while the sixth was unearthed from the Jablanica-Prosara mass grave, one of more than 70 mass grave sites in the area.
""I have been waiting for this day for 28 years ... 28 long, painful and sad years,"" Sanel Fazlic, 40, told Reuters while standing by flag-draped coffins containing the remains of his father and two uncles.
Relatives had planned to bury 30 victims but the coronavirus outbreak prevented many of those living abroad from attending.
It has taken years to locate the mass graves and identify the victims. Last year 68 newly identified victims were buried in Kamicani and another 10 at other locations in the area.
The Prijedor area saw some of the most violent ethnic cleansing attacks in 1992 by the Bosnian Serb police and army against Bosniaks and Croats.
Villages were razed, thousands were taken to detention camps, more than 3,000 non-Serbs were executed and tens of thousands were driven from their homes.
Eleven Bosnian Serb ex-policemen were convicted of the crime, including Darko Mrdja who was jailed for 17 years by the Hague-based international war crimes tribunal. The remainder were convicted by the Bosnian war crimes court.

The suspected mastermind of the killing, Simo Drljaca, the Prijedor police chief, was killed in an exchange of fire with NATO-led peacekeeping forces in 1997 in their first attempt to arrest suspects still at large.

""There's no problem in wearing one, I'm completely for it,"" said Elina Outh, a 22-year-old business student who called in to buy some of Gaci's pastries. 
""What's happening makes sense and I think it should have happened a long time ago.""
Government edicts about wearing face coverings to curb the spread of COVID-19 have touched off fierce debate in the United States and elsewhere about civil liberties. 
In France, most people accept them as a necessary tool to fight the epidemic.
A nationwide ruling requiring face coverings in shops, banks, covered markets or any other enclosed public space came into force on Monday. Anyone violating the rule is liable to pay a 135-euro ($155) fine. 
Ministers accelerated the rule change because, even though the disease has abated nationwide, there have been localised flare-ups that sparked fears of a second wave. More than 30,000 deaths in France have been linked to COVID-19. 
At the covered market at La Baule-Escoublac, a resort on France's Atlantic coast, a sign was displayed reading: ""Stop Coronavirus. The wearing of a mask is mandatory.""

A fishmonger at the market, who gave his name as Gregory, said shoppers had been complying. ""Since lockdown, people in La Baule were used to almost always wearing a mask, so people are respecting the rules,"" he said.

Malaysian health authorities recorded 21 new coronavirus cases on Monday, lifting the total since the outbreak began to 8,800 cases and 123 deaths.
Monday's was the second straight daily double-digit rise in infections, after Malaysia managed to broadly hold daily growth to single digits since the lockdown was eased on June 10. The number of positive cases climbed by 15 on Sunday, and by 18 two days prior.
Muhyiddin said the string of double-digit daily increases, coupled with the new clusters detected in several states across the country, has led the government to think that it may be necessary to make wearing face masks in public compulsory. 
""The details will be announced once the relevant regulations are finalised by the government,"" Muhyiddin said in an address broadcast on national television.
Malaysia was among the earlier countries in the region to impose strict curbs on public activity, closing borders, barring mass movement, and ordering all but key sectors to shut operations in March as it fought to contain the spread of COVID-19.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's leader has sacked officials building a hospital after they pressed the public for contributions, media reported on Monday, the second rebuke linked to the high-profile project in a country where such problems are rarely publicised.
Leader Kim Jong Un ordered the Pyongyang General Hospital to be built by the 75th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party in October, calling it a ""top priority"" in improving public health in the face of the novel coronavirus.
But during his latest visit to the site, Kim fired a group of project managers, called the construction coordination commission, for failing to allocate a proper budget and supplying equipment and materials from ordinary citizens. 
""He severely rebuked them for burdening the people by encouraging all kinds of 'assistance',"" the KCNA state news agency reported, calling the incident a ""serious digression"" from party policy.
KCNA released photographs of a serious-looking Kim speaking at the site with officials wearing masks.
It was his second rebuke for the managers this month. He earlier criticised them for causing delays with ""inattention"" and violating unspecified anti-epidemic rules.
Kim praised builders on the project for making rapid progress despite ""difficult situations"" but told the party to ""investigate the performance of the construction coordination commission as a whole and replace all the officials responsible"", KCNA reported.
Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the sackings suggested a setback for a prestigious project and hinted at broader difficulties facing the economy.
""It indicates potential delays and further obstacles in meeting the October deadline given difficulties in mobilising resources due to the pandemic and sanctions,"" Yang said.

North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus but has taken intensive prevention measures, including a ban on gatherings, an order to wear masks and mandatory quarantines for border workers.

GUWAHATI,India (Reuters) - Intense rain and floods in the Indian state of Assam have killed at least 84 people and displaced more than 2.75 million since May, authorities said on Monday, as they tried to collect the bodies of nine rare rhinos drowned in the past 10 days.
Rescue teams were facing a double challenge of rising flood waters amid the novel coronavirus as villagers driven from their homes huddle in shelters.
""It's hard to enforce social distancing when people are being ordered to move away from the rising waters,"" said Sanghamitra Sanyal, a member of the northeastern state's flood management force.
""We're urging people to at least cover their mouth and nose with a piece of clean cloth."" 
Officials warned that the water level in the Brahmaputra river was expected to rise by 11 cm (4.3 inches), two weeks after it burst its banks swamping more than 2,500 villages.
Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by flooding every rainy season despite flood-control efforts.
Rights groups accuse corrupt officials of siphoning off funds meant for flood projects, resulting in shoddy construction of embankments which are often breached.
Floods have also inundated the Kaziranga National Park, home to the world's largest concentration of one-horned rhinoceros, with an estimated 2,500 out of a total population of some 3,000 of the animals.
""Nine rhinos have drowned and over 100 other animals have been killed,"" Atul Bora, Assam's agriculture minister who is Kaziranga's member of the state parliament, told Reuters.

With the park waist-deep in water, rhinos, elephants and deer have been forced to seek refuge on roads and in human settlements.

Bar staff need practical rules on how to interact with customers, said Shinya Iwamuro, a urologist and public health advocate who has been teaching infection control measures in Tokyo's Shinjuku district and other nightspots.
That means no kissing, no sharing plates and conversation should be at right angles to avoid droplet contamination.
""As much as possible, kiss only with your partner, and avoid deep kissing,"" Iwamuro told a news conference, outlining what he described as ""kiss etiquette"".
Strategic testing in the nightlife districts of Tokyo has revealed rising daily cases of coronavirus, predominantly among people in their 20s and 30s. The clusters prompted the Tokyo governor to raise the city's alert to the highest ""red"" level on July 15.
With cases in Tokyo nearing 300 a day late last week, officials excluded people travelling to and from the capital from a multibillion dollar government campaign aimed at reviving domestic tourism.
The government is also considering toughening its special measures act that allows it to declare a state of emergency. Media reported Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga as saying there may be more spot checks of nightlife businesses.
But concern has grown that nightlife has become a scapegoat for the failure of authorities to track and contain the disease.
Masayuki Saijo, director of virology at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, said it was not appropriate to discriminate against people based on where or when they work.
""There's no difference, working at night or working in the day,"" Saijo said. ""The strategy to reduce human-to-human infection is the same.""
The host and hostess scene provides a kind of safety net for many Japanese seeking work, particularly single mothers, said Kaori Kohga, representative director of the Nightlife Business Association.
More than a million people are estimated to work in the industry, she said.
Her group has drafted its own safety rules for its members, including disinfecting karaoke microphones, as it found government recommendations, such as wearing masks and two-metre social distancing, were impractical, she told reporters.

""Nothing will change if you're only criticising us as the bad guys,"" Kohga said, adding the government hadn't acknowledged their rules nor offered enough financial help to businesses or workers.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's 84-year-old ruler, King Salman bin Abdulaziz, has been admitted to hospital in the capital Riyadh, suffering from inflammation of the gall bladder, state news agency SPA said on Monday.
The king, who has ruled the world's largest oil exporter and close U.S. ally since 2015, is undergoing medical checks, the agency added, without giving details.
After the news, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi postponed a visit scheduled to Saudi Arabia, said Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said.
King Salman, the custodian of Islam's holiest sites, spent more than 2-1/2 years as the Saudi crown prince and deputy premier from June 2012 before becoming king. He also served as governor of the Riyadh region for more than 50 years.
The de facto ruler and next in line to the throne is the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, widely referred to as MbS, who has launched reforms to transform the kingdom's economy and end its ""addiction"" to oil.
The 34-year-old prince, who is popular among many young Saudis, has won praise at home for easing social restrictions in the conservative Muslim kingdom, giving more rights to women and pledging to diversify the economy. 
To the king's supporters, this boldness at home and abroad was a welcome change after decades of caution, stagnation and dithering. 
But state control of the media and a crackdown on dissent in the kingdom make it difficult to gauge the extent of domestic enthusiasm.
The crown prince's reforms have been accompanied by a purge of top royals and businessmen on charges of corruption, and a costly war in Yemen, which have all unnerved some Western allies and investors.
His prestige also suffered a blow after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 at the hands of Saudi security personnel seen as close to him.

Wong is one of more than a dozen young, more confrontational politicians who outshone old guard democrats in unofficial opposition primaries this month in what many saw as a protest vote against a national security law imposed by Beijing.
The Sept. 6 vote will see the democratic opposition try to reclaim some political influence in a city assembly stacked with Beijing loyalists. Only half its seats are directly elected.
Political analysts and democracy activists expect authorities will try to disqualify some candidates.
Beijing says the primaries were illegal and may have violated the security law, which punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
""With the possibility of facing a life sentence ... I still hope to receive people’s mandate and let the world know that we will continue to fight until our last breath,"" Wong, who sees himself as a prime target of the new law, told reporters.
In the past four years, authorities have barred 18 democrats from running in local elections, including Wong, according to the group Civil Rights Observer.
Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement protests, was not been a leading figure of the often-violent protests that shook the semi-autonomous financial hub last year.
However, he has drummed up support for the pro-democracy movement abroad, meeting politicians from the United States, Europe and elsewhere, drawing the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a ""black hand"" of foreign forces.
He was disqualified from running in the former British colony's district council elections last year on the grounds that advocating for Hong Kong's self-determination violated electoral law, which he described at the time as political censorship.
Wong has said he supports the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong’s future but that he is against independence.

Wong did not sign a form in which candidates are asked to pledge allegiance to Hong Kong and its mini-constitution, the Basic Law. The form is not mandatory, but candidates are required by the security law to pledge allegiance in writing or through other means.

The vote, won by the incumbent Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, was seen as key for Poland's future relations with the EU, which have been frayed by the bloc's concerns over the rule of law.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A surge in COVID-19 cases in Australia's second-biggest city could take weeks to subside despite a lockdown and orders to wear masks, Australia's acting chief medical officer said on Monday as the country braces for a second wave of infection.
Authorities in the state of Victoria, whose capital Melbourne is in partial lockdown amid a new outbreak, reported 275 new COVID-19 cases on Monday, down from a daily record of 438 three days earlier.
Australia's Acting Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said it would take ""weeks"" to slow the outbreak to levels seen as recently as June, when Victoria and the rest of Australia reported single or double-digit daily infections.
""We have learned over time that the time between introducing a measure and seeing its effect is at least two weeks and sometimes longer than that,"" Kelly told Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio.
Australia has recorded about 11,800 coronavirus cases with a death toll of 123, a fraction of what has been seen in other countries. In most Australian states the disease has been effectively eliminated.
Less than a month ago, Australia was widely heralded as a global leader in combating COVID-19 but quarantine lapses in Victoria triggered a flare-up in infections in June. An official inquiry into the outbreak began hearings on Monday.
Victoria's government has ordered about five million people into a partial lockdown for six weeks and told residents around Melbourne to cover their faces if they have to leave their homes.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said it was too soon to declare that such measures had flattened the outbreak.
""Until we bring some stability to this, we won't be able to talk about a trend,"" he said, referring to the drop in daily new cases.
The Victorian outbreak and rising daily cases in neighbouring New South Wales, the country's most-populous state, are stoking fears of a national second wave.
NSW reported 20 new infections on Monday, the highest in three months. The transmission rate in the state is higher than in Victoria, despite social distancing restrictions being tightened.
NSW authorities have been unable to trace some of the clusters and state authorities have urged people to avoid unnecessary travel and public transport.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would consider tightening social-distancing restrictions in cities like NSW capital Sydney if the numbers continued to rise over the next few weeks.
Should NSW be forced to implement new restrictions, it would be a hammer blow to Australia's hopes for a quick economic recovery. Already, Australia is facing its first recession in nearly three decades, with unemployment at a 22-year high.
Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg will later this week announce how Australia's conservative government plans prop-up an ailing economy. Its centrepiece economic policy, a A$70 billion ($48.9 billion) wage subsidy scheme is set to expire at the end of September.
Deloitte Access Economics on Monday estimated around 240,000 businesses in the hospitality, professional services, and transport industries in particular are at high risk of failure after September without enduring government support.

In the project - #shutupfor30days - he also sealed his mouth with packing tape with ""404"", the error code for a webpage not found, written across it, a nod to the blocking of online content that is common in China for sensitive issues. 
""If you ask me how an artist should digest unfair treatment, such as violence or censorship, my first reaction is: keep fighting, with art,"" said Brother Nut.
The 39-year-old artist has built a reputation for statement-making projects in a country where the room for dissent has shrunk and censorship has intensified under President Xi Jinping.
China faced a barrage of criticism over the virus that emerged late last year in Wuhan, from being slow to sound the alarm to the treatment of a doctor who tried to alert authorities about the outbreak but was reprimanded by police for ""spreading rumours.""
The doctor, Li Wenliang, became a symbol of the outbreak in China and later died from coronavirus.
""Sometimes I feel my job is similar to that of an NGO or a journalist - seeking to raise awareness of social issues and the moves to counter them,"" said the soft-spoken, long-haired artist during an interview at a cafe in Shanghai's M50 art district.
Brother Nut's previous performances include tugging a battery-powered vacuum cleaner around Beijing and creating a solid brick from polluted air.
In 2018, he invited a heavy metal band to play in a village polluted with heavy metals, prompting local environmental authorities to investigate the contamination. 
To speak up for investors who lost their savings in a financial scam, Brother Nut staged a torch relay dubbed ""Good Luck Beijing,"" which in Chinese sounds similar to ""Beijing Olympics"". 
He was later detained for 10 days by police.
Threats and calls from police are commonplace, which he said makes him angry, rather than fearful, although he does not want his real name to be published.
Brother Nut acknowledged that during last month's project to maintain silence, he sometimes spoke to himself while eating.

""We need expressions of art whenever and wherever. They're like flowers growing in cracks, and allow us to dance in the most desperate time,"" he said.

Last month, the judiciary said Mahmoud Mousavi-Majd, who was arrested in 2018, had spied on former Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani, adding however that the case was not connected to Soleimani’s killing earlier this year.
On Jan. 3, a U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Soleimani, leader of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force. Washington had accused Soleimani of masterminding attacks by Iran-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region.
The execution comes at a time when millions of Iranians have taken to social media to protest against the death sentences awarded to three men accused of participating in anti-government protests last November. 
Their executions have been suspended, one of their attorneys, Babak Paknia, said on Sunday.

Witnesses said security forces fired tear gas last Thursday to disperse demonstrators in the southwestern city of Behbahan who were protesting against economic problems but also the death sentences against the three men.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghans shared accounts of violence linked to the Taliban on social media with the hashtag phrase 'don't redeem the Taliban' as anxiety grows as the United States withdraws troops and attempts to usher peace talks with the militant group.
The accounts of alleged violence and human rights abuses with the hashtag phrase in Dari meaning 'don't redeem the Taliban' have been shared more than 100,000 times on Twitter.
Kabul-based Twitter user Ejaz Malikzada, 26, said the message had gained traction as Afghan social media users sought to remind foreign powers not to sacrifice achievements on human rights made in the last few decades.
""By participating in this hashtag I want to tell those foreigners who insist on starting peace talks in Afghanistan, they have ignored or forgotten the crimes and violence committed by the Taliban against Afghan people,"" he said.
Though millions of Afghans have no access to Twitter, for many, social media movements allow people to voice their concerns and share their grief from remote parts of the country. 
The Taliban has carried out attacks that have killed thousands of civilians around the country as they waged an insurgency since their ouster from power.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for a number of attacks this month, the most recent last week when a car bomb exploded at a government compound.
During their 1996-2001 rule they enforced their strict interpretation of Islamic law under which women were barred from education or leaving the house without a male relative.
The group say they have changed their approach to women's rights and operations by government and foreign forces have also killed many civilians. 
But many Afghans and human rights activists remain sceptical, saying they are concerned that impending U.S.-brokered peace talks, aimed at ending more than 18 years of war, will not include adequate protection of human rights if the insurgent group returns to a role in formal power. 
Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said he suspected the social media campaign was due to 'anti-peace elements' and that ""no legitimate rights will be lost"" during peace talks.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne confirmed in a tweet https:// on Sunday that the black boxes of a downed Ukrainian airliner that killed all 176 people on board in January had arrived in Paris, ending a months-long standoff.
The black boxes are expected to be brought to France's air accident agency, BEA, on Monday for analysis, Champagne said, adding that Canadian transportation officials would be present.
Iran's Revolutionary Guard has said it accidentally shot down Ukraine International Airlines Flight PS752 on Jan. 8, mistaking it for a missile at a time when tensions were high between Iran and the United States.
Many of the victims killed in the crash were Canadian citizens or permanent residents, or had Canada as their final destination.
On Saturday, Iran's deputy foreign minister said the boxes had been sent to France for analysis.

The fate of the cockpit voice and data recorders has been the subject of an international standoff since the plane was shot down, with Canada, France and Ukraine demanding access.

508,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 07:27PM ET</span>",U.K. Fight With China Gets Ugly Over Hong Kong Extradition Pact,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. is about to test the risks of a wider confrontation with China that’s been a long time coming.
The next act is playing out Monday when Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab addresses Parliament. The top diplomat has dropped a heavy hint the U.K. will suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, a former colony it handed back to China in 1997. The move would mark a further diplomatic escalation to a conflict that takes on the reach of Huawei Technologies Co. in post-Brexit Britain and the possibility of it sanctioning China over human rights abuses.
In a sign of growing tension, China’s ambassador to London threatened the U.K. with retaliation and accused it of bowing to U.S. pressure by banning Huawei from the U.K.’s 5G network. China also is irked by Prime Minister Boris Johnson inviting as many as 3 million Hong Kong residents to apply for U.K. citizenship.
“You have seen what happened between China and the United States,” Liu Xiaoming said on BBC Television on Sunday. “They sanctioned Chinese officials; we sanctioned their senators, their officials. I do not want to see this tit-for-tat between China-U.S. happen in China-U.K. relations.
“I think the U.K. should have its own independent foreign policy rather than dance to the tune of the Americans, like what happened to Huawei.”
The stakes extend beyond Britain. The U.K. is part of the world’s most extensive intelligence-sharing network known as Five Eyes and after parting ways with the European Union it is vying for commercial opportunities to establish its “Global Britain” brand. In China’s eyes, an unresolved Brexit could make the U.K. vulnerable.
Canada’s experience, for example, offers a cautionary blueprint.
After Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in 2018 at Vancouver’s airport on a U.S. extradition request, China detained two Canadians.
The two were indicted on spying charges in June and Canada has also faced trade repercussions. China stopped buying Canadian soybeans and for a while banned its pork and beef. Beyond the boycott, there was the risk of targeted cyber attacks or that Canadians traveling to China risked arrests.
Potential British targets are emerging after the U.K. government reversed itself and excluded Huawei. China’s displeasure can take multiple forms, from boiler-plate rhetoric to actions behind the scene.
Bytedance Ltd.’s TikTok, the video app that President Donald Trump has said he’s considering banning, has suspended talks to build a global headquarters in the U.K., the Sunday Times reported. Bytedance is a private company, but it has found itself in the crosshairs of Beijing’s politics abroad, such as when a skirmish in a disputed area of the China-India border saw it banned in India.
Communist Party officials, meanwhile, have warned British companies doing business in China they’re set to face retaliation over the government’s decision to stop working with Huawei, according to the report.
What seems inevitable is that U.K.-Chinese relations are likely to chill further. In a Sky News interview, Raab was asked if the two countries still enjoy a “golden era” of diplomatic relations -- a term coined five years ago by then U.K. leader David Cameron.
“It’s not a phrase I would use,” responded Raab.
Meanwhile, the pressure from the U.S. is unrelenting. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo is due in London on Monday to meet Raab and U.K. lawmakers from all main parties on topics including “the fact that China now concerns everyone,” Conservative lawmaker Bob Seely said in an interview.
Canada, the U.S., Australia and New Zealand are the other Five Eyes members. The U.S., Canada and Australia suspended the extradition treaty and New Zealand is considering it. The U.S. is locked in a superpower trade war with China, while the others have economically vital relationships with the Asian titan.
“We’re going to follow U.K. national interests and we’re going to work with our partners — try and work with China on the things where we can really accentuate the positive, but be very clear-sighted and clear-eyed about the risks and we’re going to protect our vital interests and on Hong Kong,” Raab said on Sky News on Sunday.
Liu called the ban on Huawei, which includes removing all of the Chinese company’s 5G infrastructure equipment in the U.K. by 2027, a “dark day” for the U.K.
He also warned Raab that if he seeks to impose sanctions on any individuals in China, there will be a “resolute response.”

It said 15 of the wounded had been taken to a hospital on the Turkish side of the border and that some were in critical condition.
Azaz has been under the control of rebels backed by Turkey since Ankara's first incursion into Syria in 2016, in an operation that aimed to drive away Islamic State militants and the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia from its border with Syria.
Ankara regards the U.S.-backed YPG as a terrorist organisation. The operation ended in 2017.

ECOWAS, which represents countries in West Africa, sent a delegation to Mali last week to try to help end the crisis, with the protesters calling on Keita to resign over what they say is his failure to halt violence by jihadist groups or address the disputed results of recent legislative elections.
Issuing its recommendations on Sunday, the delegation proposed that Mali's Constitutional Court examine the contested elections and that Keita create a new government including opposition members and civil society. 
The M5-RFP coalition, which has led the protests, dismissed the recommendations.
""(ECOWAS) came to support Keita and threaten the M5-RFP. All they want is their vision, Keita's vision, but not ours,"" said coalition spokesman Nouhoum Togo. 
Further protests were inevitable until Keita stepped down, Togo said. 
The government did not respond to requests for comment. An ECOWAS representative could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The president has offered concessions including dissolving the Constitutional Court, but the opposition has hardened since police fired on protesters and leading members were arrested this month.
The coalition has said that 20 people have been killed in the protests this month. The Health Ministry puts the toll at 11. 
International powers fear turmoil in Mali could undermine their military campaigns against Islamist insurgents in West Africa's Sahel region. The United Nations has over 13,000 peacekeeping soldiers in Mali, the epicentre of much of the violence.

Authorities had said last week that the mosaics would be concealed with either curtains or lasers when the first prayers are held next Friday.
In a move that sparked sparked international criticism and concern, President Tayyip Erdogan declared Hagia Sophia open to Muslim worship earlier this month following a court ruling that said the building's conversion to a museum in 1934 was unlawful.
Hagia Sophia dates back to the sixth century and has a history as both a church and a mosque before it was turned into a museum. 
In an interview with broadcaster NTV, Kalin said some mosaics of Mary and Gabriel that are positioned in the direction of Qiblah, where Muslims face during prayer, would be covered with curtains.

514,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 19, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>","'Mr. No, No, No' - Why Dutch PM Rutte plays role of EU bogeyman","By Toby Sterling
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - As EU negotiations over a coronavirus recovery fund and a new budget for the bloc ran into an impasse, Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte was singled out by one leader this weekend as the ""man responsible for the whole mess"". 
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban accused him of that, while Spanish and Italian diplomats have taken to calling him ""Mr. No No No!"".
Standing up for not spending money on European projects requires a naysayer, and Rutte has taken on the role with calculated determination as leader of a group of smaller ""frugal"" nations.
While he may cut a less colourful figure than Margaret Thatcher a generation ago, Rutte's readiness to don the mantle of parsimony after Britain's departure from the EU is solidly grounded in public opinion and politics at home.
The Dutch, who support EU membership by a two-thirds majority, take pride in both their history as a trading nation and their traditional Calvinist thrift.
Dutch taxpayers are aware that they are proportionately among the largest contributors to the EU budget, and the idea of giving or lending more is unpopular. 
The ""Mr. No"" moniker derives from an April video clip, frequently retweeted, that shows a Dutch waste collector shouting at Rutte not to give money to ""those Italians and French"".
""Oh, no, no, no."" Rutte replied. ""I will remember this."" 
Critics say the Dutch reluctance to spend now is misplaced, given the country's large trade surplus with the rest of the EU. Unicredit (MI:CRDI) economist Erik Nielsen argued in a note on Sunday that the Dutch 2018 net budget contribution of 2.4 billion euros ""tells only a small part of the real financial story"".
""According to the Tax Justice Network, that same year, the Netherlands’ tax haven structures helped them grab 6.7 billion euros in tax receipts from Germany, France, Italy and Spain,"" he wrote.
But conversations in the Netherlands more often focus on whether Dutch prosperity is the result of a tougher work ethic, and whether it is fair to share funds with countries that have a lower retirement age.
Domestic politics also play a role. With national elections looming in March, Rutte's conservative VVD Party must jockey with far-right parties for exactly those voters most likely to be euro-sceptic.
In addition, his current centre-right coalition lacks a majority in parliament. Any compromise struck in Brussels now that goes too far in the eyes of the Dutch might not be ratified later in The Hague.

This rejection happened in 2005 and again, to a deal Rutte had agreed to, in 2016.

Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has long said foreign-owned media outlets have meddled in Poland's affairs and that Polish-owned media should have a stronger place. The accusation was leveled again in the recent presidential campaign, during which incumbent and PiS ally Andrzej Duda repeatedly accused foreign media or foreign-owned media of misinforming the public. 
When asked if PiS would introduce reforms before the end of their term, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told Polish public radio on Sunday that he hopes the reforms will be carried out soon. 
""We will manage to do this much faster (than before the end of our term), at least on the legislative level, but this process' success is tied to many changes that we have to bring about in our country as well as international relationships,"" Kaczynski said. 
PiS has maintained that any new law would have to adhere to EU rules, which could hamper the party's political aim to substantially reduce the influence of foreign-owned outlets, such as Discovery-owned broadcaster TVN. 
But, in the wake of last week's presidential vote, where Duda won a second term in office, PiS has been emboldened in its criticism of the influence of foreign-owned media outlets in Poland. 
Kaczynski said any potential rules are still ""being analyzed and there are discussions on the matter."" 

Many options were being considered, a PiS official told Reuters earlier this week, adding that the purchase of regional newspapers, many of which are German-owned, was among the ideas that had come up, Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza reported last week.

Flanked by senior government and military officials, state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi laid a wreath at a mausoleum dedicated to Aung San, her father and the country's independence hero, who was assassinated alongside members of his cabinet on July 19, 1947.
Crowds also laid flowers beside statues of Aung San, who remains a potent political force in the country, with his image used by his daughter and some of her rivals to garner support among a public that continues to revere him. 
The former ruling military junta for years curtailed use of his image for fear it would help the democracy movement that emerged in 1988 led by Suu Kyi.
In the commercial capital of Yangon on Sunday, crowds queued to approach a statue of Aung San clutching portraits of the independence leader and his daughter, waiting on markers painted in the road to encourage people to keep a distance.

When protesters began throwing rocks, the authorities opened fire, said Matthew Kanu, a department head at the University of Makeni.

People voted across government territory at more than 7,000 polling stations, including for the first time in former rebel bastions that the army has recaptured over the last two years. 
Assad's opponents denounced the vote as a farce, nearly a decade into a war that has killed hundreds of thousands of people and made millions refugees. 
The elections, originally set for April, were postponed twice due to the coronavirus pandemic. At a polling station in the capital Damascus, many voters - who were disinfected upon arrival - said they were worried about the rising costs of living. 
""We have to find a solution for the living conditions,"" said Samer Mahmoud, who owns a clothing shop. 
""God willing, I hope we overcome these sanctions,"" said Mouna Sukkar after casting her ballot.
More than 1,600 candidates, many prominent businessmen, were competing for 250 MP seats in the third such election since the conflict erupted in 2011. No surprises were expected in the vote that marked Assad's second decade in power, with no real opposition to the ruling Baath party and its allies. 
The Syrian National Coalition, an opposition bloc based in Turkey that had Western backing, called it a ""theatrical election by the Assad regime"" with millions uprooted or in exile. 
In the town of Douma, in the eastern suburbs of Damascus where a fierce army offensive snuffed out insurgents in 2018, candidate banners hung in front of piles of rubble, collapsed rooftops and buildings pockmarked with bullets.
Dozens of people crowded a polling station where a portrait of a smiling Assad covered a wall. 
""I came to vote...because we want to live in safety and for the rising prices to go down. There's a big turnout,"" said Ziad, a resident who fled and returned some two years ago. In 2016, when the town was rocked by fighting, he had cast his ballot in Damascus.
The town was the site of a suspected poison gas attack that killed dozens of people in 2018 and prompted Western missile strikes. Damascus and Moscow denied any chemical attack took place.
Thanks to help from Russia and Iran, Assad holds more of Syria than at any time in the war, with the northeast in Kurdish hands, and rebels now confined to a northwest corner near the Turkish border. 
But the battered economy is sinking deeper into trouble, hit also by a financial meltdown in Lebanon that choked off dollars and the toughest U.S. sanctions yet imposed last month.

Washington says the goal is to hold Assad to account. Damascus blames them for the hardship, as soaring prices and a fall in the value of the currency makes life harder for Syrians.

The 25 million figure put forward by Rouhani on Saturday is nearly a third of the population and massively higher than the official number of COVID-19 cases. Official case numbers rose to 273,788 on Sunday, with 14,188 deaths, Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said.
A Health Ministry statement carried by Iranian news media said the figure given by the president was based on numbers produced by a deputy in the ministry.
""It is not possible to rely on serological tests to diagnose the current state of the disease,"" the statement said.
Serological tests determine if a person has been exposed to a disease by showing their antibody response. In the coronavirus pandemic, they have been used by countries to survey samples of the population and estimate overall infection rates -- whether or not people have had severe, mild or no symptoms of COVID-19.
“Serological tests only show if people have been exposed to the virus in the past,” Mostafa Qanei, head of the government’s scientific committee of the coronavirus task force, was quoted as saying by the state IRINN website. PCR tests of the throat and nose are needed to diagnose COVID-19, he added.
Iran has been hardest hit by the pandemic in the Middle East, with infections and deaths rising sharply since restrictions were eased, beginning in mid-April. Still, the number given by Rouhani took many Iranians by surprise.
Turkey has suspended flights to Iran because of coronavirus worries, a spokesman for Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, Reza Jafarzadeh, was quoted as saying on Sunday by the official IRNA news agency.
Parliament deputy Alireza Salimi called on the government to come up with a single official figure for coronavirus cases.
In announcing the 25 million estimate on Saturday, Rouhani did not say what the figure was based on, but added that 30-35 million more were possibly at risk. 

A coronavirus task force official said Saturday the 25 million were “mildly affected patients who ... did not need to seek medical advice”.

The United States last week hardened its position on the South China Sea, saying it would back countries in the region that challenge Beijing’s claim to about 90% of the strategic waterway. 
In a statement on Saturday, the U.S. embassy in Yangon called China's actions in the South China Sea and Hong Kong, where Beijing has imposed tough new national security laws, part of a ""larger pattern to undermine the sovereignty of its neighbors"".
The U.S. statement drew parallels between China's actions in the South China Sea and Hong Kong with large-scale Chinese investments projects in Myanmar that the United States warned could become debt-traps, along with trafficking of women from Myanmar to China as brides, and the inflow of drugs from China into Myanmar.
“This is how modern sovereignty is often lost - not through dramatic, overt action, but through a cascade of smaller ones that lead to its slow erosion over time,"" the U.S. embassy said.
In its rebuke, China said the statement showed a ""sour grapes"" attitude by the United States towards ""flourishing China-Myanmar relations"" and was ""another farce on a global tour by the U.S. authorities to shift the attention on domestic problems and seek selfish political gains"".
“The U.S. should first look in the mirror to see whether it still looks like a major country now,” it said.
The Chinese embassy in Yangon did not answer phone calls seeking further comment. The U.S. embassy was not immediately available for comment.
Myanmar has increasingly become a battleground for influence between the two countries since relations between the government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and the West became strained over its treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.
Author and historian Thant Myint-U told Reuters in an email although the country was of negligible economic value to the rivals, its strategic importance as a bridge between mainland China and the Bay of Bengal was hard to ignore.
""Myanmar’s instincts since independence in 1948 are to try to be friends with everyone, but it's not clear that's going to remain possible, in this coming period of increasingly febrile superpower rivalry,"" he said.
""The sheer weight of China's giant industrial revolution next door is already transforming Myanmar; if multi-billion dollar infrastructure projects are added to the mix, the border between the two countries will become increasingly difficult to see,"" he said.
""It's important to remember that Myanmar was one of the few countries in the world where the last Cold War led to proxy armed fighting which in turn led to military dictatorship and decades of self-imposed isolation.""

GUWAHATI, India/KATHMANDU, Nepal (Reuters) - Nearly four million people in India's northeastern state of Assam and neighbouring Nepal have been displaced by heavy flooding from monsoon rains, with dozens missing as deaths rose to at least 189, government officials said on Sunday.
The overflowing Brahmaputra River, which flows through China's Tibet, India and Bangladesh, has damaged crops and triggered mudslides, displacing millions of people, officials said.
More than 2.75 million people in Assam have been displaced by three waves of floods since late May that has claimed 79 lives after two more deaths were reported overnight, a state government official said. 
""The flood situation remains critical with most of the rivers flowing menacingly above the danger mark,"" Assam water resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters. 
Assam is facing the twin challenge of combating floods and the coronavirus pandemic. Out of 33 districts, 25 remained affected after the current wave of flooding, beginning a fortnight ago.
India is grappling with the novel coronavirus, which has infected nearly 1.1 million people and 26,816 have died from the COVID-19 disease, government data showed on Sunday. 
In neighbouring Nepal, the government asked residents along its southern plains on Sunday to remain alert as heavy monsoon rains were expected to pound the Himalayan nation where more than 100 have died in floods and landslides since June, officials said.
Some 110 people were killed and another 100 injured as landslides and flash floods washed or swept away homes, upended roads and bridges and displaced hundreds of others in 26 of the country's 77 districts, police said.
Home ministry official Murari Wasti said the death toll was expected to rise as 48 people were still missing.
""Search and rescue teams are looking for those who are missing in different places but chances of finding them alive are slim,"" Wasti told Reuters.
Barun Paudel of the weather forecasting office in the capital, Kathmandu, said heavy rains were expected to pound much of the mainly mountainous nation in the next four days. 
""We have urged residents to remain alert against possible landslides and floods,"" he said.

Landslides and flash floods are common in Nepal, India's Assam and Bihar states during the June-September annual rainy season.

531,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2020 10:30PM ET</span>",Baloch families seek answers from Pakistan as more disappear amid insurgency,"KARACHI/QUETTA, Pakistan (Reuters) - For over 11 years relatives of people who disappeared in the murk of a separatist insurgency in southwestern Pakistan have gathered outside the Press Club of Quetta wanting to know who took their fathers, husbands and sons.
The daily sit-in protest in the provincial capital of Balochistan began on June 28, 2009 after a doctor, Deen Muhammad, was abducted by ""unknown men"".
Relatives suspect Muhammad, like many other missing ethnic Balochs, was snatched by Pakistani security forces hunting separatists, who for decades have waged a campaign for greater autonomy or independence.
Sometimes less than a dozen join the daily protest, other days many more, but Muhammad's two daughters have been among the regulars since they were eight and ten years old.
""Our little hands were holding pictures of our father back then; now we have grown up and we still have no clue if he is alive,"" Sammi Baloch, now 21, told Reuters by telephone from Quetta.
Even when the weather is too extreme in Quetta to hold protest, a sit-in is observed by Balochs in front of the press club in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and a melting pot for different ethnic groups.
The insurgency in Balochistan, a sparsely populated, mountainous, desert region bordering Afghanistan and Iran has sometimes waned and sometimes intensified over the years. 
But for all the durability of the Baloch struggle, the conflict has seldom drawn international attention. It grabbed headlines however, in late June when a group of young Baloch militants launched an attack on the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi.
On Tuesday, three soldiers were killed and eight wounded in an area known for attacks by Baloch fighters. But beyond giving the grinding casualty toll, the veil of secrecy over the conflict is seldom lifted, and foreign journalists are often discouraged from visiting Balochistan.
Multiple calls, texts and emails to Pakistan's human rights ministry, the military and Balochistan's provincial government, seeking comment for this story went unanswered.
The military did issue a statement last year sympathising with families of missing Balochs, while saying that some may have joined militant groups and ""not every person missing is attributable to the state.""
Pakistan has repeatedly blamed India for fanning militancy in Balochistan, a charge New Delhi has consistently denied.
    
MORE MISSING
Last month, the Balochistan National Party (BNP) quit Prime Minister Imran Khan's parliamentary bloc, frustrated by unfulfilled promises to address Baloch grievances including the festering issue of the disappeared.
When he led the BNP into an alliance with Khan's coalition two years ago, Akhtar Mengal gave the government a list of 5,128 missing persons.
Since then over 450 of the people on the list have been found or returned to their families, but during the same period Mengal says another 1,800 were reported to have disappeared.
""If you cannot recover people, at least stop disappearing more people,"" said Mengal.
Another Baloch party - set up in the months prior to the 2018 elections with backing from the military establishment, according political analysts - is in a coalition with Prime Minister Khan's party at both federal and provincial level.
Balochistan Awami Party Senator Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar told Reuters the numbers of missing are ""exaggerated"".
But, Mama Qadeer, who heads a group called Voice for Baloch Missing Persons, keeps his own count. 
""In last six months, the number of Baloch missing persons has risen,"" he told Reuters by telephone. His son disappeared a decade ago.
In February last year, Qadeer's group handed a list of 500 missing to provincial officials. Since then nearly 300 have been returned to their homes, but 87 others disappeared in the first half of this year, according to the group.
          
CHINA RAISES STAKES
A federal commission set up nine years ago listed 6,506 cases of enforced disappearances nationwide by the end of 2019. Most came from the northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.
Only 472 were registered from Balochistan. Advocacy groups say Balochistan's number is far higher, pointing to difficulty in having cases accepted by the commission.
""There's hardly a home in Balochistan that hasn't had a relative or loved one picked up,"" Mohammad Ali Talpur, an aged activist who once fought alongside Baloch insurgents in the 1970s, told Reuters.
The conflict has a long, complex history, but since that time the stakes have risen as Balochistan's wealth of copper, gold, gas and coal deposits caught China's eye.
The prospects of Pakistan's most reliable ally pouring in money excited successive governments, while fuelling Baloch resentment over how little would come their way.
Separatist militants have frequently targeted Chinese construction in Gwadar, a port on the Balochistan coast, near the entrance to the strategically-important Gulf.
And in 2018, the Balochistan Liberation Army launched an assault on the Chinese consulate in the southern port city of Karachi, killing four Pakistani police and civilians.
It was the most high profile attack by the group until June 29 this year, when its fighters attacked the stock exchange, again killing four people. 
The attack came a day after hundreds of relatives of missing Balochs gathered in Quetta to mark the four thousandth day of their protest since the disappearance of Dr Muhammad.

With little of the usual royal pomp and fanfare, the 31-year-old Beatrice married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi on Friday at Windsor Castle. She is the eldest daughter of Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York.
The couple had originally planned to marry in May, but the coronavirus lockdown forced them to reschedule and have a low-key ceremony. 
The 94-year-old monarch and her husband Prince Philip, 99, were among the few who attended. Wedding ceremonies have been allowed in England since July 4 but with a limit of 30 guests.
""The couple decided to hold a small private ceremony with their parents and siblings following the postponement of their wedding in May,"" the palace said in a statement. 
British media said the ""secret"" wedding would have been the first time that the queen had seen her second son Andrew, 60, since his friend Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested in the United States.
Maxwell is charged with luring young girls for late U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein to sexually abuse, accusations she denies. U.S. prosecutors also want to question the British prince about his contacts with Epstein but say he has so far evaded their requests, an allegation he rejects.
Buckingham Palace said Beatrice, who is ninth in line to the throne, wore a vintage ivory dress by Norman Hartnell and the Queen Mary diamond fringe tiara, both loaned to her for the day by the queen. 
Elizabeth wore the same tiara, made in 1919 from a diamond necklace given to Queen Victoria for her wedding, when she married Philip in 1947.
""Working within government guidelines, the service was in keeping with the unique circumstances while enabling them to celebrate their wedding with their closest family,"" the palace said. 

""No hymns were sung, but a selection of music was played. The National Anthem was played but not sung.""

Witnesses and GNA military commanders said a column of about 200 vehicles moved eastwards from Misrata along the Mediterranean coast towards the town of Tawergha, about a third of the way to Sirte.
The GNA recently recaptured most of the territory held by the LNA in northwest Libya, ending eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's 14-month campaign to take the capital, Tripoli, before the new front line solidified between Misrata and Sirte. 
Backed by Turkey, the GNA has said it will recapture Sirte and an LNA airbase at Jufra. 
But Egypt, which backs the LNA alongside the United Arab Emirates and Russia, has threatened to send troops into Libya if the GNA and Turkish forces try to seize Sirte.
The United States has said Moscow has sent warplanes to Jufra via Syria to act in support of Russian mercenaries who are fighting alongside the LNA. Moscow and the LNA both deny this. 
The LNA has itself sent fighters and weapons to bolster its defence of Sirte, already badly battered from earlier phases of warfare and chaos since the 2011 revolution against longtime autocrat Muammar Gaddafi.

537,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",Thai protesters call for government to resign,"By Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Around 2,500 Thai protesters on Saturday evening demanded the resignation of the government and the dissolution of parliament, defying a coronavirus ban on gatherings in one of the largest street demonstrations since a 2014 military coup.
People at the student-led rally near Bangkok's Democracy Monument cited a litany of complaints against the year-old civilian government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former army chief who ousted an elected government six years ago.
Organisers issued three demands: the dissolution of parliament, an end to harassment of government critics, and amendments to the military-written constitution that critics say virtually guaranteed victory for Prayuth's party in elections last year.
""How can we be OK with the lack of democracy like this?"" student activist Tattep Ruangprapaikit told the crowds.
There were also some veiled public references at the protest to the powerful Thai monarchy, despite a law forbidding criticism of the king. Such references would once have been unthinkable.
Police were on standby but did not move to stop the protest. The monument was cordoned off with signs reading: ""No entry without permission. Maintenance in progress.""
The protests started with student groups, but during the evening hundreds more arrived to join, swelling the numbers to about 2,500, according to organisers and estimates by reporters on the scene. 
The demonstration dispersed at about midnight, but organisers said they would return to the streets in two weeks if their demands were not met.
Public opposition to Prayuth has been growing in recent months.
Since last year's election, a court has dissolved the second-largest opposition party, giving his ruling coalition firmer control in parliament.
Prayuth also saw several cabinet members resign on Thursday over internal disputes.
Prayuth's Palang Pracharat Party campaigned on a vision of traditional Thai culture and loyalty to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy, but insulting the king is punishable by up to 15 years in prison, and many conservatives view the monarchy as sacrosanct.
Some signs and speeches at Saturday's protest made veiled references to the monarchy.
""This is our country, but whose home is in Germany?"" said one of the student leaders on a small stage set up on the street.
King Vajiralongkorn has an estate in Germany, where he spends much of the year.
A protest sign read ""Lost faith is definitely not a crime!!! #Thiwakorn"", in a reference to a separate protest in Thailand's northeast on Friday in support of a man who was committed to a psychiatric hospital after he wore a T-shirt saying he had lost faith in the monarchy.
Another banner said ""The People’s Party Isn’t Dead"" - a reference to the political party whose revolution ended absolute royal rule in 1932.

Prayuth last month publicly warned political activists not to risk their futures by criticising the monarchy.

The boat, which sank on June 27, is believed to have been carrying 55 to 60 migrants, according to Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. Five people have been arrested in relation to the incident.
Nine bodies were recovered from the lake on Saturday, bringing the confirmed death toll to 54, the governor's office said.
Lake Van is near Turkey's border with Iran, from where migrants from Iran, Afghanistan and other countries regularly cross into Turkey heading west towards Europe.
Seven people died and 64 were rescued when a boat carrying migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan sank on the lake in December.
More than a million people reached Greece from Turkey in 2015-16. Numbers dropped sharply following a 2016 agreement between the EU and Turkey for Ankara to take migrants back in return for funds.
Earlier this year, tens of thousands of migrants tried to cross into Greece via land and sea borders after Ankara said it would no longer stop them. 

Turkey, home to 3.6 million Syrians, the world's largest refugee population, had said it would open the frontier because it was alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria.

The army ruled Sudan for a few months after removing veteran leader Omar al-Bashir in April 2019, before signing a fragile three-year power-sharing deal with civilians under pressure from protesters.
In a statement on Saturday, the army said that legal action would be taken against activists, journalists and others both inside and outside Sudan. No further information was given, but the army said it would release more details in due course.
""The armed forces took this step after systematic insults and accusations crossed the bounds of patience. They are part of a plan targeting the country's army and security system,"" the statement said. 
Activists and rights groups accuse the army of blocking investigations into the killing of scores of protesters on June 3 last year when security forces broke up a sit-in outside the defence ministry. Witnesses say that a powerful paramilitary force played a leading role in the raid.
The army denies that it is obstructing the investigation, saying wrongdoers will be punished.
In May, the army appointed one of its officers as a commissioner to file legal complaints and follow them up under the supervision of the military prosecutor, the statement said.
It said the action was not an attempt to ""restrict freedoms"" and was in accordance with recently passed laws.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of Khartoum and other cities at the end of June, demanding faster reform and greater civilian rule in the country's transition towards democracy. The demonstrations were the largest since the transitional government took power late last year.
The transitional government led by Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok replaced slew of top ministers earlier this month and fired the police chief and his deputy in response to the protests. 
Hamdok, a technocrat, is expected to replace some state governors who are former army officers with civilians.

NANTES, France (Reuters) - A fire in the 15th century cathedral in the western French city of Nantes blew out stained glass windows and destroyed the grand organ on Saturday, and officials said they suspected arson.
Prosecutor Pierre Sennes told reporters three fires had been started at the site and authorities were treating the incident as a criminal act. He gave no other details.
Officials said an investigation had been opened.
The fire began in the early morning, engulfing the inside of the Gothic structure in massive flames. More than 100 firefighters worked at the site, bringing it under control after several hours and extinguishing it completely by the afternoon.
The fire came just over a year after a massive fire at the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris, which destroyed its roof and main spire.
""After Notre-Dame, the St. Peter and St. Paul Cathedral is in flames. Support to the firemen who are taking all the risks to save the Gothic jewel,"" President Emmanuel Macron tweeted from Brussels, where he was attending an EU summit.
The fire broke out behind the grand organ, which was completely destroyed, fire chief Laurent Ferlay told reporters. Stained glassed windows at the front of the cathedral were blown out and the fire also consumed a 19th century painting that had come from Rome.
However, the damage was not as bad as initially feared.
""We are not in a Notre-Dame de Paris scenario. The roof has not been touched,"" Ferlay said.
Prime Minister Jean Castex and the culture and interior ministers visited the scene later
""The state will take its share of the responsibility (to restore it),"" Castex told reporters outside the cathedral, adding that he had no further details on the cause of the fire.
Jean-Yves Burban, who runs a newsagent facing the cathedral, said he had opened his business and heard a bang at around 7:30 a.m.. He went outside to see huge flames coming from the building.
""I am shook up because I've been here eight years and I see the cathedral every morning and evening,"" he told Reuters. ""It's our cathedral and I've got tears in my eyes.""
It was not the first time fire has damaged the cathedral in Nantes, which is about 340 km (210 miles) southwest of Paris.
It was partly destroyed during World War Two in 1944 after Allied bombings. In 1972 a fire completely ravaged its roof. It was finally rebuilt 13 years later with a concrete structure replacing the ancient wooden roof.
""The fire of 1972 is in our minds, but at this stage the simulation is not comparable,"" Nantes Mayor Johanna Rolland told reporters.

In 2015, a fire that appeared to have been caused by renovation work destroyed most of the roof of another church in Nantes, the Saint Donatien Basilica.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Saturday accused world powers of ignoring inequality in global institutions, but said the coronavirus pandemic has created a ""generational opportunity"" to build a more equal, sustainable world.
Delivering the annual lecture for the Nelson Mandela Foundation via internet, Guterres pushed for a so-called New Global Deal to ensure power, wealth and opportunity are shared more broadly and fairly at the international level.
""The nations that came out on top more than seven decades ago have refused to contemplate the reforms needed to change power relations in international institutions,"" Guterres said. ""The composition and voting rights in the United Nations Security Council and the boards of the Bretton Woods system are a case in point.""
""Inequality starts at the top: in global institutions. Addressing inequality must start by reforming them,"" he added.
The Bretton Woods system includes the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 
He said the pandemic has revealed, like an x-ray, ""fractures in the fragile skeleton of the societies we have built."" 
""It is exposing fallacies and falsehoods everywhere: the lie that free markets can deliver healthcare for all; the fiction that unpaid care work is not work; the delusion that we live in a post-racist world; the myth that we are all in the same boat,"" said Guterres during the virtual lecture. 
""Because while we are all floating on the same sea, it's clear that some are in superyachts while others are clinging to the floating debris,"" said Guterres, a former Socialist prime minister of Portugal. 
The coronavirus has infected more than 14 million people and there have been nearly 600,000 known deaths worldwide, according to a Reuters tally. The U.N. has appealed for $10.3 billion to help poor states, but has received only $1.7 billion. 
Guterres said rich countries have ""failed to deliver the support needed to help the developing world"" and that the pandemic has ""brought home the tragic disconnect between self-interest and the common interest; and the huge gaps in governance structures and ethical frameworks.""
He said a changing world needs new social protection policies with safety nets including universal health coverage and the possibility of a universal basic income.

Guterres concluded: ""Now is the time for global leaders to decide: Will we succumb to chaos, division and inequality? Or will we right the wrongs of the past and move forward together, for the good of all?""

The Defence Ministry described the exercises as a routine check of the army's capacity to ensure security in Russia's southwestern region and denied any links between the training and the fighting taking place in the Caucasus region, south of Russia.
More than a dozen Armenian and Azeri soldiers have been killed in recent days in clashes between the two former Soviet republics which have long been at odds over Azerbaijan's breakaway, mainly ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Russia, which has a military base in Armenia, has urged the two sides to cease fire and show restraint. The Kremlin has said Moscow is ready to act as a mediator.
Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Azerbaijan's Sakir Hasanov discussed the clashes in a phone call on Saturday.
The drills involve around 150,000 troops and 400 aircraft, according to the defence ministry. 
The two sides accuse each other of shelling military targets and villages, and Azerbaijan has warned Armenia it could strike the Metzamor nuclear power station if its Mingechavir reservoir or other strategic outlets were hit. 
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Saturday Azerbaijan posed a threat to his country and global security, saying the threat to attack one of its nuclear power stations amounted to ""a threat to commit terrorism"". 
Russia considers Armenia to be a strategic partner in the South Caucasus region and supplies it with weapons. 

""I categorically deny any link between the activities held by the armed forces of the Russian Federation and the escalation on the Armenian-Azeri border,"" deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin said in a separate statement, quoted by Russian news agencies.

The country is in the grip of a financial meltdown, raising concerns for its stability, and is badly in need of foreign aid. Hopes of salvation through an IMF deal have retreated with the government hamstrung by the conflicting agendas of sectarian leaders.
Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai has made several comments this month that were widely interpreted as criticism of both the Shi'ite Hezbollah movement and its ally President Michel Aoun, both backers of Diab's cabinet.
""The issue of neutrality is a political one ... and it needs deep dialogue between all the political sides in Lebanon,"" Diab said after meeting with Rai on Saturday.
In an interview published earlier this week, Rai blamed Hezbollah for closing off a vital source of aid from Western and Gulf Arab states. Hezbollah's opponents say its alliance with Iran, in the power struggle with Saudi Arabia, pushes away the mainly Sunni Gulf Arab states that once helped Lebanon.

""We are fundamentally a neutral country...and in the end, our salvation is in our neutrality,"" Rai told local broadcaster LBC later on Saturday.

546,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2020 09:06AM ET</span>",Ten thousand march in Russian far east in support of detained governor,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - At least 10,000 people marched in the Russian far eastern city of Khabarovsk on Saturday, demanding the release of a popular regional governor detained last week on suspicion of murder, in a second week of protests.
Sergei Furgal, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party, was the governor of the Khabarovsk region where he swept to power in 2018 after defeating a rival from the ruling United Russia party that backs President Vladimir Putin.
Furgal was taken to Moscow last week, where he is now in pre-trial detention after being charged with involvement in organising the murder of multiple businessmen 15 years ago.
He could face up to life in prison if found guilty of the charges, which also include involvement in attempted murder. He denies the charges.
Demonstrators packed a city thoroughfare on a sweltering Saturday afternoon, carrying posters in support of Furgal, some demanding his release, others calling for an open and transparent trial, with the column of marchers stretching into the horizon.
Svetlana, a middle-aged woman wearing a face mask, said residents were not put off by the accusations against Furgal. Many Russian politicians have a dark past, she said, as the final years of the Soviet Union were riddled with corruption and crime.
""People came out here to defend their voting rights: We elected him, so return him to us,"" she said.
The protests come barely three weeks after a landslide referendum victory for the Kremlin on amendments to the constitution, allowing Putin to remain in power for another 16 years. Dozens were arrested in Moscow last week after a few hundred protested against the amendments.
Last Saturday, between 10,000-12,000 people took part in an unsanctioned march in Khabarovsk, the local branch of the interior ministry said in a statement. The city is a seven-hour flight east of the capital.
This Saturday, fewer than 10,000 marched, the city mayor's office said in a statement, adding that the protest was peaceful and there were no detentions. Some local news outlets estimated the number was significantly higher.

Some 176 people were killed when the Revolutionary Guards, Iran’s most powerful military force, fired missiles at the Ukraine International Airlines mistaking it for a hostile target while on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.
“The black boxes were transported to Paris yesterday by officials of the Civil Aviation Authority and a judge,” Mohsen Baharvand, Iran’s deputy foreign minister for international and legal affairs, was quoted as saying by the the semi-official ILNA news agency.
He said France will begin reading the flight recorders on Monday and praised the French government for its “very good cooperation with the Iranian delegation”.
France’s BEA air accident investigation agency is known as one of the world’s leading agencies for reading flight recorders.
The fate of the cockpit voice and data recorders was the subject of an international standoff after the plane was shot down on Jan. 8, with Ukraine demanding access.

In an interim report last week Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation blamed a misalignment of a radar system and lack of communication between the air defence operator and his commanders for the downing.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Poland said the European Union's criticism of Poland's adherence to democracy is ""overblown"", as Warsaw faces cuts to EU budget funds over its judiciary reforms. 
Since coming to power in 2015, Poland's ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has faced criticism from the EU over its overhaul of its judiciary system, with Brussels accusing Poland of violating EU laws. 
As its relationship with the EU has faltered, PiS has focused on building strong ties with the United States, especially since President Donald Trump came to power in 2016.
""If you're asking me...do I think that a lot of the attacks on Poland about democratic values is overblown, my answer is yes, I do,"" U.S. ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher told Reuters in an interview.
The EU is struggling to respond to what many in western Europe see as creeping authoritarianism in the eastern wing of the bloc, especially Poland, Hungary and Romania.
In an election on Sunday, Polish President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, won a second term in office, reinforcing the government's mandate to pursue reforms of the judiciary and media.
Mosbacher said the EU has been reluctant to acknowledge how much progress Poland has made, particularly when it comes to economic growth, since becoming a democracy after the fall of communism. 
""It's still seen as the adolescent in the EU and it isn't anymore...I don't think France and Germany... (are) comfortable with that yet,"" she said.
A mechanism that would freeze out countries that fail to live up to democratic standards is up for discussion at an EU summit that began on Friday.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has threatened to veto a massive EU stimulus plan over his objections to the mechanism, with talks continuing on Saturday. 
The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has also signaled to Polish regional authorities that it may curb EU aid to areas that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation, after many towns passed motions against the promotion of what they called LGBT ""ideology"".
Mosbacher called out the ruling party for its handling of LGBT issues in Poland's presidential campaign, after Duda said during his campaign that LGBT ""ideology"" was worse than communism.
""I think there were homophobic undertones,"" Mosbacher said of the campaign. ""Do I like it? No. And I'm pretty vocal on that publicly.""
She added that an agreement in June 2019 between Duda and Trump to bring 1,000 U.S. troops to Poland would be finalized ""within weeks, not months."" 

Reuters reported last month that after a year of technical negotiations, the deal was crumbling amid disputes over funding and troop placement, which Mosbacher denied at the time.

549,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 18, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>","In Arizona, school reopening sparks protest movement","By Andrew Hay and Brendan O'Brien
July 18 (Reuters) - Arizona third-grade teacher Stacy Brosius has been called a ""liberal socialist Nazi"" and a ""whiner and complainer"" for leading car-based protests to delay in-person schooling, but she says she's doing it to save lives in a pandemic.
Inspired by Black Lives Matter demonstrations, hundreds of Arizona teachers like Brosius are putting on red t-shirts they last wore in a 2018 strike and driving around cities in cars daubed with slogans like: ""Remote learning won't kill us but COVID can!""
With ""motor marches"" spreading to other coronavirus-hit sunbelt states, including Florida, and counter demonstrators organizing ""reopen"" rallies, the fight over the new school year is fast becoming America's new protest flashpoint.
In Arizona, teachers want Republican Governor Doug Ducey to push the start of in-person school to at least early October after a beloved educator died of COVID-19 teaching summer school and statewide hospitalizations and deaths spiral.
At stake, Arizona teachers say, is the safety of the state's 1.1 million public school students and 20,000 teachers.
""We don’t want any children to get this from us, because as a teacher, I don’t want to go to any of their funerals,"" said Brosius, 47, who is not prepared to send her three children back to school.
School re-openings have become a white-hot election issue after President Donald Trump demanded a return to in-person learning throughout the United States, while Democrats urge remote schooling until COVID-19 case rates flatten.
Arizona has been hit hard by the virus this summer as its 7-day average of new cases has gone from 500 at the end of May to more than 3,000 in July, while hospitals' intensive care capacity, according to most recent data from Arizona Department of Public Health, stood at a nearly 90 percent this week.
Ducey on Thursday said he would not be swayed by politics, adding he would be comfortable sending his children back to school, as did the state's health chief, Cara Christ.
With slogans like ""freedom over fear,"" Arizona parents are demanding their children have the option of in-person learning. A ""REOPEN our SCHOOLS"" protest is set for July 30 in Phoenix in support of Ducey's mandate that in-person classes resume Aug. 17, after the Deer Valley Unified School District delayed their start until Oct. 14.
""All we want is our choices back,"" said protest organizer Christina DeRouchey, the mother of four school-age children.
'RED FOR ED'
Teachers wearing ""Red for Ed"" t-shirts - the same garb they wore during a successful week-long pay strike two years ago -- are planning a much larger motor march July 22 to circle the state capitol and governor’s office.
The red shirts are a symbol of nationwide strikes by educators over the past few years that some believe may be rekindled this fall.
Arizona teachers are not alone in their protests. Teacher unions across the nation, especially those recently entangled in labor battles, are organizing to become active participants in when and how to re-open schools.
The United Teachers Los Angeles have won an indefinite delay to in-person learning. Others in more conservative states such as Florida are trying to push back classroom start dates and boost funding for personal protective equipment.
""This is a core piece of what our educators come together for, which is to demand that schools are properly funded,"" said Joe Thomas, president of the Arizona Education Association (AEA) ""Until we can see that, we are not ready to come back to schools.""
Much like they did in 2018, Arizona educators are using social media hashtags and online petitions to demand schools not have funding reduced if students switch to remote learning.
""I’m going to compare it to our walkout in 2018,"" said Kelley Fisher, a kindergarten teacher who helped organize the walkout campaign in 2018. ""It’s not fair to put any child or any teacher or any family’s life at stake because they have to open a school building.""
Ducey, who has the authority to open or close schools, moved the start of school back until Aug. 17, a delay of one or two weeks for most districts in response to the rise in coronavirus cases. Some have decided to begin the school year with remote learning while others will implement online and in-person instruction.
Ducey said on Thursday he will finalize his decision on the re-opening of schools next week after he speaks with educators around the state.

""Our kids are going to be learning in the fall. We are going to do our best to conduct the most positive educational year that we can,"" Ducey said.

The figures Rouhani cited in a televised speech were far higher than Saturday's official toll of 271,606.
His office said they were based on ""an estimated scenario"" from a report by the health ministry's deputy minister of research. 
""Our estimate is that until now 25 million Iranians have been infected with this virus and about 14,000 have lost their dear lives,” Rouhani said in the speech. ""There is the possibility that between 30 and 35 million other people will be at risk.""
He said more than 200,000 people had been hospitalised and that the ministry expected that number to double in the coming months.
RESTRICTIONS REIMPOSED
Authorities on Saturday reimposed one-week restrictions in the capital Tehran including banning religious and cultural functions, closing boarding schools, cafes, indoor pools, amusement parks and zoos. 
The Health Ministry reported 188 deaths in the past 24 hours to take Iran's total to 13,979.
Iran, with a population of more than 80 million, has been the Middle East country hardest hit by the epidemic, with infections and deaths rising sharply since restrictions were eased beginning in mid-April.
From Sunday, 22 cities and towns in the southwestern Khuzestan Province will be under a three-day lockdown, the province's governorate announced on Saturday.

That will include Behbahan, where police on Thursday fired tear gas into a crowd protesting over economic hardships.

Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte early this month signed a stricter anti-terrorism bill, condemned by critics and rights groups as a weapon to target opponents and stifle free speech.
""The Philippines remains committed to the protection of civil and political liberties as well as human rights,"" its embassy in Washington said in a letter to 50 U.S. representatives dated July 16 and made available to the media on Saturday.
""The Anti-Terrorism Act itself strongly mandates that human rights be absolute and protected at all times,"" it added.
Duterte has defended the law, saying law-abiding citizens should not fear as it targets terrorists including communist insurgents.
The legislation creates a council appointed by the president, which can designate individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. It also allows for surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.
Lawyers have questioned the law before the Supreme Court, saying the legislation could be abused to target administration opponents and suppress peaceful dissent.

""What the law signifies is the Philippine government's strong resolve to combat terrorism and to implement a more effective and comprehensive approach to such a serious threat that knows no borders,"" the embassy said, adding that the previous anti-terror bill, signed in 2007, resulted in the conviction of only one person.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong formally kicked off a two-week registration period for candidates to run in a key legislative election in September, amid fears authorities might try to disqualify an assertive young generation of democrats.
The citywide poll will be a crucial battleground for the city's democratic opposition to try to reclaim some political influence in the wake of tough national security laws China imposed on June 30.
These laws have been decried by critics, including the United States, as a death knell for the city's freedoms and autonomy from China.
Chinese and Hong Kong officials, however, say the laws will bring stability to the financial hub after a restive year, and only affect a very small minority of ""troublemakers"".
A vanguard of young democrats are raring to get on the ballot, having stormed to big wins in an unofficial ""primary"" election earlier this month. 
These young firebrands, or ""localists"", who often embrace a more confrontational anti-China stance, have appealed more broadly to younger, disaffected voters who no longer believe the moderate rhetoric of veteran democrats.
""For every candidate in the pro-democracy camp, we must unify at this time, to avoid attacking ourselves and to consolidate our strength to challenge the tyranny,"" Sam Cheung, one young democratic hopeful, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Overshadowing their prospects, however, is the risk of disqualification. 
In the past four years, authorities have barred 18 democrats from running in local elections, including prominent activist Joshua Wong, according to a report by the rights group Civil Rights Observer.
Critics say the disqualifications - on grounds including a dissenting ideology, or support for Hong Kong independence - are meant to curb the ascendancy of this new crop of democrats.
At least six young candidates were barred from the previous legislative poll in 2016, including pro-independence leader Edward Leung, who has since been jailed on a rioting charge.
Given the heightened political tensions after last year's often violent anti-government protests, mass disqualifications of candidates could stoke fresh social unrest, though replacement candidates are also poised to jump in if need be.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of a high degree of autonomy and broad freedoms including ""the right to stand for and take part"" in elections.
The imposition of the national security law, however, grants China wide-ranging new powers to clamp down on civil society and dissenting voices in the city, and to over-ride local laws to take jurisdiction over certain big and complex cases.
Should the democrats make history and seize 35 seats or more in the 70-seat chamber for the first time, they could stymie the city's annual budget and deepen oversight of government policy.
""For me, taking part in this election is essentially to resist,"" said localist, Ventus Lau. 
Under the new security legislation, all candidates for local elections must swear allegiance to Hong Kong and pledge to uphold Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
Some have refused to make such a pledge, though others say it's more important to get on the ballot.

Around 4.47 million of Hong Kong's 7.5 million residents are eligible to vote on September 6.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A video depicting a sprawling military-style convoy of one of Mexico's most powerful drug cartels circulated on social networks on Friday just as President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador visited the group's heartland.
In the two-minute clip, members of the fearsome Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) stand in fatigues alongside a seemingly endless procession of armored vehicles. 
""Only Mencho's people,"" members of the cartel shout, pumping their fists and flashing their long guns. The cry was a salute to their leader, Nemesio “El Mencho” Oseguera, one of the country's most-wanted drug lords. 
The video's release coincided with Lopez Obrador's visit to the states of Guanajuato, Jalisco and Colima, some of the cartel's strongholds. 
""They are sending a clear message... that they basically rule Mexico, not Lopez Obrador,"" said Mike Vigil, a former chief of international operations for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
A spokesman for Lopez Obrador's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
It was unclear when the video had been filmed, but it appeared to be authentic, Vigil said. 
CJNG is regarded as Mexico’s strongest gang, along with the Sinaloa Cartel formerly led by jailed kingpin Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman. It is often credited with infiltrating poorly paid and trained police departments across the country to protect its wide-ranging criminal rackets.
In late June, the cartel was quickly fingered as the probable culprit in a brazen attack on Mexico City security head Omar Garcia Harfuch that took place in broad daylight in a posh neighborhood in the capital.
Unlike his predecessors, Lopez Obrador has taken a less confrontational approach on security, preferring to attack what he describes as root causes like poverty and youth joblessness, via social spending.
But the strategy, branded by Lopez Obrador as one of ""hugs, not bullets,"" has emboldened criminal groups, many security analysts say.

The president's approach ""has only led these cartels to operate with more impunity,"" Vigil said.

(Reuters) - A week that marked the return of capital punishment by the U.S. government after a 17-year hiatus ended on Friday with a third execution of a federal prisoner.
Dustin Lee Honken, a convicted murderer, was pronounced dead at 4:36 p.m. EDT (2036 GMT) after an executioner injected him with a powerful barbiturate at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, the U.S. Department of Justice said.
Efforts by President Donald Trump's administration to resume executions were under way soon after the Republican took office. His administration has now completed as many federal executions in a few days as were carried out in the preceding 57 years.
Lawyers for the condemned men have amassed legal challenges, which include arguments that the Justice Department's new one-drug lethal-injection protocol breaches a constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishments. The arguments were rejected twice this week in overnight rulings by a 5-4 majority in the Supreme Court.
Honken, 52, was a dealer in illegal methamphetamine when he and his girlfriend murdered five people in Iowa in 1993, including a government informant and two girls aged 10 and 6. He was convicted in 2004.
His execution began at 4:06 p.m., when he was asked for any final words after being strapped to a gurney.
""Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me,"" he said, according to a media witness who provided an account of the execution to news outlets.
After being injected with pentobarbital, his breathing became more labored. He turned ashen white as blood drained from his face and hands, and his breathing gradually became shallower. It took about 30 minutes before he could be pronounced dead, the media witness said.
Shawn Nolan, one of Honken's lawyers, said Honken had embraced his Catholic faith in prison and repented for his crimes and spent time atoning for them.
""There was no reason for the government to kill him, in haste or at all,"" Nolan said in a statement. ""In any case, they failed. The Dustin Honken they wanted to kill is long gone. The man they killed today was a human being, who could have spent the rest of his days helping others and further redeeming himself.""
UNCONSTITUTIONAL OR JUST?
Honken was one of several inmates on federal death row in Terre Haute who have said the new one-drug protocol, which replaces a three-drug protocol the government last used in 2003, would cause an unnecessarily painful death in which their lungs drowned in bloody fluid before they lost consciousness.
The litigation will continue in U.S. District Court in Washington with the surviving prisoners. Since last year, Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing the cases, has ordered injunctions on three occasions delaying the scheduled executions to allow the legal challenges to play out. All three were overruled by the Supreme Court.
Two other men convicted of murdering children were executed in Terre Haute earlier this week: Daniel Lee, 47, on Tuesday, and Wesley Purkey, 68, on Thursday. Keith Nelson, who murdered a 10-year-old girl, is due to be executed on Aug. 28.
Families of the killers' victims have been divided, reflecting broader public disagreement over capital punishment, which has been abolished by most other countries. Relatives of Lee's victims pleaded for Trump to scrap Lee's execution. The father of the 16-year-old girl murdered by Purkey told reporters that Purkey's death brought some resolution to his grief.
Cassandra Stubbs, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Capital Punishment Project, called it ""a truly dark period for our country."" She joined the condemned men's lawyers in criticizing higher courts in what they called a rush to short-circuit prisoners' legal rights.
While the Supreme Court's conservative majority wrote that it had established that lethal injection was a constitutional method, some of the liberal justices complained that new problems raised by the changed protocol were being dismissed too hastily. 
""I remain convinced of the importance of reconsidering the constitutionality of the death penalty itself,"" Justice Stephen Breyer wrote in a dissenting opinion on Thursday.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said in a statement that the executions were a ""just punishment.""

Jose Luis Albornoz, 19, died Thursday of a shot to the chest allegedly fired by a member of the National Guard, which was clearing the protest on Toas Island in northwestern Zulia state, said Avilio Troconiz, an opposition deputy.
Gasoline had been arriving to the island once a month and stations had been selling the allotted 120 liters per person under a government rationing system, but on Thursday the guard reportedly wanted to restrict sales to 60 liters, sparking protest, Troconiz told Reuters. ""The guard reacted with bullets and that is when they killed the boy.""
Around 90% of the population on small, remote Toas Island sustains itself from fishing. The community alleged the ration cut would not give them enough gasoline to power their boats, Troconiz added.
""Witnesses say Bolivarian National Guard officials who repressed the protest were allegedly responsible,"" the non-governmental Zulia Commission for Human Rights (Codhez) said in a statement, adding the fisherman had no fuel for days. 
The information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Venezuela is facing new fuel shortages after a momentary relief in June due to the arrival of gasoline from Iran.
Data provided by Venezuela to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries earlier this week showed June crude output had fallen to a 77-year low as U.S. sanctions choked off exports.
Production has been falling since 2016 due to underinvestment and mismanagement, three years before the U.S. sanctions on Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A., or PDVSA.
Fuel shortages have plagued the OPEC nation. In June 2019, a man was shot to death at a gas station in the northwestern Merida state while waiting in a line of hundreds of cars for fuel.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The government of India has agreed to allow U.S. air carriers to resume passenger services in the U.S.-India market starting July 23, the U.S. Transportation Department said on Friday.
The Indian government, citing the coronavirus, had banned all scheduled services, prompting the U.S. Transportation Department in June to accuse India of engaging in ""unfair and discriminatory practices"" on charter air carriers serving India.
The Transportation Department said it was withdrawing an order it had issued requiring Indian air carriers to apply for authorization prior to conducting charter flights, and said it had approved an Air India application for passenger charter flights between the United States and India. 
A group representing major U.S. airlines and the Indian Embassy in Washington did not immediately comment on Friday.
India's Ministry of Civil Aviation said on Twitter it was moving to ""further expand our international civil aviation operations"" and arrangements from some flights ""with US, UAE, France & Germany are being put in place while similar arrangements are also being worked out with several other countries.""
""Under this arrangement,"" it added, ""airlines from the concerned countries will be able to operate flights from & to India along with Indian carriers.""
The U.S. Transportation Department order was set to take effect next week.

Britain's capital and other major cities have seen large Black Lives Matter protests inspired by concern about racial injustice following the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
""The video footage that I have seen today and is circulating on social media is extremely disturbing,"" Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Steve House said in a statement. ""Some of the techniques used cause me great concern - they are not taught in police training.""
Reuters was not able to independently verify the video.
The Metropolitan Police referred the circumstances of the arrest, which took place on Thursday evening in north London, for investigation by the independent police watchdog for England and Wales. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan called for a swift and thorough inquiry into what he described as a ""distressing"" incident.
Late on Friday the Metropolitan Police said the 45-year-old man they arrested had been charged by prosecutors with possession of a knife in a public place, and would appear in court on Saturday. The man was also wanted for recall to prison for a separate offence, police added.
Knife crime has risen rapidly in Britain in recent years, even as other violence has fallen, and a disproportionate amount takes place in London, where 86 people were killed in knife attacks in the year ended in March.
Video filmed by an onlooker showed one white police officer appearing to kneel on the side of the man's head and neck, while another officer of east Asian ethnicity helped to restrain the man on the ground.
The white officer stopped kneeling on the suspect after he cried out ""Get off my neck"", and the man was later shown sitting up and speaking with the officers while in handcuffs.
""One officer has been suspended and another officer has been removed from operational duty, but not suspended at this time. This decision will be kept under review,"" House said.

562,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>","Two years after failed bomb plot, Iranian opposition rallies backers online","PARIS (Reuters) - An exiled Iranian opposition group that was the target of a failed bomb plot in France two years ago took its annual rally to the internet on Friday as it sought to pressure the Tehran government despite the coronavirus outbreak.
The Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), an umbrella bloc of opposition groups in exile that seek an end to Shi'ite Muslim clerical rule in Iran, traditionally holds a mass gathering each year on the outskirts of the French capital. 
The NCRI was responsible for arguably the most influential opposition move in years when it became the first group to expose Iran’s covert nuclear program in 2002, although it has since had a chequered record. 
It says it has huge backing within Iran although analysts say its support is very hard to gauge. Its detractors have questioned the nature of the support that attends its gatherings, which usually draws thousands of people, and the motivations of its speaker list that includes a raft of former politicians and lawmakers.
Eighteen sitting U.S. senators were among those who spoke on Friday as did U.S. President Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who has repeatedly backed the group.
The COVID-19 outbreak forced the NCRI to make the rally virtual. It said the event was connected to 30,000 locations within Iran and 100 countries across the world.
""The mission of our generation is to overthrow the mullahs’ criminal regime and to restore the trampled rights of all the people of Iran,"" the group's leader Maryam Rajavi said during the six-hour event.
The online rally comes just two days after an Iranian diplomat and three others were ordered to stand trial in Belgium over their role in a failed plot to carry out a bomb attack at the NCRI gathering near Paris in 2018.
The NCRI members joined the 1979 Islamic revolution but later broke from the ruling clerics. Based in Iraq in the early 1980s, their fighters clashed with U.S. forces during the 2003 Iraq war, but have since renounced violence.
The group was once listed as a terrorist organisation by the United States and the European Union but is no longer.
Tehran has long called for a crackdown on the NCRI in Paris, Riyadh, and Washington. The group is regularly criticised in state media.

The gilded wooden carriage was built in 1898 and is decorated on one side with a panel called ""Tribute of the Colonies"", which shows Black and Asian subjects bringing offerings to a white woman on a throne representing the Netherlands.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte said in June he was aware the carriage, which has been undergoing restoration since 2015, ""summons emotions"", but added: ""it's all part of our history.""
The carriage, along with statues of naval heroes from the country's 17th century golden age, has become a hot topic of debate in the wake of Black Lives Matter protests.
""We're following the discussion, I'm listening to it,"" King Willem-Alexander said during an annual meeting with the press, when members of the royal family pose for pictures.
""As long as there is implicit and explicit discrimination in the Netherlands, we must tackle that as a society,"" he added.
The carriage traditionally transports the king to address parliament every September, but is not due to be back in service until 2021.
The king said there would be no move to change the decorations during its repairs.
""It's part of our cultural heritage, so we're not going to be re-writing history with the restoration,"" he said.

Both Numbi and his designated successor, General Gabriel Amisi Kumba, are under U.S. and European Union sanctions for repression and abuses directed against opposition figures and protesters under former president Joseph Kabila.
Tshisekedi's office did not give a reason for the reshuffle.
Until now, Kumba was Numbi's number two and head of territorial operations of the Congolese Armed Forces. Both were promoted to their posts by Kabila in mid-2018.
The last month has seen rising tensions in the ruling coalition between supporters of Tshisekedi and those of Kabila, who maintains extensive power through his parliamentary majority, control of most cabinet ministries, and influence in the army.

(Reuters) - The three white men charged with the murder of a Black jogger in the U.S. state of Georgia pleaded not guilty on Friday in a case that led to a national outcry after a cellphone video of the shooting surfaced on the Internet.
Lawyers for one of the defendants, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, asked Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley to release him on bond, but the judge denied the bond, saying he was concerned that Bryan posed a flight risk.
Bryan, 50, shot the video that appeared to show the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, on Feb. 23 just outside the coastal town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC). He was charged with murder and attempt to illegally detain and confine. 
A former police officer, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, are charged with murder and aggravated assault.
Police say Gregory McMichael saw Arbery jogging through his neighborhood outside of Brunswick and believed he looked like a burglary suspect. The elder McMichael called his son and the two armed themselves and drove after Arbery.
Bryan joined the chase in his own pickup truck, police say, and took video of the incident on his phone, which appears to show the McMichaels confronting Arbery before the jogger was shot with a shotgun.
Bryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, told the court his client was not a flight risk and had deep ties in the community. Gough also argued unsuccessfully that Bryan should be released because of concerns over the possibility of catching the novel coronavirus in jail.

No trial date was immediately set.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Large parts of China were reeling on Friday from the worst floods in decades, as disruption mounted for supply chains, including for personal protective equipment (PPE), vital in the fight against the novel coronavirus.
The central city of Wuhan and the provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi and Zhejiang declared red alerts as heavy rain swelled rivers and lakes.
Wuhan, on the banks of the Yangtze river where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year, warned residents to take precautions as water levels fast approached their maximum guaranteed safety level.
The summer rainy season brings floods to China almost every year but the impact of the disruption they cause is being felt further afield as Chinese goods become more important in global supply chains for various items, including PPE.
""It's just creating another major roadblock here in terms of PPE getting into the United States - it is the worst of times for it to happen but that's what we're dealing with right now,"" said Michael Einhorn, president of Dealmed, a U.S. medical supply distributor, which sources disposable lab coats and other products from Wuhan and nearby regions.
""We cannot get product out for over a week, which is a very long time in our business,"" he said, adding that the delays could last up to three weeks.
Xiantao, just west of Wuhan, is China's biggest manufacturer of nonwoven fabrics used in PPE production. A third of China's total exports of nonwoven fabric products are from the city.
With the relentless rain, more misery seems inevitable.
The giant Three Gorges reservoir, which has been holding back more water to try to ease downstream flood risks, is more than 10 metres higher than its warning level, with inflows now at more than 50,000 cubic metres a second. 
The Poyang lake in Jiangxi province, which is formed from the overspill of the Yangtze, is 2.5 metres higher than its warning level. It has expanded by more than 2,000 square kilometres during thus flood season, and parts of the surrounding town have been inundated.
Further east, the Tai lake near Shanghai has also declared a red alert after its water level rose to nearly a metre higher than its safe level.
Economic activity in other parts of China, especially construction and steel and cement demand, has also been hurt by the flooding, analysts say, suggesting some loss of momentum after a stronger than expected bounce in the second quarter from the coronavirus crisis.

""We estimate recent floods in Yangtze River regions could lead to a gross drag of 0.4-0.8 percentage points on third-quarter GDP growth,"" analysts at  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) said in a note to clients on Friday.

Pompeo said in a statement that the United States would review the consequences and implications of the decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union that could disrupt thousands of companies that rely on the agreement.
""We are deeply disappointed that the Court of Justice of the European Union ... has invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework,"" Pompeo said.
""The United States will continue to work closely with the EU to find a mechanism to enable the essential unimpeded commercial transfer of data from the EU to the United States,"" he added.
The ruling effectively ends the privileged access companies in the United States had to personal data from Europe and puts the country on a similar footing to other nations outside the bloc, meaning data transfers are likely to face closer scrutiny.
The so-called Privacy Shield was set up in 2016 by Washington and Brussels to protect personal data when it is sent to the United States for commercial use after a previous agreement known as Safe Harbour was ruled invalid in 2015.

More than 5,000 companies have signed up to it but the Privacy Shield was challenged in a long-running dispute between Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who has campaigned about the risk of U.S. intelligence agencies accessing data on Europeans.

""I have a baby daughter, I need to get her food and water and pay for her vaccines,"" the 29-year-old said. A currency crash means his pension in Lebanese pounds is now worth just around $500, he said. 
He blamed the ruling elite for daily power cuts, skyrocketing prices and pushing the country to the brink. 
""You can't do anything anymore ... who's hiring today? This is where they got us, and now they tell you 'go plant crops and buy candles, you'll be fine', while we just move backwards,"" he said.
The AUB, one of the country's oldest universities and a regional medical hub, did not respond to requests for comment.
Local media and employees said the institution laid off more than 500 workers, mainly in administrative and nursing departments. 
Its president, Fadlo Khuri, had said there would be staff cuts as the financial meltdown and the coronavirus pandemic hit revenues. He told Reuters in May the private institution faced its biggest threat since its foundation in 1866.
While Lebanon produces little hard economic data, businesses have shut at a rapid rate. 
At least 220,000 jobs in the private sector were shed between October and February, a survey by research firm InfoPro showed, with the figures only expected to get worse.
Mahmoud Edelbe, a maintenance worker at AUB who also lost his job on Friday, said his monthly income was only around $100 since the Lebanese pound, known as the lira, lost nearly 80% of its value on the parallel market.
""Are we the burden on the university?"" he said near dozens of ex-employees crowding the hospital entrance. ""We get the short end of the stick, we who have nobody to back us or help us.""
Some AUB alumni on social media criticised the heavy security presence near the campus and medical centre during the layoffs on Friday. A Reuters witness saw 10 army vehicles nearby.
""I spent days and nights at this university, it's my home,"" said Khaled al-Homsi, 59, a father of five who worked there for 35 years. ""And in the end you get tossed out.""
He worried about the future, with job prospects bleak. ""Now a million lira is worth a $100, what can I even do with it?""

KONSKOWOLA, Poland (Reuters) - Surrounded by fields of roses and lavender in tranquil eastern Poland, some residents of the village of Konskowola feel the European Union may be trying to blackmail them.
Like about a hundred other municipalities across rural Poland, the local council has declared Konskowola to be free of ""LGBT ideology"", reflecting a backlash against gay rights throughout the conservative, largely Catholic nation.
This has raised eyebrows in Brussels, with the European Commission signalling to regional authorities, including Konskowola, that it may curb EU aid to areas that discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation.
Some residents, such as Radoslaw Gabriel Barzenc, the Konskowola council head, are angry over what they see as unjustified interference by Europe's liberal west in the town's beliefs.
""The restrictions could be implemented because people have an opinion. Isn't this discrimination? Is this what European tolerance is about? I don't think so,"" he told Reuters.
""I cannot imagine we would yield to blackmail.""
Gay rights have become a hot-button issue in Poland since the right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) came to power five years ago pledging to defend traditional family values.
In the run-up to last Sunday's presidential election, the incumbent Andrzej Duda, allied with PiS, pledged to ensure gay couples would not be able to adopt children and to prevent education about gay rights in public schools.
He won a second five-year term with a margin of 51% against a liberal challenger, amid mounting polarisation in Poland over the role religious values should play in public life. 
PiS and Duda have long disagreed with Europe over Warsaw's adherence to democratic norms, and the issue was on the agenda at a European Union summit which started in Brussels on Friday.
Some want to freeze payouts for EU countries said to be undermining democratic values, such as Poland, although Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a right-wing ally of Warsaw's conservative government, has threatened a veto.
On the eve of the summit, Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg's gay prime minister, expressed outrage.
""If we accept that you condemn a sexual minority, tomorrow it will be religion, the day after it will be race,"" he told Reuters. 
A Polish rights organisation has also petitioned the European anti-fraud office OLAF to investigate whether EU funds disbursed in Poland are being misused by ""LGBT-free"" communities. OLAF declined to comment. 
'HOMOPROPAGANDA'
In Konskowola, in Poland's conservative heartland, some 70% of residents voted for Duda, a devout Catholic.
""The EU should not withdraw its funds,"" said Urszula Nowak, a 76-year-old pensioner who has lived her entire life in the village. ""It would mean the EU was against our faith. The majority of Poles are Christian after all.""
Konskowola authorities say their aim is not to discriminate against any individuals.
In a 2019 declaration, the council said it opposed any public activity aimed at ""promoting the ideology of the LGBT movement"", and declared it would protect its school and its families from anything that would contradict Christian values.
""We will not allow any administrative pressure in support of political correctness, rightfully called 'homopropaganda',"" the declaration read. 
But dissent in Konskowola, which has a population of just over 2,000, is brewing.
Mayor Stanislaw Golebiowski, who is not a member of the local council, says it should have never taken up the issue and should reconsider. He feels too much is at stake. 
He wants EU cash to modernise irrigation systems - made more urgent by falling groundwater levels - for the town's prize rose fields and other flowers it grows.
Like thousands of towns and villages across Poland, which joined the EU in 2004 and has since received some 36 billion euros ($41 billion) in aid, Konskowola has spent the cash on projects to improve living standards after the ravages of World War Two and four decades of communism.
Honorata Sadurska, 26, a bisexual veterinarian from Konskowola, believes homophobia is on the rise.
""It's happened that I was pushed on the bus or that someone has yelled something not nice to me. Is it because of the council's declaration?,"" she told Reuters. ""I don't know what came first, the chicken or the egg.""
But she opposes funding cuts for Konskowola. ""It will only isolate such places further.""

WINDSOR, England (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth knighted Captain Tom Moore on Friday, recognising the 100-year-old for lifting Britain's spirits during the gloom of the coronavirus pandemic by raising millions of pounds for health workers.
The World War Two veteran raised a record 33 million pounds ($41 million) by walking 100 laps of his garden with the aid of a walking frame in April in the run-up to his landmark birthday.
At an open-air investiture at Windsor Castle, the 94-year-old queen smiled as she dubbed Moore on both shoulders with her knighting sword, which previously belonged to her father, George VI. 
Moore, in a dark suit, stood holding onto a wheeled walking frame.
""Thank you very much,"" Moore told the queen. 
""Wonderful,"" the queen said, before greeting Moore's family. ""What an amazing amount of money you have raised.""
The Yorkshireman became a symbol of British endurance in the face of the adversity of the coronavirus crisis and cheered many with his promise that ""the sun will shine again"". 
""I could never have imagined this would happen to me,"" Moore said in a message posted on Twitter before received the ancient accolade.
""It is such a huge honour and I am very much looking forward to meeting Her Majesty The Queen. It is going to be the most special of days for me.""
Moore, who served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two, quipped earlier this year that having a knighthood would be funny because he would be Sir Thomas Moore - a reference to the Tudor statesman Sir Thomas More.
The monarch has been sheltering at Windsor Castle, the oldest permanently inhabited castle in the world, since March.

Other investitures have been postponed because of the coronavirus and Moore's knighthood was one of the first official duties the queen has carried out since the coronavirus lockdown.

The U.S. Treasury Department named the individuals as Songyan Ji, Longbao Zhang, Guifeng Cheng and Guangfu Zheng, and the firm as Global United Biotechnology Inc, which it said was owned and operated by the Zheng Drug Trafficking Organization (DTO) run by Fujing Zheng. 
Treasury identified Fujing Zheng and the Zheng DTO as significant foreign narcotics traffickers under the U.S. Kingpin Act last August.
""Fentanyl and other drugs have caused overwhelming devastation to communities across America,” said Deputy Treasury Secretary Justin Muzinich. 
“The United States is committed to holding drug traffickers and those who facilitate their operations accountable for the suffering they impose upon American families.”
The four individuals were designated for allegedly facilitating purchases of fentanyl and other drugs for the Zheng DTO, a Treasury statement said.
It said the Zheng DTO laundered drug proceeds using digital currency such as bitcoin and transmitted proceeds into and out of bank accounts in China and Hong Kong.
It said Global United Biotechnology Inc was ""a virtual storefront for the Zheng DTO.""The designation means all property of the individuals and Zheng DTO in the United States must be blocked and reported.
Fentanyl is a cheap painkiller 50 times more potent than heroin that has played a major role in a devastating opioid crisis in the United States, where more than 28,000 synthetic opioid-related overdose deaths were recorded in 2017, 
U.S. officials say China is the main source of illicit fentanyl. President Donald Trump has accused Chinese President Xi Jinping of failing to meet promises to help stop the flow of the drug into the United States, a charge Beijing rejects.

Offences involving knives or sharp instruments in England and Wales rose 6% to 46,265 in the year to March 2020, 51% higher than when comparable figures began in 2011, according to police data published on Friday by Britain's Office for National Statistics. 
London, which accounted for just over a third of knife crime, saw a 7% rise in offences.
""The number of homicides involving the use of a knife or sharp instrument in London increased from 67 to 86, a 28% increase,"" the ONS said.
While knife crime rose, there was a 4% decrease in firearms offences and a 9% decrease in burglary across England and Wales. Data for the city of Manchester in northwest England was excluded due to problems with a new computer system in the city.
The increase in knife crime recorded by the police contrasts with a longer-term decline in violent crime measured by an ONS survey of the public, which is its lowest since that survey began in 1981 and more than 70% below its peak in 1995.
The ONS says its surveys generally give a better sense of long-term trends than police records, as they are less affected by people's reluctance to speak to the police and changes in police record-keeping. 
However, police records are likely to be better for rare crimes such as murders.

On his trip to Venezuela, which he called a private humanitarian mission conducted at the request of ""several American prisoners' families,"" Richardson met Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and Venezuela's vice president.
""I am glad we were able to meet with President Maduro to discuss the potential release of the American prisoners and other COVID-19 humanitarian issues,"" Richardson said in the statement.

The former U.S. Army Special Forces soldiers were arrested in May for leading a failed incursion attempt aimed at capturing Maduro.
The Citgo executives have been imprisoned since 2017 on allegations of embezzlement, which the U.S. government and the executives' lawyers have said are baseless.
In a statement, Elliott Abrams, Washington's special envoy on Venezuela, sharply criticized the executives' imprisonment and called for their release.
""The Department of State will continue our efforts to free them until the day when they are released,"" Abrams said.
Trump's administration has tried to oust Maduro by imposing sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector and backing opposition leader Juan Guaido, but Maduro has retained control of the government and wielded security forces against his opponents.

TUNIS (Reuters) - The collapse of Tunisia's shortest-lived government since its 2011 revolution has plunged its young democracy into a new crisis after successive failures by elected leaders to turn political freedom into economic success. 
Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh's coalition had only taken office in February after months of political wrangling in the deeply fragmented parliament formed by last year's election.
His resignation on Wednesday means there will be a new round of talks to try to form a government and, if that fails, another election just as the country demands clear leadership to handle the global pandemic and its economic fallout.
For Tunisia, widely seen as the sole comparative success story of the ""Arab Spring"" it triggered nine years ago with the revolution that introduced democracy, the stakes could hardly be higher.
""Enough is enough,"" said Samia ben Youssef, a teacher out shopping at a street market in the Ettahrir district of Tunis. 
""At a time when people are suffering from a crisis, when coronavirus is spreading around the world, they let us face our destiny alone,"" she added. 
Already, in the impoverished southern towns where the rising flared in 2011, a fresh wave of protesters are demanding jobs and more government aid, while the government said last week it wanted to delay debt repayments to four donor countries.
On Thursday some of these protesters started blocking Tunisia's modest oil exports by closing a pumping station, a tactic that has already damaged the phosphate industry. 
Against this fraught backdrop, Tunisia faces a reckoning with its awkward democratic model, a mix of parliamentary and presidential systems but without a constitutional court, which was intended to resolve disputes but has not yet been set up. 
With many leading politicians, including the president, wanting to change the system, the party that did best in a recent opinion poll is the one that champions the old, pre-revolution, autocracy. 
""My fear is we are entering an era of turbulence and without having enough political force to face it ... It's a very gloomy scenario,"" said Youssef Cherif, a political analyst. 
POLARISATION
Politicians now have until late August to form a new government with majority support in parliament, but will struggle to bridge the divisions that weakened Fakhfakh's coalition. 
The largest party is the moderate Islamist Ennahda, the only constant presence in Tunisian politics since the revolution as numerous other parties rapidly came and went. But it has only a quarter of the seats and its leader, Rached Ghannouchi, faces a vote of confidence as parliament speaker.
Tunisia's biggest political rift is over fiscal policy. Ennahda has tended to stand with parties that favour reforms sought by donors to curb spending and public debt.
President Kais Saied appears to stand on the other side of that division, Cherif said, along with Arab nationalist parties and the other major player in Tunisian politics, a powerful labour union. 
Talks have already started with the International Monetary Fund over a new loan programme, but it has previously wanted tough economic reforms that much of parliament opposes. 
In parliament on Thursday the tense political atmosphere was encapsulated by Abir Moussi and her populist Destouri party, which voices support for the ousted autocracy of Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali, who died in exile last year. 

They seized the speaker's chair to stop Ghannouchi sitting there, raising the spectre of renewed tension between Islamists and secularists and aggravating the risk of street confrontations between their supporters.

Turkey has been providing military aid to the Tripoli-based government in the Libya conflict, while Egypt, the UAE and Russia have backed its foes in a rival administration based in the east.
Recent weeks have seen dramatic military advances by the government, which drove back forces of the eastern commander Khalifa Haftar who had launched an assault on the capital last year.
Eastern-based lawmakers called this week for Egypt to intervene in the conflict. Sisi met Libyan tribesmen on Thursday and said Egypt would not stand idle in the face of a direct threat to Egyptian and Libyan security.
Asked about the possibility of Egyptian intervention, Erdogan said Turkey would maintain its support for the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).
""Steps taken by Egypt here, especially their siding with the putschist Haftar, show they are in an illegal process,"" he said. He also described the approach of the United Arab Emirates as ""piratical"".

Sisi said last month that Egypt's army might enter Libya if the Tripoli government and its Turkish allies renewed an assault on the central Sirte-Jufrah frontline, seen as the gateway to Libya's main oil export terminals, now held by Haftar's allies.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwanese officials in Hong Kong have been told their visas will not be renewed unless they sign a document supporting Beijing's claim to Taiwan under its ""one China"" policy, a person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The move comes after Taipei criticised a new security law imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing, and opened an office in Taipei this month to help people who may want to leave the Asian financial centre. 
Several Taiwanese officials at its de facto Hong Kong consulate who were due to renew their visas have been asked by the city's government to sign the document, a senior Taiwan official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. 
The official said the move was unprecedented and presented an ""unnecessary political obstacle"" for Taipei-Hong Kong ties.
""They won't issue the visa if we don't sign the document,"" the official said, declining to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. ""It's entirely a problem created by them."" 
""We will try our best to defend our stance. Our representatives in Hong Kong will hold fast to their position."" 
The Hong Kong Immigration Department said it would not comment on individual cases, but added that it acts in accordance with the relevant laws and policies when handling each application. 
Taiwan's China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council urged Hong Kong to return to ""existing consensus"" to maintain normal exchanges between Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
""Hong Kong should follow mutual agreements to ensure the office is free from political interference, and should not establish unnecessary obstacles beyond those agreements,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.
Taiwan has 15 Taiwanese staff at its de facto consulate in the city, another person with knowledge of the matter said. 
China sees Taiwan as part of ""one China"" and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
China has proposed that Taiwan be brought under Chinese rule under a similar ""one country two systems"" arrangement it offered to Hong Kong. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen rejects the proposal, which she calls a ""failure"". 
The source declined to say exactly how many Taiwan officials were asked to sign the paper but said its acting chief, Kao Ming-tsun, had returned to the island late on Thursday after he refused to sign the document upon his visa renewal. 
Reuters was not immediately able to reach Kao for comment. 
Kao's return to Taiwan due to the political spat was first reported by Taiwan online publication Up Media. 
Taiwan announced this week it will enhance scrutiny over investment from Hong Kong to prevent illicit money from mainland China, days after Reuters reported the move.
Hong Kong has long served as an important trade and investment conduit between Taiwan and China, which have no diplomatic relations.
Hong Kong's new security law punishes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Critics of the law fear it will crush the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability to the city after a year of sometimes violent anti-government protests.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's top coalition partner wants Israel to shelve planned West Bank annexations and instead focus on improving conditions for Jewish settlers and Palestinians in the occupied territory, two cabinet ministers said on Friday.
Centrist ex-general Benny Gantz and the conservative Netanyahu agreed to begin discussing annexations as of July 1, but the plan -- already dogged by diplomatic blowback -- has been sidelined by a resurgence of coronavirus.
Gantz says the health crisis should take precedence over any West Bank moves that may inflame conflict with the Palestinians. The Israeli-occupied West Bank is part of territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Netanyahu could go it alone in declaring Israeli sovereignty over the West Bank settlements and strategic Jordan Valley. But Gantz's misgivings have complicated Israeli efforts to present a united front on annexations and how they might fit with U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Middle East peace. 
While Gantz -- whose popularity has plunged since he broke with an opposition alliance to join Netanyahu in March -- has limited political clout, his role as defence minister also puts him directly in charge of civilian activities in the West Bank. 
Alon Schuster, Israel's agriculture minister and a member of Gantz's Blue and White party, said he was working to achieve ""cultivation and not annexation, now"" for West Bank farmers.
""We need to bring water to the Jordan Valley -- for both the Israelis and the Palestinians who live there, by the way -- and to improve electricity,"" Schuster told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM. ""Why quarrel and waste time? ... I hope we expend our national resources on this."" 
Another Blue and White minister said this was also Gantz's approach, and that the party leader believed working on West Bank infrastructure shared by settlers and Palestinians would ""enable coexistence in accordance with the Trump plan"".
Asked to respond, Netanyahu's office declined comment.
The Palestinians have rejected the Trump plan, which envisages them gaining statehood in 70% of the West Bank, as a non-starter. European powers worry unilateral Israeli territorial moves could kill off long-moribund peacemaking.

Senior ministers from Netanyahu's Likud party have urged annexation now. Some privately worry that Trump's interest will wane as the U.S. election in November nears, and that should he lose, that would close a window of opportunity for annexation.

579,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 08:15AM ET</span>",Hong Kong police arrest pro-democracy politician set to run for legislature,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested on Friday pro-democracy politician Tam Tak-chi, who is expected to run for a seat in the legislature in September's election, on charges including incitement to participate in unlawful assembly.
Tam, 47, the vice-president of the People Power party and a former radio host, won an unofficial primary poll organised by the opposition to select candidates for the Legislative Council vote.
The arrest comes days after Beijing officials and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the primaries were illegal and may violate a new national security law.
After hearing the charges, Tam told reporters they were unrelated to the new law.
Police said the incitement to take part in an unlawful assembly charge was related to a January protest. It did not say what the charges for seditious intention and disorder in public places were related to.
Tam said they were for swearing at the police and shouting ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times,"" in January, a slogan the government declared illegal earlier this month under the new law, which is not retroactive. Sedition is covered by British colonial era legislation.
When addressing reporters, Tam shouted the slogan again.
The Beijing-drafted law introduced last month punishes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics of the law fear it will crush the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the territory when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Supporters say it will bring stability after last year's often-violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.
Soon after Beijing said the weekend primaries vote was illegal, former Hong Kong lawmaker Au Nok-hin said he was pulling out as an organiser of the poll due to the accusations.
On Thursday, another organiser, Andrew Chiu of the Democratic Party, said his work was done and he would no longer help coordinate the Legislative Council election campaign.
Veteran democrat Benny Tai, who was singled out in Beijing statements about the vote, also posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) there was ""not much left to do"" and he would now focus on academic work.
A younger, more defiant generation, including prominent activist Joshua Wong, overshadowed the old-school Hong Kong democrats in the primaries.
The registration for candidates in the September elections begins on Saturday.

Wong was disqualified from running in lower-level district council elections last year, where the democrats nevertheless won more than 80% of the seats.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - In Sutter County in California's bucolic Sacramento Valley, coronavirus cases are rising, but Mike Ziegenmeyer wants his kids back in the classroom.
Unlike big-city school districts that plan to offer only remote learning this fall as COVID-19 rages through the state, several school districts in this agricultural region - once part of the 19th century gold rush - intend to accommodate that wish.
""I want my kids in school,"" said Ziegenmeyer, a county supervisor and political conservative. ""I think they need the social interaction.""
Ziegenmeyer, at least for now, will get his wish. The tiny Brittan School District where his three children attend class plans to bring students back to the classroom.
But opposition by some other parents in the county shows how Sutter County is a microcosm of a debate raging across California and the United States of whether it is safe to reopen schools amid a resurgent wave of coronavirus cases. 
Cases started rising sharply in Sutter, as elsewhere in California, at the beginning of June and have continued to climb, increasing from about 75 cases to nearly 700. At least 17 people from Sutter, with a population of 97,000 and just a few hospital beds, were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of July 16, and 378 are currently ill, county data show.
Like so many of the controversies related to the pandemic, the school issue has become increasingly politicized. Republican President Donald Trump has been urging a return to regular school schedules, while many Democrats advocate a more cautious approach, such as continuing with the virtual lessons widely introduced when the spreading pandemic forced a sudden shutdown of schools in the spring. 
Ziegenmeyer resents what he says is a heavy-handed approach by Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom, who early this week put the brakes on the reopening of California's economy as he reversed orders that had allowed many businesses to open their doors again. On Friday Newsom will release new guidelines on reopening schools.
Ziegenmeyer is also concerned parents will suffer economic harm if they can't work because children are home from school.
HYBRID MODEL 
In California, many large urban districts, including Los Angeles, San Diego and Sacramento, have said they will begin the academic year with remote instruction. But plans vary from county to county, and from one school district to another. 
The board of the Yuba City Unified School District, Sutter's county seat and its largest municipality with 67,000 residents, voted last week to reopen with traditional instruction, five days per week.
The move, which was against the superintendent's recommendation, stunned parents and teachers expecting either remote learning or a hybrid model, under which children attend small classes for part of the week, with strict social distancing. The teachers union began tense negotiations on Thursday over the plan.
""It is my hope that they will change their minds,"" said Dina Luetgens, president of the Yuba City Teachers Association, which wants a hybrid model under which only half the district's students would be on campus at a time.
In-person instruction, even under such a model, would require careful planning and protective gear for teachers as well as students, she said. Without that, teachers and children would be safer studying remotely from home, she said. 
The school district did not respond to requests for comment. But Superintendent Doreen Osumi told the local Appeal-Democrat newspaper the district would have to implement social distancing guidelines and require children to wear face coverings. Parents who do not wish to send their children back to school will be allowed to choose a remote learning plan, although it was not immediately clear how it would be organized.
Sutter County is no stranger to not following the crowd. In May, Sutter, neighboring Yuba and Modoc counties defied state restrictions aimed at controlling the coronavirus spread and allowed restaurants, retail stores and fitness centers to reopen even though it was prohibited by state guidelines.
The guidelines Newsom is expected to release on Friday could upend plans to reopen school campuses. But even if reopening continues, Leslie Gundy says she will not send her two children back to school in Yuba City. 
""We are in no way prepared to do that,"" said Gundy, whose husband is a teacher in the district. ""There's been too little communication about their plan and how they are going to keep my children safe - and our teachers safe.""

At least 53 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and more than 200 were injured in the worst communal violence in the Indian capital for decades. 
The clashes erupted amid an outcry over a new federal law laying out the path to citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries except Muslims. Critics said the law was discriminatory and flouted India's secular constitution. 
The Delhi Minorities Commission (DMC) said Muslim homes, shops and vehicles were selectively targeted during the rioting that erupted in northeast Delhi in February when protests against the new Cititzenship Amendment Act (CAA) broke out across the country.
In all, 11 mosques, five madrasas or religious schools, a Muslim shrine and a graveyard were attacked and damaged, a team from the commission said the report released on Thursday. 
Recommendations made in the commission's report to safeguard minority rights are not binding. 
""Seemingly, to crush the protests, with support of the administration and police, a retaliatory plan of pro-CAA protesters was worked out to trigger violence at a large scale,"" it said. 
The commission said police had charged Muslims for the violence even though they were the worst victims.
Delhi police spokesman Anil Mittal rejected the allegation of bias and said police had acted fairly. 
""We have filed 752 first information reports, over 200 chargesheets, arrested over 1400 people in connection with the riots. We have also formed three special investigation teams and are still open to receiving complaints,"" Mittal said.
Critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government say it has been promoting a Hindu-first India and that the citizenship law aimed to further marginalise the country's 170 million Muslims.
The BJP denies any bias but says it is opposed to the appeasement of any community.
The report also alleged some senior BJP leaders like former member of Delhi legislative assembly Kapil Mishra of fuelling the Feb. 23 violence, but the party spokesperson said there was no basis of such allegations.
""When Delhi Police has already stated in court that there is no role proved of Kapil Mishra, then on what grounds DMC is saying this,"" BJP spokesperson Harish Khurana said. 
The minorities commission said witness spoke of police failure to intervene in the rioting.
""Multiple testimonies collected by this Fact-Finding
Committee recount reports of police inaction even as violence unfolded before them, or of police not arriving despite being called repeatedly,"" it said.

583,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 17, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>","Special Report: Civil rights icon defied death. Now he and his wife navigate pandemic, protests","By Joshua Schneyer
JACKSON, Mississippi (Reuters) - Judy Meredith (NYSE:MDP) isn't always sure where her husband goes when he walks out into the Mississippi morning.
At age 87, Jay is as stubborn as ever about his walks.
Some days he leaves home in a crisply pressed suit, rolling behind him a hot-pink suitcase he got from a granddaughter who outgrew its color.
He uses it to carry his books for sale – many of them self-published and printed at the local Kinko's. People recognize him, though not as much as they used to.
One of Jay's books, written decades ago, is called ""Letters To My Unborn Grandchildren."" Judy and Jay have 11 grandkids now, but he hadn't always counted on meeting them.  The civil rights years were a dangerous time for Jay.
""All I had to lose was my life,"" he wrote to them about that period. And he almost had, when he was gunned down by a white man in 1966.
This year, life has become dangerous again.  The other day Judy overheard Jay refuse a coronavirus test when his doctor called with concerns. Jay's picture had appeared in the newspaper. He'd been at the park, talking to a group of suburban white kids wearing Black Lives Matter shirts. His age and diabetes make him vulnerable to the virus.
""I've just never known Jay to have any fear,"" Judy says.
Jay says he'll leave to God how many more walks he'll take, or how many more days he'll have with Judy, his wife of 39 years. 
She's 16 years younger, but at 71, Judy is also at high risk. Coronavirus cases have surged in the state since last month, when most Mississippi businesses were allowed to reopen. The majority of Mississippians infected, and killed, have been Black.
The virus demands caution, but Judy and Jay haven't just stayed locked in. America is experiencing a moment of reckoning on race, and they want to bear witness to the changes it brings.
One day last month, on Juneteenth, they ventured out to the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum. It was still closed because of the pandemic, but the Merediths are always welcome.
Some things are familiar about this summer. The grandkids stop by in the daytime, cautiously, and the couple share home-cooked dinners while their dog, Charlie, steals scraps off Jay's plate. Outside, the magnolia trees have bloomed and the asphalt roads have softened under the heat.
But so much else has changed. During the height of a pandemic, people of all skin colors have taken to the streets of Jackson, and cities everywhere, to demand reforms after George Floyd's killing by a white police officer in Minneapolis. Mississippi has taken down its 126-year-old flag, the last state banner to feature the Confederate battle emblem. On Tuesday, the University of Mississippi, Ole Miss, removed a Confederate monument from the center of campus and put it in a Civil War graveyard.
Not for the first time, the Merediths see their lives, and those of their family, intersecting with momentous, history-shaping events.
In 1965, the Voting Rights Act gave Blacks the vote, but they faced white intimidation against registering. So the next year, Jay undertook a 220-mile solitary ""walk against fear,"" starting over the Tennessee state line in Memphis.
After walking by Elvis Presley's Graceland mansion and entering Mississippi, he saw a white man waiting with a shotgun off Highway 51. The man, a hardware store clerk, called out his name, and then shot him three times. National radio broke into programming to announce that he was dead. But he was still breathing.
Mississippi had a long history of racial violence against Blacks, but this ambush was different: It had all been caught on camera. The image of Jay writhing on the ground transfixed America, much like the video of George Floyd this year.
Judy calls her husband Jay. Others in their family call him J-Boy or Uncle J-Boy. But he's better known, in Mississippi and in history books, as James Meredith. 
THE LAST BATTLE OF THE CIVIL WAR
The shooting wasn't Jay's first time in the line of fire.
In December 1962, Bob Dylan recorded the song ""Oxford Town"" about him. At the time, Dylan was still an up-and-coming musician and Meredith was one of the most hated and admired men in America.
He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town
That year, Meredith had orchestrated one of the biggest victories of the American civil rights era when he became the first Black to attend Ole Miss in Oxford.
The school had been an all-white bastion of the Old South. The segregationist governor, Democrat Ross Barnett, had arrived on the scene to block Meredith's entry himself. White mobs in Oxford wanted him dead. But Meredith, an Air Force veteran, compelled the federal government to send more than 30,000 U.S. troops to uphold his right as a citizen to attend.
He had created one of the tensest moments of John F. Kennedy's presidency. Some historians have likened it to the last battle of the Civil War.
Growing up in Gary, Indiana, Judy watched these events on TV. ""Let's see if James Meredith survived another day,"" she remembers her father saying when he turned on the nightly news.
Judy remembers her church preacher asking congregants to pray for Meredith, and she had. She also remembers her mother and aunt talking about him. ""That James Meredith is one good-looking man,"" they used to say.
""I thought that was the best reality TV ever made,"" Judy says. It was one of the reasons she embarked on a career in broadcast journalism.
What Jay did at Ole Miss has opened the doors for Judy, too.
In their living room, Dr. Judy Meredith takes down her PhD degree from Mississippi State University to demonstrate. She's been a TV news reporter and anchor, a Fulbright scholar, a music teacher, a university professor.
Today, Judy and Jay live in Jackson's Fondren neighborhood, a leafy, mostly white upper-middle-class area. Still, huge racial disparities remain in the state.
These are evident, Judy says, in the surge of coronavirus cases among Blacks here, a sign of enduring economic and health deficits. Blacks make up 38% of the state's population, but they've accounted for 54% of positive tests and half of all deaths among cases in which race has been reported. Things have grown dire this week, with many of the state's intensive-care units already reaching capacity and Republican Gov. Tate Reeves entreating Mississippians to mask up.
The divides are also on display at public schools. Many in Jackson are nearly all Black, and others in the suburbs nearly all white. Even at Ole Miss, Blacks still make up only 13% of the student body.
In other ways, Judy says, it's more subtle.
As an older Black woman in the Deep South, she's noticed something at the supermarket and in department stores: White women coming down the aisles expect her to move out of their way, she says.
She's mentioned this to friends, white ladies she lunches with. Sometimes she is met with blank stares.
""They do it without even noticing,"" Judy says.
In recent years, Judy has begun playing a polite Southern game of chicken with white ladies at the stores. She's all smiles, but she stands her ground and waits for them to move out of her way.
Recently, during long hours at home, Judy has been moved to tears when the couple watch George Floyd's killing. The footage has been inescapable.
""It is terrible, disgusting,"" Judy says. But she has trouble understanding why it has prompted such an outpouring. Why now? There have been many other videos depicting police brutality against Blacks. None of them sent millions of protesters into the streets or brought down the Mississippi flag.
Jay says he knows why. The fuse was lit, this time, not just by Floyd's death, but by lockdowns, soaring unemployment, hunger, pent-up anger.
""The pandemic,"" he says, ""set up America for an explosion.""
A FUNERAL AND A WEDDING
At the Civil Rights Museum, Judy does most of the talking. Even though the place is shut to visitors, a sound system is pumping loud spiritual music, and Jay's hearing is going. ""I'm happy to be a sideshow,"" he says.
He's also wary. Few reporters have ever understood him, he says, admitting that he likes to confound people. One exception, he says, was the late Bill Minor, often considered the dean of Mississippi journalism. (The observation people remember by Minor – the one uttered through the Southern grapevine ever since – is this one: ""James Meredith is crazy."" It's something Jay doesn't exactly deny, either. Back at Ole Miss, he'd trained himself never to blink when whites threw firecrackers at his feet.)
But at their home the next day, they both wax on during an interview that lasts four hours – at a safe social distance.
They describe how they met, in 1981. Jay was on his way to a funeral in Indiana.
Two years earlier, his first wife, Mary June, had died of a heart attack at age 41, leaving Jay with three boys to raise. Judy was a single mother too, with a son from an earlier marriage.
If she was starstruck by the man she'd watched on TV two decades earlier, she didn't show it that day. ""I didn't want him getting any ideas,"" she says.
He got ideas anyway. Later, at the funeral in Indiana, he peered at the casket and then turned to their mutual friend: ""Ain't nothing I can do for this man, so take me back to that woman.""
For the next several weeks, Judy and Jay courted over long-distance calls that lasted until dawn. They exchanged family histories, and bonded over their childhoods, so similar even though they came from North and South, city and country. They debated current events.
Judy was sharp, not shy about challenging Jay. She reminded him of his mother, Miss Roxie, a proud ""belle of the county"" who took no sass from Jay, his nine siblings, or anyone else.
""I ain't never told nobody this,"" Jay says. ""But I have one of the biggest egos in the world.""
At that, Judy says, ""Mmmm-hmmm.""
They married 10 weeks after they met. Early in their life together, there were times when she bristled at his stubbornness. She left once, back to Gary. Jay went north and won her back.
""Now every time I leave home, I check to make sure she's still here,"" he says.
Last year, Judy finished a short documentary about her husband called ""Who Is James Meredith?"" Before the pandemic hit, it was having a good run at film festivals.
Given their age difference, she seems aware that she will likely be a torchbearer for his legacy.
It's a complicated one.
At many turns, Jay has inflamed civil rights groups and would-be supporters. He's never wanted to be part of a movement, often preferring individual action or lone ""walks"" to collective marches.
Some of his actions have been unorthodox, to say the least.
Like the time in the 1990s he supported David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader, for governor of Louisiana. Or when, earlier, he'd endorsed the reelection of Mississippi Gov. Barnett, the man who'd tried to block his way at Ole Miss.
He says everything he's done in life has followed a plan – a ""divine mission"" – to dismantle white supremacy, including by showing no fear to its figureheads. In politics, he wants Blacks to know what they're up against. 
""I prefer bigotry to be out in the open where I can confront it,"" he wrote to his unborn grandkids.
He has also courted controversy with speeches that veer into performance art.
One time, in a talk at his alma mater Ole Miss, he played the song ""Shake Your Money Maker"" by Mississippi bluesman Elmore James, breaking into dance moves and telling students it was the most important thing they could learn about the Black experience in America.
Everybody knows what the song is about, Jay says, but nobody wants to say it.
""I ain't gonna say it,"" Judy says.
""It means you gotta shake your booty,"" Jay says, bursting into a laugh that detaches his dentures from his gums.
A FAMILY AFFAIR
For all Jay's ""lone wolf"" agitation and egotism over the years, what's most important to him is family.
Both he and Judy grew up in families that went to extremes to shield them, as children, from the ugliness of racism.
Judy, born to a Black father and white mother, had been given up at birth. She was adopted at age 3 by parents from East Texas who had migrated north, like millions of other Blacks.
She grew up within earshot of the childhood home of Michael Jackson. The sound of the Jackson 5's daily band practices filled the street.
""You couldn't not hear them,"" she says.
Her own gift for music was evident before kindergarten, and she spent her childhood almost always near a piano, at home, church and school. It was a sheltered existence, and Judy says her parents ""never talked about race relations."" 
She remembers one moment when reality intruded, while riding with her mother on a trip down to East Texas.
""This little white boy, riding a bike, called my mom n---er,"" she says. ""She hollered out the window, 'Peckerwood,' but we didn't talk about it; she didn't stop to tell me what was going on.""
Jay was raised on an 84-acre farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi (perhaps best known these days as the hometown of Oprah Winfrey). His father, Cap, instructed Jay that nothing could hold him back and he would be called upon to lead. As the Black owner of a sizable farm, Cap was well off for his time. He built fences several feet inside the property line so they could be maintained without bickering with white neighbors, with whom Jay had scarce contact.
Jay remembers the exact moment, at age 15, when he discovered that Southern whites viewed him as inferior. 
It was on a 1948 train ride back from a family road trip to Chicago. When the train reached Memphis, the conductor ordered him and his brother to leave their seats, for which they'd paid full fare, and go stand in the ""colored car."" 
Jay says he cried all the way back to Mississippi. 
""I cried, but I also started scheming."" 
Scheming, he says, to accept no Mississippi in which he or his kind could be degraded, just as his father, Cap, had done with his farm.
He talks at length about earlier generations, what they endured, inherited and passed down.
""Most of my life happened before I was born,"" Jay says.
Judy and Jay share a vision of family as a relay of sorts, over the arc of time, in which each generation can, and must, seize a new set of gains.
Their son Joseph personified this, graduating summa cum laude from Harvard and later winning the outstanding doctoral student award at Ole Miss. Twelve years ago, Joseph died of lupus at age 39.
A NEW GENERATION AT ""NEW MISS""
In one of his letters to his grandchildren, Jay wrote: ""Life in America is combat.""
Ole Miss was a war zone when Meredith arrived in Oxford in 1962. Thousands of white men, many of them armed, faced off against outnumbered federal marshals, the night sky illuminated by explosions. Two people died, hundreds were injured, and Jay slept through it all in a dorm room.
Today, Judy and Jay think of Mississippi not only as home but as ""the center of the universe.""
This might seem improbable. It's the poorest of the 50 U.S. states, with the lowest life expectancy. People in Jackson sometimes joke that its streets have potholes big enough to catch catfish from.
But when change comes to Mississippi, the couple say, it has a tendency to reverberate elsewhere.
""Nobody wants to be behind Mississippi,"" Jay says.
In a generation, Mississippi has gone from the epitome of segregation to a place where scores of Ole Miss students and alumni approach Jay for handshakes or autographs when the couple attend a football game there.
Never mind, Judy says, that a few of the alumni might have yelled the N-word at Jay back in 1962.
In 2006, Judy and Jay attended the unveiling of a statue of him on campus. At first, he had mixed feelings about the statue. For one, he wasn't invited to the podium to speak at the ceremony. (The actor Morgan Freeman was among those enlisted to talk about him instead. Asked about the unveiling, an Ole Miss representative said, ""James Meredith is one of our most notable alumni; however, we are not able to confirm those details from the event from 14 years ago."")
In 2014, the statue was defaced by white students who placed a noose around its neck along with a Confederate symbol. Afterward, a Black student guarded the statue for months, holding a daily vigil. It has become a popular gathering and protest spot for students, most recently in protective face masks. 
""The past is never dead. It's not even past,"" wrote another Ole Miss alumnus and a son of Oxford, the novelist William Faulkner. The writer died just a few months before Meredith's arrival on campus in 1962, but his nephew was in a National Guard unit deployed to protect Meredith. He was attacked by rioters throwing bricks and broke an arm.
Judy and Jay have a granddaughter, Jylah Meredith Knight, who plans to start as a freshman at Ole Miss in the fall.

It isn't yet clear whether it will be safe for Jylah to attend classes on campus, but unlike her grandfather, she's in the same predicament as all students. It's a virus, this time, that has changed everything.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden is facing pressure from contending groups inside his party as he prepares to interview a shortlist of women for the most important hire of his political career: his running mate.
Biden, who committed to choosing a woman for the job he held for eight years under President Barack Obama, said this week he expected the background vetting process to conclude around July 24. He would then interview each finalist before making a decision, expected by early August.
The selection of the vice presidential candidate has taken on outsize importance this year, reflecting the desperation to defeat Republican President Donald Trump among Democrats, who have agonized over which candidate would give Biden the biggest boost in the Nov. 3 election.
Biden leads in national and battleground-state opinion polls as voters fault Trump for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the subsequent economic recession and race relations.
Adding to the weight of Biden's choice, he would be 78 at his January inauguration, making him the oldest U.S. president and setting up his vice president as an early front-runner for the 2024 race should he serve only one term.
""There's a lot of attention on this for a number of reasons, not least of which that Vice President Biden is 77 years old,"" former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said.
Reid, who has had several conversations about the topic with Biden, said the list narrowed in recent weeks but remained fairly large.
The women under serious consideration include Senators Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Tammy Duckworth; U.S. Representatives Val Demings and Karen Bass; former U.S. national security adviser Susan Rice; New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham; and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, according to interviews with Democratic officials.
Harris cemented herself early as a favorite after dropping her presidential bid, particularly among top fundraisers, who have Biden's ear and tend to be more centrist. Online betting site PredictIt puts her odds of being picked at 41%, far higher than any of the other candidates on the list.
The Biden campaign declined to comment on the search.
In making his choice, Biden has to balance many factors, including ideology, race and ethnicity, as well as candidates' ability to raise money, create enthusiasm and fulfill the traditional vice presidential ""attack dog"" role by going after Trump.
Alex Heckler, a member of Biden's national finance committee who backs Harris as running mate, said the ideal candidate given Trump's ""bogus"" allegations about Biden's lack of mental stamina would be someone who could attack Trump's shortcomings and be qualified to serve as president if needed.
MOUNTING CALLS FOR BLACK RUNNING MATE
Perhaps the biggest question facing Biden is whether to select a Black woman following national protests over racial injustice following the police killing of George Floyd, an African American, in Minneapolis. Warren is the only white candidate on the shortlist, which includes five Black women as well as Grisham, who is Latina, and Duckworth, who is an Asian American.
""As I am witnessing what is happening in this country right now, I am more convinced than ever that Joe Biden needs a Black woman as his vice presidential candidate,"" said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of the advocacy group Black Voters Matter.
Leah Daughtry, a Democratic official who ran the 2008 convention that nominated Obama, the country's first Black president, has also lobbied Biden and top campaign officials like Anita Dunn to pick a Black woman.
""Nominating a Black woman will get you the enthusiasm that Joe Biden is going to need to run a successful race in this pandemic environment,"" she said.
Left-wing activists mounted a campaign to support Warren, who they argue would help unite the party's liberal faction behind the more moderate Biden and whose commitment to ""big structural change"" could address the country's deepening health and economic crises.
Some progressive Black advocates pointed to Warren's attention to racial inequity in crafting her policy platform as a presidential contender, while noting that Harris' background as a prosecutor in California and Demings' as a police chief in Florida might make them less appealing to criminal justice activists.
""Representation is important; it's just not sufficient,"" said Maurice Mitchell, executive director of the liberal Working Families Party. Mitchell said he planned to make the case for Warren directly to Biden or his senior aides during an expected sit-down soon.
Among the other potential picks, Grisham could boost Latino turnout in key Sun Belt states like Arizona and Florida, which the campaign regards as an area Biden needs to shore up.
Duckworth, a military veteran who lost her legs in combat, would give the ticket a compelling personal narrative and help bolster the campaign's national security credentials.
Some advisers harbor doubts about whether Harris' ambition for higher office might upstage Biden's message. But Keith Williams (NYSE:WMB), chairman of the Democratic Black Caucus in Michigan, a battleground state Trump narrowly won in 2016, said he told the Biden campaign that Harris was hands down the best option.

""She's been on the world stage. She has acquitted herself in the debates,"" he said. ""She is the most likely choice that they should go with.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's defence minister said on Friday he hoped talks could bring some sort of resolution to a border standoff with China that led to a deadly clash last month, though India would not cede an inch of territory.
Top commanders have been holding lengthy talks near a stretch of disputed Himalayan border in the Ladakh region, where Indian and Chinese troops have been locked in confrontation since early May.
Tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours spiked after soldiers fought with nail-studded clubs and rocks in the desolate Galwan valley on June 15.
Twenty Indian troops were killed and there was an unspecified number of casualties on the Chinese side.
""Given the progress of the negotiations so far, the matter should be resolved. But to what extent it would be resolved, I cannot guarantee,"" Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told troops in Ladakh's Luking area on his first visit to the region since the June clash.
""But I want to assure that no power in the world can capture even an inch of India's soil,"" said Singh, who attended a battle drill involving special forces and air force helicopters, accompanied by the army chief, General Manoj Mukund Naravane.
On Thursday, the army said negotiations with the Chinese side were advancing, but a disengagement process was ""intricate"" and required verification on the ground.
Earlier in the week, China said there had been progress in defusing the crisis and it urged India to maintain peace.
Both countries have blamed each other for triggering the clash in the Galwan valley, the deadliest between the neighbours in at least five decades.
India and China share a 3,488-km-long border that runs along the Himalayan mountain range, but have been unable to agree on its exact alignment despite several rounds of talks.

They fought a border war in 1962 and the dispute has remained largely peaceful since then.

Residents of Wamberal, about 90 km (55 miles) north of Sydney, were evacuated after emergency personnel warned their homes might collapse as waves as high as 11 metres sped up erosion, local media reported. The suburb has a population of about 6,300.
The storms were forecast to continue late on Friday, with the situation repeated at towns along the country's eastern coastline.
""We're all so anxious and frightened and vulnerable, and quite frankly angry that we've come to this situation, which we knew was going to happen because the revetment wall wasn't built,"" said Wamberal resident Margaret Brice.
Revetment walls are permanent structures to prevent erosion of land that are placed on banks or cliffs. Plans to build one at Wamberal have been the subject of community debate for a decade, the Australian Broadcasting Corp reported.
The ABC quoted the Central Coast Council's director of environment planning, Scott Cox, as saying the community was frustrated but ""I can't authorise people to do work without approval. If residents with sound engineering advice need to do work to save their own home, council won't be taking any action against them.""
The issue has affected the town since a 1974 storm when houses along the foreshore collapsed into the ocean, the ABC said.
Brice said she was ""devastated that we've now lost our pristine beach"".
""If those properties are lost, the dunes are going to be breached and the rest of Wamberal is at threat,"" she added.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea cancelled on Friday the licences of two anti-North Korea groups that send propaganda leaflets into the North infuriating its government and undermining South Korean efforts to engage with its isolated neighbour.
Groups run by North Korean defectors have for years sent anti-North Korea leaflets, along with food, medicine, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks with South Korean dramas and news, into North Korea usually by balloon or in bottles on border rivers.
The government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in is keen to improve ties with the North and so asked the groups to stop sending the propaganda but they rejected the request.
The Ministry of Unification, which handles relations with the North, said it had revoked the licenses of two groups - Fighters for a Free North Korea and Kuensaem Education Center.
""The groups' distribution of leaflets and goods to the North gravely hindered the government's unification policy and efforts to promote it, caused danger to the border-area residents' lives and safety, and created tension,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Last month, tension flared after North Korea, angry about the propaganda leaflets, blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border and threatened military action.
Without a non-governmental organisation (NGO) licence, the groups will not get tax exemptions or be allowed to hold fundraisers, though donations are still allowed.
The two groups, along with rights organisations, condemned the government action as a bid to silence voices critical of the North in the interest of its political agenda.

""The government has shown a track record of using legislative and administrative measures to pressure NGOs into acting ... in line with the policy agenda of the day: friendly relations with North Korea,"" a coalition of groups said in a petition it said it sent to United Nations.

Defence Minister Andriy Taran told the parliament the exercises would include anti-aircraft fire and would be held at the end of September in southern Ukraine. 
Relations between Moscow and Kiev have been tense since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine and backed a separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine that remains active.
Clashes between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed forces have killed more than 13,000 people since 2014, despite a ceasefire agreement struck in 2015.
""This asymmetric response will show the readiness of the armed forces of Ukraine to give a worthy rebuff to any attempts by the Russian Federation to exacerbate the situation or start large-scale hostilities,"" Taran said.

But she was fired when the COVID-19 pandemic hit and her employers dumped her on the streets. 
The 32-year-old was left on the curb outside the Ethiopian consulate in a suburb of Beirut, one of hundreds of women abandoned by employers without the means to get home after the pandemic hit, on top of a financial crisis that has devastated the Lebanese economy. 
Lebanese labour laws offer little protection for migrant workers. The best the women can hope for is that a charity will help them get home. 
""They just take them out and dump them on the streets with their belongings,"" Alemtsehay told Reuters. ""Even right now, there are many women on the streets, waiting for someone to come to their rescue."" 
Ethiopia accounts for the biggest percentage of migrant workers in Lebanon, according to Lebanese government data. 
In May, Alemtsehay was one of around 650 women returned to Ethiopia on a flight organised by Addis Ababa authorities and the United Nations' International Organization for Migration (IOM).
Another woman on the flight said she had been dumped without her wages or passport and arrested for not having identification. She didn't want Reuters to identify her for fear that traffickers that she paid to bring her to Lebanon would track her down and force her to repay her debts. 
Maureen Achieng, IOM's chief of mission in Ethiopia, said women were still keen to work in Lebanon despite the horror stories. 
""The dangers are for the most part well known but ... not always a sufficient deterrent,"" she told Reuters.
Alemtsehay's family is just happy to see her.

Two people were declared dead on Thursday evening, with disaster response officials pulling four more bodies from debris during the night, fire and police officials said.

The Kuomintang (KMT) has mounted a noisy campaign against the nomination of Chen Chu to head the Control Yuan, an independent government watchdog.
The KMT, soundly beaten by Tsai and her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) in elections in January, this week occupied parliament's main chamber for three days, trying to thwart Chen from taking the post.
Several KMT lawmakers knocked down voting booths inside the chamber to block DPP legislators from casting ballots over the nomination. KMT has accused the DPP of cheating in part of the vote on nomination this week. 
The voting on Friday went ahead despite shouting and protests from KMT lawmakers, who held banners reading ""invalid vote"".
About 100 KMT supporters outside parliament fought with police and some tried to break through barricades, calling on the DPP to withdraw the nomination. 
""Rejection to cronyism. Withdraw the nomination,"" KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang told supporters on the back of a truck outside the parliament.
Taiwan is a boisterous, sometimes unruly democracy. Punch-throwing and rowdy protests are not uncommon in parliament.
The DPP has a large parliamentary majority, and has been angered by the targeting of Chen, who was jailed in 1980 for helping lead pro-democracy demonstrations against the then-KMT government when Taiwan was a dictatorship.
The KMT, under its youthful new leader, Chiang, has been trying to reinvent itself since its election defeat, having failed to shake off DPP accusations they were too pro-China.
The party traditionally favours closer ties with China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory.
The KMT faces a further challenge next month in a mayoral by-election in the major southern metropolis of Kaohsiung, traditionally a DPP stronghold. 

Kaohsiung's previous KMT mayor was thrown out of office in a recall vote in June.

(Reuters) - Arizona and Texas counties hit hard by COVID-19 are ordering coolers and refrigerated trailers to store bodies as their morgues fill up, authorities said on Thursday.
Arizona's Maricopa County, home to the state's largest city, Phoenix, is bringing in 14 coolers to hold up to 280 bodies and more than double morgue capacity ahead of an expected surge in coronavirus fatalities, officials said on Thursday. 
In Texas, the city of San Antonio and Bexar County have acquired five refrigerated trailers to store up to 180 bodies as some morgues at hospitals and funeral homes reach capacity, Mario Martinez, San Antonio Metro Health assistant director, said in a video.
New York used dozens of refrigerated trailers in April as its daily COVID-19 deaths exceeded 700. The appearance of mobile morgues in Arizona and Texas reflects that the pandemic appears to now be spinning out of control in southern U.S. states. 
""We are likely to see the trends of deaths rise over the next two to three weeks,"" Maricopa County health director Marcy Flanagan told a news briefing.
Maricopa's daily COVID-19 cases peaked in late June at over 3,000. Patients typically spend a few weeks in hospital before dying, Flanagan said.
Texas on Thursday reported 10,457 new COVID-19 cases and a single-day record of 129 deaths. The state's Cameron and Hidalgo counties are also sharing a refrigerated trailer to store bodies of coronavirus patients, local press reported. 
Coolers in Maricopa will be located at the medical examiner's office, which stores around 20% of bodies in the county. Many hospitals and funeral homes that hold the rest are at or near capacity, said Flanagan and county spokesman Fields Moseley.
Phoenix-based Abrazo Health Network has morgue space but has ordered refrigerated storage to have additional capacity if needed, a spokesman said on Thursday.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Crews have extinguished all known fires aboard a U.S. Navy warship that burned for four days at its mooring in San Diego, a top admiral said on Thursday, but it was still unclear if the Bonhomme Richard could be saved.
Firefighters were combing through the 844-foot-long (257-m) amphibious assault ship to make sure that all flames were out before a formal investigation could begin into the cause of the blaze, Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck told a news briefing at U.S. Naval Base San Diego.
""We do not know the origin of the fire. We do not know the extent of the damage. It is too early to make any predictions or promises of what the future of the ship will be,"" said Sobeck, commander of the Navy's Expeditionary Strike Group Three.
The flames erupted on Sunday morning, followed by at least one large explosion aboard the Bonhomme Richard, which was commissioned in 1998 with a name dating to the U.S. Revolutionary war.
Sobeck said 63 people - 40 sailors and 23 civilians - were treated for minor injuries during the four days of firefighting from land, air and sea that followed, Sobeck said. None were hospitalized.
""The bottom line is every sailor is a firefighter and we certainly proved that,"" the admiral said. 
The Bonhomme Richard, whose size ranks second in the U.S. Navy fleet to that of an aircraft carrier, sustained severe damage from the flames, leaving the ship listing to the starboard side, its superstructure collapsed and melted.
Sobeck said he believed the ship could be repaired and returned to duty but that the Navy had not yet decided whether to undertake the massive task.
""The Bonhomme Richard has proved its survival. It's in stable condition all the way through,"" he said.
The ship was undergoing repairs at the time the fire broke out, so only about 160 of its 1,000 crew members were aboard and all major munitions had already been removed, Navy officials have said.
The ship marks the third incarnation of the Bonhomme Richard, dating to when France gave a frigate to the United States and the father of its Navy, John Paul Jones, at the time of the Revolutionary War. He named it Bonhomme Richard.

The 15-year-old student, called Grace in the original ProPublica report that highlighted her situation, was on probation for fighting with her mother and stealing. ProPublica reported that Grace, who has attention deficit disorder, was easily distracted when studying at home and fell behind during remote learning. A Michigan circuit court judge sent Grace to juvenile detention in May, citing the schoolwork as a probation violation.
On Thursday afternoon, protesters assembled at Groves High School in the suburb of Beverley Hills before they drove to the Oakland County's Circuit Court and prosecutor's office holding up signs with calls to ""Free Grace."" 
Students at the demonstration told Reuters Grace’s academic performance was not unique as the country grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.
“A lot of people were behind on their work this semester, no one had motivation to do anything because the teachers weren’t teaching and we were all online. I know so many people that didn’t do their homework,” said Prudence Canter, 18, a graduating senior at the school.
“It didn’t seem like the judge or the caseworker knew how grades and due dates and things were structured during the pandemic shutdown in the spring,"" Geoff Wickersham, a social studies teacher at Grove, told Reuters at the protest. ""I think this is a huge injustice.” 
Speakers asked protesters to raise their hands if they had ever failed to turn in an assignment at some point and every person raised their hands.
The prosecutor's office declined to comment. Judge Mary Ellen Brennan, who handed down the ruling, was not immediately available for comment.
Oakland County Executive David Coulter posted a statement online Tuesday night, writing that he had spoken to the judge.
“While there are many more details that she is unable to share with me and the public to protect privacy of the minor and their family, I believe a review of this case within her court or during an appellate process is required,” Coulter wrote.
Congressional Representative Andy Levin wrote online that children should not be locked up for not doing their homework.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Doctors in Bogota are calling for a return to a strict city-wide quarantine to slow coronavirus infections in Colombia's capital, warning that medical services are close to collapsing, a leading medic said on Thursday. 
The Andean country has reported over 165,000 cases of the coronavirus and around 6,000 deaths. Bogota accounts for more than a third of the country's total cases and over 20% of its deaths. 
""We're in a critical situation,"" the president of the Bogota College of Medicine, Herman Bayona, told Reuters. ""We are close to collapse."" 
Colombian President Ivan Duque declared an ongoing quarantine to slow the spread of the coronavirus in late March. 
The quarantine is due to be lifted on Aug. 1, with certain sectors of the economy and parts of the country already starting to reopen. 
This week the capital began strict, rolling two-week quarantines by neighborhood, something Bayona said was ineffective.
""We don't think zonal quarantines have the power to slow the speed of infections,"" he said. 
Bayona said a number of medical associations had met with political leaders in Bogota to argue for a return to a strict city-wide quarantine. 
Bogota's intensive care units (ICUs) were at just under 90% capacity as of Wednesday evening, according to local government figures. Mayor Claudia Lopez visited a public hospital on Thursday and said between 20 and 30 new ventilators will come online daily to increase ICU capacity. 
""Bogota's hospitals haven't collapsed,"" Lopez said. ""The hospital system and ICUs are serving everyone who needs attention.""
Though some ICUs are at full capacity, patients can be moved to hospitals with space, she said. 
But ICUs are not the only measure of a stretched health system. COVID-19 wards in the city are full, Bayona said, while emergency services are operating above capacity. 
Lopez is set to hold a meeting early next week with the health ministry to determine whether all of Bogota will be placed under a strict quarantine. 
If hospitals reach full capacity as the peak of the pandemic hits, it will spell disaster, Bayona said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A few dozen New Yorkers wandered through Manhattan's elevated High Line Park on Thursday, marveling at the lush gardens, city views and lack of crowds as it reopened with limited capacity after a four-month shutdown due to COVID-19.
The park, a 1.5-mile (2.3-km) strip of green built on an old elevated railroad that runs along Manhattan's West Side, was one of few city parks to close in March, in part because it was too narrow to permit proper social distancing, the Board of Directors said in a statement. 
The High Line that opened on Thursday, mostly empty and its walkway dotted with bright green circles spaced six feet apart, was an unfamiliar sight to New Yorkers who know it as a tourist haven. That made it an especially welcome respite for the lockdown-weary. 
""This is huge. It actually makes it feel like things are coming back to normal,"" said Greg Bruckno, a 50-year-old program coordinator.
Bruckno said he used to walk to work along the High Line but stopped because it got too crowded. On Thursday, he appreciated the chance to show the park to his friend Stan Redfern, a New Yorker who had never visited before because of the tourists.
""By the time I got around to going, I saw all these billions of tourists lined up so I thought, 'I'm not going to go there,'"" said Redfern, 80 years old and recently retired from publishing.
One of the city's most popular tourist attractions since it opened in 2009, the High Line attracts millions of visitors every year.
Visitors now must make reservations to enter the park at a specific time under new rules in place to prevent crowding. Staff members were stationed throughout the park on Thursday, reminding visitors of another new policy: foot traffic can only move north from the Gansevoort Street entrance at the park's south end to prevent bottlenecks. 
A few people sunbathed on wooden lounge chairs wearing masks and sunglasses. Others snapped selfies, pushed strollers or read books in the shade.
Homecare nurse Barbara Duggan sat on a bench with a bouquet of flowers. It was her 71st birthday, and she had come directly from visiting Governors Island, which reopened on Wednesday.
""It's hopeful to see things starting to open again,"" Duggan said. ""It's amazing that people cooperated so that the numbers went down.""
The city, once the epicenter of the United States' COVID-19 crisis with more than 6,000 new cases daily, has recorded fewer than 300 new cases daily in the last week with a positive test rate of about 2%. 
Sooman Park and Juyun Lim were relieved to have a new outdoor destination to bring their 2-year-old daughter, Chowon, who was dozing in her stroller after toddling around the walkway.
Park, who attends Columbia Business School, said he and Juyun had only let their daughter and 5-year-old son play in their neighborhood near Columbia University's campus for months while the city was shuttered.

""We really missed midtown and other parks in the city,"" he said. ""We're going to book another ticket for next weekend.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General William Barr installed a new interim U.S. attorney in the Northern District of Alabama on Thursday, the latest appointee to come out of the Justice Department in Washington to serve in an acting capacity as a top federal prosecutor.
Prim Escalona, the department's principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Office of Legislative Affairs, will take over from Jay Towns, who resigned on Wednesday to take a job with a defense contractor.
A Justice Department spokesman did not have any immediate comment on why Barr tapped Escalona, who does not appear to have a background prosecuting criminal cases based on her LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile.
Barr has reshuffled a number of U.S. attorneys in recent months, replacing them with people who worked in Washington.
In January, he installed his counsel Tim Shea as acting U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, the office that brought the criminal case against Trump's longtime friend Roger Stone.
Barr later ordered Shea to scale back the department's sentencing memorandum for Stone, prompting all four career prosecutors to resign from the case.
Earlier this month, Barr also appointed Seth Ducharme, the principal associate deputy attorney general in Washington, as acting U.S. attorney for the Brooklyn-based Eastern District of New York.
Richard Donoghue, the prior U.S. attorney in the Eastern District, took over Ducharme's role in Washington. 
In June, Barr ousted Manhattan's top federal prosecutor, Geoffrey Berman, so that Trump could appoint Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, who has no experience as a prosecutor.
Barr originally had planned to fill the job temporarily by appointing Craig Carpenito, the U.S. attorney in New Jersey. 
But Berman foiled those plans by refusing to step aside until Barr agreed to let Berman's handpicked deputy serve as acting U.S. Attorney.
Separately, Barr also recently appointed Deputy Associate Attorney General Stephen Cox as the top prosecutor in the Eastern District of Texas.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian security forces fired tear gas on Thursday to disperse demonstrators gathered in the southwestern city of Behbahan, witnesses told Reuters, and there was a heavy presence of forces in other cities.
Videos posted on social media from inside Iran showed protesters chanting, ""Fear not, fear not, we are in this together"". Some protesters chanted slogans against top officials. 
Videos posted on Twitter showed a heavy presence of security forces in several cities, including Tehran and Isfahan. 
Witnesses in Behbahan said there had been several arrests in the city, which is in Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province.
The videos on social media and arrest reports could not be verified by Reuters.
Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks wrote on Twitter that it had seen some internet restrictions in place in Khuzestan province late on Thursday.
Iran's clerical rulers have tried to prevent a revival of anti-government protests that took place last November, when over 1,000 of people are believed to have been killed in the deadliest street violence since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution.
Iran's interior ministry said in May that the number of those killed was 225, including security forces. 
""People are angry. The economy is so bad that we cannot survive,"" said an Iranian man by phone from Tehran on Thursday, who asked not to be named due to security concerns.
Last year's unrest began with protests over economic hardship but turned political, with demonstrators demanding top officials step down.
Iran's economy, hard hit by U.S. sanctions that have choked off its oil exports, has since further deteriorated as a result of the coronavirus crisis in past months.
Iran's judiciary announced on Tuesday that the death sentences of three men involved in last year's anti-government unrest had been upheld, sparking a surge of online protests against their sentences.
Some people on social media called on people to stage demonstrations across the country on Friday to protest the death penalty for the three men.
Iran's Tasnim news agency said the security forces had arrested ""key elements of opposition groups... who were encouraging people to protest on Friday in the northeastern Khorasan Razavi province"".

OTTAWA (Reuters) - A Canadian federal court on Thursday recommended an external review of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service after it found the agency failed to disclose it relied on information that was likely obtained illegally when seeking court warrants.
In a decision, Justice Patrick Gleeson recommended a comprehensive external review of the country's main spy agency that aims to ""fully identify systemic, governance and cultural short-comings and failures.""
The review, the judge said, should also consider the manner in which legal advice is being delivered to intelligence agency and its interactions with Canada's Justice Department. 
""This Court and the Canadian public must have confidence that respect for the rule of law is and remains a foundational principle underpinning all national security intelligence decision-making,"" Gleeson wrote. 
Justice Minister David Lametti told a news conference that the Canadian government planned to appeal the decision.
David Vigneault, director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS), said in a statement the agency often relied on help from human sources who have access to individuals or organizations that could pose a threat. Those individuals are sometimes paid for information or provided with logistical supports, like a cellphone.
""Let me be clear, the types of activities that are in question in this decision are representative of routine, bread and butter practices used by allied intelligence agencies around the world,"" Vigneault said.
Both Lametti and Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said they took the court's finding ""very seriously."" 
""We want to reassure Canadians that at no time was the safety of Canadians at risk, nor were our rights and freedoms,"" the ministers said, adding they had requested a national security watchdog look into the concerns raised by the court.
The Canadian government has also retained a former Supreme Court of Canada justice as an external adviser.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rebuffed a bid by voting rights advocates to block a Republican-backed Florida law mandating that people with past felony convictions pay court fines and fees before being able to register to vote.
The conservative-majority high court left in place a July 1 decision by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to put on hold a judge's earlier ruling declaring the law an ""unconstitutional pay-to-vote system"" imposed on citizens who genuinely cannot pay - or even know if anything is owed. 
U.S. District Judge Robert Hinkle's ruling had cleared the way for potentially hundreds of thousands of Floridians to register to vote in the key election battleground state ahead of the Nov. 3 election in which President Donald Trump is seeking a second term in office.
Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan dissented from Thursday's decision. Sotomayor wrote in dissent that the Supreme Court's action prevents thousands of otherwise eligible voters from casting ballots ""simply because they are poor,"" adding that the decision ""continues a trend of condoning disfranchisement."" 
The law was signed last year by Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, a Trump ally. Voting rights advocates and Democrats have accused Republicans in a number of states of passing laws aimed at suppressing the voting ability of groups who tend to support Democratic candidates.
The 11th Circuit decision effectively halted the voter registration of former felons who cannot afford to pay the fines and fees as required under the law to have their voting rights restored.
A group of Floridians and voting rights organizations sued DeSantis, arguing the law amounted to an illegal poll tax in violation of the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law.
Opponents argued the law goes against the wishes of Florida voters who approved an amendment to the state's constitution in 2018 to grant voting rights to felons who served their time and were not convicted of murder or sex crimes.
The 11th Circuit put a temporary hold on Hinkle's decision while it considered an appeal by DeSantis. That action put the rights of these former felons in limbo for months, well past deadlines to register to vote in the presidential election.

Florida Democratic Party Chair Terrie Rizzo said in a statement after the Supreme Court's action, ""Florida Republicans have a shamefully transparent electoral strategy: voter suppression.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Only one in four Americans think it is safe for public schools to reopen this fall as U.S. coronavirus cases climb, and four in 10 parents said they would likely keep their children home if classes resume, a new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll shows.
The July 14-15 national online poll was conducted as the country's 13,000 school districts grapple with how to safely resume instruction after closing in the spring as infections spread. The results suggest President Donald Trump’s demand to fully reopen schools is at odds with how most Americans feel.
Just 26% of American adults said they thought it was safe for schools in their community to bring students back. Another 55% felt they were not safe, and 19% were not sure.
The response was split along party lines: Half of Republicans said they thought schools were safe, compared with only one in 10 Democrats.
Among respondents with school-age children, about four in 10 said it was unlikely that they would send them to school if in-person teaching resumes. Another five in 10 said they would send their kids to school, and the rest said they were unsure.
""I’ve had a migraine every day for the past month, just with the stress and fear of all of this,"" said Tameka Dumas, 47, a mother of two from Grenada, Mississippi. 
Dumas will keep her 16-year-old son home to take online classes when his school reopens in August, deciding that it is better to protect him from a virus that already has infected her uncle and killed one of her friends.
""I told him that I hate to keep him from his friends, but at the rate of infection, it’s just for the best,"" she said. 
Trump recently has made reopening public schools a focus of his re-election campaign, in part to court suburban voters, especially women, who are increasingly unhappy with him.
The Republican president has said school districts must offer a full schedule of classes, and he threatened to cut funding from schools that do not follow through. 
""Medical and education experts agree that children learn best through in-person education, and it’s also true that parents need the certainty of schools reopening so they can return to work,"" Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. ""We must reopen schools and the economy and do it safely.""
The poll found that only three in 10 white women, including only two in 10 suburban white women, felt schools are safe to reopen. More than eight out of 10 white women said they are still concerned about the spread of the coronavirus, which has claimed more than 138,000 lives in the United States and has continued a rapid spread throughout much of the country.
White women are key for Trump's re-election bid. He won that demographic by 13 percentage points in the 2016 election, and they are also one of the most likely subgroups to vote. 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who for months has led Trump in national polls, including a 10-point advantage among registered voters in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, has called for a more cautious approach to re-opening schools.
HEEDING THE EXPERTS
Away from the campaign trail, Americans say they are largely relying on guidance from public health experts on when and how schools should open, the Reuters/Ipsos survey found.
Asked who should determine when schools reopen in their community, 40% said they would leave the decision to public health experts, while 17% said it should be up to the school districts and 13% said their state’s governor should decide. Only 5% said they would leave it to the federal government. 
When classes resume, only 20% said students should return for the full school calendar. Another 37% felt students should begin an online-only curriculum, and 43% said students should follow a hybrid schedule that includes some time in the classroom and some instruction online.  
""They should reopen,"" said Rick Gardner, 48, of Republic, Missouri, who wants to send his 16-year-old daughter to a full high school schedule in the fall. Gardner, a security officer at his local airport, said he thinks the public's concern about the coronavirus is overplayed.
""I’m around hundreds of people all day, and I don’t know one person who’s gotten the disease,"" he said. 
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,114 American adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of three percentage points.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's federal government will give the 13 provinces and territories more than C$19 billion ($14 billion) to help pay for the costs of restarting the economy after several months of COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, the prime minister said on Thursday.
The federal government first announced it wanted to reach a ""safe restart agreement"" with the provinces and territories last month, when it pledged C$14 billion, and negotiations have been ongoing ever since.
The cash is meant to cover extraordinary costs over the coming six to eight months, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a news conference, and will take care of ""the kinds of things that actually really matter to Canadians,"" including preparing for a possible ""second wave"" of contagion.
Those things include contact tracing, providing protective equipment to workers, helping struggling municipalities pay operating costs, aiding local transit operators, ""safe spaces"" for daycare, and improving long-term care for the elderly.
The money will also allow the government to provide up to 10 days of sick leave for those who do not already have it, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said in the same news conference.
""COVID-19 isn't just a health crisis, it's an economic crisis, too,"" Trudeau said. ""Because until we find a vaccine, the daily threat of COVID-19 will not disappear.""
Canadian provinces and territories have been gradually reopening. On Wednesday, Canada reported 343 new cases from a day earlier and 12 more deaths.
But there is growing concern about the spread of the virus from the United States, where numbers are skyrocketing in several states. 

Canada and the United States on Thursday confirmed a Reuters report from earlier this week, which said the border would remain closed to nonessential travel until Aug. 21. It has been shut since mid-March.

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Restrictions on non-essential travel at U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico will be extended through Aug. 21, Canada and the United States announced on Thursday.
""Canada and the United States have agreed to extend the current border measures by one month until August 21, and we're going to keep working closely with our American neighbors to keep people safe on both sides of the border,"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at a news conference.
Earlier, acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf announced the 30-day extension on Twitter that ""close collaboration with our neighbors has allowed us to respond to #COVID19 in a North American approach and slow the travel-related spread of the virus.""
Reuters reported Monday that Canada and the United States were set to extend a ban imposed to fight the coronavirus outbreak. 
The rules, first issued in March, have been repeatedly extended in 30-day blocks.
The restrictions do not cover trade across a U.S.-Canada border that stretches 5,525 miles (8,891 km) or air travel.
Passenger crossings have fallen by 90% or more at many border crossings and hit tourist destinations along U.S. borders.
In May, passenger traffic in Detroit fell to 45,000 people crossing, down from 502,000 passengers crossing in February.
At San Ysidro, California, on the U.S.-Mexico border, passenger and pedestrian traffic fell from more than 2.9 million people crossing in February to 1.3 million in May.

The restrictions do not apply to travelers who are getting to work, or people travelling for family care, educational or humanitarian reasons.

While Rio has in recent weeks relaxed lockdown measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, most locals are still shunning famed beaches like Copacabana and Ipanema as a precaution.
Where once there was a forest of umbrellas, music blaring, and hardly an inch of sand unoccupied, now the only sound is the turquoise sea lapping at the largely empty bays, dotted with the occasional sunbather. The beach volleyball courts are empty. 
Biologist Mario Moscatelli told Reuters the dearth of visitors and traffic was giving the city's beaches a breather in several ways.
""It is something positive from the pandemic... without humans on the beaches, the empty space is being occupied by native fauna that have not been seen here for a long time,"" he said. ""Also, there is less trash.""
Decades of heavy beach traffic have taken a toll on the beaches and their waters. Rio's Guanabara Bay may look pristine on the surface, but life in its waters has long been impacted by the stress of thousands of daily beachgoers.
Moscatelli is sanguine that after the pandemic, a better balance may be found between nature and human life in Rio.

He hopes society will learn from the lockdown measures ""and understand that health and the environment are our greatest treasures, and what our health depends on.""

With loans to pay and a family of four to support, she found herself where she thought she'd never wind up: the food bank.
Even though France has made it through the worst of the coronavirus lockdown, charities say workers hurt by the economic crisis are still in dire need of help. And if a second wave should hit in the autumn, they are warning of serious hardship to come.
""I'm not embarrassed, but it's too bad we can't get by on our own,"" Natalia told Reuters outside a food bank run by charity Secours Populaire in Houilles, a suburb of Paris.
Though she was able to go back to work two weeks ago, business at the bakery is still dire and Natalia is worried she could lose her job for good at any moment. For now, she still relies on groceries from the charity to keep food on the table.
""What scares me is how are we going to get by if there is a second wave?""
Hamza, a student from Morocco, earned his livelihood giving maths lessons to high school pupils. Lockdown in March left him with no income. 
""I don't have any more resources available. So I come here, at least I get something to eat,"" he said. ""I would have never thought I'd have to come here.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan on Thursday validated licenses of 166 pilots working in foreign countries amid a scandal involving ""dubious"" flying certificates, which caused a global alert.
Pakistan's civil aviation ministry grounded 262 pilots for ""dubious"" qualifications last month, prompted by a preliminary report into an airliner crash in Karachi in May that found the pilots had failed to follow standard procedures and disregarded alarms.
That crash killed 97 passengers and crew. 
The ministry had said earlier that Pakistan has a total of 860 pilots, 107 of whom work for foreign airlines, but updated on Thursday in a statement that it had received requests from 10 countries for validation of 176 pilots.
It said 166 of them have been validated by Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) as ""genuine and certified"" and the remaining 10 will have their process completed by next week. 
The 10 countries where these pilots are employed included United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Malaysia, Vietnam, Bahrain, Ethiopia, Hong Kong, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait, the ministry said. It said the validation had been conveyed to the respective countries. 
Out of the 262 grounded pilots, the statement said, the licenses for 28 pilots have been cancelled, and a process of verification for another 76 was underway. 
The scandal has prompted the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to suspended two Pakistani airlines' authorisation to fly to the bloc for six months over safety failure.
Britain and the United States have also revoked landing rights for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), and various global safety boards have downgraded the national carrier's rating over aviation safety risks.
Several countries have grounded the Pakistani pilots, seeking the validation from Pakistan. 
Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association (PALPA) has said there are discrepancies in the government-prepared list of pilots with licences deemed dubious.

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Thursday said its diplomats protested and left a meeting arranged by Pakistan in Islamabad with an Indian man condemned to death on charges of spying, saying an agreement to allow ""unimpeded"" consular access had not been honoured by Pakistani officials. 
Former Indian Naval Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav was arrested in 2016 in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan and convicted of espionage and sabotage by a Pakistani military court a year later. 
India took the matter to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) which ordered a stay on Jadhav's execution in 2019, as well as consular access for India. Pakistan was also ordered to conduct an ""effective review"" of the death penalty. 
""Two consular officers of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad were provided unimpeded and uninterrupted consular access to Commander Jadhav at 1500 hours,"" Pakistan's foreign office said in a statement on Thursday.
The meeting between Jadhav and Indian officials was the second since the ICJ ruling.
However, according to the India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA), the consular officers left after protesting that the access did not permit free conversation as was agreed a few days earlier with Pakistan.
""Pakistani officials with an intimidating demeanour were present in close proximity of Shri Jadhav and Consular Officers despite the protests of the Indian side,"" the MEA said in a statement, adding that the conversation was also recorded.
Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the MEA's statement.
Indian officials say they were prevented from obtaining Jadhav's written consent to arrange legal representation, necessary for a review of his case.
Earlier this month, Pakistan invited India to file a review against the death sentence in light of the ICJ judgment.

Already tense diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars, have deteriorated since they expelled half of each other's diplomatic staff last month.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will not stand idle in the face of any direct threat to Egyptian and Libyan security, President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi said on Thursday, after lawmakers allied to commander Khalifa Haftar urged Cairo to intervene militarily in Libya's civil war.
Tribal leaders who flew in from Haftar's Benghazi stronghold told Sisi at a meeting in Cairo that they authorized him and the Egyptian army to intervene in their country to counter what they described as the ""Turkish invasion and terrorism"".
The meeting, broadcast on state TV, illustrates the growing regional stakes in Libya, divided since 2014 between areas held by an internationally recognised government in Tripoli, backed by Turkey, and a rival eastern administration, backed by the UAE, Russia and Egypt. 
The eastern-based parliament allied to Haftar called on Egypt this week to help counter Turkish support for Libya's internationally recognised government in Tripoli.
Turkey has helped the Tripoli administration force Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) to abandon an offensive on Tripoli.
Any major escalation could risk igniting a direct conflict in Libya among the foreign powers that have already poured in weapons and fighters in violation of an arms embargo. 
In response to Turkish actions, Sisi last month said Egypt's army might enter Libya if the Tripoli government and its Turkish allies renewed an assault on the central Sirte-Jufrah frontline seen as the gateway to Libya's main oil export terminals. Both areas are held by the LNA.
At the meeting with tribal leaders backing Haftar, Sisi said ""the red lines that we announced earlier... were basically a call for peace and to put an end to the conflict in Libya.""
""But we will not stand idle in the face of any moves that pose a direct threat to our national strategic security on our western borders, especially in light of the increasing military build-up operations in the vicinity of the city of Sirte.""
Sisi said he would seek approval for any military move in parliament, which is dominated by his supporters. ""Egypt is able to change the military situation quickly and decisively if it wants,"" Sisi said before urging all parties to stop fighting.
Haftar enjoys the backing of tribes mainly from east but also former LNA strongholds like Tarhouna in western Libya.

But the former officer from the regime of toppled Muammar Gaddafi is very unpopular in much of western Libya after his 14-month assault on Tripoli, which displaced some 200,000 people.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's independent ethics commissioner on Thursday launched a conflict-of-interest investigation into Finance Minister Bill Morneau for his part in selecting a charity his daughter works for to run a multibillion dollar student grant program.
Morneau, who has been leading the government's economic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, joined a cabinet vote picking WE Charity Canada to administer a C$900 million ($665.1 million) program. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the grants on June 25, but the charity backed out about a week later. 
Earlier this month, Trudeau was put under his third ethics probe for taking part in the same cabinet vote even though his family members have been paid to speak at some of the charity's events in recent years.
Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion is looking into whether Morneau broke rules that prohibit politicians from making, or participating in, decisions that further their personal interests, Dion's office said a statement.
Trudeau apologized in a nationally televised news conference on Monday for taking part in the decision even though his mother, Margaret, has received C$250,000 in speaking fees from the charity, while his brother, Alexandre, has taken in about C$32,000.
Morneau's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the minister said last week that he had not recused himself from the vote.
""I now realize I should have in order to avoid any perception of conflict,"" he said. ""I apologize for not doing so, and moving forward, I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE (Charity).""
Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau have regularly participated in WE Charity events, and Gregoire Trudeau hosts a podcast on the charity's website for which she is not paid.

It takes on average about seven months to complete an investigation, Dion's office said on Twitter.

The 17-year-old spoke to Reuters TV after she and other activists sent an open letter to European leaders urging them to take emergency action and saying people in power had practically ""given up"" on searching for a real solution.
""We need to see it as, above all, an existential crisis. And as long as it's not being treated as a crisis, we can have as many of these climate change negotiations and talks, conferences as possible. It won't change a thing,"" Thunberg said, speaking via video from her home in Stockholm.
Thunberg, who lambasted world leaders at a U.N. climate summit last year for believing in ""fairytales"" of eternal economic growth, said that only fundamental change to the existing system would bring climate change under control.
She cited a U.N. study published in November that suggested planned investments to boost fossil fuel production are likely to push temperature goals enshrined in the 2015 Paris Agreement out of reach.
""So that means that if we are to stay below these targets, we have to make it possible to tear up and abandon valid contracts and deals. And that is not possible within today's system,"" Thunberg said.
""So, yes, then obviously we need to think differently. And, yes, we need to think outside the box."" 
ECOCIDE 
Demands in the letter, released before Friday's European Council summit, included an immediate halt to all investments in fossil fuel exploration and extraction, in parallel with a rapid ending of fossil fuel subsidies. 
The letter also called for binding annual ""carbon budgets"" to limit how much greenhouse gas countries can emit to maximise the chances of capping the rise in average global temperatures at 1.5C, a goal enshrined in the 2015 Paris climate accord.
It urged European governments to back calls for the Hague-based International Criminal Court to adopt a new crime of ""ecocide"" to prosecute people responsible for large-scale destruction of the natural world. 
Thunberg emerged as the face of a growing, youth-led climate movement after a solitary vigil she began holding outside the Swedish parliament in 2018 inspired children and teenagers around the world to stage school strikes on Friday afternoons. 
""In the beginning, I was very worried,"" Thunberg said, describing the fears over climate change that motivated her to embrace activism. ""But when I started doing something, then there came hope from that. Because hope comes from action.""
With climate protests largely driven online by the coronavirus pandemic, Thunberg joined climate scientists, activists and celebrities including actor Leonardo DiCaprio and author Margaret Atwood in signing the letter that was posted on https://climateemergencyeu.org.
""The longer we keep pretending that we are on a reliable path to lower emissions and that the actions required to avoid a climate disaster are available within today's system ... the more precious time we will lose,"" the letter read.
It called for climate policies to be designed to protect workers and the most vulnerable and reduce economic, racial and gender inequalities, as well as moves to ""safeguard and protect"" democracy.

Security is deteriorating anew as Yemen faces the coronavirus pandemic and what the United Nations describes as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis, with millions on the verge of famine.
The strikes were the third such incident since June. The Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group has said it is investigating reports of civilian deaths in Wednesday's attack and in Hajjah region earlier this week.
""We deplore yesterday's air strikes in #AlJawf... A thorough & transparent investigation is required,"" envoy Martin Griffiths tweeted, describing attacks on civilians as reprehensible.
The U.N. humanitarian coordination office in Yemen said at least 11 civilians were killed. The Houthi health ministry raised the death toll to 24 after initially saying nine people, including two children, were killed when coalition air strikes hit homes.
The Houthis have recently stepped up cross-border missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities as well as military operations on the ground. The coalition has retaliated with air strikes.
At al-Thawra hospital in the Houthi-held capital Sanaa, where some of the injured were taken, a child writhed in bed with a chest drain and bandaged shoulder and legs. 
A 15-day-old baby died from his wounds, hospital employee Ahmed Sanad, told Reuters.
""For what sin is this child and a baby only days old bombed?"" another employee, Ahmed al-Aawag, said.
The coalition, which receives weapons and intelligence from Western allies including the United States and Britain, was last month removed from a U.N. blacklist several years after it was first accused of killing and injuring children in Yemen.
The conflict has killed more than 100,000 people since the alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 shortly after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in Sanaa.
Griffiths has been holding virtual talks between the warring parties to agree a permanent ceasefire and confidence-building steps to restart peace negotiations last held in December 2018.
The conflict is largely seen regionally as a proxy war between Saudi and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

The boat, which sank on June 27, is believed to have been carrying 55-60 migrants, according to Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. Five people have been formally arrested in relation to the incident.
Lake Van is near the border with Iran, from where migrants regularly cross into Turkey heading west toward Europe from Iran, Afghanistan and other countries.
Seven people died and 64 were rescued when a boat carrying migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan sank on Lake Van in December.
More than a million people reached Greece from Turkey in 2015-16, although the numbers later dropped sharply under a 2016 agreement between the EU and Turkey for Ankara to take migrants back in return for funds.
Earlier this year, tens of thousands of migrants tried to cross into Greece via land and sea borders after Ankara said it would no longer stop them. Turkey, home to 3.6 million Syrians, the world's largest refugee population, had said it would open the frontier because it was alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria.

A number of military services, including the Marine Corps, have already banned the display of Confederate flags even as President Donald Trump has said that flying the flag is ""freedom of speech.""
""Anything that is a divisive symbol, we do want to take those of our installations and that sort of thing out of our formation,"" Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told reporters.
Asked if that would include specifically identifying Confederate flags as divisive symbols, McCarthy said: ""We would have any divisive symbols on a no-fly list, if you will.""
He added that the Pentagon was close to a decision on a uniform policy for the different services on divisive symbols. 
Trump, who has stoked racial divisions as part of his re-election campaign, has criticized the desecration and removal of statues of Confederate and other former U.S. leaders to energize his political base.
Last month, Trump rejected renaming military bases named after Confederate generals, slapping down Pentagon officials who are open to discussing the issue.
Recent social unrest has raised new questions about the flying of the Confederate battle flag in areas of the country and whether statues honoring Confederate leaders during the 1861-1865 U.S. Civil War should be removed from prominent places.
Asked on Tuesday if the flag should be ""taken down,"" Trump responded: ""I know people that like the Confederate flag and they're not thinking about slavery.""
Last week the top U.S. general said the military had to take a ""hard look"" at symbols of the Confederacy, including base names.

The Justice Department executed convicted murderer Wesley Purkey by lethal injection, and he was pronounced dead at 8:19 a.m. EDT (1219 GMT) at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, a Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman said.
The execution had been blocked by a federal court, but the Supreme Court overruled it, just as it did in another case on Tuesday, and putting the federal government back in the business of executing prisoners.
""This sanitized murder really does not serve no purpose whatsoever. Thank you,"" a remorseful Purkey said in his final words, according to a reporter who was allowed to witness the killing and share notes with the media.
Purkey, 68, was convicted in 2003 in Missouri of raping and murdering 16-year-old Jennifer Long before dumping her dismembered and burned remains in a septic pond.
His lawyers argued he had dementia and brain damage caused by Alzheimer's disease and no longer understood his punishment, though he had accepted responsibility for his crime. Killing him would breach the U.S. Constitution, they said.
""I deeply regret the pain and suffering I caused to Jennifer's family. I am deeply sorry. I deeply regret the pain I caused to my daughter, who I love so very much,"" Purkey said after he was strapped to a gurney inside the execution chamber, his arms tied to side boards, and an intravenous syringe was inserted into his right arm.

Before Tuesday, when the Justice Department executed convicted killer Daniel Lee in Terre Haute, the federal government had only executed three people since 1963, all from 2001 to 2003.

(Reuters) - The Vatican is advising bishops to report cases of sexual abuse of minors by priests to civil authorities even if they are not obliged to by local law, toughening its official guidance on an issue that has rocked the Catholic Church in recent years.
The advice is contained in a new 20-page ""vademecum"", or guidebook, issued on Thursday by the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. It contains some of the clearest language on reporting sexual abuse ever in a Vatican document.
Previous Vatican documents required clerics to report any cases of abuse to Church superiors but said they should follow local law on whether they are obliged to report alleged sexual abuse to civil authorities.
""Even in cases where there is no explicit legal obligation to do so, the ecclesiastical authorities should make a report to the competent civil authorities if this is considered necessary to protect the person involved or other minors from the danger of further criminal acts,"" the handbook says.
While the provision does not have the full force of Church law and gives bishops some discretion, the language appeared to be a significant step in response to demands by victims groups.
Archbishop Giacomo Morandi, number two at the Vatican doctrinal office, highlighted the novelty of the reporting issue in an interview with the official Vatican News website.
The handbook, a step-by-step guide and mostly a compilation of existing laws, was devised after a request from bishops at a Vatican summit on abuse in February last year.
It is intended to help local churches get through what the Vatican's doctrinal chief, Cardinal Luis Francisco Ladaria, called ""a dense forest of norms and procedures"".
The guidelines will be sent to all dioceses, even those who already had them. 

For the past two decades Roman Catholic churches around the world have been hit by a raft of sexual abuse cases and have spent billions of dollars in settlements, expenses that in many cases have led to the closing of parishes and schools.

Ethiopia's charge d'affaires in Khartoum also told a senior Sudanese Foreign Ministry official in a meeting that his country had not closed the dam gates, the statement added.
Ethiopian Water Minister Seleshi Bekele said on Wednesday in televised comments, of which a transcript was given to Reuters by his office, that ""the construction of the dam and the filling of the water go hand in hand"".
""The filling of the dam doesn't need to wait until the completion of the dam,"" he added. 
However, the Sudanese statement quoted the Ethiopian envoy as saying that the minister ""did not make the comments attributed to him yesterday‮‮ ‬‬about starting the process of filling the dam"". 
Addis Ababa is committed to continuing African Union- sponsored talks with Sudan and Egypt over the dam, its envoy was quoted as saying.
Earlier this week talks between the three nations to regulate the flow of water from the dam failed to reach agreement.
Sudan and Egypt both fear the $4 billion hydroelectric dam could lead to water shortages in their own nations.
The project has raised concerns in Egypt that already limited Nile waters will be further restricted. The Blue Nile is a tributary of the Nile from which Egypt gets 90% of its fresh water.
Egypt asked Ethiopia for urgent clarification on whether it had started filling the reservoir, the foreign ministry in Cairo said on Wednesday.

(Reuters) - Cirque du Soleil accepted a recapitalization offer from its creditors on Thursday, after an earlier deal with shareholders including TPG Capital and Fosun International Ltd was dismissed by lenders.
Creditor Catalyst Capital Group said the entertainment company had accepted its ""stalking horse bid"" for its assets.
A ""stalking horse"" bid is an opening offer that other interested bidders must surpass if they want to buy the company.
The deal will inject up to $375 million into the financially-strapped Cirque du Soleil, a source familiar with the matter said.

The Montreal-based company, which grew from a troupe of street-performers in the 1980s to a company with global reach, has slashed about 95% of its workforce and suspended shows due to the pandemic. The company filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday.

Berlin, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, has so far largely shielded the organisation from the most intense criticism by Washington, which wants to leave the WHO because of its alleged excessive closeness to China.
But now Germany seems to be taking a more assertive position.
Spahn told reporters he had discussed the review of the WHO's management of the crisis with its chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus twice over the last 20 days.
""In both conversations I encouraged him very clearly to launch this independent commission of experts and to expedite its launch,"" Spahn said.
The WHO said last week it was setting up an independent panel to review its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response by governments.
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused the WHO of being too close to China and not doing enough to question Beijing's actions at the start of the crisis. Tedros has dismissed the suggestions and said his agency kept the world informed. 
Tedros has said the panel will provide an interim report to an annual meeting of health ministers in November and present a ""substantive report"" next May.
Spahn said the review was important now, even if the pandemic is still raging across the world, because ""we can already draw conclusions.""
This could lead to quick actions over the body's governance and to improve ""cooperation between the political and the scientific level"" of the organisation, Spahn added.
EU governments have said the review should be followed by a reform of the organisation, a possibility already being discussed with the United States and other members of the G7 group of rich countries, officials told Reuters.

One official had said the aim was to ensure WHO's independence.

""It is almost certain that Russian actors sought to interfere in the 2019 General Election through the online amplification of illicitly acquired and leaked Government documents,"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said.
""Sensitive government documents relating to the UK-US Free Trade Agreement were illicitly acquired before the 2019 General Election and disseminated online via the social media platform Reddit,"" he added.
A British government investigation found that when these documents gained little traction, further attempts were made to promote illicitly obtained material online ahead of the election, Raab said.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson won a landslide victory in the December 2019 election - beating Labour's Jeremy Corbyn with the Conservative Party winning the biggest majority of seats since the 1987 win of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
""Whilst there is no evidence of a broad-spectrum Russian campaign against the General Election, any attempt to interfere in our democratic processes is completely unacceptable,"" Raab said.
""The government reserves the right to respond with appropriate measures in the future,"" he added.
Relations between London and Moscow fell to a post-Cold War low in 2018 when Britain blamed Moscow for trying to kill a former double agent with a Soviet-developed nerve agent in the English cathedral city of Salisbury.

Russia denied it was to blame but London identified agents from Russian military intelligence whom it said had travelled to England to poison former double agent Sergei Skripal.

A report by the EU parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs criticised the ""continuing deterioration of democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights in Poland"" under the eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party.
President Andrzej Duda, a conservative allied with PiS, narrowly defeated a liberal challenger in Sunday's vote, reinforcing the PiS's push to consummate reforms of the judiciary and media that the EU and international rights groups say subject both to state control.
Duda's campaign was also filled with promises to protect what PiS defines as Catholic Polish traditions from any influence from gays, Germans or Jews. 
The EU parliament committee voted 52-15 in favour of the report calling on the other 26 EU countries to advance a rule of law procedure against Warsaw that, in theory, could lead to a suspension of Poland's voting rights in the bloc.
The report, which will be debated by the whole parliament soon, came a day before national EU leaders meet to haggle over a mass economic stimulus to help member state economies recover from the coronavirus pandemic.
The European Parliament will have to approve any deal between member states on their next joint budget worth nearly 1.1 trillion euros and an attached economic recovery fund envisaged at 750 billion euros.
The report's authors said solid democratic safeguards would be a precondition for approving the recovery package.
The wealthy, mainly liberal western EU states that will provide most of the resources for joint spending want to link recovery funding to respect for the rule of law, an approach Poland and its eurosceptic ally Hungary reject.

HANOI (Reuters) - The United States this week hardened its position on the South China Sea, where it has accused China of attempting to build a ""maritime empire"" in the potentially energy-rich waters, despite regional concerns.
The rivals have accused each other of stoking tension in the strategic waterway at a time of strained relations over everything from the new coronavirus to trade to Hong Kong.
A statement from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on July 13 was the first time the United States had called China's claims in the sea unlawful and accused Beijing of a ""campaign of bullying"".
But heated rhetoric has also been on the rise in the region, where Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam challenge China's claim to about 90% of the sea.
REGIONAL TENSIONS
Vietnam, frequently at loggerheads with China over the issue, is this year chairing the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
At a June 26 summit in Hanoi, Vietnam and the Philippines - China's most vocal challengers over the sea - warned of growing regional insecurity amid concern that Beijing was advancing territorial claims under the cover of the COVID-19 pandemic.
As China held military drills in the South China Sea this month, Vietnam said Beijing's actions were ""detrimental"" to its relationship with the Southeast Asian bloc. The United States simultaneously deployed two aircraft carriers to the area for what it said were pre-planned exercises.
In a blustery response to the Chinese drills, Philippine Foreign Minister Teodoro Locsin said China ""will be met with the severest response, diplomatic and whatever else is appropriate"", if the exercises encroached on Philippine territory.
That followed a surprise move by President Rodrigo Duterte - who had courted Beijing since taking office in 2016 - to suspend his decision to scrap a two-decade-old troop deployment agreement with the United States.
TROUBLED WATERS
China illustrates its claims with a vague, U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" that includes swathes of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone, or EEZ, as well as the Paracel Islands and Spratly Islands. It also overlaps the EEZs of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam.
A tribunal at The Hague, based on a suit brought by the Philippines, ruled in 2016 that China has no ""historic title"" over the waters, and that its line was superseded by the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Last year, Chinese and Vietnamese vessels became embroiled in a months-long standoff in Vietnam's EEZ where a Chinese research vessel conducted a sweeping seismic survey of waters overlapping Vietnamese oil blocks.
In May, the same Chinese research vessel was involved in another month-long standoff with Malaysian ships in Malaysia's EEZ, close to where a drillship contracted by Malaysian state oil firm Petronas had been operating.
Chinese incursions happened 89 times between 2016 and 2019, Malaysia's government said on Tuesday.
Indonesia has also begun to take a tougher stance. In January, Jakarta summoned China's ambassador and dispatched air and sea patrols after Chinese vessels entered Indonesia's EEZ around the northern Natuna islands.
The tensions have already affected Vietnamese oil production in the area, including operations controlled by Russia's Rosneft and Spain's Repsol (OTC:REPYY).
""We're already seeing reduced appetite for oil and gas investment in Vietnam,"" said Andrew Harwood, research director at consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie.

""Escalating tensions will not improve the situation"".

""Everyone is tired of this quarantine,"" the presidential press service quoted him as telling government officials.
Ukraine imposed strict restrictions in March but partially eased them in May to allow economic recovery. 
It has been extending the lockdown monthly, with current rules in place until end-July requiring people to wear masks and adhere to strict norms in restaurants and public places.
""We need a clear framework for how we will continue it (lockdown), so that people have the opportunity to live safely, so that business can function, so that the economy does not stand at a pause,"" Zelenskiy added.

That scenario would mean an end-August lockdown finish.

Ukraine has recorded 56,455 coronavirus cases and 1,445 deaths - relatively low numbers compared to western European counterparts. But there have been worryingly high levels of new infections in recent weeks, which authorities attribute to a reluctance to wear masks and observe social distancing.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and China are making progress on ending a months-long military faceoff at their disputed Himalayan border but it is a complicated process and needs verification on the ground, the Indian army said on Thursday.
India says Chinese troops have breached the Line of Actual Control, the poorly defined border in the western Himalayas, and set up defence structures. China says it is operating on its side of the de facto border.
Last month, a clash erupted in the high altitude Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and China took an unspecified number of casualties, prompting top level diplomatic and military talks to defuse the crisis.
China has since thinned out from the Galwan Valley and on Tuesday top military commanders on both sides discussed the next steps in the pullback, the Indian army said.
""The Senior Commanders reviewed the progress on implementation of the first phase of disengagement and discussed further steps to ensure complete disengagement,"" said army spokesman Colonel Aman Anand. 
""The two sides remain committed to the objective of complete disengagement. This process is intricate and requires constant verification,"" he said.
China's foreign ministry said on Wednesday there had been progress in defusing the border crisis and urged the Indian side to maintain peace. 
China has previously blamed frontline Indian troops for provoking the June 15 clash, the most serious in 53 years.
India and China have not been able to agree on their 3,488-km -long border that runs from the snow deserts of Ladakh in the western sector to thick forest and mountains in the east, despite several rounds of talks over the years.
The two sides are trying to resolve the standoff in other parts of Ladakh, including Pangong Tso lake and Hot Springs, officials say. Once that happens, the two armies can start to thin out forces they had inducted into the region following the rise in tensions.

Brahma Chellaney, a specialist on India-China ties, said the threat of more clashes or even an armed conflict has yet to lift since the rival forces are still mobilised in the area.

The committee, which oversees the work of Britain's intelligence community, has been in focus since the publication of the report into Russian influence was delayed by last year's election and the appointment of the group was also postponed.
Opposition lawmakers have accused the government of seeking to tighten its control of the group, but those attempts, which officials deny seeking, seemed to be derailed on Wednesday, when Conservative lawmaker Julian Lewis was voted as chairman.
He beat former minister Chris Grayling, who had been tipped as the government's choice, and Lewis was promptly expelled from the Conservative Party, in what some said was another sign that Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not truck dissent.
""The Committee has unanimously agreed this morning that it will publish the Report on Russia prepared by its predecessor before the house rises for the summer recess,"" it said in a statement.
Britain's parliament will break for the summer holidays on July 22.
The report into Russian influence was commissioned because of concerns that Moscow had interfered in British political life and was completed in March last year.
The delay in publishing has prompted criticism from opposition lawmakers, who have questioned the government's motives and suggested that it did not want to release the report's findings. The government has denied such criticism and the report's findings are not expected to be explosive.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China accused the United States of ""gangster logic"" after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered an end to Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law in response to Beijing's imposition of new security legislation on the former British colony.
Beijing's Liaison Office in the Asian financial hub said the move would only damage U.S. interests while having little impact on Hong Kong.
""Unreasonable meddling and shameless threats by the United States are typical gangster logic and bullying behaviour,"" the office said in a statement late on Wednesday.
The Beijing-drafted law punishes what China broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Critics of the law fear it will crush the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the territory when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China unrest.
This week, a younger, more defiant generation of Hong Kong democrats secured the most votes in unofficial ""primary"" elections in the city in what many saw as a protest vote against the security law.
The vote was organised by the pro-democracy camp to pick candidates for a Sept. 6 election for the 70-seat Legislative Council, or mini-parliament.
Beijing warned the vote may have violated the new law. On Wednesday, former Hong Kong lawmaker Au Nok-hin said he was pulling out as an organiser of the weekend vote amid Beijing's accusations.
On Thursday, another organiser, Andrew Chiu of the Democratic Party, said his work was done and he would no longer help coordinate the Legislative Council election campaign.
""After carefully considering different views ... I would like to withdraw from the coordination work,"" Chiu said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Earlier on Thursday, police arrested a 17-year-old for unlawful assembly and 19-year-old man for obstructing police on July 1, when hundreds were arrested in protests against the national security law.
The 19-year-old tried to help the 17-year-old escape arrest by a policeman who was stabbed in the skirmish. The man accused of stabbing the officer was caught at the airport that night. 
Last week, police arrested seven people for assisting him.
'HYPOCRITICAL'
Trump on Tuesday signed an executive order to end preferential economic treatment for Hong Kong, allowing him to impose sanctions and visa restrictions on Chinese officials and financial institutions involved in the imposition of the law.
China has threatened retaliatory sanctions of its own, and summoned the U.S. ambassador to protest.
The Hong Kong government said on Wednesday it would support any action Beijing chose to take against the United States. 
""It is hypocritical for the U.S. to introduce measures to attack China by creating issues in (Hong Kong) under the pretext of human rights, democracy and autonomy out of its own political considerations,"" a government statement said.
Four members of a pro-establishment party, the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong, staged a protest at the U.S. Consulate on Thursday demanding the United States ""stop interfering in Chinese internal affairs"".
Trump has not ruled out sanctions on top Chinese officials to punish China for its handling of Hong Kong, a White House National Security Council spokesman said on Wednesday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A resounding election win for Singapore's perennial rulers has been tainted by concerns about a generational voter shift that could in time weaken the People's Action Party's (PAP) unyielding grip on power.
The PAP won all but ten of 93 seats in parliament and 61% of the popular vote - a landslide by international standards - but its share of the vote dropped nine points from the last election in 2015. 
Surveys released this week said a youth backlash was reinforced by disaffection from middle-aged voters, who were not expected to rock the boat given the dire economic outlook and job uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
This has prompted analysts to consider whether a long-term decline in the PAP's support is underway - a trend that Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and others have warned could unnerve foreign investors drawn to Singapore's political stability. 
""The results indicate a tentative generational shift,"" said Eugene Tan, a former nominated member of parliament. ""Unless the PAP responds with humility and empathy, one-party dominance will wither.""
Seats won by the opposition have grown steadily over the last two decades, as has its popular vote, with the exception of the 2015 election held after the death of Singapore's modern day founder Lee Kuan Yew.

In the wake of Friday's election, senior PAP figures promised ""soul-searching"", while editorials in pro-government media called for a change to the PAP's paternalistic approach and combative political tactics, and a leadership with stronger links to the people.
""The young people have significantly different life aspirations and priorities...This will have to be reflected in our political process and in government policies,"" Prime Minister Lee said after the election results.
DISAFFECTED VOTERS
There are many unique characteristics of the Singapore electoral system that favour the larger and better-resourced ruling party, notably group constituencies where teams of candidates contend for multiple seats.
The capture by the main opposition Workers' Party of two of these constituencies last week has been held up as an example of the PAP losing touch with young voters. In one of them, Sengkang, a relatively-youthful voter base picked a slate of mainly new candidates, including Singapore's youngest ever elected MP at 26, over experienced political office holders.
A survey of voter intentions published by Blackbox Research on Thursday showed that the Workers' Party was most popular among Generation Z, those aged 21-25. 
Separate surveys by the Straits Times newspaper showed that young voters swapped to the opposition due to issues ranging from opposition pledges to reduce immigration to perceptions that the PAP's targeting of opposition figures was high-handed. 
But Blackbox said the biggest vote shift was towards the new Progress Singapore Party (PSP), headed by an ex-PAP stalwart, which narrowly missed out on seats but garnered 10% of ballots. PSP was most popular among those aged 25-59, while the PAP was favoured by those aged 60 and above. 
""The PSP appeared to do better with disaffected former PAP voters,"" Blackbox said.
Opposition voter Selvan Paramasivam, a 31-year-old investment analyst, said as older voters lose their influence in elections to a younger, social media-savvy citizenry, a consensus is forming around the need for ""a substantial alternative voice in parliament."" 
And despite warnings about foreign investors, this mood for change received only a muted reaction from financial markets compared to a similarly-unexpected slump in the PAP's vote share in 2011.

""This may have to do with the point that most commentators feel that the election was a good one reflecting the Republic's political maturity transition to a more diverse parliament,"" said Leong Sook Mei, a market researcher at MUFG Bank.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea needs to train for potential infectious disease outbreaks worse than COVID-19 and detailed treatment guidelines, as risks of more frequent such outbreaks rise and public sickbeds remain tight, a senior government official said.
South Korea's early success to tame the novel coronavirus through aggressive contact tracing and testing has been touted by disease experts worldwide as gold standard of how to effectively control infectious disease.
Its early state intervention limited widespread community infections and helped hospitals keep sickbeds available for severely affected patients.
But its extremely low rate of public hospital beds - only 10% of total - remains a potential weak spot, as the country continues to battle small but persistent outbreaks and front-line public healthcare workers suffer burnout after more than six months of treating COVID-19 patients.
""I think we will see more such disease outbreaks that are more highly transmissible and fatal,"" National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) President Dr Kim Yong-ik told Reuters.
""We need to be prepared by running simulation exercises on various scenarios: how to switch the existing hospitals, where to send the medical staff, or how to categorize the patients.""
South Korea had the second highest number of hospital beds, next to Japan, in 2017 with 12.3 beds per 1,000 population, double the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development's (OECD) average of 4.7, according to an OECD report.
But public hospital beds account for just 10% of total, far below most advanced countries: according to NHIS, the rate is 100% in Britain, 63% in France, 26% in Japan and 25% in the United States.
Kim said more public hospitals and staff were needed to prevent a resurgence as winter comes.
""Early state intervention helped contain the spread of the virus, but things could get worse when the winter season starts and it's very important for healthcare workers not to get exhausted before then,"" Kim said. 
Kim Dae-ha, a spokesman for the Korean Medical Association which represents all doctors in South Korea, said the low proportion of public sickbeds and doctors has not been a problem as privately owned clinics have as much influence as the public ones.
""South Korea’s efforts (to clamp down on COVID-19) have been called a success, despite a lack of public medical facilities. This evaluation proves the private hospitals and doctors are second to none,"" he told Reuters.
Rather than investing in doctors in specific fields for public hospitals, it is more efficient to support existing private doctors and hospitals, he added.
South Korea's national healthcare insurance, which covers the entire 50 million population, has so far spent 132 billion won ($109 million) treating COVID-19 patients and the amount is likely to rise above 200 billion won this year, according to NHIS.
That's equivalent to $3,600 for a mild patient and $10,000 for a serious one, who can cost up to $58,000 to treat.
The country has reported a total of 13,551 confirmed cases and 289 deaths, sharply lower than most countries.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Supreme Court on Thursday overturned an abuse-of-power conviction against a prominent liberal politician, keeping alive his chances of being a top contender in the next presidential election, in 2022.
Lee Jae-myung, the governor of Gyeonggi province, was convicted in 2019 of abuse of power and lying about his attempt to incarcerate his brother in a mental hospital in 2012.
He was fined 3 million won ($2,500), which according to the law, strips him of eligibility to run for public office.
But Chief Justice Kim Myeong-su ruled that Lee's remarks about his brother, made in a 2018 election debate, were in response to questions from an opponent and it was undemocratic for a state institution to regulate such comments.
""Such remarks cannot be regarded as a public act as their intention was to actively and unilaterally disclose factual information regardless of the debate topic or context,"" Kim said.
Lee thanked the top court in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post for what he called a just decision.
""You have reaffirmed the faith that fake cannot defeat the truth,"" he said.
""I have just realized how lucky I am to even be able to breathe here,"" said Lee. ""As grateful I am for the opportunity to continue my work.""
A former human rights lawyer and activist, Lee, is considered a likely top contender for the 2022 presidential election, consistently ranking second in opinion polls among possible liberal candidates.

President Moon Jae-in was elected in 2017. Presidents in South Korea serve one five-year term.

Eleven Azeri soldiers and a civilian, and four Armenian servicemen, have died since Sunday in renewed conflict between countries who fought a 1990s war in the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region.
International concern is heightened because of the threat to stability in a region serving as a corridor for pipelines taking oil and gas from the Caspian Sea to global markets.
Both countries' defence ministries accused the other of firing mortars from before dawn and encroaching on territory, though there were no casualties reported. 
It was ""the first serious violation of the fragile ceasefire established yesterday,"" the Armenian ministry said. 
The neighbours have long been in conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway, mainly ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh. But the latest flareups are around the Tavush region in northeast Armenia, some 300 km (190 miles) from the enclave.

Ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.

U.S. and Malaysian authorities say about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (N:GS), among others.
Najib has denied wrongdoing. In February, three units of Goldman Sachs pleaded not guilty in a Malaysian court to charges of misleading investors regarding $6.5 billion in bond sales the U.S. investment bank helped raise for 1MDB.
High court judge Mohd Nazlan Mohd Ghazali imposed a temporary freeze on the funds in Britain held by PetroSaudi, which has links to the Saudi royal family, pending the outcome of an Aug. 28 hearing on an application by Malaysian prosecutors seeking an order to prohibit the company and four others from accessing it.
The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), which filed the application under anti-money laundering legislation, said it would extend the interim order to British authorities via mutual legal assistance to ensure the assets remain frozen until the court comes to a decision on the case.
The Free Malaysia Today news site quoted a lawyer for the MACC, Muhammad Nizamuddin Abdul Hamid, as saying Britain's National Crime Agency (NCA) had advised Malaysian authorities to seek a Malaysian court order so the NCA could enforce it there.
Others named in the application were PSI co-founder Tarek Obaid; PetroSaudi Oil Services (Venezuela) Limited; Clyde & Co LLP, which is holding $500 million of PetroSaudi funds in escrow; and an account under the name Temple Fiduciary Services, which Malaysian prosecutors say allegedly belongs to Tarek.
Lawyers representing Tarek and PetroSaudi Oil Services opposed the order in court. 
They declined to comment on their clients' position on the case when approached by reporters outside the court.

Co-founded by Najib in 2009, 1MDB entered what would ultimately become a failed joint-venture with PetroSaudi to develop oil fields that year, with $1 billion paid up front by the Malaysian fund.

TAICHUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan's air, sea and land forces conducted live-fire exercises simulating the repulsion of an invading force on Thursday, with President Tsai Ing-wen saying it showed their determination to defend the democratic and Chinese-claimed island.
F-16 and domestically made Ching-kuo fighter jets launched strikes and tanks raced across inland scrub, firing shells to destroy targets on the beach. About 8,000 personnel took part in drills, held on a coastal strip near Taichung in central Taiwan.
The drills, dubbed ""Han Kuang,"" are Taiwan's main annual exercises. This year's come as China has stepped up its military activity around the island, including flying fighters and bombers close to what Beijing calls its ""sacred territory"".
""The Han Kuang exercises are a major annual event for the armed forces, evaluating the development of combat abilities. Even more, it lets the world see our determination and efforts to defend the country's territory,"" Tsai told the troops.
Tsai, who won re-election by a landslide in January, pledging to stand up to China, has made military modernisation a priority. Taiwan unveiled its largest defence spending increase in more than a decade last year. 
""As I have said, national security does not rely on bowing and scraping but on solid national defence. All our officers and soldiers are the core of that,"" she added.
Although Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made hardware, China has huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment such as stealth fighters and new ballistic missiles.
China sees Taiwan part of ""one China"" and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. 
Taiwan is one of a growing number of flashpoints in the U.S.-China relationship. Beijing routinely denounces Washington's support for the island.

China has stepped up pressure on Taiwan, saying Tsai is pushing for the island's formal independence - a red line for Beijing. She says Taiwan is already an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name.

BADUNG, Indonesia (Reuters) - An Australian woman sentenced to four years imprisonment over the death of a policeman on the Indonesian island of Bali was given early release on Thursday, and was keen to be reunited with family, her lawyer said. 
Sara Connor, 49, was jailed in March 2017 together with British man David Taylor for their roles in the death of a traffic policeman, whose body was found on the popular Kuta beach with neck and head wounds.
Connor was freed 13 months short of her full term due to her good behaviour. 
The two, who were a couple, were tried separately and Taylor, who is in his mid 30s, received a six-year term. 
Wearing a headscarf, Connor did not comment as she left the prison surrounded by guards, who helped her through a scrum of photographers and into a vehicle that took her to an immigration facility.
""I think everybody who will be released will be very happy, especially when she wants to meet the family, but I don't know about the next plan,"" said Sienny Karmana, Connor's lawyer. 
Karmana added that Connor would return to Australia on Friday.
During a trial that attracted significant attention in Indonesia and Australia, the defendants both denied murder and said a fight broke out over Connor's missing purse.

Connor had testified that she saw Taylor beating policeman Wayan Sudarsa, but the judge ruled that she had held the victim down while he was being struck.

He referred to talk of another summit before the U.S. presidential election in November in which Trump is seeking a second term.
""It’s now July.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisian Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh stepped down on Wednesday, plunging the country into a political crisis as it tries to weather the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Fakhfakh presented his resignation to President Kais Saied, a government statement said. Political sources told Reuters Saied had asked him to do so as momentum grew in parliament to oust the prime minister over an alleged conflict of interest. 
Saied must now choose a new candidate for prime minister, but parliament is deeply fragmented among rival parties and a failure to build another coalition would trigger an election. 
The collapse of Fakhfakh's government less than five months after it was formed will further delay urgent economic reforms and complicate efforts to handle any new surge in coronavirus cases after Tunisia brought a first wave under control. 
Western countries have hailed Tunisia for its comparatively successful transition to democracy since the 2011 revolution that ended decades of autocratic rule despite periodic crises, but many Tunisians are deeply frustrated. 
Since the revolution, the economy has stagnated, living standards have declined and public services have decayed while political parties often seemed more focused on staying in office than addressing a long list of problems. 
Deep ideological splits in Fakhfakh's government had made it harder to agree on the urgent economic reforms demanded by foreign lenders to bring Tunisia's fiscal deficit and public debt into a more sustainable trajectory. 
The pandemic has worsened those problems. Tunisia now expects the economy to shrink by 6.5% this year and forecasts a deficit equivalent to 7% of gross domestic product. It has asked four countries to delay debt repayments. 
In poorer parts of the country, protests have been building to demand more jobs and state aid to help them cope with the economic fallout, sometimes blockading exports by state industries. 
Mouna Kariem, a law professor, said Saied would now have 10 days to name a new candidate for prime minister who would have a month to form a government. 
The last parliamentary election in October led to a chamber in which no party held more than a quarter of the seats, complicating efforts to form a stable government. 
The biggest party, the moderate Islamist Ennahda, failed in its own attempt to build a coalition late last year and though it joined Fakhfakh's government it has since been tussling for influence with President Saied. 
Fakhfakh's resignation came as Ennahda sought signatures for a vote of no confidence in the government. If that process had succeeded then it would have given Ennahda, rather than Saied, the right to nominate a new prime minister. 
Ennahda's push for a confidence vote was triggered by a report that Fakhfakh was guilty of a conflict of interest by owning shares in companies that had received state contracts. He denies any wrongdoing. 

Two opposition parties, media mogul Nabil Karoui's Heart of Tunisia and the conservative Karama, joined Ennahda in seeking the vote of confidence in Fakhfakh. By the time he had resigned, they had gathered 105 of the 109 signatures needed to trigger the vote.

(Reuters) - More than 100 U.S. diplomats and family members flew to China on Wednesday, according to internal State Department emails, as Washington pressed ahead with its plan to restaff its diplomatic mission at a time of heightened tensions between the world's two largest economies.
A chartered commercial aircraft left Dulles airport outside Washington for the South Korean capital, Seoul, where passengers would transfer to another aircraft outfitted for medical operations before flying to the Chinese city of Guangzhou.
The flight, only the second one of many required to return more than 1,200 U.S. diplomats with their families, was the first since talks between Washington and Beijing hit an impasse two weeks ago over conditions China wanted to impose on the Americans, prompting the State Department to postpone flights tentatively scheduled for the first 10 days of July.
The United States is working to fully restaff its mission in China, one of its largest in the world, which was evacuated in February because of the coronavirus outbreak. A Department email dated Wednesday and viewed by Reuters said more flights were being arranged to take diplomats back.
""For those still waiting to return, we are in the process of getting approvals from the Department for subsequent flights to Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Tianjin/Beijing in the coming weeks.   Due to PRC regulations, these flights will be limited to a maximum of 120 passengers,"" it said.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have deteriorated to their lowest level in decades over issues including China's handling of the pandemic, bilateral trade and a new security law for Hong Kong.
Washington and Beijing have been negotiating for weeks over the terms of how to bring U.S. diplomats back and the top issues of disagreement have been testing and quarantine procedures for diplomats and families as well the frequency of flights and how many one journey can bring back.
The State Department internally told its staff that it had received assurances from Chinese authorities that parents would not be separated from their children if they tested positive. 
But disagreements over other issues, such as testing being conducted in Chinese labs, have persisted. 

Diplomats say agreeing to be tested contravenes the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The internal email said that on arrival in China, adults and children of all ages should be prepared to undergo a nasal and/or throat swab COVID-19 test.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Once a rising star of Mexican politics, Emilio Lozoya could trigger a precipitous fall from grace of former colleagues if he returns to spill the beans on alleged corruption inside the government of the country's last president, Enrique Pena Nieto.
Lozoya, who is being extradited from Spain to Mexico, is expected home this week to face a series of corruption charges dating back to his 2012-16 tenure at the helm of struggling Mexican state oil company Petroleos Mexicanos, known as Pemex.
Once vaunted as a possible foreign minister, the 45-year-old Lozoya has become a key piece in President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's plan to expose corruption in and around the government he took over from Pena Nieto in December 2018.
Scion of a political family and former grandee of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Lozoya has agreed to inform Mexican authorities about what went on during the government of Pena Nieto, Lopez Obrador told reporters this week.
""We're going to get this all out and make it public,"" the president told a regular news conference on Monday.
Lopez Obrador has identified corruption as the source of Mexico's principal ills, from surging gang violence to widespread poverty and chronic inequality and weak growth. 
Aside from making the eradication of corruption his top objective, the president has used corruption to keep a steady barrage of fire trained on the opposition, which hopes to recapture the lower house of Congress in mid-term elections next year.
Lozoya, whom Mexican prosecutors accuse of money laundering and taking bribes from scandal-hit Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, was one of the closest aides to Pena Nieto, who governed Mexico for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
POLITICAL CALCULUS
According to prosecutors, in March 2012 Lozoya solicited and obtained funds from Odebrecht for the PRI presidential campaign, which Pena Nieto won that July, defeating Lopez Obrador.
In exchange, Lozoya awarded contracts to the Brazilian firm as boss of Pemex and also took money in exchange for contracts from Mexican steelmaker Altos Hornos de Mexico, they contend. Lozoya used that money to purchase properties, they say.
Odebrecht has admitted paying bribes in Mexico. The bosses of Altos Hornos have denied wrongdoing. 
Additionally, prosecutors contend that while at Pemex, Lozoya spent some $450 million renovating and acquiring an out-of-service fertilizer plant from Altos Hornos de Mexico.
Lozoya, who was arrested in the southern Spanish city of Malaga in February, has denied any wrongdoing. 
Lawyers for Lozoya, a onetime director and head of Latin America for the World Economic Forum, have said he always acted under the orders of president Pena Nieto.
Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied any allegations of wrongdoing, as has the former president's influential finance minister, Luis Videgaray, who is now based in the United States.
Mexican media have been awash with speculation that Lozoya will make damaging revelations about his former colleagues in order to reduce any possible criminal sentence.
Lopez Obrador has been reluctant to point the finger directly at Pena Nieto. But the veteran leftist has suggested that Pena Nieto's landmark 2013-14 liberalization of the energy market, which Lopez Obrador strongly opposed, was tainted by corruption.
The reform ended Pemex's 75-year state monopoly on oil production and exploration, and was backed by much of the opposition, in particular the center-right National Action Party (PAN), which remains the strongest opposition force.
Revelations damaging to the PAN could hurt the party's chances in the next year's mid-term elections.

""My impression is the president aims to use Lozoya to hit the PAN,"" said Agustin Basave, a former leader of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. ""He wants to weaken the opposition party that's in the best shape.""

Lopez Obrador has identified corruption as the source of Mexico's principal ills, from surging gang violence to widespread poverty and chronic inequality and weak growth. 
Aside from making the eradication of corruption his top objective, the president has used corruption to keep a steady barrage of fire trained on the opposition, which hopes to recapture the lower house of Congress in mid-term elections next year.
Lozoya, whom Mexican prosecutors accuse of money laundering and taking bribes from scandal-hit Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, was one of the closest aides to Pena Nieto, who governed Mexico for the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
POLITICAL CALCULUS
According to prosecutors, in March 2012 Lozoya solicited and obtained funds from Odebrecht for the PRI presidential campaign, which Pena Nieto won that July, defeating Lopez Obrador.
In exchange, Lozoya awarded contracts to the Brazilian firm as boss of Pemex and also took money in exchange for contracts from Mexican steelmaker Altos Hornos de Mexico, they contend. Lozoya used that money to purchase properties, they say.
Odebrecht has admitted paying bribes in Mexico. The bosses of Altos Hornos have denied wrongdoing. 
Additionally, prosecutors contend that while at Pemex, Lozoya spent some $450 million renovating and acquiring an out-of-service fertilizer plant from Altos Hornos de Mexico.
Lozoya, who was arrested in the southern Spanish city of Malaga in February, has denied any wrongdoing. 
Lawyers for Lozoya, a onetime director and head of Latin America for the World Economic Forum, have said he always acted under the orders of president Pena Nieto.
Pena Nieto has repeatedly denied any allegations of wrongdoing, as has the former president's influential finance minister, Luis Videgaray, who is now based in the United States.
Mexican media have been awash with speculation that Lozoya will make damaging revelations about his former colleagues in order to reduce any possible criminal sentence.
Lopez Obrador has been reluctant to point the finger directly at Pena Nieto. But the veteran leftist has suggested that Pena Nieto's landmark 2013-14 liberalization of the energy market, which Lopez Obrador strongly opposed, was tainted by corruption.
The reform ended Pemex's 75-year state monopoly on oil production and exploration, and was backed by much of the opposition, in particular the center-right National Action Party (PAN), which remains the strongest opposition force.
Revelations damaging to the PAN could hurt the party's chances in the next year's mid-term elections.

""My impression is the president aims to use Lozoya to hit the PAN,"" said Agustin Basave, a former leader of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. ""He wants to weaken the opposition party that's in the best shape.""

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra undertook a major government reshuffle on Wednesday, replacing more than half his cabinet as his popularity has taken a hit due to the harsh economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and a lengthy lockdown.
Vizcarra installed lawyer Pedro Cateriano as prime minister to lead the cabinet, and changed up the key energy and mining ministry, appointing economist Rafael Belaunde. The president kept his rock-star economy minister María Antonieta Alva.
Peru, the world's no. 2 copper producer, has been battered by the COVID-19 outbreak, with the fifth highest number of cases in the world despite a strict lockdown imposed in March. The economy has crashed as mining output sank.
In a sign of the unusual times, one of the new ministers took the oath by video while serving a quarantine at home after testing positive for COVID-19.
The country's health minister, who came under fire over his handling of the pandemic, was also ousted, replaced by the surgeon Pilar Mazzetti, who held the same position several years ago and had been leading the COVID-19 Operations Command.
""In this new stage.... we will deepen the measures to accelerate the economic recovery and return Peru to the path of growth,"" Vizcarra said in a speech at the Government Palace.
The Andean country earlier announced its economy contracted by 32.75% in May from a year earlier, the third straight monthly drop as Peru heads for a deep contraction this year.
Cateriano, the new prime minister, made a pledge on social media before taking office: ""I offer: sweat, honesty and democratic conduct for a more just and free Peru."" 

Analysts say the experienced, if confrontational cabinet chief will give the government breathing room in the face of criticism, and after Vizcarra's popularity has fallen to a still decent 65% from a peak of 87% in March.

About 500 demonstrators, many of whom wore face masks branded with the word ""no"", chanted calls for Putin to resign and held up banners against the reforms. 
Police surrounded them and began making arrests late in the evening after participants started a march down one of the city's main boulevards, with officers in riot gear forcefully rounding up protesters and placing them in vans.
Over a hundred people were detained, according to the rights monitoring group OVD-info. There was no immediate confirmation from police or the government on numbers of arrests. 
A vote earlier this month amended Russia's constitution, handing Putin the right to run for two more presidential terms, an outcome the Kremlin described as a triumph.
Opposition activists say the vote was illegitimate and that it is time for Putin, who has ruled Russia for over two decades as president or prime minister, to step down.
""I came here to sign the petition against the constitutional reforms because I am a nationalist,"" said one 40-year old man in a black t-shirt as protesters chanted ""Putin is a thief"".
Fourteen-year old Vasilisa said she also signed the petition because Putin ""is to blame for the poverty in our country"".
""Gay people are killed here, women are beaten up here, and no one is ever held accountable,"" she said. 
Two Russian activists involved in the campaign against the constitutional reforms were detained last week and the homes of five others were searched, ahead of the scheduled protest, which had not been sanctioned by authorities.

Mass gatherings are banned in the capital because of COVID-19 restrictions. Even in normal times, protests of more than one person require the authorities' advance consent.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 03:36PM ET</span>","Ethiopia dam reservoir filling as talks with Egypt, Sudan stall","By Dawit Endeshaw
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The reservoir behind the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is filling, its water minister said on Wednesday, a day after talks with Sudan and Egypt on the giant Blue Nile hydroelectric project stalled. 
Sudan and Egypt both fear the $4 billion dam could lead to water shortages in their own nations.
""The construction of the dam and the filling of the water go hand in hand,"" Ethiopian Water Minister Seleshi Bekele said in televised comments, a transcript of which was provided to Reuters by his office. ""The filling of the dam doesn't need to wait until the completion of the dam.""
The water level had increased from 525 metres to 560 metres, he said. 
The comments by Seleshi did not address whether Ethiopia had closed the gates of the dam. The area has also seen recent heavy rainfall.
""My understanding of his statement is that they have not closed the outlets,"" said Dina Mufti, a spokesman for the foreign ministry.
Seleshi had tweeted earlier in the day: ""The inflow into the reservoir due to heavy rainfall and runoff exceeded the outflow and created natural pooling. This continues until overflow is triggered soon.""
The minister, his spokesman, and the spokeswoman for the prime minister's office did not return calls seeking clarification.
The project has raised concerns in Egypt that already limited Nile waters, which its 100 million people depend on heavily, will be further restricted. The Blue Nile is a tributary of the Nile from which Egypt gets 90% of its fresh water.
Egypt asked Ethiopia for urgent clarification on whether it had started filling the reservoir, the foreign ministry said.
On Tuesday, talks between the three nations to regulate the flow of water from the dam failed to reach agreement.
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Secretary General Antonio Guterres had urged the three countries to “seize the opportunity in the coming days to bridge remaining differences and reach a mutually beneficial agreement for their peoples”. 
The dam, when finished, will have an installed capacity of 6,450 megawatts - more than doubling Ethiopia's existing capacity - and is the centrepiece of the country's bid to become Africa's biggest power exporter. 
The dam is being built about 15 km (9 miles) from the border with Sudan. Sudan and Egypt have sought a legally binding agreement before the dam is filled.
Sudan's Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources said it was prompted to investigate after satellite images appeared to show the reservoir filling.
""It was evident from the flow meters in the al-Deim border station with Ethiopia that there is a retreat in the water levels, equivalent to 90 million cubic meters per day, confirming the closure of the gates of the Renaissance Dam,"" it said in a statement.

Sudan rejects any unilateral actions taken by any party as negotiating efforts continue, it said.

(Reuters) - George Floyd's family sued Minneapolis and four police officers for wrongful death on Wednesday, alleging police violated their own rules and U.S. Justice Department warnings by kneeling on the neck of the handcuffed Black man for nearly nine minutes.
Civil rights attorney Ben Crump filed the suit seeking monetary damages on behalf of Floyd's children and siblings with the U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, calling the case ""the tipping point for policing in America.""
""It was the knee of the entire Minneapolis Police Department on the neck of George Floyd that killed him,"" Crump said. ""The city of Minneapolis has a history of policies and procedures and deliberate indifference when it comes the treatment of arrestees, especially Black men.""
Floyd, 46, whose May 25 arrest was captured on video, pleaded for his life and said he could not breathe as a white officer knelt on his neck while other officers held him down or kept disturbed witnesses from intervening.
His death triggered nationwide street protests against police brutality and renewed the American debate about racism in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic and months away from the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Coincidentally, new video emerged on Wednesday showing the entire time the officer is kneeling on Floyd's neck and Floyd's last words, ""Man, I can't breathe,"" CNN reported.
Minneapolis interim City Attorney Erik Nilsson called Floyd's death a ""tragedy"" in a statement, saying the city was reviewing the 40-page lawsuit and would respond later.
The suit, seeking an unspecified amount in damages, names as defendants the city of Minneapolis and four officers who participated in his arrest on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store. 
Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was arrested four days later. He has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder and manslaughter.
Three other officers at the scene, J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, have been charged with aiding and abetting.
Though the arrest has been widely seen through video taken by witnesses and security cameras, new images emerged Wednesday from body cameras worn by Lane and Kueng.

Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill allowed news organizations to view the two videos, in which Floyd is heard crying and pleading with the officers before he was pulled from a car and handcuffed, CNN reported.

While the government of President Ivan Duque declared a national quarantine in late March, illegal armed groups have imposed harsher measures in at least 11 of the Andean country's 32 provinces, where they have taken advantage of authorities' absence to subdue the civilian population and control movement, HRW said. 
""These groups impose draconian rules to control coronavirus, terrorizing civilians with threats, attacks and cold-blooded executions of those who don't comply,"" HRW director Jose Miguel Vivanco said in a virtual press conference. 
Left-wing National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and dissident former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who rejected a 2016 peace deal, were among those responsible, Vivanco said.
He also singled out criminal organizations such as the Clan del Golfo, saying they were looking to control civilians and tighten their hold over illegal mining, drug trafficking and other activities.
According to HRW's report, nine people have been killed by such groups, who use pamphlets and WhatsApp messages to broadcast rules including lockdowns and restrictions of movement for people, cars and boats in provinces like Cordoba, Cauca, Guaviare, Narino and Putumayo. 
In one case, three people were killed by FARC dissidents on April 26, HRW said. The group told other members of the community they were executed for not following quarantine measures the group had imposed.
""The brutal and draconian punishments armed groups impose to halt the spread of COVID-19 expose people in remote and poor communities across Colombia to being attacked or killed if they leave their houses,"" Vivanco said. 
""The government must step up its efforts to protect these communities, to guarantee their access to food and water, and protect them from the effects of COVID-19,"" he added.

RED RIVER, N.M. (Reuters) - In the New Mexico mountain resort of Red River, tourists from Texas stroll along Main Street, most disregarding Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham's orders they quarantine and wear masks.
It's the same in other New Mexican tourist towns such as Taos and Santa Fe, except nearly all their visitors wear face coverings - surrounded by signs warning of fines if they don't.
Like governors in at least 15 states, Democrat Lujan Grisham has ordered out-of-state tourists to self-isolate, citing data that about one in 10 of New Mexico's spiking COVID-19 cases comes from visitors.
Enforcing the orders is proving difficult, given the lack of a national plan, police reluctance to take on the massive task, and Americans' penchant for driving hundreds or thousands of miles to vacation, even in a pandemic.
A U.S. road trip this summer means navigating through a patchwork of quarantine regulations across various states, most of them voluntary.
New York, New Jersey and Connecticut require travelers from 19 states with high COVID-19 infection rates to self-quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. New York imposes fines.
Hard-hit Florida requires travelers from those three states to self-isolate for 14 days whether arriving by plane or car, or face a $500 fine. 
Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and Vermont all have varying self-isolation rules. 
'TAKING AWAY OUR LIBERTY'
New Mexico published newspaper ads in neighboring Arizona and Texas, states respectively reporting 27% and 18% positive coronavirus test rates, urging their residents not to visit. Health experts consider a 5% rate to be worrisome.
But tourists keep coming.
""I think it's bullshit. They're saying the masks should work, so why should you be quarantined?"" said Chris Fry, 59, a feed company manager from Dimmitt, Texas, staying in his cabin near Red River and stopping in town for ice before going fishing.
A 45-minute drive south in Taos Plaza, Louisiana tourist Christy Brasiel was frustrated the historic Native American community was closed to visitors and compared Lujan Grisham's rules to ""communism or socialism."" 
""They're taking away our liberty,"" said Brasiel, 49, staying in an Airbnb rental to avoid her voluntary quarantine order enforced by local hotels that turn away out-of-state visitors.
As in cities across New Mexico, police in Red River have yet to issue citations for non-compliance to COVID-19 rules, said Mayor Linda Calhoun, a Republican, adding that she is encouraging businesses to require masks.
""We live off of tourists, that's all we have, so it's very difficult for us to enforce the order,"" Calhoun said of the quarantine rule in her town nicknamed ""Little Texas"" for the number of visitors from that state.
Many locals in Taos County, where COVID-19 cases have doubled in the last month, are dismayed by the rule breaking.
""It doesn't make any sense to be so selfish,"" said lawyer Maureen Moore, 67.
""WE DON'T WANT YOU HERE""
Only three weeks ago, as outbreaks raged across the U.S. Sunbelt, New Mexico reported stable or declining daily cases. 
A poor state with limited hospital capacity, New Mexico used early, tough restrictions to curb the pandemic. 
But with its positive test rate rising above 4%, Lujan Grisham has scolded New Mexicans for letting down their guard since she eased restrictions on June 1, and on Monday reclosed indoor restaurant dining.
On a shortlist as a running mate to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Lujan Grisham has also rounded on tourism, the state's second-largest industry.
""We don't want you here now,"" she told potential visitors in a July 9 press briefing, taking special aim at Texans. ""I want you to stay in Texas.""
Lujan Grisham said New Mexico State Police would ""aggressively"" enforce her quarantine and mask orders. The force has handed out 13 verbal warnings for mask violations but none for quarantine non-compliance, a spokeswoman said on Monday.
The rules are piling pandemic pain on businesses in the state. Standing outside his Red River supermarket, business owner Ted Calhoun said Lujan Grisham had gone too far.

""Ordering visitors to do a 14-day quarantine is killing the tourist industry of New Mexico,"" said Calhoun, the mayor's husband.

The Philippines this week recorded Southeast Asia's biggest daily jump in coronavirus deaths and saw hospital occupancy grow sharply, after a tripling of infections since a tough lockdown was eased on June 1 to allow more movement and commerce.
""It was clear during our discussion that if the spread of the virus in Manila will not slow, it is possible that stricter quarantine measures would be reimposed after two weeks,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque said late on Wednesday.
Confirmed cases in the capital region have more than doubled to 29,015 since June.
Schools are to remain closed, operations of shopping malls and dine-in eateries limited, mass gatherings banned, social distancing enforced on public transport, and children and the elderly urged to stay at home.
Under tighter regulations in force from mid-March to the end of May, public transport was barred, working from home instituted where possible, and only one person per household allowed out for essential goods.
Meanwhile, Duterte eased lockdown measures in Cebu from July 16 after the central city recorded a decline in the number of confirmed cases, although it still accounted for 10% of the 58,850 total infections in the country.
Many parts of Asia, the region first hit by the coronavirus that emerged in China late last year, are pausing the reopening of their economies - some after winning praise for their initial responses to the outbreak.
Navotas, a city of 250,000 in the National Capital Region surrounding Manila, will from July 16 return to lockdown after cases tripled since June, its mayor said this week.
Health Secretary Francisco Duque said earlier on Wednesday the government had ""successfully flattened the curve since April"" because COVID-19 cases were growing slower, with the rate of doubling of infections now at 8.28 days from 4.8 days in May.

To prevent wider transmission, the government said it would use police to carry out house-to-house searches for patients so they can be isolated and brought to quarantine facilities where they can be properly managed.

Macron, who was strolling in Paris' Tuileries Garden with his wife Brigitte after Tuesday's annual parade and presidential address, spent several minutes engaging the ""yellow vest"" protesters on subjects from police to pension reform.
Nervous bodyguards watched on. 
""It's a holiday, I'm taking a walk, I'm being respectful ... Be cool, don't shout,"" said Macron, who is struggling to lift low approval ratings in the wake of the coronavirus crisis.
Some of the protesters chanted for him to resign and one repeatedly berated him over police on motorbikes used to control the anti-government ""yellow vest"" protesters who began taking to the streets from late 2018.
""I wish you a happy July 14th. You can protest, it's a democracy. Have a good day,"" added Macron, noting that some protests had turned violent.
""I hear you, I've heard what you're asking for, but I'm asking a commitment from you, which is also to be cool - no violence, no stupid stuff, none. If not, we won't get through this.""
Some people questioned Macron's judgement going out in public on a day when demonstrations were expected. 
""It was a verbal confrontation that turned out to be nothing serious, but it could have taken on different proportions,"" conservative lawmaker Christian Jacob said on RTL radio.
Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Wednesday that Macron's security had not been compromised.

Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai spoke after meeting President Michel Aoun, an ally of the heavily armed Hezbollah, which has supported Iran in its power struggle with Sunni-led Arab Gulf states in the region.
Lebanon is in the throes of an acute financial crisis seen as the worst threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war. The crisis is rooted in decades of state corruption and bad governance by the sectarian ruling elite.
Hezbollah's opponents say it is to blame because its alliance with Iran has led Gulf Arabs who once supported Lebanon to steer clear, closing off an important source of aid.
In his last two sermons, Rai made comments that were widely interpreted as criticism of both Hezbollah and its ally Aoun. On Wednesday, Rai said his comments had been misunderstood
Rai holds sway in Lebanon as head of the Maronite church, from which the head of state must be drawn under sectarian power-sharing arrangements.
""We will not be saved from the state we are in today - the economic problem, poverty and hunger - other than through neutrality,"" Rai said told reporters after the meeting.
Lebanon should not get into ""political or military struggles or alliances"" in the Arab world. 
Asked if he was speaking about Hezbollah, he said: ""On the contrary, I told the president I mean everyone"".

Rai also warned that poverty and unemployment were leaving the door open for foreign interference in Lebanon, without giving details.

BRISTOL, England (Reuters) - A sculpture of a Black protester with her fist raised in the air has been erected in a stealthy night-time operation in place of a 17th Century English slave trader whose statue was toppled by anti-racism demonstrators in the port city of Bristol.
Edward Colston, who made a fortune from trading in West African slaves, was pulled down and thrown in the harbour of the city in southwest England last month by protesters demonstrating in the wake of the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
The sculpture of Jen Reid, who was photographed standing on the plinth of Colston's statue just after it was pulled down, was put up in the early hours of Wednesday by a team directed by artist Marc Quinn, the Guardian newspaper reported.
""Resident Jen Reid and I have unveiled a new temporary, public installation, ‘A Surge of Power (Jen Reid) 2020’, on top of Edward Colston’s empty plinth in Bristol, England,"" Quinn said on Instagram beside a photograph of the new work.
Quinn is best known for his statue of pregnant disabled woman Alison Lapper in London's Trafalgar Square.
""I think it's something the people of Bristol really appreciate seeing,"" Reid told the BBC.
The mayor of Bristol said the future of what should replace Colston should be decided by the people of Bristol, though he said the sculpture of Reid was installed by a London-based artist and no permission was given for it.
But some Bristol residents praised the move.
""There is an element of poetic justice about it,"" said David Hayes, a 42-year-old resident of the city.
""Replacing it with a protester who stood on the plinth at the time - it's a very powerful image and it's been brilliantly done, I think. So, yeah, hopefully it might stay.""

Last month, Bristol said Colston's statue, now retrieved from the water, would be exhibited in a museum and displayed alongside Black Lives Matter placards from the recent protest so the 300-year story of slavery and the fight for racial equality could be better understood.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Oliver Taylor, a student at England's University of Birmingham, is a twenty-something with brown eyes, light stubble, and a slightly stiff smile.
Online profiles describe him as a coffee lover and politics junkie who was raised in a traditional Jewish home. His half dozen freelance editorials and blog posts reveal an active interest in anti-Semitism and Jewish affairs, with bylines in the Jerusalem Post and the Times of Israel.
The catch? Oliver Taylor seems to be an elaborate fiction. 
His university says it has no record of him. He has no obvious online footprint beyond an account on the question-and-answer site Quora, where he was active for two days in March. Two newspapers that published his work say they have tried and failed to confirm his identity. And experts in deceptive imagery used state-of-the-art forensic analysis programs to determine that Taylor's profile photo is a hyper-realistic forgery - a ""deepfake.""
Who is behind Taylor isn't known to Reuters. Calls to the U.K. phone number he supplied to editors drew an automated error message and he didn't respond to messages left at the Gmail address he used for correspondence.
Reuters was alerted to Taylor by London academic Mazen Masri, who drew international attention in late 2018 when he helped launch an Israeli lawsuit against the surveillance company NSO on behalf of alleged Mexican victims of the company's phone hacking technology.
In an article in U.S. Jewish newspaper The Algemeiner, Taylor had accused Masri and his wife, Palestinian rights campaigner Ryvka Barnard, of being ""known terrorist sympathizers.""
Masri and Barnard were taken aback by the allegation, which they deny. But they were also baffled as to why a university student would single them out. Masri said he pulled up Taylor's profile photo. He couldn't put his finger on it, he said, but something about the young man's face ""seemed off.""    
Six experts interviewed by Reuters say the image has the characteristics of a deepfake.
""The distortion and inconsistencies in the background are a tell-tale sign of a synthesized image, as are a few glitches around his neck and collar,"" said digital image forensics pioneer Hany Farid, who teaches at the University of California, Berkeley.  
Artist Mario Klingemann, who regularly uses deepfakes in his work, said the photo ""has all the hallmarks."" 
""I'm 100 percent sure,"" he said. 
(For a guide to deepfakes, click https://tmsnrt.rs/32eLhsR)
'A VENTRILOQUIST'S DUMMY'
The Taylor persona is a rare in-the-wild example of a phenomenon that has emerged as a key anxiety of the digital age: The marriage of deepfakes and disinformation.         
The threat is drawing increasing concern in Washington and Silicon Valley. Last year House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff warned that computer-generated video could ""turn a world leader into a ventriloquist's dummy."" Last month Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) announced the conclusion of its Deepfake Detection Challenge - a competition intended to help researchers automatically identify falsified footage. Last week online publication The Daily Beast revealed a network of deepfake journalists - part of a larger group of bogus personas seeding propaganda online.
Deepfakes like Taylor are dangerous because they can help build ""a totally untraceable identity,"" said Dan Brahmy, whose Israel-based startup Cyabra specializes in detecting such images.
Brahmy said investigators chasing the origin of such photos are left ""searching for a needle in a haystack – except the needle doesn't exist.""
Taylor appears to have had no online presence until he started writing articles in late December. The University of Birmingham said in a statement it could not find ""any record of this individual using these details."" Editors at the Jerusalem Post and The Algemeiner say they published Taylor after he pitched them stories cold over email. He didn't ask for payment, they said, and they didn't take aggressive steps to vet his identity.
""We're not a counterintelligence operation,"" Algemeiner Editor-in-chief Dovid Efune said, although he noted that the paper had introduced new safeguards since.
After Reuters began asking about Taylor, The Algemeiner and the Times of Israel deleted his work. The Jerusalem Post removed Taylor's article after Reuters published this story. Taylor emailed the Times of Israel and Algemeiner protesting the deletions, but Times of Israel Opinion Editor Miriam Herschlag said she rebuffed him after he failed to prove his identity. Efune said he didn't respond to Taylor's messages.
Arutz Sheva has kept Taylor's articles online, although it removed the ""terrorist sympathizers"" reference following a complaint from Masri and Barnard. Editor Yoni Kempinski said only that ""in many cases"" news outlets ""use pseudonyms to byline opinion articles."" Kempinski declined to elaborate or say whether he considered Taylor a pseudonym.
Oliver Taylor's articles drew minimal engagement on social media, but the Times of Israel's Herschlag said they were still dangerous - not only because they could distort the public discourse but also because they risked making people in her position less willing to take chances on unknown writers.

""Absolutely we need to screen out impostors and up our defenses,"" she said. ""But I don't want to set up these barriers that prevent new voices from being heard.""

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's government has been rocked by the novel coronavirus, with the president and at least seven of her Cabinet ministers testing positive, straining the interim leadership and casting a shadow over a slated election rerun in under two months.
Conservative caretaker President Jeanine Anez, who is also a candidate in the planned Sept. 6 ballot, tested positive for the virus last week, though she said she was doing well and would continue to work from isolation. 
The ministers for economy, foreign affairs, mining, health, hydrocarbons and the presidency are also infected, the most recent confirmed on Tuesday. Others include Senate leader Eva Copa, who has said she was stable, and dozens of junior officials.
""I am afraid to be here, my body trembles because the contagion is circulating everywhere,"" Sergio Choque, the leader of the Chamber of Deputies, told lawmakers on Tuesday, adding that he had tested negative, ""thank God.""
""I feel sorry for each one of you who are risking your life today and the days before.""
Latin America has become the epicenter for the virus with around a quarter of global cases and deaths despite only having around 8% of the world's population. Cases and fatalities are still rising fast.
A number of other political leaders in the region, including Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and Venezuelan socialist party leader Diosdado Cabello have also tested positive.
In Bolivia, confirmed cases have topped 50,000, with the lowland city of Santa Cruz the hardest hit. The death toll stands near 1,900. 
ELECTION DELAYS?
The spread of the virus through Bolivia's government has rekindled questions about the coming election, a delayed rerun of a fraught poll last year which sparked widespread protests and led to the resignation of long-term leftist leader Evo Morales.
Anez took power in a political vacuum, pledging to hold quick new elections to help calm deadly clashes that had broken out around the country. She later said she would run herself, sparking criticism after she had previously ruled herself out.
The spike in coronavirus cases in Bolivia, a landlocked nation of some 11.5 million people, has overwhelmed some hospitals, sparked protests from medical workers and, in one case in the city of Cochabamba, seen a body left lying in the street.
""We must postpone the elections,"" former President and rival candidate Jorge ""Tuto"" Quiroga said in a video statement, adding that a delay was needed to ensure voter participation and avoid contagion.
Morales' Movement for Socialism (MAS) party, whose candidate Luis Arce leads in opinion polls, wants the vote to go ahead, while the electoral tribunal has stuck by plans for a September election.
Bolivians themselves had mixed views on election plans.
La Paz resident Alejo Calle said that while people needed to be careful, it was important to take part in the elections and that he'd seen other countries move ahead with votes.

""I do not agree with going to vote in the election because of the pandemic,"" said Aracely Quiroz, also from the highland city. ""Now it is more dangerous than before, now there are more infections than at the beginning.""

Approximately 10 parliamentarians who were seeking to impeach the president, and rally other members of the 290 seat body to their side, have backed down, Tasnim reported. 
One MP quoted by Tasnim said that the motion had been dropped after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the country, had expressed support for the government.
Iranians’ daily struggle to make ends meet has become harder since the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018, and the economy has been further damaged by rising inflation, growing unemployment, a slump in the rial and the coronavirus crisis.
First elected in a landslide in 2013 and re-elected in 2017, Rouhani opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with six major powers that led to a 2015 nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to curb its sensitive nuclear work in return for the easing of sanctions.

But hardliners opposed to the West were always lukewarm about the agreement, and they fiercely criticised Rouhani when U.S. President Donald Trump quit the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have choked Iran’s vital oil exports.

The Houthi health ministry spokesman said air raids by a Saudi-led coalition hit residential houses in the al-Hazm district, killing nine people including two children and two women. Two residents told Reuters seven people had been killed.
Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki told Reuters the reports will be investigated: ""We take this report very seriously and it will be fully investigated as all reports of this nature are, using an internationally approved, independent process.""
The alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 soon after the Iran-aligned Houthi movement ousted the Saudi-backed government from power in the capital Sanaa.
Violence has picked up since the expiry in late May of a temporary ceasefire prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, with the Houthis repeatedly staging missile and drone attacks on Saudi cities and the coalition retaliating with air strikes.
Earlier this week the Houthis launched missiles and drones at Saudi border cities in what they called a response to air strikes that killed 10 civilians in the Hajjah region. The coalition later said it would investigate the matter.
In June, an air strike killed at least 12 people, including four children, in Saada province, according to the Houthis and a U.N. official. The coalition said it had struck a vehicle carrying armed Houthi combatants.
The United Nations last month removed the Western-backed coalition from a U.N. blacklist several years after it was first accused of killing and injuring children in Yemen.
The conflict, largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has killed more than 100,000 people and caused what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

671,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 15, 2020 09:00AM ET</span>",Exclusive: 'There will be people in jail': Mexico plans arrests soon in tax crackdown,"By Daina Beth Solomon and Carlos Gonzalez Galvan
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico could issue arrest warrants for suspected tax dodgers by September, a top prosecutor said, as the government ramps up an aggressive campaign to squeeze more revenue out of businesses and end years of what it calls weak tax collection. 
A crackdown aimed at boosting state coffers in the country with the lowest tax take in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has already pushed retailer Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc's Mexico unit and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) bottler Femsa to fork over hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Various criminal complaints over tax violations are pending, Fiscal Prosecutor Carlos Romero said in an interview, without providing details on the number or the targets. ""We were going to have the first arrest orders between April and May, but a pandemic hit us. Right now, I expect it will be between September and October,"" Romero said. ""Between 2020 and 2021, there will be people in jail.""
The tough tactics are possible due to a reform implemented this year that classifies tax fraud over 7.8 million pesos ($343,419) as a serious crime. Under it, suspects can be arrested when charged and held in custody during proceedings. Romero said the timing of arrests would depend on courts and other authorities being able to re-open after Mexico's pandemic lockdown.
The attorney general's office is responsible for filing charges with a judge and carrying out arrests based on complaints filed by the tax prosecutor. If large corporate taxpayers were to come under scrutiny, arrest warrants could target several types of positions, including the person in charge of tax payments, board members, lawyers and accountants, Romero added. Mexico's tax chief, Raquel Buenrostro, said last month that officials had opened ""four or five"" cases of corporate tax fraud this year alone, without disclosing names.Romero said this year his office closed two ""important"" criminal cases against companies, without specifying how they were resolved. In a third instance, a company reached a deal with the government when presented with the risk of criminal charges, he said. 
He did not identify the cases closed or the company that reached an agreement. Walmart de Mexico's corporate affairs director has said she did not have knowledge of a criminal complaint, after the company said it paid 8.08 billion pesos ($359.94 million) in an agreement with the tax authority over the sale of a restaurant chain.
Femsa, which pledged to pay 8.8 billion pesos in taxes, was not presented with a criminal charge, a spokeswoman said. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in June said Japanese automaker  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp was in the process of putting its tax situation in order.

Toyota in Mexico declined to comment on its tax affairs. ""If the president has not made an announcement, it's because there's still no news,"" Romero said.

At Lake Tai on the border of the wealthy coastal provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, water levels hit 4.49 metres on Wednesday, 0.69 metres above the official warning level, according to government data.
Since the flood season began in June, 33 rivers in China have reached their highest levels in history. As well as the Tai, other major lakes have also come under immense pressure, forcing authorities to declare ""red alerts"". 
Though still short of the 4.97-metre record set in 1999, Lake Tai is on the rise. Nearby Shanghai is already taking precautions, opening its sluice gates to discharge excess floodwaters. 
At some spots, the lake had already spilled over the banks, forcing residents to deploy sandbags. Some canals were also close to overflowing. 
""By and large it is pretty severe,"" said Gu Yunqing, a 54-year-old security guard stationed outside an organic farm on one of the islands in the lake. ""Normally it doesn't get like this."" 
But residents said they were not unduly worried about this year's extreme weather, claiming flood defences were far more resilient than they used to be.
""I'm not afraid,"" said Jiang Mingjun, a 42-year-old shopkeeper. ""The flood prevention work has been done really well. There are people coming every day to check the water levels."" 
Gu wasn't expecting the water to get much higher. ""It's going to end soon,"" he said.
With torrential rain still lashing down on most of the Yangtze river basin, flood defences at the Poyang Lake further inland in Jiangxi province are also under pressure. 
Authorities declared another red alert at the lake on Tuesday, with water levels more than 3 metres above normal.

LONDON (Reuters) - Levels of childhood immunisations against dangerous diseases such as measles, tetanus and diphtheria have dropped alarmingly during the COVID-19 pandemic, putting millions of children at risk, United Nations agencies said on Wednesday.
""The avoidable suffering and death caused by children missing out on routine immunisations could be far greater than COVID-19 itself,"" World Health Organization (WHO) director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a joint report with UNICEF.
Three-quarters of the 82 countries that responded to a survey for the report said they had suffered coronavirus-related disruptions to their immunisation programmes as of May 2020. 
Most problems were linked to a lack of sufficient personal protection equipment (PPE) for health workers, travel restrictions, and low health worker staffing levels - all of which led to immunisation services being curbed or shut down. 
At least 30 measles vaccination campaigns have been or are at risk of being cancelled, threatening new outbreaks of the contagious viral disease this year and beyond, the report said.
Measles outbreaks were already on the rise, infecting nearly 10 million people in 2018 and killing 140,000 of them - mostly children, according to WHO data.
For diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis, preliminary data for the first four months of 2020 ""points to a substantial drop"" in the number of children getting all three doses of the DTP vaccine that protects against them, the report said - the first time in 28 years that the world could see a fall in coverage for this routine childhood immunisation.
Data for 2019 showed that nearly 14 million children worldwide missed out on life-saving vaccines. Most of these children live in Africa and are likely to lack access to other health services, the report said.

It said progress on immunisation was already stalling before the new coronavirus emerged and spread around the world, but the pandemic made a bad situation worse.

Jakes was the last Communist-era general-secretary of the party, which held a monopoly on power and over all aspects of public life for four decades, leading it from 1987 until November 1989.
His tenure as party leader overlapped with the perestroika reforms started by Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union. 
But the Czechoslovak Communist leadership was reluctant to follow suit, keeping a stricter line on economic and public life, putting dissidents in jail, suppressing free speech and violently dispersing public protests that started to emerge in the late 1980s.
He resigned under the pressure of the demonstrations during the 1989 uprising that led to the end of Communist rule, and the transition to democracy and market economy.
Despite decades in retirement, he said last year he still considered the events of 1989 as a counter-revolutionary coup to destroy socialism, Czech Radio reported.
""Perestroika opened the room for unbound openness. Everybody said whatever they wanted, criticised what they wanted, and instead of unity, this led to ruptures,"" he had also told Russia's gazeta.ru in 2017.
Coming from a poor family, he joined the party after World War Two in 1945. He rose through the ranks in the 1960s and through purges following the 1968 Soviet invasion that crushed efforts for a more liberal form of socialist rule. 
Jakes was later put on trial for treason for supporting the Soviet invasion of then-Czechoslovakia, but was eventually acquitted.
The Czech Communist Party (KSCM), a successor the Czechoslovak party, has won seats in parliament in every election since 1990. Since the last lection in 2017, its votes have backed up a minority government led by Prime Minister Andrej Babis, the first share of power the party has had in the past three decades.

The changes, championed by President Vladimir Putin, were overwhelmingly approved by voters this month in an exercise that opened the door to Putin staying in power until 2036. Critics said the outcome was falsified, something authorities rejected. 
Putin, who has aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church and sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values, has said he will not legalise gay marriage as long as he is in the Kremlin.
Enshrining a de facto ban in the constitution means any potential successors would find it hard to legalise same-sex marriage even if they wanted to.
The draft legislation, which is expected to be swiftly approved by the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, explicitly bans gay marriage and outlaws same sex couples adopting children, something they cannot now do in practice anyway. 
Elena Mizulina, a senator and one of the authors of the legislation, said the marriage and adoption ban would also extend to transgender people, the Interfax news agency reported. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the legislation was part of what he called a formalisation of new laws following the constitutional vote.

RAFAH, Gaza (Reuters) - Palestinian Sameeh Qe'dan is counting down the days until his son is released from an Israeli jail. There are just over three months left of his 16-year sentence, but with family visits from Gaza suspended due to the coronavirus, Qe'dan is worried.
""I am 77 years old now and I am afraid, I am worried that I could die before I see my son or take him into my arms now with coronavirus,"" Qe'dan said.
Frail with old age, he moves slowly around his run-down apartment in Rafah city in southern Gaza. The flaking walls are decorated with posters of the 40-year-old Abdel-Raouf. 
According to his family, Abdel-Raouf was convicted in 2004 of taking part in armed attacks against Israeli troops. The Israel Prison Service (IPS) would not confirm his conviction or sentence, saying it did not comment on the status of individual prisoners. 
Qe'dan used to visit his son in prison in Israel every two months, crossing the heavily-fortified border on trips organised by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC).
When coronavirus cases in Israel began to mount in March, these trips stopped and the authorities suspended or restricted family visits across the entire prison system. According to the IPS, there have been six COVID-19 cases in its prisons.
Family visits are currently limited to one visitor, and not permitted from areas with high infection rates, the IPS said. Visits from East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank resumed in late June, but not yet from Gaza, according to the ICRC. 
The ICRC said Israel suspended visits ""to protect both detainees and their families"", but that it was exploring ways to either resume them or find alternative solutions.
A spike in infections forced Israel to re-impose some restrictions last week. The authorities have reported 371 deaths and over 42,000 coronavirus cases, with around 1,700 new cases recorded on Tuesday.
In Gaza, health officials have reported one death and 72 cases. Anyone entering the strip must undergo a month-long quarantine. Israel has also tightened restrictions on movement from the territory.
There are 5,500 Palestinians in Israeli jails, many of them from the West Bank and East Jerusalem, which Israel captured along with Gaza in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel pulled its troops out of Gaza in 2005 but blockades the territory, citing security concerns from Islamist ruling party Hamas.
Qe'dan keeps a giant calendar to keep track of how much time remains until Adbel-Raouf's planned release.
""Every day at dawn, I cross out a day,"" he said.

Several hundred people took to the streets of the capital Minsk on Tuesday and social media reported protests in other Belarusian cities after the central election commission refused to register the two challengers.
Police said more than 250 people had been detained after rights group Vesna 96 published the names of 250 detainees, and the state investigative committee said it had launched a criminal case against the protest organisers and protesters.
""All video materials posted on the internet are attached to the materials of the criminal case and are currently being studied by investigators,"" the committee said in a statement.
Lukashenko, who has allowed little dissent in his 26-year rule, is all but certain to win the Aug. 9 election though he has faced mass protests this year. 
In central Minsk, protesters periodically broke into applause on Tuesday - a trademark of recent protests. Reuters witnesses saw police blocking off the main streets and detaining protesters.
The European Union delegation to Belarus said the election commission's decision ""undermines the overall integrity and democratic nature of the elections"".
Viktor Babariko, a banker who was detained last month, was excluded from the ballot because of a criminal case against him, the commission said. Valery Tsepkalo, a former ambassador who runs an office park for tech companies, was also rejected, after signatures on a supporting petition were nullified.

The two men had been widely seen as the last candidates with any chance of defeating Lukashenko, who faces growing public frustration over the economy, human rights and his playing down of the COVID-19 pandemic in the former Soviet republic.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The EU's public health body is assessing risks posed by ventilation systems and other settings at workplaces for the transmission of the novel coronavirus through the air, in addition to through droplets, its head said.
The announcement by the European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDP) could show a commitment tackling the potential spread through fine airborne mists known as aerosols, which the World Health Organization (WHO) acknowledged as a possible danger only last week.
While the virus is believed to spread mainly through contaminated droplets, Europe's ECDC has long warned it might also spread through the air in mists. That could pose extra risk in enclosed spaces, especially with poor ventilation, risks that could rise in winter as people spend more time indoors.
Andrea Ammon, who chairs the ECDC, told Reuters there was still no evidence to show what proportion of cases were spread by aerosols rather than droplets, but ""we know both are a possibility"".
Last week, the WHO said the virus could spread through aerosols, although it stopped short of saying this had been confirmed. The global health body had come under pressure from scientists, who wrote a letter calling on it to acknowledge the potential for airborne spread.
Ammon said the ECDC was assessing risks in the workplace, which would be heightened by airborne transmission, after several localised outbreaks in plants throughout Europe, with the most serious in a slaughterhouse in Germany in June.
""We are working on a technical report on occupational settings and risk factors for such outbreaks,"" she said, adding dangers posed by ventilation systems were being assessed.
Many of the social distancing and hygiene guidelines that countries have adopted during the COVID-19 pandemic are based on preventing contact with droplets of saliva or mucous expelled by carriers of the virus when they cough, sneeze or speak. Preventing airborne spread could require other strategies.

Ammon said the ECDC still assumes droplets are the most common vehicle of transmission. She said there was no need at this stage to update the agency's guidance, and reiterated that it was crucial that people continue to respect social distancing rules and wear face masks.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two out of three Americans want to see President Donald Trump's income taxes, and about half believe he has been withholding them for reasons that could hurt him politically, according to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll. 
The July 13-14 poll shows many Americans remain concerned about Trump's finances and potential conflicts of interest with his family business. The survey was conducted after a U.S. Supreme Court ruling over Trump’s financial records last week likely postponed their release to New York City prosecutors until after the Nov. 3 election.
Trump has refused to show the public his personal tax returns for years, bucking a decades-old tradition of financial transparency among presidential contenders. The businessman-turned-politician has routinely questioned the public's interest in his taxes and said he would not release them because they are under audit.
The poll found 66% of adults agreed that Trump ""should release his tax returns from earlier years,"" and 68% said ""Americans have a right to see each presidential candidate's financial records before the election."" 
When asked why the Republican president has not released the records, about half said it was because of reasons that could make it tougher for him to be re-elected. 
According to the poll, 26% said they believe Trump's taxes contain ""incriminating evidence against him,"" and 10% said Trump is ""trying to hide significant financial losses."" Another 16% said they thought Trump does not want to reveal them because he ""does not pay taxes.""
Fourteen percent said they thought Trump simply was pushing back against liberals, and 3% said Trump has not released his taxes because he is too busy dealing with the coronavirus. 
Only 7% said Trump was withholding his taxes because they are being audited.
“This is an issue that was litigated before the voters in 2016 and the American people elected Donald Trump president of the United States,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.
""He released more than 100 pages of financial documents in that election. It’s no secret that President Trump is a wealthy man who was successful in business before giving it up to serve the American people.”
Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, has released several years of financial disclosures and tax returns on his campaign website.
With less than four months to go before the election, Trump trails Biden by 10 percentage points among registered voters in the latest poll.
About 40% of people polled said they approve of Trump's overall job performance, a level that has been consistent over the past year even amid the upheaval of Trump's impeachment, a deadly pandemic and a recession.
Trump's popularity is comparable with his immediate predecessor, Democrat Barack Obama, at about the same point in his presidency. Unlike Trump, Obama consistently drew higher levels of support among registered voters than his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the U.S. It gathered responses from 1,115 American adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 3 percentage points.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Rhinos, lions, buffalo and leopards range against the background of a city skyline in the Nairobi National Park, Africa's only game reserve within a capital city. 
The park has been fenced in on three sides as the city mushroomed around it.
Outside its unfenced southern boundary, the banks of the Mochiriri River are a favoured refuge for breeding lions. Animals often pass through to make their way to larger parks beyond.
But the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) has proposed a 10-year plan to fence land along the southern boundary to reduce conflict between people and animals. 
The idea has many conservationists up in arms and a court hearing on the plan is scheduled on Wednesday.
""This is the lifeline of this park,"" said Reinhard Nyandire, a conservationist working with the Friends of Nairobi National Park, gesturing to the open pastures behind him. 
""When they fence the park, you cut them (the animals) off,"" he said.
The volunteer group is dedicated to helping KWS keep the lands around the park open. 
The KWS director general and spokesmen did not respond to requests to discuss the plan.
Commercial buildings are encroaching on the park's land and in 2018, a six-km railway bridge was built through it. Sewage from nearby settlements empties into the river, KWS reports say.
Animals often leave the park during the rainy season when the grass is too long to see predators and return during the dry season when the grass inside is more lush. The park also links up to migration corridors leading to larger parks. 
The plan proposes fencing in land on the southern boundary if the owners are willing, or if they do not agree, to fence the park itself. 
A 2016 KWS report said fencing was the ""least suitable option"" to reduce animal-human conflict. Shrinking ranges would cause conflict among rhinos and lions, other species could not migrate, and inbreeding would be a problem.
It is not the only option. The plan itself said conservation initiatives such as installing free motion-sensor lights to deter lions have already reduced human-animal conflict.
Nkamunu Patita, co-ordinator for the Naretunoi conservancy which borders the park, said many landowners do not want any fencing.
When Reuters visited Naretunoi, herds of zebras were resting there with fluffy babies, unsteady young giraffe grazed alongside their mothers, and ostrich and wildebeest roamed alongside Maasai cows.
Freedom to move across wide swathes of land benefits both wildlife and Maasai herders, she said.

""Their way of life is compatible with conservation,"" she said. ""That's why you see zebras and cows grazing together.""

A judge finally approved the regional government's stay-at-home order for residents of the city of Lleida and six nearby towns on Tuesday night after several days of legal wrangling and political tensions over the issue. 
Under the new rules, people may only leave their homes for essential activities like working or buying supplies, while hotels, restaurants and bars will close except for food pick-up or delivery. 
Regional authorities have also encouraged the residents of three neighbourhoods in L'Hospitalet, a Barcelona suburb that is home to around 260,000, to stay home, but that's not a mandatory confinement. Another judge refused to rubber stamp a proposed restriction on gatherings of more than 10 people there. 
After more than 28,000 deaths from the pandemic, Spain's government ended a nationwide lockdown on June 21, considering it had dealt with the worst of the virus as the number of contagions had ground to a near halt.
But since then, more than 170 clusters have sprung up around Spain, prompting regional authorities to impose a patchwork of local restrictions, confusing locals and angering businesses.
While Catalonia, which is Spain's second-most populous region, is the first to return its citizens to home confinement, parts of Galicia have been sealed off to visitors and the Basque town of Ordizia imposed a curfew to tackle their own outbreaks.

And, following Catalonia's lead, a string of regions introduced compulsory mask use at all times, regardless of whether social-distancing can be guaranteed. In the southern Andalusia region, the restriction even applies to beachgoers.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The national security law Beijing foisted on Hong Kong has drawn red lines across many aspects of life in the city, but a vanguard of young democrats is intent on shaking up the political order and gaining mass support.
Young firebrands stormed to big wins in several Hong Kong districts that held primary elections for the democracy camp on the weekend, outshining some veteran democrats. 
Backed by throngs of volunteers, several dozen so-called localists took to the streets to campaign for their unofficial primary poll to select the strongest pro-democracy candidates for a city legislative election in September.
""We believe the traditional way adopted by the old politicians is not useful and quite pointless during this era,"" said Sunny Cheung, 24, who turned down a chance to study for a master's degree at Johns Hopkins University to ""resist the evil regime"".
Clad in black with white sneakers while handing out flyers outside a metro station, Cheung said his generation had been energised by anti-government protests and embraced ""resistance"".
The localists - a term for those who do not see themselves as Chinese and focus on saving the former British colony's freedoms - tend to adopt a more assertive stance than traditional democrats.
While many localists talk publicly about resistance, they don't speak about independence for Hong Kong, which could see them fall foul of the new security law and face up to life in prison. 
On Tuesday, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office condemned the weekend poll as ""illegal manipulation"" and a ""blatant challenge"" to the security law.
Former democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin stepped down on Wednesday as organiser of the election due to Beijing's remarks, although he reiterated the poll was legal.
Of the more than 610,000 people - or about 8% of the city's population - who participated in the poll - up to three quarters of them in several districts backed the localist or ""resistance"" camp, according to organisers.
'ERA OF CHANGE'
The democrats are hoping to secure a majority in the city's 70-seat legislature for the first time, riding a wave of anti-Beijing sentiment.
""I hope that the new generation can respond to the angry roar of the times and resist in the Legislative Council with new methods and ideologies,"" said incumbent democratic lawmaker Helena Wong, 61, who was muscled out of contention in the primaries.
Veteran democrats and assembly members like James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Gary Fan and Alvin Yeung performed poorly, with their moderate call for democracy no longer appealing to young voters.
""I don't trust the traditional democrats anymore. They failed to bring any change,"" said one student.
Many localists are followers of Edward Leung, a former pro-independence activist and philosophy student who became a de facto leader of their movement. 
Leung was jailed in 2016 for six years on a riot charge.
""Edward Leung has become the spiritual leader of Hong Kongers. He inspired me and many others,"" said Owen Chow, 23, who campaigned over the weekend with a loud hailer rigged to a BMW convertible sports car.
""We've entered an era of change.""
The security law criminalises what Beijing defines as terrorism, secession, foreign collusion and subversion, while authorising Chinese security agents to enforce laws in the city.
Beijing and Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government say it is needed to restore stability and safeguard prosperity.
A large number of disqualifications when nominations open on Saturday could stoke fresh protests, political analysts warn.
""Many argue that this is the darkest age of Hong Kong,"" said Cheung.

""We can only try to incrementally do something. We don't know which path can be 100% effective. We're not sure about anything, actually. We have to try everything.""

A Reuters witness said thousands of people took part in the march in Baku and there were demonstrations in other cities despite coronavirus restrictions which ban large gatherings in the South Caucasus country.
Demonstrators entered the parliament building in Baku as emotions intensified after the march. Their action did not appear to be intended as a protest against the authorities.
Eleven Azeri soldiers and a civilian, and four Armenian servicemen, have been killed since Sunday in border clashes around the Tavush region in northeast Armenia.
Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war in the 1990s over the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh region which is inside Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians, who declared independence as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Some of the demonstrators who gathered in a square outside Azerbaijan's parliament after Wednesday's march in Baku shouted ""Karabakh!"". Other chanted: ""Our homeland is indivisible!""
The international community worries about clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan in part because of the threat to instability in the South Caucasus, a region that serves as a corridor for pipelines taking oil and gas to world markets.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Young firebrand activists polled strongly in Hong Kong pro-democracy primaries in initial results released on Wednesday, but one election organiser stepped down after Beijing warned the vote may violate a new national security law.
Former democracy lawmaker Au Nok-hin helped organise the weekend poll that saw more than 610,000 people vote in what was widely seen as a symbolic protest against the sweeping legislation imposed on the city by Beijing.
""Withdrawal is the only choice (I have, to) ... protect myself and others,"" Au said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The primary polls were aimed at selecting democracy candidates to stand in September elections for the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's governing body.
Results from the primaries so far show 16 candidates from the ""resistance"" or ""localist"" camps were elected, outshining the traditional democrats who secured 12 votes. 
The strong performance of the younger generation reflects a potential change of guard to a more radical grouping likely to rile authorities in Beijing.
The remaining results are expected later on Wednesday.
Some voters are frustrated with Hong Kong's more moderate traditional democracy groups at a time when Beijing is tightening its grip on the city with a new security legislation seen by many as the latest attempt to crush freedoms. 
The democrats are gearing up for elections on Sept. 6, when they hope to secure a majority in the 70-seat legislature for the first time. 
In comments that critics said were aimed at instilling fear in the community, Beijing's top office in the city, the Hong Kong Liaison Office, the Chinese government agency Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, and the city's leader Carrie Lam have all said the primaries could violate the new national security law.
While a spokesman for the Liaison Office said the pro-democracy camp's bid for a legislative majority was an attempt to carry out a ‘color revolution’ in Hong Kong, referring to populist uprising in other parts of the world.
""For those who do not recognise democracy, or do not agree with democratic values, it is difficult to understand the meaning of the primary election,"" said Benny Tai, another organiser of the pro-democracy polls.
The new security law punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and sees Chinese intelligence agents operating officially in the city for the first time.
Critics of the law fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability to the city after a year of sometimes violent anti-government protests.
Hong Kong police on Wednesday arrested the vice chairman of the city's Democratic Party, Lo Kin-hei, on charges of unlawful assembly related to anti-government protests in November, he wrote on his Facebook page. He was released on bail.
Hong Kong police said they charged five males aged 21 to 70 with unlawful assembly, without giving names and they will be mentioned in court on Aug. 21.
The moves come as U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday ordered an end to Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law to punish China for what he called ""oppressive actions"" against the former British colony.
""Hong Kong will now be treated the same as mainland China,"" Trump said.
China said on Wednesday it would impose retaliatory sanctions on U.S. individuals and entities after Trump signed a law penalising banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the new Hong Kong national security law.

In another blow to the city's international status, the  New York Times  (N:NYT) said it would shift part of its Hong Kong office to Seoul, as worries grow that security law would curb media and other freedoms in the city.

Early in June, those fans - collectively called ARMY - put their energy behind an online campaign called #MatchAMillion to raise money for social justice causes in the United States. It hauled in $1 million in roughly one day, matching the donation of the band itself to Black Lives Matter. 
This accomplishment, ARMY members say, shows that being a fan of BTS is about more than buying records. It also illustrates how the fan base extends into older demographics, tying their spending clout to a generation that is internet-savvy and able to harness the power of social media. 
""We're buying cars and selling out stadiums; you can't just do that with some overexcited girls,"" said Erika Overton, 40, one of the administrators of One In An ARMY, the fan group that organised the #MatchAMillion fundraising effort. ""This is not just a fan group to enjoy music – it's an economic force, and something you can't really dismiss as something trivial.""
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/309qC6P in an external browser to see an interactive graphic on how BTS ARMY raised money for social justice causes in the United States.)
Some Black ARMY members say BTS has a responsibility to continue publicly supporting the racial justice protests that affect them. And BTS has also publicly acknowledged their music is based on hip-hop and R&B – genres that were created and popularised by Black American artists.
But others are concerned the wider fanbase's attention to these racial issues may be fleeting.
“When people care – like seriously care – they're going to put action behind that and not just words. And to actually see action behind it? That made me wake up and have hope,” said Nico Edward, who runs a BTS reaction video YouTube channel. 
“People lash out and do the hashtags and stuff and that's fine to raise awareness, but it usually, historically, dies out and people's attention moves to other things. But we're still dealing with this every single day.”

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's Supreme Court on Wednesday ordered the case of a translator jailed for involvement in a Russia Today documentary about sex trafficking be heard by an appeal court, due to what his lawyer said was a ""factual problem"" during his trial.
A lower court last year sentenced Rath Rott Mony, 49, to two years in prison for incitement to cause discrimination, after he assisted a Russian news crew in the making of a film that the government said contained ""fake news"" about Cambodia.
His lawyer Lor Chunthy said the Supreme Court, in a brief decision, referred the case ""after finding that there is a factual problem"". He did not elaborate. 
Another of Mony's lawyers, Sam Tithseyha, said there were ""some lacking issues"" with the trial.
Supreme Court spokesman Ouk Kimsith confirmed Wednesday's referral decision.
The documentary Mony worked on, ""My Mother Sold Me"", included an account of a Cambodian girl from a poor family who it said was sold into sex work, prompting authorities to question the people involved in her alleged sale.
Authorities concluded the girl and her mother were paid $200 to lie for a film that had damaged Cambodia's reputation.
Russia Today has said that it never pays documentary participants or interview subjects.
Mony, a trade union leader, was ordered to pay $17,500 of damages to two of the mothers of girls in the film.
Mony's wife, Long Kimheang, who is in Thailand under the protection of the United Nations refugee agency, said she was not satisfied with Wednesday's outcome.
""If the court found that my husband's trial wasn't right, the Supreme Court should release him, "" Kimheang told Reuters.

""We don't know when the Appeal Court will rehear the case ... we don't know how quickly they intend to proceed.""

The plane would arrive in Spain after a 13-1/2-hour flight and a stop in Canada, the attorney general's office said in a statement. It would return with Lozoya once the necessary administrative procedures had been completed, it added.
Assuming there are no hold-ups, Lozoya, 45, who was chief executive of the company known as Pemex [PEMX.UL] from 2012 to 2016, could land back in Mexico before the end of the week.
Spanish officials arrested Lozoya in the southern city of Malaga in February, making him the most high-profile detainee so far in Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's drive to crack down on political corruption.
Lozoya has been accused of bribery and money laundering in cases involving scandal-hit Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, as well as a Mexican fertilizer company.
Lozoya has denied wrongdoing, and his lawyers have argued he would not have done anything without the approval of the president, who at the time was Enrique Pena Nieto.
Lopez Obrador said on Monday that Lozoya was prepared to ""inform"" about what had gone on under the Pena Nieto adminstration, fueling speculation that other senior officials could be next to face charges.

SKOPJE (Reuters) - North Macedonia holds a parliamentary election on Wednesday that may decide the pace of the country's bid for European Union membership, with the governing pro-EU Social Democrats and the main opposition nationalists locked in a close race.
The vote was originally scheduled for April but postponed due to the coronavirus outbreak.
Parliament dissolved in February following the resignation of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev after the EU declined to give the ex-Yugoslav republic a date for membership negotiations. A month later the EU announced that talks could begin, again setting no date but diplomats said it would likely be later this year. 
One recent election poll suggested a narrow victory for Zaev's Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) while another indicated the opposition nationalist VMRO-DPMNE of Hristijan Mickoski would come out on top. Both polled less than 25%, meaning they will need partners for a working majority.
Zaev engineered a landmark agreement with Greece that changed the small Balkan country's name, ending a decades-long row, paving the way for North Macedonia to join NATO and progress toward EU accession talks after years of delay.
“We built bridges, we built friendship, we ... opened the doors to NATO and the European Union,” Zaev told his final pre-election party rally in the southern town of Bitola.
The VMRO opposed the addition of ""North"" to the country's name, which settled Greek concerns about a perceived Macedonian claim to the Greek province of Macedonia, and also accuse Zaev and the SDSM of corruption and cronyism, charges they deny.
""They (Social Democrats) changed, sold everything they could..., even our history and language. We must stop this depletion of Macedonia,” Mickoski told supporters in the eastern town of Stip.
Analysts say an SDSM victory could lend momentum to Skopje's membership talks with the EU and improve stability in the historically volatile Western Balkans, a region also taking in Serbia, Kosovo, Bosnia, Montenegro and Albania. 
Skopje analyst Petar Arsovski said if VMRO-DPMNE won, it would not abandon the deal with Greece but might try to hold up implementing some aspects, such as renaming the currency and changing uniform symbols, risking new obstacles to the EU bid.

Social media has come under fire on both sides of the Atlantic for carrying political ads that contain false or misleading claims ahead of elections, with the upcoming U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3 a key focus.

Respondents will be asked about the transparency of political advertising, if the content is clearly labelled and if it is easy to identify the party or candidate behind such ads.
The Commission asked if the current system where social media companies self-regulate should be maintained or if a regulatory package with overarching principles should apply to all information society services or if more detailed rules for tackling disinformation are needed.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's President Sebastian Pinera on Tuesday widened emergency support for middle-class citizens hit by the coronavirus-led economic shutdown to head off legislation that would allow withdrawals from the country's private pension funds.
Middle-class workers will get a $630 spot payment if their income has dropped at least one-third, regardless of their current employment status. This follows measures announced two weeks ago that included a soft loan, mortgage payment holidays, rent subsidies and beefed-up higher education financing. 
The center-right president called the measures a more ""responsible"" solution to growing poverty caused by business shutdowns and widespread layoffs following lockdowns that began in March.
""Many have felt that the state has not supported them as it should have done,"" Pinera said in a speech outside La Moneda presidential palace. ""We have to and can change that."" 
The announcement came as a bill moves through congress to allow citizens to withdraw 10% of their pensions in Chile's Pension Fund Administrators (AFP) system, which manages assets of around $200 billion. A similar plan for a 25% drawdown was approved in Peru in April. 
The plan, backed by 83% of Chileans in a July Cadem poll, passed an initial lower house vote last week with support from 13 ruling coalition lawmakers. nL1N2EG15Y
Ministers from Pinera's unpopular administration, already reeling from months of intense social unrest over inequality that started in October, have lined up to condemn the plan as harmful to pensioners and the wider economy.
Economists said local stock and bond markets would feel a short-term impact, with local equity outflows of $560 million to $1.1 billion depending on take-up and whether the funds liquidated more from local or foreign assets. 
The AFP system, designed by Pinera's brother Jose in the 1980s, has been widely imitated but was among the key gripes of protesters last year because of its low payouts.
The law faces a fresh lower house vote on Wednesday before moving to the Senate where it requires a 60% majority. If ruling coalition senators, 44% of the total, support the bill, the president or the constitutional court can veto it.

The government is driving ""urgent and necessary"" reforms to the pensions system, Pinera said. ""The protection of the middle class cannot and should not be at the cost of reducing pension savings, or compromising the future of the country.""

The main opposition Socialist party said state prosecutors were trying ""to discredit the protests as paid and organised"" but said officials would not silence demonstrators seeking to drive Prime Minister Boyko Borissov from office.
""It is easy to see that there are people who sincerely want change,"" the Socialist party leader Kornelia Ninova said in a statement, as thousands of anti-government protesters gathered in Sofia and other cities chanting ""Resign"" and ""Mafia"".
The Balkan nation, the poorest member of the European Union and ranked the bloc's most corrupt state by graft watchdog Transparency International, has yet to convict a single senior official of corruption.
Alongside demanding the prime minister quit, protesters have called for the resignation of the chief prosecutor, saying he has not done enough to root out high-level corruption.
The U.S. embassy in Sofia weighed in on Monday, with a statement saying: ""Every nation deserves a judicial system that is non-partisan and accountable to the rule of law.""
State prosecutors dismiss accusations of bias.
Borissov, who has been in power almost without break since 2009 and who has repeatedly promised to sweep out corruption, has said his government will not resign and elections would be held in spring. Senior ministers repeated that on Tuesday.
Prosecutors published on Tuesday what they said was a tapped telephone call in which gambling tycoon Vasil Bozhkov told an opposition politician he had helped boost the size of the protests. The publication prompted the politician to quit the Socialists parliamentary group.
Bozkhov, who fled the country to escape charges ranging from tax evasion to extortion, which he denies, said in a message on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that he had supported the protests from the start and would continue to do so.

In a statement late on Monday, the House of Representatives based in the eastern port of Tobruk said Egyptian backing was needed to stave off what it described as a Turkish invasion and occupation. 
The statement underscores the growing stakes in Libya, where battle lines solidified earlier this month near the city of Sirte after the GNA and Turkey repelled a yearlong assault on Tripoli by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA). 
Libya has been divided since 2014 between the GNA in Tripoli and a rival eastern administration in Benghazi, where LNA commander Khalifa Haftar has dominated. There is also a separate House of Representatives based in Tripoli. 
Any major new escalation could risk igniting a direct conflict in Libya among the foreign powers that have already poured in weapons and fighters in violation of an arms embargo. The LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has already warned the army might enter Libya if the GNA and its Turkish allies renew an assault on Sirte, a central coastal city seen as the gateway to Libya's main oil export terminals.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed in a phone call on Tuesday to work more closely in Libya to bring about lasting stability in the country, the Turkish presidency said.
Ankara has previously said the United States needs to play a more active role in the North African country.
The White House said the two leaders underscored the ""need for a negotiated settlement of regional issues.""

Control over oil, the main source of state revenue, has emerged as the biggest prize in the conflict, with eastern forces having imposed a blockade on production and exports since January.

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) - An Ecuadorean teenager has set up an improvised school under a tree in a poor neighbourhood of northern Guayaquil for some 40 students who haven't been able to study during the novel coronavirus lockdown for lack of internet access.
Almost nobody in the Reality of God neighbourhood has a computer or a cellphone with a data plan, leaving children unable to participate in the online education that has replaced regular schooling under the coronavirus health emergency.
Denisse Toala, 16, meets with kids and uses her cellphone to check school websites to see what homework has been assigned, which they would be unable to do on their own. 
""COVID-19 has caused difficulties on the economic front, but especially in education,"" said Toala, who is her final years of high school. ""They deserve an education."" 
Under the tree where they meet, she has set up a blackboard, educational posters and a welcome sign that reads: ""Learn to teach.""
UNICEF Ecuador in May said only 37% of the country's households have internet access. As a result, it said, ""6 out of 10 children cannot continue their studies on digital platforms.""
The report said the situation is more serious in rural areas, where only 16% of households have internet access.
The Telecommunications Ministry has acknowledged the problem and says it is working on ways to boost internet availability.
Parents say Toala is helping their kids keep up with their studies amid the pandemic, which in March and April overwhelmed Guayaquil's medical services. 

""There is no internet, there is no (cell) signal and my children would have lost a year (of school) if not for the tree and the teacher,"" said Gina Perez, whose four children study every afternoon at the makeshift school.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government carried out its first execution in 17 years on Tuesday, putting to death convicted murderer Daniel Lee over objections by his victims' relatives after the Supreme Court cleared the way with an overnight ruling.
Lee, 47, was pronounced dead at 8:07 a.m. EDT (1207 GMT) at the federal execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana, the U.S. Bureau of Prisons said.
His death marked the culmination of a three-year effort by Republican President Donald Trump's administration to resume capital punishment, ending a de facto moratorium by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, amid legal challenges and difficulties obtaining lethal-injection drugs. [nL1N2EG2ML]
""The American people have made the considered choice to permit capital punishment for the most egregious federal crimes, and justice was done today in implementing the sentence for Lee's horrific offenses,"" U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. 
Lee's lawyers complained that the government had acted in haste and that they received no notification of his rescheduled execution after a remaining legal obstacle that had not been addressed by the Supreme Court was cleared shortly after dawn. 
Just 10 minutes passed between the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals revoking the last outstanding injunction stopping Lee's execution, in an order at 7:36 a.m. (1136 GMT), and the curtain in the execution chamber being pulled back at 7:46 a.m. (1146 GMT) to reveal Lee strapped to a gurney.
The execution had previously been scheduled for Monday at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but was again delayed, with hours to spare, when a U.S. District Court in Washington ordered the U.S. Justice Department to delay Lee's and three other executions scheduled for July and August to allow the continuation of legal challenges by death row inmates.
In issuing her injunction, Judge Tanya Chutkan had said Lee and other condemned men were likely to succeed in their argument that the new lethal-injection protocol announced last year that uses a single drug, the barbiturate pentobarbital, would cause an unconstitutional degree of pain and suffering. 
Her order was affirmed overnight by an appellate court.
But at 2:10 a.m. (0610 GMT), the Supreme Court in a 5-4 vote ruled that challenges by Lee and other condemned men to the execution protocol did not justify ""last-minute"" intervention by federal courts.
""Last-minute stays like that issued this morning should be the extreme exception, not the norm,"" the Supreme Court wrote in its unsigned ruling.
Ruth Friedman, one of the public defenders who had represented Lee, rebuked the Justice Department for what she described as a rushed process, saying lawyers did not learn his execution was underway until after his death.
In a statement, she said ""it is beyond shameful that the government, in the end, carried out this execution in haste, in the middle of the night, while the country was sleeping. We hope that upon awakening, the country will be as outraged as we are.""
A Justice Department official said that the Bureau of Prisons had notified Lee's counsel soon after the earlier Supreme Court ruling, but that there was no need to give further notification after the later ruling by the 8th Circuit.
Lee, who once espoused white supremacist beliefs, was convicted for his role in the killing of three members of an Arkansas family in 1996. But some relatives of his victims opposed him receiving the death sentence, while his accomplice in the murders, Chevie Kehoe, was sentenced to life in prison. 
The victims' relatives unsuccessfully sued last week to delay the execution until the coronavirus pandemic had passed, saying they feared attending would risk their safety. 
Lee spent four hours strapped to the gurney while the final legal challenges played out, his lawyers and a witness said. He was then asked if had any last words, according to a media witness in the viewing chamber.
""I didn't do it. I've made a lot of mistakes in my life but I'm not a murderer,"" Lee said, according to the media witness, who issued a report for other news outlets. ""You're killing an innocent man.""
As the drug was being administered, Lee raised his head to look around, and his breathing appeared to become labored, according to the pool report. Soon after, Lee's chest was no longer moving, his lips turned blue and his fingers became ashy.
Two unnamed Bureau of Prisons officials and Lee's spiritual adviser could be seen inside the execution chamber. 

The Justice Department has scheduled two more executions of convicted child killers this week: Wesley Ira Purkey on Wednesday and Dustin Honken on Friday. An appeals court has temporarily stayed Purkey's execution date, and it remained unclear whether it would proceed.

Darmanin has denied the allegation that he coerced a woman into having sex in 2009 when she sought his help in having her criminal record cleared, and a judge dismissed the case against him after a preliminary investigation into the allegation was dropped.
A judicial source told Reuters last month the Paris appeal court had ordered the investigation to be reopened although no new evidence had been found.
Hundreds of women took to the streets of Paris last week to protest against Darmanin's promotion from budget minister in a government reshuffle, saying he should not be allowed to hold high office and demanding his resignation.
Asked about the minister in a television interview on Tuesday, Macron said the two men had met to discuss the allegation.
""If from the moment someone is accused, he is not tried, he becomes somehow the victim of a judgment on the streets or on social networks, (...) our democracy changes nature, it becomes a democracy of opinion,"" Macron said.
""For France I want the best of our country, I don't want the worst of Anglo-Saxon society,"" Macron said.
An investigating judge will now decide whether there is a case to pursue with a formal investigation into the allegation against Darmanin, 37. 

Lawyers for Darmanin said in a statement last month that the ruling was a matter of legal process, and that the minister had filed a complaint for slander.

The AU launched its mediation effort two weeks ago, involving eleven online sessions to end the deadlock over the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile river.
The dam is the centrepiece in Ethiopia’s bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter, but has sparked concerns in Cairo that Egypt’s already scarce supplies of Nile waters, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.
""Unchanged and additional and excessive demands of Egypt and Sudan prohibited the conclusion of this round of negotiation by an agreement,"" the Ethiopian foreign ministry said on Tuesday.
It did not elaborate but said Ethiopia was willing to show flexibility as talks would continue.
The Egyptian irrigation ministry said on Monday that all three countries would submit a report on the talks to mediator Cyril Ramaphosa, the South African president and African Union president who is preparing a new mini summit. 
""The desired goal is to always reach an agreement and it is the thing we are trying to achieve,"" Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told local TV. 
Sudan's information minister, Faisal Saleh, said on Monday that the issue must be resolved through dialogue, and a fair solution was necessary to limit the negative impact of the dam.
The three countries had been expected to sign an agreement in Washington in February but Ethiopia skipped the meeting and only Egypt initialled the deal.
The GERD is being built about 15 km (9 miles) from the border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, source of most of the Nile’s waters.

Sudan and Egypt have sought a legally binding agreement before the dam is filled, which Ethiopia said would start this month using seasonal rains.

She plans to appeal as allowed within 10 days. 
Chargui's sharing of the post in May angered some conservative social media users who demanded punishment in a nation periodically polarised between secular and Islamist political wings since a revolution that introduced democracy nine years ago.
Court spokesman Mohsen Dali said the sentence was on charges of inciting hate between religions and races. 
The case has brought criticism from rights groups.
Saying she was a victim of a ""repressive law"" that curtailed free speech, Amnesty International said the prosecution did not allow Chargui's lawyer to accompany her to court, where she was asked about her religious beliefs and mental condition.

HERRENCHIEMSEE, Germany (Reuters) - Angela Merkel, on a visit to a leading candidate to succeed her when she steps down as German chancellor, praised Bavarian Premier Markus Soeder as a strong leader, but declined to be drawn into giving an endorsement ahead of a 2021 federal vote.
Merkel's decision to attend a meeting of Bavaria's cabinet was widely seen as a coronation of her successor after the wealthy southern state's aggressive management of the coronavirus crisis raised Soeder's profile nationally.
""You will not hear me comment on the issue of who will succeed me in any form or in any forum,"" she said. ""All I can say is that Bavaria has a good premier and he invited me today.""
Soeder was among the first of Germany's 16 powerful state premiers to impose lockdowns and roll out mass testing programmes as the virus swept into Germany.
Bavaria's success, underlined by Soeder's repeated assertive national television appearances, contrasts with that of North Rhine-Westphalia, whose premier Armin Laschet is the other front-runner for the conservative nomination.
Laschet, whose Netherlands-sized state is Germany's most populous, has had a tougher time mastering the pandemic, with a series of outbreaks, most recently in a slaughterhouse in Guetersloh, infecting thousands.
Some interpreted Soeder's decision to invite Merkel to Herrenchiemsee, a castle on an island in a lake where Germany's constitution was drafted in 1948, as a calculated move to present him as a national, rather than merely Bavarian leader.

Merkel declined to be any more specific, however, adding in response to further questioning that she would always accept invitations from state premiers.

Workers have been told by managers to either stay and work or lose their jobs, civil society organisations said last month, citing miners and union representatives and demanding an end to the practice.
""All mining companies that have confined workers to the operating site are granted a one-month moratorium to return to normal operation,"" Labour Minister Nene Ilunga Nkula said in the letter, dated July 13, which she shared on Twitter on Tuesday.
Mining companies must provide healthcare for workers and their families, as well as decent housing and a healthy diet for confined workers, Nkula said.
Companies mining in Congo's southern copper belt include Glencore (OTC:GLNCY) subsidiary Katanga Mining, China Molybdenum's Tenke Fungurume, MMG, and Chemaf, while Ivanhoe is developing two copper mines there.
Six workers at Glencore's Kamoto Copper Company (KCC) mine in Lualaba province tested positive for the coronavirus, KCC said a week ago.
Companies in Lualaba have a month from July 2 to prepare sanitation measures and release all workers confined for more than a month. In Haut-Katanga the period runs from July 6, the letter said. 
Congo is Africa's top producer of copper and the world's main source of cobalt, accounting for two-thirds of global supplies of the metal used in smartphones and electric car batteries. 
Mines minister Willy Kitobo Samsoni has warned that full mine shutdowns would trigger a ""catastrophic"" economic and social crisis in the country, with the industry contributing 32% of its GDP and 95% of export revenue in 2018.

Thousands of Saudi-bound Ethiopian workers cross Yemen each month but restrictions aimed at curbing the rapid spread of COVID-19 in the war-ravaged country have cut arrivals.
But among those already there, thousands have been bussed or trucked to cities like Aden and Marib where they are now stuck, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said.
""It's a very dire situation when you combine access (difficulties) and the circumstances in which they live – a mobile population in urban environments,"" IOM spokesman Paul Dillon told journalists in Geneva. He declined to give specifics regarding who was responsible for the transfers.
An unknown number of the stranded migrants could be held in detention centres that had poor hygiene standards even before the outbreak of COVID-19, Dillon added. However, locals and charities were helping some of the migrants.
The United Nations says the virus is spreading unrestrained in a country with shattered health systems and inadequate testing capabilities after years of war, and that the actual number of cases is likely much higher than official reports.
The Saudi-backed Yemeni government based in the south has officially reported 1,504 infections and 424 deaths as of Monday. The Houthi movement, which controls most big urban centres, has not provided figures since May 16 when authorities said there were four cases, with one death.
One of the early cases in May was that of a Somali refugee which the IOM has previously said contributed to migrants being stigmatised as ""transmitters of disease"". 
Yemen last year detained Ethiopian migrants in open-air football stadiums and a military camp. Such migrants would typically go on to work as cleaners, drivers and labourers in Saudi Arabia.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A Malian Islamist rebel accused of being central to the ""persecution"" of residents of Timbuktu and the destruction of the city's holy grounds refused to enter a plea Tuesday as his lawyers argued he was not mentally fit to stand trial. 
Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court, which opened the trial on Tuesday, say the Ansar Dine Islamist group that Al Hassan Ag Abdoul Aziz belonged to controlled every aspect of public life in Timbuktu after seizing part of the north of Mali in 2012 along with Tuareg separatists.
Timbuktu's inhabitants were ""belittled, humiliated and assaulted, subject to a veritable persecution on religious and gender grounds to which they saw no end and in which Al Hassan, the acting embodiment of the Islamic police, played a leading role"", ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda told judges. 
As well as trying to impose sharia Islamic law across divided Mali, the al Qaeda-linked fighters used pick-axes, shovels and hammers to shatter earthen tombs and centuries-old shrines reflecting the local Sufi version of Islam in what is known as the “City of 333 Saints”.
This kind of Sufi worship was anathema to Islamists like the Ansar Dine fighters who adhere to a puritanical branch of Sunni Islam. 
The attacks, which drew international condemnation, were an echo of the 2001 dynamiting by the Taliban of two 6th-century statues of Buddha carved into a cliff in Bamiyan in Afghanistan.
The ICC, the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal, has been examining events in Mali since 2012. French and Malian troops pushed the rebels back the following year.
Al Hassan faces 13 charges for rape, torture, sexual slavery and directing attacks against religious and historical buildings. 
According to his defence team, restrictions related to the coronavirus outbreak meant they had not been able to see their client in person for four months. He has been held in ICC custody since March 2018. 
When they finally did this month they were ""alarmed"" at his state and cited a defence health expert report that Al Hassan was ""experiencing disassociation"" due to post-traumatic stress from ""severe maltreatment"" he suffered earlier while in jail in Mali before his transfer to The Hague.
While the judges ordered a medical examination of Al Hassan to determine his fitness to stand trial, they also ruled they would not delay the hearing.
Al Hassan was asked to enter a plea to each of the charges but refused, telling judges 13 times: ""I cannot answer that question."" 
He is the second suspect from Mali to appear before the ICC over crimes suspected to have been committed by Ansar Dine. Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi pleaded guilty to the destruction of cultural heritage for his part in smashing the mausoleums. He was sentenced to nine years in 2017 after apologising for his actions.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's move to switch the status of Hagia Sophia to a mosque has struck a raw nerve with many Greeks, who revere the sixth century building as a focal point of their Orthodox Christian faith. 
Greece, whose relations with Turkey are fraught with historical tensions, says the matter is not a bilateral dispute.
""With this backward action, Turkey is opting to sever links with western world and its values,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said.
""Confronted with this unnecessary, petty initiative from Turkey, Greece is considering its response at all levels,"" Mitsotakis said, in a reference to Hagia Sophia.
A Turkish court ruled last week that Hagia Sophia's conversion to a museum in 1934 was unlawful. Declaring the building a mosque, Erdogan said prayers would be held there within two weeks, in a move that drew international criticism. 
Relations between Greece and Turkey are often tense over Cyprus, divided between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations after an abortive Greek-inspired coup which triggered a Turkish invasion in 1974. 
Moves by the island's Greek Cypriot-led government to explore for offshore natural gas have been countered by Turkish attempts at gas exploration in the same areas.

""Europe should once and for all draft a specific list of actions, and sanctions against a country which seeks to be a regional troublemaker, and which is evolving into a threat to the stability of the whole south-east Mediterranean region,"" Mitsotakis said.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 14, 2020 08:21AM ET</span>",Special Report: The quest to stop a 'Sugar Daddy' judge accused of preying on women,"By John Shiffman and Michael Berens
EUREKA SPRINGS, Arkansas (Reuters) - She was 30 years old, jobless and facing a custody fight for two young children. To keep her kids, she needed a lawyer – someone cheap and willing to see her quickly.
Tim Parker seemed ideal. He was available, and his fee was about half what another lawyer quoted. According to confidential testimony reviewed by Reuters, the woman told state authorities that Parker agreed to represent her in late 2013, then offered her some unexpected advice.
“‘You need yourself a Sugar Daddy,’ is exactly what he said,” the woman said in the confidential testimony. “He was very persistent on it and knew that I was pretty much broke.”
The woman told authorities that she covered part of her legal fees by having sex with Parker, and that Parker paid her at least $3,000 for more sex over the next two years. Typically, allegations that a lawyer had sex with a client or exchanged services for sex would be handled by local police or state ethics officials. 
But Parker’s case was complicated: He wasn't just a lawyer. He was also a part-time judge for the Carroll County District Court. 
That gave Arkansas' judicial oversight agency the jurisdiction to investigate Parker. Although the woman declined to talk with Reuters, she alleged in secret testimony to the agency that Parker had also used his authority as a judge to help her friends bond out of jail, again in return for sex. The alleged conduct was not isolated, according to the confidential records reviewed by Reuters and interviews with eight law enforcement officials in Arkansas.
City police, the sheriff’s office, the state police, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a federal grand jury investigated Parker for about four years. Witnesses gave evidence that the judge disclosed the identity of a confidential informant; traded money and opioids for sex; and gave favorable treatment to young women in his courtroom, Reuters found.
Despite the intense scrutiny, Parker, 58, was never charged with any crime. In brief interviews with Reuters, Parker said he did nothing wrong, as a judge or as a lawyer. In a statement, Parker’s lawyer said the allegations of illegal drug use and sexual misconduct are “absolutely untrue.”
Still, Parker’s term on the bench ended in disgrace, when the state judicial commission forced his removal and resignation on what was already scheduled to be his final day in office.
The story of Tim Parker shows how hard it can be to remove an American judge suspected of corruption. It also illustrates how, even after misconduct on the bench becomes an open secret, a judge can remain in power for years when his victims are people who typically make for poor witnesses – in this case, petty criminals and drug addicts.
In its investigation into judicial misconduct across America, Reuters sought to identify people harmed as a result of judges who break the law or violate their sworn oaths. Over a dozen years, the news agency found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge’s misconduct. The victims ranged from individuals who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments or actions.
Parker’s case also provides a different, more hopeful lesson about ensuring accountability in America's state and local courts, however. It demonstrates how a well-staffed and persistent state judicial oversight agency – the exception, not the rule, in the United States – can hold judges to account when other authorities can’t.
“A lot of times, the public and even law enforcement didn’t know we were there, or what we could do,” said Lance Womack, chief investigator for the Arkansas Judicial Discipline & Disability Commission from 2000 to 2017. “They didn’t realize that we could get a judge off the bench or disciplined for ethics, even when there might not be enough to get a criminal conviction.” 
As part of its national investigation into judicial misconduct, Reuters analyzed staffing and disciplinary actions by state oversight commissions for a dozen years – from January 2008 through December 2019. 
The news agency found Arkansas has one of the better-staffed oversight agencies in the United States. Nationally, commissions have on average one full-time employee for every 155 judges. Arkansas has roughly one staffer for every 53 state judges.
Arkansas took disciplinary action against a judge 40 times from 2008 through 2019, a greater frequency than in all but five states, Reuters determined. Nationally, commissions on average publicly disciplined 6 in every 100 judges. In Arkansas, the ratio was 13 per 100. 
A trained, experienced staff is fundamental, said Robert Tembeckjian, who has supervised more than 2,500 judicial investigations and leads New York's commission.
“It’s not enough to adopt an ethics code,” he said. “Without vigorous oversight, judges may act with impunity, and litigants and the public will lose faith in the courts.”
The Arkansas commission is among the few that investigate anonymous complaints and make every disciplinary decision public. It has filed formal charges against state supreme court justices and has cracked cases that have sent trial judges to prison.
Arkansas commission director David Sachar, the son of a preacher, is the past president of the national Association of Judicial Disciplinary Counsel and speaks frequently at international conferences on misconduct by judges. He and his former deputy, Emily White, said they pursued Parker and others with the same mindset they applied earlier in their careers as sex crimes prosecutors in Little Rock. 
“The average citizen cannot be expected to brush off improper or undignified behavior by a judge,” Sachar said in a 2018 speech to a United Nations conference. “The power imbalance is such that an employee, party or professional in that court have no way to respond without fear of a harsh or vindictive counter-response from a powerful public official.”
""WE DIDN'T SEE WHAT WAS COMING"" 
Perched on a remote ridge in the Ozark Mountains of northwestern Arkansas, Eureka Springs is a city of 2,000 people, about a four-hour drive from the state capital of Little Rock. 
Its Victorian-era shops, bars, spas and hotels draw a million tourists annually, said Mayor Butch Berry. Those visitors fuel the local economy. They also account for many arrests for crimes related to partying, such as speeding, drunken driving and petty drug use. 
Like much of Eureka Springs, the limestone courthouse on Main Street has been preserved and looks much as it did when it opened in 1908. Parker had served there from 1999 to 2004 as district court judge. And so, in 2013, after the incumbent resigned to focus on a corporate legal job, the governor appointed Parker to fill the vacancy.
The part-time gig was not unusual. In hundreds of small U.S. towns and rural counties, where the caseloads are light and the court meets just a few times a month, a local lawyer is appointed or elected as a part-time judge. The lawyers can continue their private practices, typically their primary source of income, but they are bound by ethics codes for both attorneys and judges. 
When Parker was tapped for the bench, he promised to treat everyone fairly. “I plan to be a humble judge that follows the law,” he told the local newspaper.
At the outset, Parker enjoyed the community’s backing because of his previous stint as judge, recalled Earl Hyatt, the police chief from 1996 to 2014.
“I actually wrote a letter to the governor supporting his appointment,” Hyatt told Reuters. “We didn’t see what was coming: drugs, sex and using his position on the bench to further his personal interests.”
""RUMOR IS I HAVE CANDY"" 
Among the landmarks in Eureka Springs is a six-story statue of Jesus. Another is the Cathouse Lounge and Pied Piper Pub & Inn, a self-described biker bar and restaurant steps from the courthouse. Parker was a frequent patron.
From the Pied Piper on April 19, 2013, phone records show, the judge texted a woman half his age. Police say the exchanges were filled with coded drug references.
“Rumor is I have candy,” Parker texted.
“Omg,” the young woman replied.
When Parker texted that he couldn’t meet right away, she said,“What if I make it worth your while?”
“Sure, that’ll work,” the judge wrote back.
On April 22, 2013, Parker texted the same woman again from his office: “I am all alone.”
Her response: “LOL ooooh !! So am i :) were u able to find me anything good? If so it could b fuuuun ;)”
Yes, Parker texted back. Seven opioid hydrocodone pills, “plus a bunch of blue and yellow capsules.” 
The judge asked if he should swing by her place.
“Ok that cool,” she replied.
“On my way,” he texted back.
The text messages are among the confidential records Reuters reviewed, compiled over four years by federal, state and local law enforcement authorities. The records identify by name six women who told investigators about interactions with Parker that related to drugs, sex or both. He denies the accusations. Reuters is not naming the women, whom police consider victims.
“You bet I’m still in fear of retaliation,” one of the women told Reuters. “He was a judge and I’m a peon. Yes, I’m a felon, but I’m also a human and don’t have less rights.”
The woman spoke with Reuters on condition of anonymity, as did the woman Parker texted from the bar. Both said they were opioid addicts at the time and are now in recovery.
“Back then I would do anything to get my fix,” said the woman Parker texted. “I was struggling to make ends meet. He definitely took advantage of that.”
Parker’s lawyer denied that his client ever offered drugs for sex or possessed pills without a prescription. 
In summer 2013, a few months after the text exchanges, the woman’s ex-boyfriend took her phone to city police. They sent it to the FBI to extract the texts and call logs. 
""I KNOW YOU'RE A SNITCH""
One of a judge’s most sensitive duties is approving search warrants. Typically, warrants are sealed to permit police to surprise suspects and to protect the identities of informants.
In sworn statements, city police say they became alarmed early in Parker’s tenure when the names of informants in methamphetamine cases began to leak. One informant showed police a text she received from a Parker acquaintance, the records show.
According to a sworn testimony from former police chief Hyatt, the text read in part: “I know you’re a snitch. Parker told me what you’ve been doing… You could die for this.” 
Hyatt said he alerted the FBI about the text message.
“We took it extremely seriously,” Hyatt told Reuters. “That could end up in grievous bodily injury or death to an informant.”
Parker’s lawyer, John Everett, called the allegation “simply not true.” As a part-time judge, Parker maintained his law practice when he wasn’t on the bench, Everett said in a written statement. Parker learned the identities of confidential informants through his work as an attorney, not as a judge, Everett said, and never disclosed their identities to anyone “while serving as judge.”
For police, a tipping point came on a Saturday morning in September 2013, when one of Parker’s female clients was arrested at the Pied Piper for meth possession. Parker came to the jail that Saturday and ordered her release. Parker’s lawyer said the judge’s action was not uncommon or unethical. 
Local police viewed it differently. Most people arrested on a Saturday would not go before a judge until Monday, they said. To them, Parker’s intervention was outrageous. Thomas Achord, then a city detective, said he had been searching for the arrested woman as part of a local and federal drug investigation.
“When she was booked, I got an automated email alert,” he told Reuters. “I called the jail, but they said Judge Parker had already come and had her released. I couldn’t believe it.”
Other police officers also complained that the judge routinely refused to enforce the state’s impaired-driving law in court and seemed to favor young female defendants.
In response, Hyatt tasked a detective to compile court records and mugshots of everyone arrested for drunken or impaired driving since Parker had taken the bench. The detective concluded that the judge was more likely to dismiss cases against women aged 20 to 4o – so long as they weren’t obese – than others arrested for the same offenses. Police delivered a binder containing the mug shots and records to the FBI, hoping agents there would pursue a public corruption case.
Parker’s lawyer Everett said the judge always followed proper bond procedure and that the police analysis of Parker’s record “borders on being laughable.” 
“Surely the investigating officers have something better do with their time than to review these kinds of records,” he said.
An FBI spokesman referred queries to the Justice Department, which declined to comment.
Hyatt, the former police chief, said he assumed federal authorities would pursue the judge. “I wanted a criminal prosecution,” he told Reuters. “I wanted him to face the same thing anyone else would, given the circumstances.” 
In August 2015, Parker drew the attention of another law enforcement agency, the Carroll County Sheriff’s Office, which was unaware of the other investigations.
A woman was arrested for beating her adult son, sticking a gun in his face and threatening to kill him, the arrest report shows. From jail, she called Parker at his law firm. Reuters reviewed a recording of the conversation.
“Oh my God, please, Tim, get me out of here,” the woman told Parker. “It’s horrible.”
As the woman began to blurt out details of her arrest, Parker interrupted. 
“Just settle down,” Parker said, warning that calls from the jail are recorded. “Don’t be saying anything over the telephone.” 
When Parker asked about the status of her case, the woman said she was waiting for a judge “to set bond or something this afternoon –”
Parker cut her off. “I can come in and do that,” he said. 
A few hours later, the judge headed to the jail, ordered the woman released without bail and drove her away, according to sworn statements by police officers. A year later, prosecutors dropped the charges against the woman. 
Parker, who said he once represented the woman’s husband, told Reuters he doesn’t remember the jailhouse call. But he said it was proper for him to respond to a request from a defendant for a bond hearing. He denied that he drove the woman from the jail. 
J.J. Reddick, a sheriff’s lieutenant, said that when he heard about the call, he began to investigate the judge.
“He came over, did a bond hearing and took her home,” Reddick said. “Who gets personally involved like that, as a judge? That was amazing to me.”
Reddick started digging, carefully, so as not to tip off Parker. In fall 2015, he began interviewing young women already in jail for petty crimes. One told him that she knew seven women – herself included – who had had sex with Parker for cash or reduced bond. 
Reuters reviewed a video of that woman’s interview with Reddick. During the interview, she joked that she could name even more women if she had access to her list of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) friends. 
“That’s how bad it is,” the woman said.
She then began to describe her own encounter with Parker, but stopped suddenly. Reddick assured her that she should not be ashamed.
The woman nodded. “The prostitution is bad,” she said, “but where he’s telling me he’ll set my bond low where I could get out, I think is different, because that is using his power against other people.”
“If I didn’t sleep with you, you would set it high?” the woman said. “That’s more fucked up.”
At one point, the woman became exasperated, noting she had already discussed Parker’s conduct with federal authorities. “The messed-up thing is that I told them this a year ago!”
Reddick, who was unaware of the FBI investigation, said calmly, “I promise you I’m not going to just let this go away. If I don’t get somebody to listen to me, I’m going to go to somebody else and keep going. I don’t care if I have to go to Little Rock.”
""EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S CROOKED""
About six months later, Reddick approached an official from the judicial commission, based in the capital of Little Rock. At the time – spring 2016 – the commission was busy with a high-profile investigation, one starkly similar to the Parker case.
A judge on the other side of the state, Joseph Boeckmann, was suspected of sexual misconduct with young men facing petty criminal and traffic offenses. The judicial commission’s handling of the Boeckmann case offers an example of how an aggressive oversight agency can have a decisive impact: It led to a federal indictment charging the judge with abuse of power. Boeckmann pleaded guilty to dismissing cases in return for “sexually related conduct.” He was sentenced to five years in prison, two more than prosecutors sought.
“He’s the traffic judge in a small town,” U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker said as she sentenced Boeckmann. “He is the System. He acted corruptly while performing his core duty as a judge.”
With Boeckmann in handcuffs, commission director Sachar turned to Parker. 
By then, Sachar had to hurry. It was mid-October 2016, and Parker had just 75 days left in his term. Most judicial investigations can’t be completed that quickly. Gathering evidence against a judge can take months, sometimes years. And if a judge contests the allegations – as records show Parker did – the process can stretch even longer.
Sachar pressed on. He concluded that if any case could be made against Parker, a finding by the commission would send needed messages – to Parker, his victims, other judges and the public. After all, in Sachar’s view, a small town had essentially surrendered to the authority of a corrupt judge. This couldn’t continue or be allowed to happen again, he reasoned. 
“Everybody knows it’s crooked,” Sachar said. “Everybody. The judge is doing personal favors, quid pro quo, and people know it. What does that say to people who were locked up and didn’t get out?”
Adding to Sachar’s outrage and urgency: alarming testimony from a woman who alleged she’d had sex with Parker for cash and judicial favors. The woman alleged that, after receiving a commission subpoena to testify about Parker, he paid her $100 for a copy of the subpoena and offered advice on what to tell investigators.
The woman couldn’t recall the judge’s precise words but told commission investigators that Parker said, in effect, “I’m not telling you to lie, but if you do, I won’t say anything.”
Parker’s lawyer denied that the judge paid anyone for a copy of a subpoena or advised anyone to lie to authorities. 
Sachar struck a deal with Parker on his last day in office, December 31, 2016. The judge disputed the sex and drug allegations but admitted that he improperly got friends and former clients out of jail. Under the agreement, he “resigned” but was also “removed.” As important: Parker was banned for life from returning to the bench. The outcome, Sachar believes, put other judges on notice. 
“I felt like we just couldn’t let him walk away,” Sachar said. “Symbolically, I wanted him removed to make a statement.”
The case against Parker did not end on the last day of 2016. There would be at least two more investigations.
A special state prosecutor requested Sachar’s case file to comb through the evidence of drug use, prostitution and corruption. The FBI also received the evidence and a federal grand jury heard testimony, records show, but no charges were filed. A federal spokesman declined to comment.
In January 2018, more than two years after Parker resigned, Arkansas special prosecutor Jason Barrett completed his probe without filing charges. He cited the difficulty in locating witnesses and victims. Five other law enforcement officials also told Reuters that they struggled to build cases against Parker because the former judge’s alleged victims made for poor witnesses.
The women proved hard to locate and reluctant to cooperate, the authorities said. In cop slang, most were “frequent flyers” – people caught in a cycle of petty crime, addiction, escalating court fines and probation violations that led to repeat jail stays. Most were young mothers. They rotated jobs, addresses and phone numbers every few months, as money, drugs and relationships came and went. Several had outstanding warrants, and feared going public might trigger their arrests.
“They just wanted it to go away,” said deputy Reddick. “They didn’t want to have to go on the stand and face people and let them know what they’d done.”
As a single mother who exchanged sex with the judge for pills and cash told Reuters, “I hate that this happened.” Said another: “I feel shame.”
The special prosecutor told Reuters that he forwarded a file to the state attorney discipline agency to review whether Parker violated rules of conduct for lawyers. That agency’s director, Stark Ligon, said that he could not comment on the case, except to say that the “file remains open and under investigation.”
Meantime, Parker has continued to practice law. In February, the former judge appeared at the Eureka Springs courthouse, this time as a defense attorney. Among the charges against his client: illegally possessing opioids and assaulting a woman.

The international community worries about clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan in part because of the threat to instability in the South Caucasus, a region that serves as a corridor for pipelines taking oil and gas to world markets.
Azerbaijan and Armenia both said exchanges of fire that began on Sunday had continued into Tuesday, and each accused the other of ceasefire violations and shelling.
An army major-general and a colonel were among seven Azeri servicemen killed, Azeri deputy defence minister Kerem Veliyev said, adding that ""devastating blows were inflicted on the enemy"".
Armenia's Defence Ministry said two of its servicemen, a major and a captain, had been killed in skirmishes. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anna Naghdalyan said the city of Berd had been shelled near the border but Armenian forces had ""destroyed the Azeri bases"" that fired on it.
Armenia and Azerbaijan, two former Soviet republics, have long been in conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway, mainly ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh. But the latest clashes occurred around the Tavush region in northeast Armenia, some 300 km (190 miles) from the enclave.
Russia urged the two sides to cease fire and show restraint, and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Moscow was ready to act as a mediator.
Nagorno-Karabakh is in Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians, who declared independence during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to accuse each other of shooting attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.

Xu Zhangrun, a constitutional law professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, returned home on Sunday morning, six days after he was taken away by police. 
In a text message showed to Reuters by one of his friends, Xu told the friend that he had been ""relieved of teaching and public positions"" by Tsinghua University.
Repeated phone calls to Xu went unanswered on Tuesday.
Tsinghua University did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The university had suspended Xu from teaching duties since 2019, his friends have said.
Xu, 57, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two-term limit for China's leader.
Earlier this month, Xu was taken from his home in suburban Beijing by police, who searched his house and confiscated his computer, according to a text message circulated among Xu's friends and seen by Reuters.
Police told his wife that he was being detained for allegedly soliciting prostitution during a trip to Chengdu, said his friends, who dismissed that allegation as character assassination.
At the peak of China's coronavirus outbreak in February, Xu wrote an article calling for freedom of speech. In May, he wrote an article accusing Xi of trying to bring the Cultural Revolution back to China.
Under Xi, China has clamped down on dissent and tightened censorship.

(Reuters) - Inequality between white and Black Americans persists in almost every aspect of society and the economy. Such disadvantages have proven immune to decades of laws and policies meant to address them, leaving Black people with less education, less wealth, poorer health and shorter lifespans. Together, the disparities reflect what many have labeled systemic racism amid the mass protests that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in May.

There has been progress in recent decades. But wide gaps — rooted in the legacy of slavery, segregation and discrimination — have endured or widened in the years since the civil rights victories of the 1960s. Born from the enslavement of Africans in British colonies since the early 1600s, American inequality plays out over the course of a lifetime.

The newspapers said Torrent and two other separatist politicians were warned by researchers working with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s instant message service WhatsApp that their phones were broken into with a spyware called ""Pegasus"" made by Israeli company NSO Group.
The prime minister's office said the Spanish government was ""not aware"" of any such spying on the three separatist leaders.
A spokesman for Torrent confirmed the details in the newspapers and said: ""Everything seems to show the Spanish state is behind this.""
""It is clear that Mr. Torrent was not involved in criminal activity such as terrorism or drug trafficking that would justify a judicial order to intervene on his phone,"" the spokesman said.
The prime minister's office said: ""Any intervention on a mobile is always carried out in accordance with the law that requires judicial authorisation.""
Tensions between Catalonia's separatist regional leaders and the central government in Madrid have been high for years, particularly since a failed independence bid in 2017. 
NSO, whose customers include law enforcement and governments around the world, declined to say whether it had sold its Pegasus software to Spain. 
It said its software ""is operated in line with our industry-leading governance policies solely by authorised government agencies to fight terror and serious crime, and protect public safety"".
Facebook did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
WhatsApp last year said 1,400 of its users had been targeted by Pegasus. It said the attack exploited its video calling system to send malware to mobile devices.
Britain's Guardian newspaper, without citing a source, said WhatsApp believed the attacks in Spain occurred over a two week period in April to May 2019, when the 1,400 users were allegedly targeted by the spyware.

The Pegasus spyware has been linked to political surveillance in Mexico, the UAE and Saudi Arabia, according to the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which researches digital surveillance.

The CAO said in an interim report that the plane was accidentally downed, killing 176 people on board, because of a misalignment of a radar system and lack of communication between the air defence operator and his commanders.
But Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba told an online briefing that many questions remained unanswered.
""I want to clearly emphasise: it is early to say that the plane was shot down as a result of human error, as the Iranian side claims,"" he said. ""We have many questions, and we need a large number of authoritative, unbiased, objective answers about what happened.""
Iran's Revolutionary Guards shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight with a ground-to-air missile on Jan. 8 shortly after the plane took off from Tehran. Iran later called it a ""disastrous mistake"" by forces who were on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.
Tehran said last month said it would send the black box flight recorders from the downed airliner to France for analysis and that experts from the United States, Canada, France, Britain and Ukraine would take part in the decoding.

Kuleba said an Iranian delegation was due to arrive in Kiev later this month to discuss compensation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in February Kiev was not satisfied with the size of compensation Iran had offered.

Russia called off the patrol following the blast near the town of Ariha in Idlib province, which damaged one Russian and one Turkish armoured personnel carrier, the Russian ministry said.
The Russian statement said an unspecified number of Turkish troops were also hurt. Two sources said there were no Turkish casualties in the attack.
Russia was evacuating its equipment from the area and moving its troops to the Hmeimim air base where some of them would receive treatment, the Russian statement said. 
Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's war, agreed in March on a ceasefire and joint patrols following weeks of clashes that brought them to the brink of direct confrontation.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that the first federal executions in 17 years could proceed, overturning an injunction blocking them in order to allow legal challenges to the government's lethal-injection protocol to continue.
Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. district court in Washington had on Monday ordered the justice department to delay four executions scheduled for July and August.
Chutkan's order was issued less than seven hours before the execution of Daniel Lee was due to take place in Terre Haute, Indiana. The order was later affirmed by a U.S. appeals court.
""The plaintiffs in this case have not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention by a Federal Court. Last-minute stays like that issued this morning should be the extreme exception, not the norm,"" the Supreme Court said.
""The government has produced competing expert testimony of its own, indicating that any pulmonary edema occurs only after the prisoner has died or been rendered fully insensate,"" the court added.
The authorities were prepared to move forward with Lee's execution at 4 am EDT (0800 GMT) on Tuesday after the Supreme Court's decision, documents filed in the district court in Washington by Lee's lawyers showed.
""In light of the imminent and irreparable harm that he faces, Lee respectfully requests that the court immediately issue a ruling on his pending supplemental claim and motion for preliminary injunction,"" his lawyers said.
Reuters could not verify if the execution took place at 4 am EDT. The U.S. justice department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Attorney General William Barr had announced last July that the Justice Department would resume carrying out executions of some of the 62 inmates on federal death row.
He originally scheduled five executions for last December, but was ordered to delay them by Chutkan while long-running lawsuits challenging the government's lethal-injection protocol played out.

An appeals court overturned that injunction in April, and Barr announced new execution dates for July and August of four inmates, all men convicted of murdering children: Lee, Wesley Purkey, Dustin Honken and Keith Nelson.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's opposition is preparing for early elections after a crucial vote in the lower house this week showed Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin may lack a parliamentary majority, said Mohd Shafie Apdal, a potential rival for the premiership.
Muhyiddin on Monday succeeded in his bid to replace the speaker of parliament's lower house by a margin of two votes. But he fell one vote short of a simple majority with only half of the 222 lawmakers in the house voting for his motion.
""It is not even a simple majority. It is clear that it is a hung parliament,"" Mohd Shafie told a group of reporters on Tuesday.
""Elections are not far away, it's just around the corner,"" he said, anticipating Malaysia would hold a national election well before it falls due in 2023.
He said the tabling and parliamentary vote on the 2021 budget in November would be another crucial test for the government. 
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy has been grappling with political uncertainty since Muhyiddin was unexpectedly made prime minister in March by forging an alliance with the graft-tainted UMNO party that was defeated in a 2018 election. 
The opposition, which now includes his predecessor Mahathir Mohamad, has accused Muhyiddin of grabbing power by shifting allegiances instead of earning it at the ballot box, and has vowed to oust him. 
However, the opposition has been fighting over who should be their prime ministerial candidate. Ninety-five-year-old Mahathir and his ally-turned-foe Anwar Ibrahim have both declared their intentions to be the bloc's candidate, but Mahathir later threw his support behind Mohd Shafie.
A long-time UMNO stalwart, Shafie was suspended from the party in 2016 for questioning the then-prime minister Najib Razak over his handling of the 1MDB scandal. He later quit the party to form his own party based in his home state of Sabah in Malaysian Borneo, and became the state's chief minister after the 2018 polls.
Mohd Shafie said he was still weighing whether to be a candidate, and has received messages of support from some lawmakers in Anwar's party.
The opposition needs to work harder to show a united front and present clear economic policies to recover from the coronavirus pandemic to win over voters in any election, he said.
Should he be named the opposition's candidate for prime minister, Mohd Shafie would be the first from outside Peninsular Malaysia, the traditional centre of political power and economic development. 
East Malaysia on the island of Borneo contributes more than two-thirds of the country's oil and gas reserves. It is made up of Sabah and Sarawak - among the country's poorest states - which have long demanded more autonomy and a greater share of the energy revenues. 
Sarawak's ruling Gabungan Parti Sarawak coalition is aligned with Muhyiddin's administration, and with 18 lawmakers is seen as a kingmaker. 

The chief of Malaysian energy giant Petronas (PETR.UL) quit last month after a disagreement with the prime minister over giving more oil money to Sarawak, sources have told Reuters. Critics have said Muhyiddin was offering the state more oil revenues to gain its support.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China counts the costs of its most punishing flood season in more than three decades, the role played by the massive and controversial Three Gorges Dam - designed to help tame the Yangtze river - has come under fresh scrutiny. 
Amid some of the heaviest rainfall on record, the Chinese government says the world's biggest hydroelectric plant has reduced flood peaks, minimised economic losses and slashed the number of deaths and emergency evacuations. 
But critics say the historically high water levels on the Yangtze and its major lakes prove the Three Gorges Dam isn't doing what it was designed for.
""One of the major justifications for the Three Gorges Dam was flood control, but less than 20 years after its completion we have the highest floodwater in recorded history,"" said David Shankman, a geographer with the University of Alabama who studies Chinese floods. ""The fact is that it cannot prevent these severe events.""
Ye Jianchun, China's vice-minister of water resources, said at a Monday briefing the ""detailed scheduling"" of water discharges from reservoirs, particularly the Three Gorges, had been effective in controlling floods this year. 
He said 64.7 billion cubic metres of floodwater has been stored in 2,297 reservoirs, including 2.9 billion cubic metres at Three Gorges. 
The company running the Three Gorges Project also said on Saturday that downstream water discharges had been halved since July 6, ""effectively reducing the speed and extent of water level rises on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze"". The total amount of stored floodwater had now reached 88% of the reservoir's total capacity, it added. 
But parts of the Yangtze, its tributaries and major lakes like the Dongting and Poyang have hit record levels anyway. 
Fan Xiao, a Chinese geologist and long-standing critic of giant dam projects, said the storage capacity at Three Gorges amounts to less than 9% of average floodwater. 
""It can only partially and temporarily intercept the upstream floods, and is powerless to help with floods caused by heavy rainfall in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River,"" he said.
Fan said Three Gorges and other major dam projects could even make flooding worse by altering the flow of sedimentation down the Yangtze. The project's need to generate electricity has also undermined flood control, he said. 
""When people only consider using reservoirs to solve flood-control problems, they often overlook or even weaken the natural ability of rivers and their lakes to regulate floods,"" he said. 
Shankman said that the Three Gorges Dam helps alleviate flooding during normal years, but that it was always likely to be vulnerable to more extreme weather, a problem that is exacerbated by shrinking flood plains downstream. 
""The Three Gorges Dam reservoir does not have the capacity to significantly affect the most severe floods,"" he said. 

""Floodwater storage along the middle Yangtze is less because of stronger levees that are less likely to fail,"" he added. ""Both of those things are at play here. This was predictable.""

727,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>",Editing history: Hong Kong publishers self-censor under new security law,"By Sarah Wu and Joyce Zhou
HONG KONG (Reuters) - In the last two weeks, Hong Kong publisher Raymond Yeung has hastily made changes to a draft paper copy of a book entitled ""To Freedom,"" replacing the word ""revolution"" with ""protests,"" tweaking a banned slogan and cutting passages that advocate independence for the Chinese-ruled city. 
The changes were hard to make, he told Reuters, but impossible to avoid since China passed a national security law on June 30, making the broadly defined crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison. 
""This is really painful,"" Yeung said as he flipped through pages of the collection of essays by 50 protesters, lawyers, social workers and other participants in the pro-democracy demonstrations that shook Hong Kong last year. 
""This is history. This is the truth,"" he said, holding up the book with blue sticky flags on many pages to mark changes made because of the new law.
Just as demand for political books was surging in Hong Kong after a year of protests, Hong Kong's once unbridled and prolific independent publishers are now censoring themselves in the face of the new law. 
Hong Kong authorities say freedom of speech remains intact, but in the past two weeks public libraries have taken some books off the shelves, shops have removed protest-related decorations and the slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times"" has been declared illegal.
""To Freedom"" is the first political book Yeung has taken on as a part-time publisher. After Beijing introduced the security law, the book’s original printer bailed, and two other printers declined, he said. Another printer agreed to take it anonymously, but wants to get a better sense of how the law is implemented first.
The Hong Kong Trade Development Council, which organizes the annual Hong Kong Book Fair, told exhibitors not to display what it called ""unlawful books"" at this week's planned fair, but did not explain further. 
The council postponed the fair at the last minute on Monday due to a recent spike in cases of the new coronavirus. It did not specify a new date for the event, which draws about 1 million visitors.
Three non-governmental pro-Beijing groups had teamed up to urge people to report stalls at the fair selling material promoting Hong Kong independence, a subject that is anathema to the Chinese government. 
""Every citizen has a duty to report crime,"" said Innes Tang, the chairman of PolitiHK Social Strategic, one group behind the campaign. ""We are not the police. We are not the ones to say where the red line is."" 
DANGEROUS READING
Jimmy Pang, a veteran local publisher who has participated in every fair since it began in 1990, called 2020 ""the most terrifying year"" because of the security law and the economic downturn that was already hurting publishers. 
He said the law has prompted publishing houses and writers to halt projects while printers, distributors, and bookstores have turned down sensitive books.
For example, Breakazine, a local Christian publication, said it suspended the distribution of its mid-July issue called ""Dangerous Reading"" while seeking legal advice for navigating the security law. 
""Everyone is avoiding risks by suffering in silence,"" said Pang, a spokesman for 50 exhibitors at the fair.
Last year, a unit of Pang's Sub-Culture Ltd published Chan Yun-chi's ""6430,"" a book of interviews with surviving pro-democracy protesters in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the bloody 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, a subject heavily censored on the mainland. 
""In the future, there will be no sensitive books related to politics,"" he said. 
Bao Pu, the son of Bao Tong, the most senior Chinese Communist Party official jailed for sympathizing with Tiananmen protesters, founded New Century Press in 2005 in Hong Kong to publish books based on memoirs and government documents and other sources that often differ from the official versions of events in China and could not be published on the mainland. 
His customers were mostly mainland visitors, a lucrative niche in Hong Kong until China began to tighten border controls a decade ago, making it harder to bring back books to the mainland.
Given the drop off in demand, Bao said he no longer plans to publish such books in Hong Kong. But he urged other publishers to avoid self-censorship.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth's representative in Australia fired a prime minister without warning the palace - or the prime minister - because ""under the constitution the responsibility is mine"", according to archived letters released on Tuesday.
In a Nov. 11, 1975 dispatch, Governor-General John Kerr told the Queen's private secretary he took the unprecedented step to sack Prime Minister Gough Whitlam as Whitlam prepared to end a months-long budget standoff by calling a partial Senate election.
""I decided to take this step ... without informing the Palace in advance,"" Kerr wrote to former private secretary Martin Charteris on the day of Whitlam's dismissal.
""It was better for Her Majesty not to know in advance, though it is ... my duty to tell her immediately,"" Kerr added, according to the documents.
The release of 211 so-called ""palace letters"" pulls the veil from one of the great mysteries of Australian politics, and may reignite a conversation about whether the country should cut ties with Britain and become a republic.
Whitlam's firing remains one of the country's most polarising political events because it represented an unprecedented level of intervention by the Commonwealth.
Historians say the country was never told the full story, and in 2016 a historian sued the National Archives of Australia for access to letters between Kerr and the queen. The lawsuit failed on grounds that the letters were private, but the High Court overturned the ruling in May.
The letters show Kerr and Buckingham Palace discussed the political crisis gripping the country, and Kerr's role in it, for two months before Whitlam's sacking as the prime minister tried to get parliament to approve his Budget. 
His efforts were rewarded, by the palace at least. The day after he sacked Whitlam, Charteris congratulated Kerr on his judgment.
""In not informing The Queen what you intended to do before doing it, you acted not only with perfect constitutional propriety but also with consideration for Her Majesty's position,"" he wrote.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's annual defence review accuses China of pushing its territorial claims amid the coronavirus pandemic and suspects Beijing of spreading propaganda and disinformation as it provides medical aid to nations fighting COVID-19. 
China ""is continuing to attempt to alter the status quo in the East China Sea and the South China Sea,"" Japan said in the defence white paper approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government on Tuesday. 
The white paper described ""relentless"" intrusions in waters around a group of islets claimed by both nations in the East China Sea, known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. 
In the South China Sea, it said Beijing was asserting territorial claims by establishing administrative districts around disputed islands, that forced countries distracted by the coronavirus outbreak to respond.
Japan's criticism of China echoes similar comments made by the United States, and comes as tension in the region increases as Beijing and Washington conduct separate military drills in the resource-rich South China Sea and as relations between the world's two largest economies deteriorated.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday rejected China's disputed claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea, saying they were ""completely unlawful"".
Beijing insists its intentions in the waterway, through which around $3 trillion of global trade passes each year, are peaceful.
Japan sees China as a longer-term and more serious threat than nuclear-armed North Korea. Beijing now spends four times as much as Tokyo on defence as it builds a large modern military. 
Japan's defence review also claimed China appeared to be responsible for ""propaganda"" and ""disinformation"" amid ""social uncertainties and confusion"" caused by the coronavirus outbreak. 
Such disinformation included online claims that the coronavirus was brought to China by a U.S. military member, or that Chinese herbal remedies could treat COVID-19, a defence ministry official said at a briefing.
Other threats faced by Japan include North Korea's ongoing development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles as well as a resurgence of military activity by Russia in the skies and waters in Japan, at times in joint drills with China, the defence review said.

730,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 13, 2020 10:40PM ET</span>",More fighting as Taiwan opposition again occupies parliament,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's main opposition party again occupied parliament on Tuesday to protest against the nomination of a close aide to the president to a top-level watchdog, after fighting with ruling party lawmakers to get into the building.
Violence and protests inside the chamber are not unusual in Taiwan, a spirited democracy where passions often run over.
Last month fights erupted inside the chamber after lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) broke through barricades erected by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who had occupied it to protest against government ""tyranny"".
The KMT has been protesting President Tsai Ing-wen's nomination of her senior aide Chen Chu to head the Control Yuan, an independent government watchdog, saying it is ""political cronyism"". 
Lawmakers from both parties fought outside the building before a group of KMT legislators got into parliament's main chamber, occupying the central podium seeking to prevent a confirmation hearing for Chen.
KMT lawmakers overturned the stand where Chen was due to speak, unveiling banners reading ""no to cronyism, withdraw the nomination"".
""We cannot accept this and are resolutely opposed to it,"" KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang told supporters outside parliament.
Chen posted a picture on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of herself inside parliament reading papers, saying she was preparing for the hearing.
""I hope all parties can get back to official business. We will discuss matters in a democratic parliament and discuss them rationally,"" she wrote.
The DPP has a large parliamentary majority, and has been angered by the targeting of Chen, who was jailed in 1980 for helping lead pro-democracy demonstrations against the then-KMT government when Taiwan was a dictatorship.
The KMT was trounced in January's parliamentary and presidential elections, having failed to shake off accusations they were too pro-China. 
The party traditionally favours close ties with China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory.
The KMT-led Republic of China government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after loosing the Chinese civil war to Mao Zedong's Communist Party.

In its annual white paper released Tuesday, the ministry accused China of “relentlessly’ pushing its way toward uninhabited East China Sea islands claimed by the two countries, saying it was becoming “a matter of grave concern.” The ministry also accused China of spreading disinformation about Covid-19.
The Defense of Japan white paper comes after fresh ripples between Japan and its sole military ally, the U.S., following Tokyo’s decision last month to drop deployment plans for a $5 billion  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). missile-defense system. The Trump administration has sought more money from Japan and other countries that host U.S. troops.
Despite those hiccups, the U.S. has still found Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to be one of the staunchest supporters of President Donald Trump’s security policies, including those for China and North Korea. Abe has spent much of his almost eight-year tenure trying to repair ties with China while maintaining Japan’s postwar alliance with the U.S.
“China is steadily increasing its capabilities to conduct operations in more distant seas,” the yearly defense paper said. The paper compiled over several months reaffirmed Japan’s position on the South China Sea, where it said Beijing was pushing forward with militarization and “continuing unilateral attempts to change the status quo by coercion to create a fait accompli.”
The Japanese report follows a Pentagon assessment that determined China to be advancing military and territorial footholds in the South China Sea. On Monday, the Trump administration rejected China’s expansive maritime claims in that water body, reversing a previous policy of not taking sides in such disputes.
U.S. Denounces China’s Claims to South China Sea as Unlawful
“We are making clear: Beijing’s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them,” U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said. “The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire.”
U.S. Protests
Japan reiterated that it believed China could use its global Belt and Road infrastructure initiative to push its People’s Liberation Army into the Indian and Pacific Ocean regions.
Japan Frets ‘Belt and Road’ Could Give Cover to China’s Military
The U.S. earlier this month sent the USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz aircraft carriers to the South China Sea for military exercises as China held its own drills in the area. Beijing’s moves have drawn protests from Washington amid worsening relations between the world’s two biggest economies.
Japan and Australia have also jointly criticized China’s militarization of the disputed waters as they face souring relations with their largest trading partner.
Ties between China and Japan deteriorated to their worst point in decades after Japan purchased part of a disputed island chain from a private owner in 2012. Relations slowly returned to a relatively even keel, but coast guard and military vessels from both countries continue to follow one another around the islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyus in China.
Japan was also worried about a series of new, solid-fuel ballistic missiles that North Korea began testing last year. Japan already believes that Kim Jong Un’s regime can miniaturize a nuclear warhead to place on a missile, and that the new series of rockets are designed to avoid defense systems.
Kim Jong Un’s ‘Son of Scud’ Poses New Threat to U.S. Troops
Kim has rolled out new solid-fuel ballistic missiles that are easier to move, hide and fire than many liquid-fuel versions. These include the nuclear-capable, hypersonic KN-23 missiles that can strike all of South Korea -- and perhaps even parts of Japan.
“These enhancements in its capabilities make early detection of the signs of a launch and the interceptions of missiles more difficult,” the paper said.
Japan abandoned the U.S.-backed Aegis Ashore ballistic-missile defense program after a backlash among residents where two batteries were supposed to be based. Plans to introduce the Lockheed interceptors, which helped fuel a record $47 billion defense budget for 2019, quickly ran into public hostility, particularly after a series of official gaffes. The purchase had followed pressure from Trump to step up defense purchases back in 2017.

Preliminary results showed a group of young democrats, or ""localists"", performed strongly in the elections that drew more than 600,000 votes, reflecting a potential change of guard to a more radical grouping likely to rile authorities in Beijing.
The primary polls are aimed at selecting democracy candidates who stand the best chance of success in September elections for the Legislative Council, Hong Kong's governing body. Final results are due later on Tuesday.
Many observers see the election as a symbolic protest vote against the tough new security law that punishes what Beijing broadly defines as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
""The goal of organiser Benny Tai and the opposition camp is to seize the ruling power of Hong Kong and ... carry out a Hong Kong version of 'color revolution',"" a spokesman for the Liaison Office said in a statement just before midnight on Monday.
Luo Huining, the head of the Liaison Office, will have oversight over the implementation of the contentious security law that will also allow mainland security agents to be officially based in China's freest city for the first time. 
Critics of the law fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, while supporters say it will bring stability to the city after a year of sometimes violent anti-government protests. 
The law has drawn condemnation from Western nations, with the European Union saying on Monday it is working on measures to punish Beijing for the move, including a possible review of EU governments' extradition treaties' with the financial hub and offering more visas to its citizens.
The law has also seen countries such as Britain and Canada caution citizens over an increased risk of arbitrary detention in Hong Kong and possible extradition to mainland China where they could face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. 
Australia last week said it was suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong due to the security law and was offering students, graduates and workers in Australia on temporary visas the opportunity to stay and work for an additional five years. 
Finland said on Monday the Nordic country's extradition treaty with Hong Kong should not be applied as the security law means people could be transferred to mainland China.

The U.N. Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression said on Monday he was ""extremely concerned"" about the future of Hong Kong following the adoption of the new national security law.

Muller became opposition leader in May, following a string of opinion polls that showed Ardern's Labour Party was set to retain power. 
But he said the role had taxed his health and he wanted to spend more time with his family.
""The role has taken a heavy toll on me personally, and on my family, and this has become untenable from a health perspective,"" he said in a statement. 
New Zealand media reported deputy National Party leader Nikki Kaye will lead the party until a permanent leader is selected. It will be the opposition’s third leader in four months.
Muller was embroiled in a scandal as opposition leader when a National member of parliament leaked confidential information about New Zealand's coronavirus cases to the media. The incident dealt a severe blow to the opposition's electoral chances. 
Ardern passed on her best wishes for Muller and his family. 
""No matter what side of Parliament you're sitting, politics is a difficult place,"" the prime minister said in a statement.
New Zealand goes to the polls in September in what is expected to be a coronavirus-dominated campaign.
Recent opinion polls have predicted that Labour could govern on its own, without needing a coalition partner, helped by the soaring popularity of Ardern with most New Zealanders approving of her government's handling of the crisis.
New Zealand had 25 active cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday, all from returning New Zealanders from overseas. It has recorded 22 deaths from nearly 1,200 confirmed cases.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil is restructuring the space agency team responsible for monitoring deforestation including reassigning a key manager, a move that enviromentalists said raised concerns of political interference as destruction soars in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
The federal government initially announced on Monday morning in the official gazette that coordinator Lubia Vinhas had been dismissed from her position as head of the earth observation team at space agency Inpe, without offering an explanation.
The announcement came after Inpe data on Friday showed that deforestation had increased for the 14th consecutive month and was up 25% in the first six months of the year, compared to the same period a year ago.
On Monday evening, Inpe released a statement on its website saying Vinhas had been reassigned as part of an existing larger restructuring to improve the agency's operations. She will lead a special project to launch a ""georeferencing"" database, and her department will be merged with meterological and other departments, it said.
Vinhas did not respond to emailed requests for comment.
The timing of the firing raises questions about whether it was politically motivated, said Marcio Astrini, head of the Brazilian non-governmental organization Climate Observatory.
""At a minimum, it's very strange that a manager at Inpe that handles the deforestation data would be dismissed on the next (working) day after the release of deforestation data,"" said Astrini.
Astrini cited last year's high-profile firing of the top official at Inpe, director Ricardo Galvao, by President Jair Bolsonaro, shortly after the release of data showing worsening deforestation that angered the right-wing leader.
""At the least, it creates distrust in the government's intentions,"" Astrini said
Inpe said it has been forced to restructure due to staff shortages caused by budget cuts.

SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Hundreds of firefighters battled through a second day from the air, land and water on Monday to save a U.S. war vessel swept by flames while moored at a San Diego shipyard, as the number of sailors and civilians injured in the blaze rose to nearly 60.
The USS Bonhomme Richard, an amphibious assault ship whose size ranks second in the U.S. Navy fleet to that of an aircraft carrier, remained largely shrouded in thick, acrid smoke on Monday as the vessel began listing to its starboard side.
The fire, accompanied by at least one large explosion, erupted Sunday morning in the lower cargo hold of the 844-foot-long (257 meter) ship, docked for routine maintenance at its home port at U.S. Naval Base San Diego.
Since then, flames have spread upward throughout much of the ship and into the tower and other structures on the top of the vessel, Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck told a late-morning news conference.
Because it was undergoing repairs at the time, only about 160 of the ship's usual contingent of 1,000 crew members were aboard at the time, and all major munitions had already been removed from the vessel as a standard safety practice, Navy officials said.
Helicopters dropped water over the ship throughout Monday while fire boats on the perimeter streamed water on the hull to cool it from the outside. San Diego fire crews discontinued blasting water into the ship from shore, apparently out of concern for destabilizing the vessel's buoyancy.
Asked whether the ship might be burned beyond repair, Sobeck said he was ""hopeful"" it could be spared. ""Once we get the fire out, which is our priority, then we'll make that assessment.""
The fire's cause was unknown, but a Navy spokesman told Reuters there was no evidence of foul play.
The Navy said 36 sailors and 23 civilians had been treated for minor injuries, including heat exhaustion and smoke inhalation, and no personnel remained hospitalized. 

The Bonhomme Richard, commissioned in 1998, is designed to carry U.S. Marine Corps attack helicopters and ground troops into battle.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday rejected China's disputed claims to offshore resources in most of the South China Sea, a move that may further sour the fraught ties between the world's largest two economies.
China has offered no coherent legal basis for its ambitions in the South China Sea and for years has been using intimidation against other South Asian coastal states, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
""We are making clear: Beijing’s claims to offshore resources across most of the South China Sea are completely unlawful, as is its campaign of bullying to control them,"" said Pompeo, a prominent China hawk within the Trump administration.
The United States has long opposed China's expansive territorial claims on the South China Sea, sending warships regularly through the strategic waterway to demonstrate freedom of navigation there. Monday's comments reflect a harsher tone.
""The world will not allow Beijing to treat the South China Sea as its maritime empire,"" Pompeo said.
Regional analysts said it would be vital to see whether other nations adopt the U.S. stance and what, if anything, Washington might do to reinforce its position and prevent Beijing from creating ""facts on the water"" to buttress its claims.
The relationship between the United States and China has grown increasingly tense over the past six months over Beijing's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, its tightened grip on Hong Kong and its crackdown on China's Uighur Muslim community.
China claims 90% of the potentially energy-rich South China Sea, but Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of it, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year. Beijing has built bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful.
Beijing routinely outlines the scope of its claims with reference to the so-called nine-dashed line that encompasses about nine-tenths of the 3.5-million-square-kilometer South China Sea on Chinese maps.
""This is basically the first time we have called it illegitimate,"" said Chris Johnson, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. It's ""fine to put out a statement, but what you going to do about it?""

The latest figures, revised from 61,000 in January, paint an ever-grimmer picture of the scale of bloodshed and suffering in Mexico, where a record 34,582 people were murdered last year.
Mexico has been racked by violence for years as successive governments battled vicious drug cartels, often by taking out their leaders. That has resulted in a fragmentation of gangs and increasingly vicious internecine fighting.
The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised a new strategy after taking power in December 2018 but has struggled to tame the cartel violence - even during the coronavirus pandemic.
The number of disappeared was revised after an exhaustive search for cases that were recorded with state prosecutors and local authorities, but which never made it into the national databases, authorities said.
Most victims were disappeared amid an epidemic of violence after the so-called ""war on drugs"" began in late 2006, data showed. About 1,523 of the cases relate to a period between 1964 to 2005.
Alejandro Encinas, Mexico's deputy minister for human rights, said Mexico has since 2006 unearthed 3,978 clandestine graves, from which 6,625 bodies have been exhumed.
Almost 30% of the graves have been discovered during the administration of Lopez Obrador, who has promised to focus on the issue.
Despite Monday's jump in the total number of disappeared, Encinas said disappearances had declined sharply in the first six months of the year, falling 36.6% compared to the same period last year. 
But some of the decline may be due to under-reporting during the pandemic, he added.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain faces a potentially more deadly second wave of COVID-19 in the coming winter that could kill up to 120,000 people over nine months in a worst-case scenario, health experts said on Tuesday.
With COVID-19 more likely to spread in winter as people spend more time together in enclosed spaces, a second wave of the pandemic ""could be more serious than the one we've just been through,"" said Stephen Holgate, a professor and co-lead author of a report by Britain's Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS).
""This is not a prediction, but it is a possibility,"" Holgate told an online briefing. ""Deaths could be higher with a new wave of COVID-19 this winter, but the risk of this happening could be reduced if we take action immediately.""
The United Kingdom's current death toll from confirmed cases of COVID-19 is around 45,000, the highest in Europe. Including suspected cases, more than 55,000 people have died, according to a Reuters tally of official data sources. 
The AMS said there is a ""high degree of uncertainty"" about how the UK's COVID-19 epidemic will evolve, but outlined a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"" where the reproduction number -- or R value -- rises to 1.7 from September 2020 onwards.
The R value -- the average number of people an infected person will pass a disease on to -- is currently between 0.7 and 0.9 in the UK and daily case and death numbers are falling. An R value above 1 can lead to exponential growth.
""The modelling estimates 119,900 hospital deaths between September 2020 and June 2021,"" the AMS report said, more than double the number that occurred during the first wave.
AMS vice president Anne Johnson said a bad winter flu season, combined with large backlog of patients suffering other diseases and chronic conditions, would add to huge pressure on health services -- underlining a need to prepare now.
""COVID-19 has not gone away,"" she said. ""We need to do everything we can to stay healthy this winter.""

(Reuters) - The U.S. National Football League's Washington team announced on Monday it will retire its Redskins name and logo, which it has used since 1933 but which has long been criticized as racist by Native American rights groups.
Team owner Dan Snyder, who bought the franchise in 1999, had previously said he would never change the name but softened his stance after FedEx Corp (N:FDX), which owns the naming rights to the team's suburban stadium in Landover, Maryland, urged the NFL club to rebrand.
The team said on July 3 it would conduct a thorough review of the club's name.
""Today, we are announcing we will be retiring the Redskins name and logo upon completion of this review,"" the team said in a statement.
The team did not provide a timeline for when the review would be completed. Its statement did not specify a reason for the name change.
Critics have ramped up pressure on the team to change its name, which is widely seen as a racial slur against Native Americans, amid the nationwide reckoning on racism and police brutality triggered by the May 25 death of a Black man named George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis.
In June, a group of more than 80 socially minded investment firms, collectively with more than $620 billion in assets under management, urged FedEx,  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) and PepsiCo Inc (O:PEP) to terminate relationships with the team unless it changed its name.
PepsiCo and Nike both followed FedEx's lead and said they welcomed the call for a review of the team's name.
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said at a news briefing that she had not yet spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the team's decision but reiterated comments he made recently in which he said the name stands for ""strength.""
""Last week, his tweet made it clear that these teams name their teams out of strength, not weakness,"" said McEnany.
""And he says that he believes the Native American community would be very angry at this and he does have polling to back him up,"" she added, citing an old Washington Post poll that showed 90% of Native Americans were not offended by the name.
The National Congress of American Indians said in a statement on Monday: ""We commend the Washington NFL team for eliminating a brand that disrespected, demeaned, and stereotyped all Native people, and we call on all other sports teams and corporate brands to retire all caricatures of Native Americans that they use as their mascots.""
The team that became the Washington Redskins was founded in 1932 as the Boston Braves. Its name was changed to the Redskins the following year and it moved to Washington in 1937. Many American professional and collegiate sports teams have nicknames on Native American themes. 
Snyder and Ron Rivera, the team's new head coach, ""are working closely to develop a new name and design approach that will enhance the standing of our proud, tradition rich franchise and inspire our sponsors, fans and community for the next 100 years,"" the team said.
The team has won three Super Bowls and is one of the NFL's marquee franchises, ranked by Forbes last September as the league's seventh most valuable franchise at $3.4 billion.
In June, a memorial to the team's founding owner, George Preston Marshall, who fought against the racial integration of the NFL, was removed from RFK Stadium, the team's former home in Washington.

The NFL did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the team's announcement.

Central African Republic has been rocked by violence since 2013 when mainly Muslim Selaka rebels ousted then president Francois Bozize, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militias. U.N. peacekeepers were deployed in 2014.
Violence waned after a peace accord was signed in February 2019 between the government and 14 armed groups including the 3R, following talks in Khartoum.

The monarch told British lawmakers the only path to a comprehensive and lasting Middle East peace was the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on land captured by Israel in the 1967 war, and with East Jerusalem as its capital.
""Any unilateral Israeli measure to annex lands in the West Bank is unacceptable, as it would undermine the prospects of achieving peace and stability in the Middle East,"" the monarch was quoted in a palace statement as telling British foreign and defence parliamentary committee members in a virtual meeting.
Jordan has led a diplomatic campaign along with most other European countries that opposes Israeli plans that envisage annexing parts of the occupied West Bank as part of a deal being promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.
King Abdullah, a staunch U.S. ally, has also in recent months warned that Israeli policies along with Trump's peace plan would lead to conflict and deal a blow to Israeli-Jordanian relations.
Amman lost the West Bank including East Jerusalem to Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Jordan is the second Arab country after Egypt to sign a peace treaty with Israel and many of its more than 7 million citizens are of Palestinian origin.

Johnson said last week that tighter rules on wearing face coverings might be needed but a senior minister - Cabinet Secretary Michael Gove - said on Sunday that wearing masks should be left instead to people's common sense.

People who fail to wear a face covering will face a fine of up to 100 pounds ($126) – in line with existing fines for people who do not cover their face on public transport - which would fall to 50 pounds if paid within 14 days.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan declared a state of emergency in the conflict-ridden western region of Darfur after violence and unrest in two towns, state news agency SUNA said.
The African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) said it had sent a team to Kutum town in North Darfur following the reported burning of a police station and cars by unidentified protesters. It gave no details.
Protesters demanded on Sunday better security and a civilian state government, a resident said. State governor positions are held in Sudan by military officers despite the toppling of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in April.
Separately, another resident told Reuters an unidentified militia had attacked on Monday another sit-in in Fatabarno, a village in the same area.
No more details were available about the two incidents. 
Peaceful sit-ins have sprung up in towns across Darfur and in other parts of Sudan, which also protesting the presence of armed militias.
Conflict started in Darfur in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against the Khartoum government. Government forces and mainly Arab militia, which moved to repress the revolt, were accused of widespread atrocities. Some 300,000 people were killed in the conflict, according to U.N. estimates.
There has been no serious fighting for years but the conflict remains unresolved as Arab militias are still present and have control over land they seized. 
The transition civilian Khartoum government, in power with military since Bashir's toppling, has vowed to end the conflict and is holding talks with some of the rebel groups that had fought Bashir's government in Darfur and elsewhere in the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's executive clemency to his longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone not only commuted the veteran Republican operative's prison term but it also spared him a hefty fine and two years of supervised release.
The details of the clemency arrangement were made public by the Justice Department and Stone's lawyer on Monday after the judge who presided over the case asked the Trump administration to explain whether the commutation announced on Friday meant he would not be supervised, as many convicted felons are after being freed.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson had set a Tuesday deadline to receive a copy of Trump's clemency order along with an explanation about whether it also commuted the period Stone was meant to be supervised after leaving prison. 
""I commute the entirety of the prison sentence imposed upon the said Roger Stone, Jr. to expire immediately,"" according to Trump's order. 
""I also commute the entirety of the two-year term of supervised released with all its conditions, and finally, I remit any unpaid balance of the $20,000 fine imposed.""
Congressional Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of abuse of power and an assault on the rule of law.
Stone, 67, was sentenced to three years and four months in prison after being convicted by a jury in Washington last year of lying under oath to lawmakers investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. Stone was found guilty of all seven counts against him. The commutation did not erase Stone's conviction as a pardon would have.
Stone was due to have reported to a federal prison in Georgia on Tuesday. Trump's action marked his most assertive intervention to protect an associate in a criminal case and his latest use of executive clemency to benefit an ally.

Stone's attorney Grant Smith, who tweeted out a copy of Trump's order, said it speaks for itself in answering the judge's inquiry.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized on Monday for taking part in a Cabinet decision to use a charity he and his family have worked with to administer a $900 million ($663.4 million) student grant program.
Trudeau, 48, is facing a third investigation for conflict of interest in a little over three years after his government tapped WE Charity Canada on June 25 to manage the program. The charity backed out about a week after the contract was announced.
""I made a mistake in not recusing myself immediately from the discussions, given our family's history, and I'm sincerely sorry about not having done that,"" Trudeau said at a news conference.
It is the second time in less than a year that the prime minister has apologized publicly for his actions in a live, nationally televised news conference. The first time was in September after decades-old images of him in blackface emerged.
""I was very aware that members of my family had worked with and contributed to the WE organization, but I was unaware of the details of their remuneration,"" Trudeau said.
WE Charity disclosed last week that from 2016-2020 it paid honoraria to Trudeau's mother, Margaret, amounting to C$250,000 for speaking at some 28 events, while his brother, Alexandre, received about C$32,000.
Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, have regularly participated in WE Charity events, and Gregoire Trudeau hosts a podcast on the charity's website for which she is not paid.
Also on Monday, Finance Minister Bill Morneau, whose daughter works at WE Charity, offered a similar apology. ""I will recuse myself from any future discussions related to WE,"" Morneau said.
The grant program, meant to help students struggling to find summer jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic, has been stymied by the controversy, and the government is now looking for a different way to administer it.

LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Monday it would launch a review after its head was rebuked by a London judge for being vulnerable to flattery from a freelance agent during a high-profile bribery investigation into oil consultancy Unaoil.
Judge Martin Beddoe said SFO head Lisa Osofsky and senior colleagues had ""taken the bait"" when an American agent acting for the prominent Ahsani family, which ran Unaoil, had promised to secure guilty pleas in the British investigation into other Unaoil managers.
The SFO should have had ""nothing to do"" with David Tinsley, who was not the lawyer of a defendant, or employed by a U.S. government agency, but was a ""freelance agent who was patently acting only in the interests of the Ahsanis"", he said.
""DT (David Tinsley) was not hesitant in flattering Ms Osofsky and talking up her talents, and unfortunately Ms Osofsky made herself vulnerable to them,"" Beddoe said. 
The SFO said it accepted the criticisms and that a review was in hand, but stressed that the judge had found no evidence of bad faith or unlawful behaviour.
""A review will be conducted into this matter, and a protocol covering contact with non-legal representatives has been put in place,"" it added.
The judgment was made public on Monday after reporting restrictions were lifted on the convictions of two former Unaoil managers, Ziad Akle and Stephen Whiteley, after a London trial.
Tinsley established contact with Osofsky and other senior SFO staff around September 2018, saying he wanted to mend a frayed relationship between the SFO and FBI and ""build something great"", according to the judgment, after a bruising court battle in Italy in 2018 over who would prosecute Saman Ahsani. 
Saman, Unaoil's former chief operating officer, and his brother Cyrus, the company's former chief executive, pleaded guilty in the United States last year.
On Feb. 4, 2019, Tinsley sent an article to Osofsky, a dual national British American and former FBI lawyer, with the message ""mercy means valuing relationships over rules"". Osofsky responded that the message was ""inspiring"", according to the judgment.
Beddoe said he was not sure what the expression meant and cautioned that he had not seen the full communications.
""...but if it is an invitation or excuse not to apply the rule of law before the application of mercy, I doubt that it has proper application to the work of the SFO,"" he said.
Tinsley, a retired U.S. drug enforcement (DEA) supervisory special agent who founded Miami-based investigative company 5 Stones Intelligences, said his comments had been taken out of context by Akle's lawyers.
They had been designed to show how moved he had been by Osofsky's ""extraordinary kindness"" to an SFO officer facing a challenging personal period, he said, adding that to suggest otherwise was ""shameless"".
The insight into the backdrop to the criminal inquiry came to light after Akle's lawyers argued that their client faced an unfair trial because of the SFO's behaviour.
Beddoe, who rejected Akle's application in January, noted there was no evidence that the SFO gave Tinsley any sensitive information or that Akle acted against his own interests.
Akle's lawyers said on Monday they would refer his conviction to the Court of Appeal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A laboratory that was revealed last week to have been testing the purity of a lethal-injection drug for the U.S. Department of Justice has said it will no longer test the drug if it is intended for executions. 
DYNALABS, in St. Louis, Missouri, announced the new policy after Reuters published an investigation on Friday that named some of the companies involved in a secret supply chain to make and test a drug ahead of the first federal executions in 17 years.
Two of the testing laboratories identified, including DYNALABS, told Reuters they did not know the samples of the drug, pentobarbital, belonged to the Justice Department, nor that it was intended for executions.
DYNALABS says it will ask any pharmacy that sends it pentobarbital, a barbiturate doctors use to treat seizures and other conditions, to sign an attestation.
""It will be our policy going forward to require a statement from our client indicating their preparation will not be used for execution,"" Michael Pruett and Russell Odegard, DYNALABS' co-founders, said in a statement published on Friday on their website. ""Clients that decline to make that declaration will not be allowed to submit their pentobarbital preparations to DYNALABS for testing.""
The first federal execution since 2003 were due to take this week. But a federal judge ordered their delay while the condemned men continue their legal challenge over the lethal-injection protocol.
The Justice Department had relied on test results showing that its pentobarbital was potent and uncontaminated as it argued in court that it was taking care not to breach a constitutional ban on ""cruel and unusual punishments."" 
The department has said it requires two independent testing labs to check pentobarbital samples prior to an execution.
The department has hired a so-called compounding pharmacy, which mixes tailored drugs to order, to make the pentobarbital. The identity of the pharmacy and other contractors has been kept secret by the department, which has argued that companies are unwilling to help with executions unless their identities are hidden.
A Justice Department spokesman did not respond to requests for comment about DYNALABS' new policy.
Two other laboratories involved, ARL Bio Pharma Inc in Oklahoma City and Eagle Analytical Services Inc in Houston, had also confirmed they had produced the test results cited by the Justice Department in court filings, and that the work had been commissioned by a compounding pharmacy.

Neither company immediately responded to requests for comment on DYNALABS' policy.

The law makes it mandatory for companies to have sufficient financial reserves to prevent potential spills or clean them up if they occur. The financial reserves can take various forms, including an insurance contract or a letter of guarantee to pay the damage from a given accident.
The law also requires companies handling hydrocarbons to draw up plans to prevent and clean up spills by Jan. 1, 2024. 
In late May, a fuel tank at a power station in the Arctic city of Norilsk leaked 21,000 tonnes of diesel into rivers and subsoil, an incident that the environmental campaign Greenpeace compared to the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez oil spill.
The Kremlin has said the new legislation is aimed at preventing similar spills.

The mining company Norilsk Nickel has pledged to ""eliminate the consequences of the accident at its own expense"", and is challenging a request for more than $2 billion from Russia's environmental watchdog, which has said the damage to the Arctic could be unprecedented.

Los Angeles and San Diego rank as the two largest public school districts in California, with about 706,000 students and 88,000 employees combined on more than 1,500 campuses overall. Los Angeles is the second-largest school district in the United States.
The two districts closed their schools and shifted to online instruction in mid-March as the coronavirus outbreak was spreading in California, days before Governor Gavin Newsom issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-home orders and mandatory workplace closures.
In Monday's joint announcement, the Los Angeles school district said it will resume online instruction for the new academic year on Aug. 18, and San Diego will follow suit on Aug. 31.
Both districts said they would continue planning for a return to in-classroom lessons during the upcoming 2020-21 academic year, as soon as public health conditions allow.
The joint statement said that much of prevailing scientific research and public health guidelines regarding the coronavirus pandemic are ""vague and contradictory."" It also pointed to the countries that have safely reopened their schools, saying they have done so with declining infection rates and on-demand testing available.
""California has neither,"" the statement said, adding, ""The skyrocketing infection rates of the past few weeks make it clear the pandemic is not under control.""

Similar protests in at least 10 other cities criticised prosecutors' failure to address genuine high-level graft, which they said was undermining the rule of law in the European Union's poorest country. Many yelled ""Mafia!"" and ""Resign!"".
The Balkan nation, ranked as the most corrupt EU member state by the graft watchdog Transparency International, has yet to convict a single senior official of corruption.
""I am here to protest against the corruption that has engulfed this country, against the oligarchs who have slipped into each and every sphere of the public administration,"" said 42-year-old protester Lachezar Lazarov.
Borissov has been in office almost without a break since 2009. He has pledged to uproot high-level corruption, but critics say public institutions have weakened and the power of tycoons has grown on his watch. A parliamentary election is scheduled for next spring. 
Public anger broke out last week after prosecutors raided the offices of President Rumen Radev, a vehement critic of Borissov, as part of probes into two of Radev's aides.
Many saw the move as an attack on the president, who has often criticised Borissov's centre-right government on the same grounds as the protesters and called for his resignation.
The protests have shown no sign of dwindling in size and more are planned for later in the week.
The opposition Socialists, who backed Radev for president, have said they will put forward a motion of no confidence in the government on Wednesday. 

On Monday, some of the protesters also demanded the resignation of the interior minister over police violence at Friday's protests, when 18 people were arrested, including two young men who were taken to hospital after being beaten. The police said they were investigating.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Lebanese man accused of financing Hezbollah was freed from jail in the United States last month as a result of indirect contacts between Tehran and Washington that are expected to yield more releases, three senior Middle East officials said.
Kassim Tajideen was released on June 11, according to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Prisons, and arrived in Lebanon last week. Two of the sources said his release was part of the same track that last year yielded the release of Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese businessman with U.S. permanent residency, from Iran, and Sam Goodwin, a U.S. citizen, from Syria.
Tajideen was released due to health concerns and reports that the release was part of a backroom deal were false, a Department of State spokesperson said. 
Tajideen's lawyer, Chibli Mallat, also denied that the release had anything to do with the release of other prisoners. ""It was a purely judicial operation,"" he said.
Tajideen, 65, pleaded guilty in 2018 to charges associated with violating U.S. sanctions imposed on him and was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $50 million. 
In 2009, the United States designated Tajideen as an important financial supporter of Hezbollah, a heavily armed, Iran-backed Lebanese Shi'ite group that is classified as a terrorist group by Washington. He was extradited to the United States after being arrested in Morocco in 2017. 
Tajideen has always denied supporting Hezbollah and disputed his designation as a terrorist financier, said Mallat. 
A judge ordered Tajideen's release on May 27 pending a 14-day quarantine on the basis of a motion submitted by his lawyers arguing that he should be freed due to the risks of COVID-19 in jail, Mallat said. He was being held in Maryland.
The reasons for his release are under seal in the United States.
The U.S. government had opposed the release but would abide by the court's decision, said the State Department spokesperson.
The sources - a senior official in the Middle East, a senior Lebanese official and a regional diplomat - said the release was the result of ""indirect understandings"" between Tehran and Washington.    
""The release of Tajideen comes within a long path of exchange operations that will happen later on a wide level. There are still those who will be released by the two sides. This operation will continue,"" the Middle Eastern official said.
The regional diplomat also described Tajideen's release as a prelude to further possible deals involving around 20 people. ""All parties involved are testing each other as there is zero trust,"" he said.
Major General Abbas Ibrahim, the head of Lebanon's General Security agency, is acting as the main mediator in the process, two of the sources said. General Security declined to comment.
The senior Lebanese official said the process had been going on in complete secrecy and had started with the handing over of Goodwin and other foreigners held by Syria, whose government is allied to Iran and Hezbollah.

Toddler Davell Gardner Jr. was killed and three men were wounded on Sunday after two gunmen opened fire at a family cookout in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, New York media reported, citing New York police. The three wounded men were expected to survive.
""It's just horrifying,"" de Blasio said at a news conference to discuss the coronavirus. ""A baby boy, Davell Gardner Jr., one years old, playing at a playground. Davell was just starting his life and his life was full of possibilities. And now he's gone.""
The sharp rise in shootings in New York, Chicago and other U.S. cities, coming in the midst of the social disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic, runs counter to a 20-year trend toward lower crime.
Davell's shooting was one of 11 incidents in which 16 people in New York were shot over the weekend, WABC television reported. Shootings were up more than 50 percent this year over 2019 with 585 incidents reported as of July 5, the New York Times said. 
Police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for an account of the incident.
The boy was in his stroller around 11:30 p.m. when two men dressed in black approached, fired and fled, the New York Times reported, citing police. Davell, who was hit in the abdomen, died at the hospital, the Times said.
De Blasio mentioned a separate weekend incident in which a 12-year-old was shot in the leg.

""You can never look away from something like this and be numb to it. I'm just heartbroken today,"" de Blasio said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China announced ""corresponding sanctions"" against the United States on Monday after Washington penalized senior Chinese officials over the treatment of Uighur Muslims in its Xinjiang region. 
China's move comes as relations between the world's two biggest economic powerhouses have slumped over disagreements on issues including the coronavirus pandemic, trade, Huawei and a sweeping national security law imposed on Hong Kong.
The sanctions targeted Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, Representative Chris Smith, Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom Sam Brownback and the U.S. Congressional-Executive Commission on China.
Rubio, Cruz and Smith have all sponsored legislation over human rights issues in China, and such measures have received strong support in the U.S. Congress from members of both parties. Rubio, Cruz and Smith are members of President Donald Trump's Republican Party.
""The U.S. actions seriously interfere in China's internal affairs, seriously violate the basic norms of international relations and seriously damage Sino-U.S. relations,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters.
""China will make further responses based on how the situation develops.""
Hua did not elaborate.
U.N. experts and activists say at least a million ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims are held in detention centres in Xinjiang. China describes them as training centres helping stamp out terrorism and extremism and giving people new skills.
The Congressional-Executive Commission on China monitors human rights and the rule of law and submits an annual report to Trump and Congress. Rubio is a co-chairman.
The lawmakers expressed no concern about the sanctions. Rubio made light of them on Twitter, asking, ""I guess they don't like me?"" 
Cruz, also on Twitter, commented that the Chinese Communist Party was ""terrified and lashing out.""

Washington's measures against Chinese officials, including the Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang, involve freezing U.S. assets, travel bans and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.

TERRE HAUTE, Indiana (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge issued an injunction on Monday delaying what would have been the first federal execution in 17 years, scheduled for later in the day, thwarting at least for now the Trump administration's goal of reviving capital punishment at the federal level.
Judge Tanya Chutkan of the U.S. district court in Washington ordered the U.S. Department of Justice to delay four executions scheduled for July and August to allow continuation of the condemned men's legal challenges against a new lethal injection protocol announced in 2019. 
""The scientific evidence before the court overwhelmingly indicates that the 2019 Protocol is very likely to cause Plaintiffs extreme pain and needless suffering during their executions,"" Chutkan wrote in her order. 
She said the inmates were likely to succeed in their claim that the new one-drug protocol using pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate, breached a constitutional ban on ""cruel and unusual"" punishments. 
Chutkan sided with a medical expert cited by the inmates who said that a high-dose injection of pentobarbital was caustic enough to rapidly fill a condemned man's lungs with bloody fluid, causing him to feel as if he were drowning for some time before losing consciousness.
To make their deaths less painful, the inmates have proposed that the Justice Department add morphine or a similar painkiller to the lethal injection protocol, or arrange for them to be executed by firing squad, a method last used a decade ago by Utah's government.
The Justice Department told the court it would appeal the injunction, saying in a court filing that its extensive planning for the July and August dates, including training drills for the 40-strong execution team and the booking of transportation and hotel rooms, ""cannot easily be undone.""
Chutkan's order came down less than seven hours before Daniel Lewis Lee was due to be put to death at 4 p.m. using a lethal injection at the Justice Department's execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana. 
Lee was sentenced to death for his role in the 1996 murders of three members of an Arkansas family, including an 8-year-old child. 
""The government has been trying to plow forward with these executions despite many unanswered questions about the legality of its new execution protocol,"" Shawn Nolan, one of the public defenders representing the death row inmates in their lawsuits, said in a statement welcoming the judge's injunction. 
Efforts to resume capital punishment at the federal level were underway within a few months of President Donald Trump's inauguration in 2017, ending a de facto moratorium that began under his predecessor, Barack Obama, due to problems getting execution drugs and while long-running legal challenges to lethal injections played out in federal courts. 
A European Union ban on selling drugs for use in executions or torture has led to pharmaceutical companies refusing to sell such drugs to U.S. prison systems. 
The Justice Department spent much of 2018 and 2019 building a secret supply chain of private companies to make and test its drug of choice, pentobarbital, which replaces a three-drug protocol used in previous executions. Some of the companies involved said they were not aware they were testing execution drugs, a Reuters investigation found last week.
The Justice Department had scheduled two more executions for later in the week and a fourth in August, of Wesley Purkey, Dustin Honken and Keith Nelson, all convicted of murdering children. 
The coronavirus pandemic has prevented some lawyers from visiting their clients on death row. At least one employee involved in the executions tested positive for COVID-19, the Justice Department said over the weekend.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish President Andrzej Duda has won five more years in power on a socially conservative, religious platform in a closely fought election that makes renewed confrontation with the European Commission likely.
Nearly final results from Sunday's presidential election runoff showed Duda, 48, on over 51%, giving him an unbeatable lead over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who won almost 49% of the votes, the National Election Commission said.
Duda is allied with the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, and his victory reinforces the government's mandate to pursue reforms of the judiciary and media which the European Commission, the European Union executive, says subvert democratic standards.
""To a large extent, the policy of Brussels, or rather Berlin, had focused on supporting the opposition,"" Arkadiusz Mularczyk, a PiS lawmaker, told Reuters. ""Polish society is not accepting this."" 
Duda has painted himself as a guardian of traditional values and the generous PiS welfare programmes that have transformed life for many poorer Poles.
However, he ran an acrimonious campaign laced with homophobic language, attacks on private media and accusations that Trzaskowski serves foreign interests instead of Poland's.
Since the polls closed he has struck a more conciliatory tone, pleading for unity in the deeply polarised country.
""Hold back as much as you can from unnecessary words... because words can hurt,"" he told supporters. ""Please, help me put Poland back together again."" 
Trzaskowski, who had said he would repair Poland's relations with Europe and use the presidential veto to block any legislation that would erode democratic norms, said he thought the PiS would not change direction.
""Unfortunately it seems like the other side has not learned lessons,"" Trzaskowski said. ""That is why we hear statements that the process of politicising the courts will be completed... Unfortunately those in power do not want to reach out their hand to us.""
Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro suggested late on Sunday that the PiS could push on quickly with its ambition to change private media ownership toward outlets more favourable to its policies.
RIFTS
The PiS and EU have been divided on climate change and migration, in addition to democracy issues. 
Rifts are likely to be evident this week when EU leaders discuss the bloc's long-term budget, with Brussels facing growing calls for funding to be made conditional on respect for the rule of law.
The European Commission did not immediately comment on the election outcome. One EU country swiftly welcomed Duda's re-election - Hungary, another right-wing nationalist voice in central Europe. 
""The international liberal mainstream once again tried everything but the central European right wing is up 3:0,"" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), referring to recent conservative triumphs in Croatia, which is an EU member state, and Serbia, which is not in the EU.
Trzaskowski had said that, if elected, he would seek a more tolerant Poland and abolish state news channel TVP Info, which critics say gave overt support to Duda in its programming.
""The public broadcaster was used as a campaign tool for the incumbent,"" said Thomas Boserup, Head of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) special election assessment mission. ""This is the clearest misuse of public resources we have seen in this election.""
To many religious conservatives in predominantly Catholic Poland, Trzaskowski came to represent the threats facing traditional values when he pledged to introduce education about LGBT rights in Warsaw schools.
Many members of the LGBT community fear discrimination under a second term of the Duda presidency.
""We feel powerless,"" said Dawid Mycek, 35, a LGBT activist and Youtuber. ""This is the first presidential campaign I know, which was based on hate, hate speech and dividing Poles.""

CAIRO (Reuters) - After losing his job as house cleaner in Cairo, Sudanese refugee Abdel-Nasser Khamis has been struggling to pay his bills.
It's a fate shared by tens of thousands of migrants in Egypt, where the fallout from the coronavirus has hit the economy hard, U.N. officials and aid workers say.
Coronavirus lockdowns also cost many Egyptians their jobs. More than a quarter of those who had a job have not been working since the government brought in measures to fight the pandemic, while more than half have been put on shorter hours, the statistics office says.
In turn Egyptians have been forced to let go migrants from Africa and Asia working as domestic staff, drivers or labourers, residents, migrants and aid workers say.
The U.N. migration agency IOM has seen requests for aid from foreigners in Egypt jump fourfold since March.
Khamis, who lives with his wife, baby and relatives in a small flat in the crowded Ain Shams district, receives food parcels from a charity. But it is not enough.
""I have not paid rent for this house for three months. The landlord was okay about it, but now says that this is the last month,"" the 29-year-old said, breaking down in tears.
""We have been mainly eating rice. Meat we cannot afford anymore,"" he said, sitting on a couch next to a relative who also lost his job as cleaner.
IOM estimates that a fifth of about 6.3 million foreigners in Egypt are ""vulnerable"" which require help, said Laurent De Boeck, IOM's head in Egypt.
""I think we have received 26,500 (cash) requests,"" he said. ""We have a plan and a strategy for reaching 80,000.""
The government press centre and foreign ministry did not respond to questions on the situation of migrants.
Egypt says its treatment of refugees is exemplary as they receive services such as health care without discrimination and live freely among locals.
De Boeck said Egyptians were very welcoming but there was a limit to what they could do. Even before COVID-19 broke out around third of locals were below the poverty rate, and nearly three-quarters have seen their income fall since then, official figures show.
STUCK
Egypt used to be a transit point for African migrants trying to make some money before moving on.
But strict controls stopping migrant boats going to Europe, an Israeli border fence, and conflict in Libya have left many stuck.
The biggest group are Sudanese with around 3.8 million, IOM says - neighbouring Egypt is a natural destination to escape poverty as they can travel by land and get help from relatives.
A Sudanese charity has been helping more than 500 families whose breadwinners have become unemployed in Egypt. ""Many are facing eviction because they cannot pay the rent,"" said Abdallah Rabeh, one of its leaders.
Ayat Mohamed, 40, who lives with 6 children, her sick father and two other relatives in a barely furnished flat, has been worrying about how to find food as her day labourer husband has not since March.
""Our financial situation is difficult ... There is no work,"" she said, standing in her small kitchen.
Not only Sudanese are affected. Some 1,000 Nigerians have lost their jobs and so have around a quarter of the 4,000 Filipinos living in Egypt, according to community leaders.
""Many (Nigerians) used to work as English teachers,"" said Peter Olufosoye, a businessman who chairs the Nigerian expatriate community in Egypt.
Some foreigners are trying to go back home, De Boeck said.
IOM has received requests from 1,500 people to be flown home and expects another 500 in the next three months.

For Khamis going back to Darfur, home to an unresolved conflict where the U.N. says 300,000 have died, is not an option. ""There is no security in Darfur,"" he said.

Ramaphosa announced the return of the ban, which was only lifted on June 1, in an address to the nation on Sunday, saying it was necessary to ease pressure on the healthcare system.
South Africa is now recording more than 12,000 new coronavirus cases a day, the fourth-largest daily increase worldwide, and deaths from COVID-19 rose by a quarter in the past week to over 4,000, official data show.
Within hours of Ramaphosa's address, consumers took to social media to vent their anger with hashtags like #AlcoholHasFallen.
Many Twitter users said they would resort to brewing their own beverages or buying bootleg liquor, while bar staff and liquor store workers worried they would struggle to put food on the table.
""For people like us, the bartenders, what can we do for us to live? That's all I want to know,"" Soweto resident Karabo Lebelo told Reuters.
An industry group representing brewers, liquor traders and wine producers said the ban would have serious economic consequences, placing a huge number of livelihoods at risk. It said a better approach would be to target problematic drinking.
Despite its unpopularity, the alcohol ban could help thousands more COVID-19 patients get treated, medical experts said.
Modelling by South Africa's Medical Research Council (MRC) showed that if the ban were kept in place for eight weeks, it could enable the treatment of roughly 17,750 COVID-19 patients in general wards, or 12,950 in intensive care units, because of fewer admissions due to alcohol-related trauma, MRC director of alcohol research Charles Parry said.
Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said officials wanted to avoid a situation where a COVID-19 patient would arrive at a hospital with no beds left because of avoidable alcohol-related ailments.
Cooperative governance minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said drinkers could not be trusted to keep their distance from others - to minimise transmission of COVID-19 - and were often responsible for acts of violence.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has made selling the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner of his predecessor a cornerstone of his campaign for a more frugal government.
Last week he traveled economy class on a commercial airline to a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Jorge Mendoza, who heads a state-owned development bank involved in the sale, told a regular news conference the president had instructed him not to offload the jet, and other planes and helicopters on sale, for less than their value. 
""The offer is in cash and also a part in medical equipment,"" Mendoza said, adding that he could not yet give more details or identify the buyer for reasons of confidentiality. 
Like many nations, Mexico has been scrambling to source medical supplies including oxygen, ventilators and masks during the coronavirus pandemic. Both the United States and China's governments have helped with equipment. 
The sale of the jet, acquired by former President Enrique Pena Nieto in 2012 and fitted with marble-lined bathrooms, has proven tough. 
In January, Lopez Obrador said one potential buyer offered $125 million. But Mexico could not sell it below a United Nations-backed valuation of $130 million, he explained then.
It was not immediately clear why Mexico was now considering a lower offer, although the plane may have decreased in value while in storage.

The government has separately launched a raffle aimed at raising the value of the plane in return for cash prizes.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday that an unofficial city-wide election conducted by the pro-democracy camp over the weekend might have violated new national security laws by ""subverting state power"". 
The weekend election drew more than 600,000 votes, in what democrats described as a symbolic protest vote against tough new laws imposed by Beijing on the freewheeling former British colony.
The vote at around 250 polling stations was held to decide the strongest pro-democracy candidates to contest key Legislative Council elections in September.
The city's opposition camp is aiming to seize majority control in the 70-seat legislature for the first time from pro-Beijing rivals by riding a wave of anti-China sentiment stirred by the law, which critics say has gravely undermined Hong Kong's freedoms.
The city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a guarantee of wide-ranging autonomy.
The new law punishes secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and allows mainland Chinese security agents to operate officially in Hong Kong for the first time. 
Lam told reporters that if the democrats' aim to gain a legislative majority was to obstruct government policies, ""then it may fall into the category of subverting the state power"". She didn't elaborate.
One of the organisers of the election, Benny Tai, told reporters that the results of the poll had been leaked ahead of an official announcement. But he said there had been no personal data breach of the voters.
Last Friday, Hong Kong police raided the office of the independent pollster helping with the election, and officers copied some information from computers there.
Hong Kong's Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau said in a statement late on Monday that it had received public complaints that the weekend poll may have ""jeopardised the integrity of the electoral process"". 
It added it was now conducting an investigation and might later refer the case to law enforcement agencies.
The preliminary results showed several incumbent democratic lawmakers like Ted Hui and Eddie Chu taking the most votes in some districts. 
But a group of aspiring young democrats, or ""localists"", also performed strongly, reflecting a potential changing of the guard as the democrats gear up for the September poll.
""It's just the beginning,"" one candidate, Sunny Cheung, a runner-up in one district putting him on the democratic ticket for September, told Reuters.

""I will try to persuade more people to support us,"" he added, saying localists like himself were gaining more mainstream support.

NEW DELHI/THIRUVANANTHAPURAM (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court on Monday upheld the right of a former royal dynasty to run the Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple, one of the world's richest places of worship, after the state government tried to take it over when the family patriarch died. 
When one of the vaults of the towering centuries-old Hindu temple in Thiruvananthanpuram in Kerala state was opened in 2011, it was found to hold diamonds by the sackful along with tonnes of gold coins and jewellery - a hoard estimated at over $20 billion.
The Kerala High Court had ruled that year, after public interest petitions, that the Travancore family must give up its custodianship of the temple following the death of its head, Sree Chithira Thirunal Balarama Varma, the last ruling Maharaja of Travancore, in 1991.
But on Monday, the Supreme Court reversed that decision.
""We allow the appeal of the royal family of Travancore. Death does not effect Shebaitship (management and maintenance of the deity) of the Travancore Family,"" justices U.U. Lalit and Indu Malhotra said in their order. 
Several Hindu temples in India have wealth running into billions of dollars as devotees donate gold and other precious objects as gifts to spiritual or religious institutions that run hospitals, schools and colleges.

The Supreme Court said a new committee that the royal family will set up to run the temple, some seven stories high and replete with ornate carvings, will have the right to decide what to do with the temple's wealth, including the contents of another ancient vault yet to be opened.""A large number of devotees had prayed for us. The judgement is their victory,"" Gauri Lakshmi Bai, a member of the family, told reporters in Thiruvananthanpuram.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia charged former military journalist Ivan Safronov with state treason on Monday, his lawyer said, accusations that have sent a chill through Russia's media community which has protested over what it says is his unfair treatment.
Security forces last week detained Safronov, who left journalism and in May became an adviser at Russia's space agency, and accused him of passing military secrets to the Czech Republic.
He faces up to 20 years in jail if found guilty of a charge he denies.
Police detained around a dozen journalists who gathered outside his detention facility on Monday to offer their support in a case they say is shrouded in unacceptable secrecy. 
Details are sparse given its sensitive nature and his trial is likely to be held behind closed doors. 
Ivan Pavlov, his lawyer, last week said that the information he is accused of handing over concerned Russian arms deliveries to the Middle East and Africa. 
Pavlov cited investigators as saying the secrets were later shared with the United States. 
""Of course this case was fabricated, it is intimidation,"" said Arina Borodina, one of the journalists detained on Monday.
A petition demanding officials declassify the case, spell out the allegations against him and publish key evidence has so far been signed by 55,000 people. 
Sergei Naryshkin, head of Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, has advised Russians not to pressure investigators. 
Safronov, who used to work for the Kommersant and Vedomosti dailies, was part of the Kremlin pool, the reporters accredited to cover events with President Vladimir Putin. 
In an unusual move, reporters from that group posted a video in which they spoke out in his defence. 

""Vanya (Safronov) is a real patriot. There are few people like that. And people like that aren't spies,"" said Kira Latukhina, a journalist for Russia's government newspaper.

DURHAM (Reuters) - Tattoo shops, beauty salons and massage parlours in England reopened on Monday after being forced to close for almost four months in the latest easing of the coronavirus lockdown.
Customers are required to wear masks while face tattoos, eyebrow trimming, face waxing and facials are prohibited under government guidelines.
People clamouring to get a new tattoo returned to body art studios such as Skins and Needles in Durham in the north of England. A limited number of customers can now only be inside at once and whereas people previously could walk in for appointments, there is now about a two-week waiting list.
After spending thousands of pounds opening the studio in February, the surge in coronavirus cases forced manager Paige Harker to shut a month later as part of the lockdown. 
""It is really good to be back and now all the staff are back together and customers are returning it is almost like the last few months never happened,"" said Harker, 25. ""We are on the road to normality with a few complications.""
Tattoo artist Devin Evans is adjusting to having to wear a face mask, which can steam up.
""You find yourself having to look under the mask a little bit, so you are almost tattooing in a different position,"" she said. ""It would be ideal if we didn't have to."" 
Britain has been the European country worst hit by the coronavirus, with an official death toll of more 44,000. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has faced criticism from the opposition over its handling of the pandemic - including locking down later than some other parts of Europe.
The latest changes apply only to England as the devolved nations in the United Kingdom - Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - have been setting their own timetables for easing lockdown restrictions.

But that was before the coronavirus hit.
Asim, 30, is one of 2.5 million Muslims globally, almost 180,000 from Pakistan, whose plans were upended when Saudi Arabia restricted this year's event to only 1,000 local residents, savaging Pakistan's 160 billion rupee ($1 billion) Haj industry.
Indonesia and Pakistan, the largest Muslim-majority countries by population, send the most pilgrims. 
""I prayed for the chance to go on Haj and Allah answered my prayers,” Asim, selected from tens of thousands of applicants for a government-supported package, told Reuters. ""But then he sent this coronavirus.""
Asim borrowed money to come up with the nearly $3,000 cost. 
More than 900 Pakistan tour operators and travel agencies are licensed to arrange travel over the Haj. This year will be the first in modern times that pilgrims from abroad will not be allowed into Mecca.
“The biggest effect right now is on our business,” Zaeen Siddiqui, senior vice-chairman of the Haj Organisers' Association of Pakistan, told Reuters.
“Our money is stuck in airlines. Our offices are closing because we cannot keep workers.""
According to Pakistan's Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, which oversees Haj arrangements, 179,210 Pakistanis had already registered to attend this year - 71,684 through private tour operators and 107,526 through cheaper, government-supported packages.
TENTS AND TOP-END HOTELS
Pilgrims buying private packages spend $4,000 to $6,000 on the journey, Siddiqui said. Those using government packages deposit around $3,000 into state accounts, money which authorities began returning last month. 
Around 60% of the cost of Haj is spent on accommodation, food and transportation in Saudi Arabia, 20% on airlines and 20% on arrangements inside Pakistan, Siddiqui said.
But local operators are able to charge premiums thanks to the high demand - premiums that keep their businesses going for the rest of the year.
Low-end tours involve basic accommodation in tents, while high-end packages come complete with personal guidance and sermons from scholars and televangelists to small groups of pilgrims who stay at luxury hotels in Mecca. 
Before the Haj setback, Pakistan's tour operators were already reeling from the suspension of year-round pilgrimages to Mecca and Medina from abroad known as the umrah, also because of the coronavirus.
Pakistan International Airlines has lost 12 billion rupees ($72.37 million) in revenue because of the cancellation of the Haj after losing nearly as much because of the umrah ban, a company official told Reuters.
Faraz Masood, 34, was planning to fly to Mecca from Karachi with his wife. They put down a 20% deposit on the $12,000 package. 
“When this coronavirus was just getting started, we were in touch with the company, and they kept saying 'dont worry, things will be back to normal in time for Haj',” he told Reuters. 

Masood is still trying to get his money back.

KABUL/MAZAR-I-SHARIF (Reuters) - Taliban militants clashed with security forces following a car bomb blast at a government compound in northern Afghanistan on Monday, killing ten people and wounding dozens more, officials said.
The attack took place at a government facility in Samangan province's capital Aybak close to an office of the National Security Directorate, the main intelligence agency.
""It's a complex attack that started with a car bomb,"" said Mohammad Sediq Azizi, a spokesman for the provincial government. 
The attack ended after four gunmen died following clashes with Afghan security forces, he added.
Abdul Latif Ibrahimi, Samangan's governor, said ten security members were killed and 54 people, including civilians, were wounded.
In a statement, the Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which comes at a sensitive time as violence increases even as the United States tries to usher the government and militants towards peace talks to end more than 18 years of war.
The violence threatens to hamper progress on the talks, which have not started due to a separate disagreement over the release of 600 Taliban prisoners from 5,000 the group has demanded.
Local officials also accused the Taliban of attacking security force checkpoints around the country overnight, killing seven personnel in the northeastern province of Badakhshan, 14 in northern Kunduz, and four in the central province of Parwan.
The Taliban said in statements they had carried out attacks killing nine in Kunduz and eight in Badakhshan.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Malaysian court heard on Monday a contempt case brought by the government against independent news portal Malaysiakini and its editor-in-chief over readers' comments posted on its website, in a case widely seen as a test for press freedoms.
Rights groups have accused Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's government of stifling dissent after a series of clampdowns against critics of his four-month-old administration.
Last month, Malaysia's attorney-general filed an application to cite Malaysiakini and its editor-in-chief Steven Gan for contempt over five comments posted by readers on its website that allegedly undermined public confidence in the judiciary.
Malaysiakini and Gan, who could face a jail term as well as a fine, have maintained they could not be held responsible and the offending comments had been immediately removed after they were contacted by police. 
At Monday's hearing, Malaysiakini’s lawyer Malik Imtiaz Sarwar argued that there was no evidence the portal intended to post the comments. 
""One shouldn’t be shooting the messenger unless one can actually show the messenger is the creator of the message being delivered,"" he told the court. 
Government lawyer S. Narkunavathy said Malaysiakini should be held liable for facilitating the publishing, arguing the portal's filtering systems had been insufficient to prevent the comments from being posted. 
""We say that they exercise control over the platform and, as such, they have to assume responsibility to expeditiously remove any comment that is adverse,"" she told the court. 
Federal Court judge Rohana Yusuf said Malaysia’s highest tribunal needed more time to deliberate before reaching a decision.
The case comes as six employees of Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera have been questioned by police over a documentary on Malaysia's detention of undocumented migrants that authorities have accused of being inaccurate, misleading and unfair. 
    Al Jazeera said it stood by the professionalism and impartiality of its journalism.
Other Malaysians have also recently been taken to court for online postings, including for criticising the country's coronavirus lockdown measures.     

    Authorities have defended the migrant arrests as necessary for public health and order, amid rising anger towards foreigners and refugees who were accused of spreading the coronavirus and taking up scarce state funds.

TURKANA, Kenya (Reuters) - Most of the men in the village of Lorengippi in northwestern Kenya are scarred.
Almost everyone has a tale of a relative killed in the cycle of violence over the years. But that is changing now. 
Village tradition demanded every boy over the age of 11 train to fight. By 16, they would carry a weapon to protect the livestock - valuable commodities in Turkana, Kenya's poorest region. 
""We were fighting over livestock, we were fighting over grazing land, we were fighting over water,"" said Kokoi Namojong, 59. His older sister was among those killed. 
Then a clash between Lorengippi's Turkana residents and neighbouring Pokot killed 23 people in 2013, said Nathan Ekal, the village chief. Their bodies are buried in a mass grave on the outskirts of Lorengippi.
The bloodshed shocked government officials, despite the region's long history of deadly cattle raids and inter-ethnic violence. 
Police mounted an operation to collect weapons, established a base and built a checkpoint on the border with West Pokot. Most importantly, said Ekal, the communities formed peace committees to resolve disagreements right after the 2013 killings.
The new security ushered in some development - a school, a small clinic and a new road connecting the village to the county capital of Lodwar, 90 km (55 miles) away. 
Cross-border raids still take place but for now the committees are resolving the issues. Livestock are being returned and there have been no mass killings in recent years.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sweden said on Monday it supported Franco-German efforts for a robust response to China's new security law on Hong Kong, joining Denmark and the Netherlands in pushing the European Union to consider countermeasures on Beijing. 
Like much of the West, the European Union has denounced the decision by China's parliament to pass national security legislation for the former British colony of Hong Kong despite an international outcry. 
But its threat of reprisals is vague.
""There is a proposal of measures especially proposed by Germany and France that I will support because we need to react to what is happening in Hong Kong,"" said Swedish Foreign Minister Anne Linde (NYSE:LIN) said before a rare meeting in person with her EU counterparts in Brussels. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month warned of ""very negative consequences"" for Beijing if it curtailed guarantees of freedom in Hong Kong that are not enjoyed on the mainland. 
EU officials declined to go into details about the measures, but two EU diplomats said they did not amount to formal sanctions on China, the bloc's second-largest trading partner.
Instead, they entail extending the EU's export ban on equipment that could be used for torture or repressive policing, such as spiked batons or rubber bullets, giving Hong Kong activists long-term refugee status in the bloc and supporting more opportunities for Hong Kong students to study in Europe. 
Sweden is seeking the release of its citizen Gui Minhai, who was sentenced to 10 years in jail in February, accused by Beijing of illegally providing intelligence overseas.

Gui, a bookseller previously based in Hong Kong who sold books critical of China's political leadership, was detained by mainland police in 2018. He was seized while with Swedish diplomats on a Beijing-bound train.

The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis said earlier it had intercepted and destroyed four missiles and six explosive drones fired by the Houthis over the border towards Saudi Arabia.
There was no Saudi confirmation of where they were intercepted or whether anything was hit. 
Oil company  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) operates a 400,000-barrel-per-day refinery in the Red Sea city of Jizan, which lies around 60 km (40 miles) from the Yemen border. Aramco declined to comment. 
""With many drones our armed forces targeted military aircraft, pilot accommodation and Patriot systems in Khamis Mushait, and other military targets at Abha, Jizan and Najran airports,"" said Yahya Sarea, a Houthi military spokesman.
""Additionally, the giant oil facility in the Jizan industrial zone. The strike was accurate."" 
Khamis Mushait, Abha, Jizan and Najran are all in southwest Saudi Arabia near the Yemen border. 
Cross-border attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement have escalated since late May when a truce prompted by the coronavirus pandemic expired. In late June, missiles reached the Saudi capital Riyadh. 
The coalition, in a statement published by Saudi state news agency SPA, did not say where the objects where intercepted but said the drones had been launched from the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa towards Saudi Arabia.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from Sanaa in late 2014. 
The Houthis, who control most large urban centres, say they are fighting a corrupt system.
Houthi-run news outlet Al Masirah said the coalition had carried out air strikes on various regions under Houthi control on Monday. 
The United Nations has launched virtual talks among the warring parties on a permanent ceasefire and confidence-building steps to restart peace negotiations. 
But discussions have been complicated by the surge in violence since the ceasefire expired. 
The war has killed more than 100,000 people and caused what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

Restaurant, hotel and pub owners took to Twitter over the weekend to say they turned away customers from the United States after learning they had not self-isolated for 14 days. A tweet from a tour guide saying she cancelled a booking for the same reason went viral on Sunday.

On Friday, a Turkish court ruled that the sixth-century building's conversion to a museum was unlawful and President Tayyip Erdogan declared that it is now a mosque. Cavusoglu was speaking in an interview with state broadcaster TRT Haber.

UNESCO said on Friday it would review the status of the monument as a World Heritage Site following Erdogan's enouncement. Hagia Sophia was a Byzantine church for nine centuries before the Ottomans converted it to a mosque.

The two former Soviet republics have long been in conflict over Azerbaijan's breakaway, mainly ethnic Armenian region of Nagorno-Karabakh, although the latest clashes occurred some 300 km (190 miles) from the mountainous enclave.
The Azeri defence ministry said four of its soldiers were killed and five wounded while Armenia's ministry said that two of its soldiers were wounded. The two sides traded accusations of ceasefire violations and firing artillery.
Exchanges of fire began on Sunday and continued into Monday in the rugged South Caucasus region.
Nagorno-Karabakh, a highland enclave within Azerbaijan, is run by ethnic Armenians who declared independence during a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union crumbled in 1991.
Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia continue to accuse each other of shooting attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.
The frozen Nagorno-Karabakh conflict has concerned the international community in part because of its threat to stability in a region that serves as a corridor for pipelines taking oil and gas to world markets.

""He had attempted suicide on Thursday, then after they (prison guards) found out, we tried to help him,"" Yunus added. ""He died last night.""
An autopsy has yet to be conducted. The French embassy in Jakarta declined to comment. Although police confirmed Camille had a lawyer, they did not identify him.
Camille was arrested at a Jakarta hotel last month following complaints to police that he made sexual advances to underage women after paying to photograph them. When refused, he became violent, police said.
Police said he was charged with counts of sexual abuse and sex with minors and had confessed to the offences. If found guilty, he would have faced life imprisonment, chemical castration or death.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Friends, family and colleagues attended the small funeral Monday for the longtime mayor of Seoul, one of the country's most prominent elected officials, who leaves a complex legacy amid accusations of sexual harassment. 
Mayor Park Won-soon was found dead on Friday; he left a note thanking and apologising to ""everyone"". Police did not give a cause of death but said there was no sign of foul play.
His death came days after a city official who served as Park's secretary filed a complaint alleging the 64-year-old had sexually harassed her, prompting a police investigation. 
A lawyer and rights activists who have helped the former secretary said on Monday that Park had repeatedly made unwanted physical contact with her and sent photos of himself in underwear and lurid text messages. 
Reuters was unable to contact a representative of Park's family. But the representative has issued a statement vowing legal action against those who spread ""groundless statements,"" without elaborating. 
""Acts of forceful sexual harassment continued for four years even after she moved to a different position,"" Lee Mi-kyoung, one of the activists, told a news conference. ""This is a case that has a victim, and could not be covered up by his death."" 
Lee also said the former secretary had reported her case to the city but officials had ignored it. A city spokesman said the report had not yet been verified and no inquiry is planned. 
The funeral, hosted by the city government at the city hall and live broadcast online, was limited to around 100 people because of coronavirus concerns. 
""Mourning doesn't necessarily exclude soul-searching, but now is time to mourn,"" said Paik Nak-chung, a literary critic who helped lead the funeral. 
Hundreds of citizens gathered despite heavy rain near city hall and a park where Park's body will be cremated, some weeping. 
In front of city hall, one man sought to bring attention to the harassment allegations, drawing boos and complaints from supporters, local media footage showed. 
Park's remains will be buried in the southeastern county of Changnyeong, where he was born, city officials said. 
As the longest-serving mayor of Seoul, a city of almost 10 million people, since 2011, Park was instrumental in its response to the coronavirus. 
An outspoken advocate of women's rights and gender equality, former activist and lawyer, he was seen as a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in a 2022 election. 
A petition filed with the presidential Blue House, urging the funeral to be cancelled over the sexual abuse allegations, gathered more than 560,000 signatures. But a court on Sunday rejected an activist group's attempt to stop it.

On Friday the latest and third mass demonstration held since protests began in early June turned violent, with police firing gunshots toward demonstrators, some of whom had occupied state buildings in Bamako.
Protesters have been calling for Keita to step down over his failure to quash violence by jihadist groups and ethnic militias, and over disputed results of legislative elections in March.
The government acknowledged four people were killed on Friday. The opposition says the policed killed at least eight more during smaller protests on Saturday. Several leaders of the M5-RFP, the coalition leading the protests, were also arrested. 
In a statement late on Sunday night, the U.N. mission in Mali, the African Union, West African regional bloc ECOWAS and the European Union criticized vandalism by protesters but reserved their sharpest criticism for the authorities. 
International and regional powers fear political turmoil in Mali could undermine their military campaigns against Islamist insurgents in West Africa's Sahel region. The United Nations has over 13,000 peacekeeping soldiers in Mali.
The organisations ""condemn the use of lethal force in the context of maintaining public order and invite all stakeholders to exercise restraint"", the statement said. 
It added that M5-RFP leaders arrested over the weekend should be released ""to create the conditions for political dialogue"". 
The M5-RFP, a coalition of religious, political and civil society leaders, has repeatedly rejected concessions offered by Keita as insufficient, including his offer on Saturday to dissolve the Constitutional Court as the M5-RFP has demanded. 

The most prominent M5-RFP leader, Muslim cleric Mahmoud Dicko, urged his supporters on Sunday to stay calm. ""We can really find and obtain everything we want through patience and good behaviour,"" he told French radio.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain's highest court upheld death sentences against two activists for bombing a convoy and killing a police officer, after convictions that human rights groups say were based on confessions extracted through torture.
Mohammed Ramadhan and Husain Moosa lost their final appeal on Monday against death sentences that were initially handed down by a criminal court in December 2014, a statement from the kingdom's public prosecutor said.
Security forces arrested Moosa, a hotel employee, and Ramadhan, a security guard in Bahrain's international airport, in early 2014 after a policeman was killed in a bombing in al-Deir, a village northeast of Manama. Ten other people tried with them have also been jailed.
Amnesty International and a UK-based pro-opposition activist group, the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy (BIRD), have said both men were tortured to extract false confessions, subjected to sexual assault, beatings, sleep deprivation and other abuses. 
""The terror of knowing that my husband can be executed by firing squad at any moment without proper notice is tearing me apart,"" Ramadhan's wife, Zainab Ebrahim, tweeted after the sentence. 
Both were prevented from meeting their lawyers until they were sentenced to death for the first time by a criminal court in December 2014, the groups say.
Bahrain's government has denied it tortures prisoners or persecutes the opposition. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the torture allegations.
Bahrain, which is led by a Sunni Muslim royal family but has a Shi'ite majority population, has been clamping down on dissent since 2011 when it quashed protests with Saudi help.
Home to the Middle East headquarters of the U.S. Navy, the Gulf island kingdom has prosecuted and revoked the citizenship of hundreds of people in mass trials. Most opposition figures and human rights activists are jailed or have fled.
""Today’s verdict is yet another dark stain in the struggle for human rights in Bahrain ... This horrendous injustice could not have happened without the tacit acceptance of Bahrain’s western allies,” Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, Director of Advocacy at BIRD said in a statement.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin cleared a major hurdle in parliament on Monday, with lawmakers narrowly backing his bid to remove the lower house speaker in a vote seen as an important barometer of his support.
While not officially a confidence vote, the outcome - a win by just two votes - was the first real litmus test of how much legislative support Muhyiddin could muster to push through policies and government business.
Muhyiddin's bid to remove speaker Mohamad Ariff Md Yusof, who was appointed by the previous administration led by Mahathir Mohamad, was backed by 111 lawmakers, with 109 against it. 
Southeast Asia's third-largest economy has been grappling with political uncertainty since Muhyiddin, who was part of Mahathir's administration, was unexpectedly made prime minister in March.
Muhyiddin forged an alliance with the graft-tainted UMNO party that was defeated in a 2018 election. The opposition has accused him of grabbing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.
The win, however, has done little to ease the uncertainty and only reinforces how slim Muhyiddin's majority is in parliament. 
He is preparing for snap election by the end of the year to seek a firm mandate, Singapore's Straits Times newspaper reported in June, amid questions over his legislative clout.
Mahathir has pushed for a confidence vote on Muhyiddin's leadership, but the premier avoided that in the last parliament session in May, when the lower house convened for only one day due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Mahathir and others in the opposition, including Anwar Ibrahim, have vowed to oust Muhyiddin. 
Under the federal constitution, a prime minister who has lost the confidence of parliament must dissolve his cabinet, unless requested otherwise by the king.

SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Flames raged for hours on Sunday aboard a U.S. warship docked at Naval Base San Diego, sending 21 people to the hospital with minor injuries and prompting a relocation of two other Navy vessels moored nearby, military and local fire officials said.
The San Diego Fire-Rescue Department reported an explosion in conjunction with the blaze, which broke out at about 8:30 a.m. local time (1530 GMT) aboard the USS Bonhomme Richard, an amphibious assault vessel in port for routine maintenance. 
The blast was believed to have been triggered by the rapid initial release of heat from a confined space under pressure, as opposed to an explosion of fuel or ordnance, Rear Admiral Philip Sobeck told a news conference on Sunday evening.
While the precise source of the blaze was unknown, the fire originated in a lower cargo hold of the ship and spread into the decks above it, consuming materials that typically burn in an office or apartment fire, Sobeck said.
Navy spokesman Mike Raney told Reuters there was no immediate evidence of foul play. 
Ammunition normally carried aboard warships at sea had already been unloaded as a standard safety precaution before the vessel was placed into maintenance, Navy officials said.
Roughly 1 million gallons of fuel remained isolated ""well below where any heat source is,"" and fire crews worked all day to ""make sure that's not affected,"" the admiral said.
Palls of thick, acrid smoke visible for miles around the base engulfed much of the 844-foot (257 meter) warship for several hours, as about half a dozen firefighting boats in the harbor trained streams of water onto the burning vessel.
Seventeen sailors and four civilians were taken to local hospitals for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, and all those who were aboard the warship - about 160 personnel - were accounted for, the Navy said in a statement.
Sobeck said the hospitalized sailors were all listed in stable condition. Navy officials said the injuries consisted mainly of smoke inhalation, heat exhaustion and minor burns. The vessel normally carries a crew of roughly 1,000.
NEARBY VESSELS MOVED
Two guided-missile destroyers docked nearby, the USS Fitzgerald and USS Russell, were moved to piers farther from the burning vessel early in the afternoon, the Navy said. Smoke from the fire appeared to begin dying around 3 p.m. local time.
The Bonhomme Richard, commissioned in 1998, is designed to carry U.S. Marine Corps attack helicopters and ground troops into battle. As a Wasp-class amphibious assault ship, it ranks as the second-largest vessel type in the Navy's fleet, surpassed only by aircraft carriers, and is one of only four of its kind in the Pacific, Raney said.
The stricken vessel has participated in several military operations and has appeared in a pair of Hollywood films - the 2012 sci-fi action movie ""Battleship"" and ""Act of Valor,"" which featured active-duty U.S. Navy SEALs, according to San Diego television station KGTV, an ABC News affiliate.
The ship was named in honor of Benjamin Franklin, one of America's founding fathers and author of the influential ""Poor Richard's Almanack,"" which he wrote under the pseudonym Poor Richard or Richard Saunders. It became a forerunner of the popular ""Old Farmer's Almanac.""

U.S. Revolutionary War naval hero John Paul Jones originally gave the name to a frigate the French donated to America in 1779 during its war of independence from Britain.

784,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 12, 2020 10:45PM ET</span>","U.S. Firms Worried About Hong Kong Security Law, AmCham Says","(Bloomberg) -- A majority of U.S. businesses operating in Hong Kong are worried about the impact of the controversial national security law recently imposed on the city by China, according to a survey from the American Chamber of Commerce.
The lobby group said 76% of companies were concerned about the sweeping measures barring subversion, secession, terrorism and foreign collusion, with most being “extremely concerned.” The poll of member companies -- which AmCham described as a “temperature test” of members’ sentiments rather than a scientific study -- received responses from 183 firms, more than half of which have headquarters in the U.S.
When asked what concerned them most about the law, companies largely echoed concerns voiced by foreign governments and civil society groups, saying they are worried about the ambiguity of the legislation’s scope and enforcement, the threat it poses to Hong Kong’s prized independent judicial system and the risk the city could lose its status as a global financial hub.
“The potential for arbitrary application of the national security law is frightening to many and Hong Kong’s judiciary is powerless to protect the people and rule of law,” one respondent told AmCham. “Some of our employees have already voted with their feet to leave for safer countries. Many others are very concerned and considering their options.”
Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials have defended the law as a necessary step to curb months of sometimes-violent unrest that rocked the former British colony last year before the global Covid-19 pandemic quieted the city’s protest movement.
Roughly 26% of firms said the new law made them feel safer, echoing the government’s arguments about the need for stability -- compared with slightly more than 50% who said the law made them feel less safe. About 22% of respondents said they weren’t concerned about the legislation.
‘Game Changer’
Companies expressed worry about data security issues, retaliatory measures from foreign governments in the form of export controls or tariffs, an erosion of Hong Kong’s guaranteed autonomy and difficulties hiring and moving talented staff to the city. Nearly half of respondents said the possibility of extradition to the mainland for a trial -- which the new security law allows -- was a “game changer” for Hong Kong’s position as a trusted international financial center.
Most companies said they were adopting a “wait-and-see” approach to the law, while some firms were planning to reduce trade and investments in Hong Kong, as well as business travel between the city and the U.S. While two-thirds of companies said they had no plans to leave, about one-third said they would consider moving assets, capital or business operations out of Hong Kong in the “medium-to-long run.”
After the law was announced by Chinese officials in late May, details emerged slowly until the text was unveiled -- initially only in Chinese -- on June 30, on the eve of the July 1 anniversary of the city’s 1997 return from British rule. Nearly 70% of respondents to the AmCham survey said they have gradually become more concerned about the law.
“The more I learn, the less I like,” another respondent told the business chamber. “We are in China now, no question about it.”

Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty earlier this year to 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act. His guilty plea made a six-week trial due to begin in June redundant.
Tarrant's decision to represent himself would not affect the sentencing hearing set to begin on Aug. 24, Judge Cameron Mander said in minutes of a hearing released by the court.
The judge approved Tarrant's request in a pre-trial video call after he was satisfied that Tarrant understood his rights to have legal representation and that he wished to waive those rights.
Tarrant's lawyers said there was no ""conflict or relationship breakdown"" between them and Tarrant, and that the request was consistent with his rights.
""Tarrant has instructed counsel that he wishes to act for himself at sentence,"" the lawyers, who have appeared for Tarrant since his second court appearance on April 5 last year, said in an emailed statement.
""We are not disappointed by Mr Tarrant's decision.""
The sentencing date was formally confirmed on Monday at the high court in Christchurch in the presence of shooting survivors and family liaison representatives, the New Zealand Herald said in a report.
Tarrant has been in police custody since March 15, 2019, when he was arrested and accused of using semi-automatic weapons to target Muslims attending Friday prayers at two mosques in the city of Christchurch.

Daniel Lewis Lee was convicted in the killing of three members of an Arkansas family in 1996. But some relatives of his victims opposed him receiving the death sentence. He is due to be put to death by lethal injection at the U.S. Justice Department's execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana.
His execution had been blocked on Friday by a federal judge after some of the victims' relatives sued, saying they feared that attending could expose them to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
As the number of coronavirus infections rises in about 40 states, the Bureau of Prisons said on Sunday that a staff member involved in preparations for the resumption of federal executions had tested positive for COVID-19. 
The lawsuit filed against the Justice Department in federal court in Indianapolis sought to block the execution until the pandemic had passed. U.S. District Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson ordered the department to delay the execution until it could show it was upholding the plaintiffs' right to attend the execution without risking their health. 
The government appealed and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Sunday overturned the injunction, saying no federal statute or regulation gave the victims the right to attend the execution.
Attorney General William Barr said last July that the Justice Department would resume carrying out executions of some of the 62 inmates on federal death row.
He originally scheduled five executions for last December, but had to delay them while long-running lawsuits challenging the government's lethal-injection protocol played out.
An appeals court overturned that injunction in April, and Barr announced new execution dates for July and August of four inmates, all men convicted of murdering children: Lee, Wesley Purkey, Dustin Honken and Keith Nelson. 

Prosecutors say Lee was a member of a white supremacist group that murdered an Arkansas gun dealer, his wife and 8-year-old daughter, then dumped their bodies in a swamp. He was convicted in 1999 of multiple offenses including murder in aid of racketeering.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario Premier Doug Ford will announce details on Monday about the province's third stage of reopening, his office said on Sunday, a step likely to end most restrictions introduced in March to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Stage 3 will allow ""most remaining workplaces and community spaces"" to reopen, according to the province's website, although ""large public gatherings will continue to be restricted.""
Canada's most-populous province and the country's economic engine laid out a three-stage framework in April for reopening, allowing the whole province into the first stage on May 19. Many regions in the province were able to move to Stage 2 on June 12, which allowed for the reopening of restaurant patios and hair salons.
But harder-hit areas - including densely populated Toronto, and Windsor Essex, a region near the Ontario-Michigan border with clusters of cases among agricultural workers - were not able to graduate to the second stage until late June and early July.
Ontario, with a population of 14.6 million, reported 129 new COVID-19 cases and three deaths on Saturday, according to public health agency data. Ontario has the second-highest number of cases and deaths behind Quebec.

Canada has reported 107,347 cases since the pandemic began, including 8,773 deaths, according to the latest government data.

TUNIS (Reuters) - At least five Tunisian parties plan to launch a vote of no confidence in parliamentary speaker Rached Ghannouchi who has been accused of partisan interests, while members of his moderate Islamist Ennahda party have called for a new government, escalating the country's political crisis.
The no-confidence motion poses the biggest challenge yet to Ennahda, which first took power following the Arab Spring uprising, but was forced to step down in 2013 after a series of protests.
Pressure on the government has mounted in recent weeks after opponents called for the resignation of Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh over an alleged conflict of interest.
On Sunday, Ennahda, the main party in the ruling coalition, said it supported calls to change the government.
Ennahda said that it wants ""to hold talks to form a strong new government because this government lost credibility after suspicion of conflict of interest involving the prime minister,"" Imed Khmiri a senior official in Ennahda told Reuters.
Fakhfakh has rejected accusations of corruption after an independent member of parliament published documents last month indicating that companies the prime minister owns shares in had won deals worth 44 million dinars ($15 million) from the state.
Mohammed Ammar from Attayar party, said that a group of parliamentary blocs agreed to start the process of withdrawing confidence from the speaker, citing numerous violations, poor management and unilateral decisions that serve partisan interests.
These blocs include the Tahya Tounes, Attayar, Chaab and Reform parties, which are in the coalition with Ennahda.
The Free Constitutional party led by Abir Moussi, a supporter of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali‮ ‬overthrown by the 2011 revolution, has campaigned to oust Ghannouchi for weeks.
Moussi's party accused Ghannouchi of serving the Muslim Brotherhood’s agenda and foreign allies, including Turkey and Qatar. 
Ghannouchi has rejected these accusations, arguing that Tunisians want a government focused on economic and social policy, not political in-fighting.
Procedures for withdrawing confidence require the signature of 73 members of the house for it to be put to a public vote. To succeed, 109 lawmakers will need to vote for no-confidence.
The five parties have about 90 members.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's Prime Minister Omar al-Razzaz promised on Sunday to deepen a crackdown on tax evasion that officials say has deprived the country's cash-strapped economy of billions of dollars' revenue in recent years.
The government has gone after senior businessmen and former politicians suspected of tax dodging, money laundering and customs evasion in a weeks-long campaign that has gained greater urgency with the hit to state finances from the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Protecting public money and fighting corruption is a national duty,"" Razzaz said in his weekly television address to the nation.
Tax authorities have raided around 650 companies so far, sometimes accompanied by security forces, according to officials who say this is the biggest campaign to combat tax evasion in decades.
The government said it had frozen the assets of dozens of companies and businessmen on suspected tax evasion charges. It added that it would track offshore havens where wealthy Jordanians have long parked cash to avoid taxes. 
Some critics have accused the government of using the campaign to carry out a witch hunt against its political enemies, including some of Jordan's leading business figures, including former ministers and senior politicians.
Officials deny that, saying the goal is to ensure justice and that no one is above the law.
The government has been using its wider powers under a state of emergency since March to give prosecutors and the main anti-corruption agency greater powers, and stiffen penalties.
A two-month coronavirus lockdown has crippled Jordanian businesses and slashed state revenues by tens of millions of dollars, leading to the sharpest economic contraction in two decades. 
The government expects the economy to shrink by 3.5% this year, a far cry from an International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimate of 2% growth before the pandemic.
The aid-dependent country, already undertaking a tough three-year IMF reform programme, tapped international debt markets this month to borrow $1.75 billion.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight with a ground-to-air missile on Jan. 8 shortly after the plane took off from Tehran,in what Tehran later acknowledged as a “disastrous mistake” by forces who were on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.
""A mistake in aligning the radar system had caused human error. An operator had forgotten to re-adjust the direction on the radar system after moving to a new position, an error that contributed to misreading the radar's data,"" an interim report on the Civil Aviation Organisation (CAO) website said. 
The CAO report, which was published on late Saturday, said the missile battery that targeted the passenger plane had been relocated and ""was not properly reoriented"". 
The downing occurred at a time of high tension between longtime foes Iran and the United States. Iran was on alert for attacks after it fired missiles at Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces in retaliation for the killing on Jan. 3 of its most powerful military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a U.S. missile strike at Baghdad airport.
""A failure occurred after the relocation of one of the air defence units of Tehran  ... It occurred because of a human error,"" the CAO report said, adding that the plane was detected by the system as a target approaching Tehran. 
The operator of the air defence system ""lacked awareness of the relocation of the air defence unit"", and fired the two missiles without authorisation from the command centre, the report said. 
“When the first missile was fired, the passenger plane was flying at a normal altitude and trajectory,"" the report added.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's opposition camp said on Sunday that over 600,000 citizens in the Chinese-ruled city cast ballots over the weekend in primaries it cast as a symbolic protest vote against tough national security laws imposed by Beijing. 
The unofficial poll will decide the strongest pro-democracy candidates to contest elections in September to Hong Kong's Legislative Council. Then, they aim to seize majority control for the first time from pro-Beijing rivals by riding a wave of anti-China sentiment stirred by the law, which critics say has gravely undermined Hong Kong's freedoms.
While the primaries are only for the opposition camp, the level of participation is seen as a guide to popular opinion in the city of 7.5 million people, a major financial hub. 
""A high turnout will send a very strong signal to the international community, that we Hong Kongers never give up,"" said Sunny Cheung, 24, one of a batch of aspiring young democrats out lobbying and giving stump speeches. 
""And that we still stand with the democratic camp, we still support democracy and freedom."" 
Defying warnings from a senior Hong Kong official that the vote might fall foul of the national security law, residents young and old flocked to over 250 polling stations across the city, manned by thousands of volunteers.
Long queues formed, with people voting via their mobile phones after having their identities verified.
""SEE THE COURAGE""
Organisers said 592,000 people had voted online, and 21,000 had cast paper ballots at the end of two full days of polling, - more than expected, and representing around a third of voters who backed the democrats in an election last year.
""Even under the shadow of the national security law, there were still 600,000 people coming out,"" said an organiser, Au Nok-hin. ""You can see the courage of the Hong Kong people in this ... Hong Kongers have created another miracle."" 
The new law punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison and allows mainland security agents to operate officially in Hong Kong for the first time.
Despite this tactical vote to maximise their chances, some pro-democracy activists fear authorities may yet try to stop some candidates from running in September's election.
""They can arrest or disqualify any candidate they don't like under the national security law without a proper reason,"" said Owen Chow, a young democratic ""localist"" candidate. 
At a time when Hong Kong authorities have barred public marches and rallies for months on end amid coronavirus social restrictions, and arrested individuals for shouting slogans and holding up blank sheets of paper, the vote was seen as a crucial and rare window for populist expression.
""I can really feel that young people haven't given up yet, even though we are facing a very depressing future,"" said Prince Wong, 22, a candidate in the New Territories West district.

""It helps me become more determined to fight.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's effort to fast-track careers of foreign-trained doctors to meet growing patient numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in only about two dozen licenses approved in Ontario and none in British Columbia, according to medical colleges in both provinces.
As Canada faced the prospect of the pandemic swamping the country's healthcare system, British Columbia created a new class of license that would allow overseas-trained doctors to practice under the supervision of a fully licensed doctor, similar to licenses that exist in other provinces, such as Alberta.
In Ontario, the medical college activated a short-term license program that would allow hospitals to hire internationally trained doctors on short notice.
But the programs have had very little uptake since being launched in May in British Columbia and February in Ontario.
Immigrant doctors and their advocates say this is because requirements for the new license categories did almost nothing to allow more physicians to apply, and the licenses were poorly communicated to both applicants and hospitals.
The overburdened healthcare system is frequently an election issue in many Canadian provinces. A 2019 report from the Canadian Institute of Health Information found that Canada had 241 physicians per 100,000 people. Ontario had 234 physicians per 100,000, and British Columbia had 250. The OECD average is roughly 350 physicians per 100,000 people, according to a 2020 report by the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based health foundation.
Amir Bajehkian, a co-founder of Trained to Save Lives, a Vancouver-based advocacy group for international medical graduates, said he was optimistic when British Columbia initially announced the new class of license.
He hoped it would fulfill requests foreign-trained doctors had been making for years.
But the requirements - at least two years' postgraduate training, strict English fluency and a specialty in acute care - barely moved the needle on who was able to apply, Bajehkian said.
""A lot of physicians are like, what's the point? Why are you doing this?"" he said.
Ontario doctors face a similar situation, said Ahmad Al-Khatib, 33, an Iraqi who practiced in the United Arab Emirates before coming to Canada four years ago.
""When the pandemic started I felt so helpless, even useless,"" Al-Khatib said. ""I have all this experience and I'm seeing people dying around me and this is where I used to work - I used to work in the emergency.""
The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario said that if applicants met all the requirements, including confirming employment with the hospital, they would be granted a license. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia declined to comment.
Even in Alberta, which has had a pathway similar to that in British Columbia for over 10 years, the challenges are steep.
Claudia Avila, 39, an obstetrician and gynecologist with 11 years of experience in her home of Venezuela, emigrated to Canada with her husband and daughter four years ago.
For Edmonton area-based Avila, it took years of saving to pay for the costly exams and its preparations. Then the regulations changed and she had to start over.

Avila came to Canada on a skilled worker visa, she said. ""Then we come here and we see that they don't even care... It is very sad. I would say I wouldn't be here if I knew it was going to be that hard.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - April van Ert should have been relieved when her son's Vancouver school reopened on June 1. For months she had been juggling her busy job and her 11-year-old son's education amid the COVID-19 shutdowns.
But due to distancing requirements, the return was hybrid: one day in class, and online work the rest of the week. The model was ""completely untenable"" for working parents, said van Ert.
""If that's the plan if there's a resurgence in the fall, then I don't see how I'm going to avoid reducing the hours I work,"" she said.
Planning is now underway to get Canadian children back into classrooms in the fall and many provinces are eyeing Vancouver's hybrid model: part-time in school and part-time at home with online learning.
It's the same model being considered by New York City, the early epicentre of the U.S. coronavirus crisis, as new cases have surged in that country. 
But school boards, teachers' unions, medical professionals, and parents are increasingly rallying against the model, saying the risk of COVID-19 should not outweigh the harm closures cause to the emotional well-being and education of children.
Experts say a part-time return will exasperate an already uneven economic recovery and increase gender inequality, further hurting women who were harder hit by layoffs and reduced hours amid the coronavirus crisis. 
""In dual income families ... the conversation becomes, if we have to lose one income, who is it going to be? And the odds are that it's women who will make that decision to step back from the workplace,"" said Stephania Varalli, co-chief executive of Women of Influence.
NO SCHOOL, NO WORK
Schools across Canada were shuttered in March to curb the spread of COVID-19, impacting some 5.5 million children. With kids at home and parents reducing their work hours, the economic hit was likely about 0.8% off Canada's GDP each month, said Vicky Redwood (NYSE:RWT), senior economic adviser at Capital Economics.
Women, who are more likely to work in the service sector, saw more COVID-19 job losses than men, and childcare issues have made it harder for them to return to work, Statistics Canada data shows. Lower-income women were the hardest hit.
Even as jobs returned, employment levels for mothers of school-aged children remained well below pre-COVID levels in June, though daycare reopenings improved the picture for women with very young kids. Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3iUL2cc
""Moms got hit with a double whammy of being more at risk of job loss because of gendered patterns in employment and because of the closure of schools and daycares,"" said Jennifer Robson, an associate professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.
The loss of one parent's income has long-term ramifications for the economy, especially as Canada claws its way out of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. And policy makers are taking notice.
""Parents are nervous, and rightfully so,"" Maryam Monsef, Canada's Minister for Women, said this week. ""We need women to get back to work so that we can restart the engines of our economy."" 
BACK TO CLASS
In populous Ontario, the provincial government is being urged to look to Quebec rather than British Columbia for its back-to-school plan.
Quebec turned to masks, hand sanitizer and distancing dots when it fully reopened most of its elementary schools in mid-May. That same month, Quebec accounted for nearly 80% of Canada's total employment gains.
But there are downsides. There were 53 active COVID-19 cases among teachers and students the week of June 5th alone, Quebec's education ministry said. By contrast, there was just one known case at a British Columbia school in all of June.
For many parents the risk is worth it. Ottawa single mom Ruth Thompson said her 6-year-old son has spent too many hours in front of a tablet and needs to get back to learning with friends.

""For me, full-time is the only option ... online schooling doesn't work,"" she told a school board meeting this week.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan will permit non-Muslims to consume alcohol and strengthen women's rights, including banning female genital mutilation (FGM), its justice minister said late on Saturday, in a reversal of almost four decades of hardline Islamist policies.
About 3% of Sudan's population is non-Muslim, according to the United Nations.
Alcoholic drinks have been banned since former President Jaafar Nimeiri introduced Islamic law in 1983, throwing bottles of whisky into the Nile in the capital Khartoum.
The transition government which took over after autocrat Omar al-Bashir was toppled last year has vowed to lead Sudan to democracy, end discrimination and make peace with rebels.
Non-Muslims will no longer be criminalised for drinking alcohol in private, Justice Minister Nasredeen Abdulbari told state television. For Muslims, the ban will remain. Offenders are typically flogged under Islamic law. 
Sudan will also decriminalise apostasy and ban FGM, a practice which typically involves the partial or total removal of the external genitalia of girls and women, he said.
Women will also no longer need a permit from male members of their families to travel with their children.
Nimeiri's introduction of Islamic law was major catalyst for a 22-year-long war between Sudan's Muslim north and the mainly Christian south that led in 2011 to South Sudan's secession.
Bashir extended Islamic law after he took power in 1989.
Sudanese Christians live mainly in Khartoum and in the Nuba mountains near the South Sudan border. Some Sudanese also follow traditional African beliefs.

The transition government led by Abdalla Hamdok runs the country in an uneasy coalition with the military which helped remove Bashir after months of mass protests.

Lebanon is suffering a financial meltdown which marks the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war. 
For the second sermon in a row, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai stressed the importance of Lebanon's neutrality, implicit criticism of the heavily armed Hezbollah over its support for Iran in conflicts with Sunni-led Gulf Arab states.
Rai carries weight as the head of the Maronite church, the Christian community from which the president must be drawn in a sectarian system of government. 
His last two sermons have been seen to mark a shift to a more openly critical stance against the policies of both Hezbollah and its ally President Michel Aoun. 
Both back the government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab.
""The intervention was seen as a shift in his politics away from supporting the president and more into criticizing the political position of the country, regionally and internationally,"" Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said.
Rai, in a copy of the sermon sent by email, said Lebanese ""rejected any ... parliamentary majority messing with the constitution ... and Lebanon's model of civilization, and that it isolate it from its brothers and friends ... and that it move it from abundance to want and from prosperity to decline"".
Lebanon's crisis is rooted in decades of state corruption and bad governance by the sectarian ruling elite.
Hezbollah's opponents say it shoulders blame as its alliance with Iran has led Gulf Arab states that once supported Lebanon to keep their distance, closing off an important source of aid.

Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has called on Lebanon to look east as it seeks help fix the economy, though he said last week this does not mean the country should cut itself from the rest of the world.

Keita announced in a speech late on Saturday he was dissolving the Constitutional Court and would move to implement recommendations made last month by regional bloc ECOWAS, which included re-running some of March's contested legislative elections.
A spokesman for M5-RFP, a coalition of political, religious and civil society leaders that launched protests over a month ago calling for Keita to resign, rejected his proposal. 
""We are not going to accept this nonsense,"" the spokesman, Nouhoum Togo, told Reuters. ""We demand his resignation plain and simple."" 
Keita, who won a second term in 2018, has faced mounting public discontent over a perceived failure to address the country's security and economic problems. The wave of protests was sparked by a dispute over the elections. The court that Keita proposed dissolving reversed several provisional results, handing additional seats in parliament to the president's party. 
Four people died in the capital Bamako on Friday during a demonstration where protesters occupied the parliament and national broadcaster, the government said. It was the third major protest organised by the M5-RFP since June 5. 
Togo said the police shot and killed eight opposition supporters on Saturday. 
It was not immediately possible to corroborate that. Police officials could not be reached for comment. Asked about the claim, a security ministry spokesperson said he did not have any information about that yet.
In his speech, Keita said he remained open to dialogue with his opponents but condemned acts of vandalism. 
""The state will take responsibility and fundamental liberties will be protected as long as I have the great privilege to serve you,"" he said. 

The turmoil is a worry for Mali's neighbours and outside powers like France who are waging a joint military campaign against Islamist insurgents linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in West Africa's Sahel region.

Critics saw the rejection as part of a political vendetta by President Rodrigo Duterte's allies in Congress after the media conglomerate angered him for its failure to air some of his paid 2016 election campaign commercials. The network has apologised. 
A legislative committee overwhelmingly agreed with a working group's assessment that ABS-CBN, which employs 11,000 people and has an audience of tens of millions of Filipinos, was ""undeserving of the grant of legislative franchise"".
In a July 3-6 nationwide mobile phone survey, private pollster Social Weather Stations (SWS) found that 75% of adult Filipinos had agreed that ""Congress should renew the franchise so that ABS-CBN can broadcast its programs again"".
Of those surveyed, 10% were undecided while 13% disagreed, SWS said in a statement.
The survey also found 56% agreed that the non-renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise was ""a major blow to press freedom"", SWS said.
The government ""lost a media partner in information dissemination"", Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque said in a statement on Sunday when asked for comment on the survey.

However, he reiterated that the granting of the broadcasting franchise remained the exclusive prerogative of Congress.

Flooding in the Poyang county of Jiangxi pushed water levels of Lake Poyang, China's biggest freshwater lake, to above 22.52 metres (74 feet), a historical high and well above the alert level of 19.50 metres (64 feet). 
By Saturday evening, provincial military authorities had dispatched thousands of soldiers to help bolster nearly 9 km (6 miles) of the lake's banks, state television said. 
China has a four-tier flood control emergency response system, with level one representing the most severe.
So far this year, some 141 people have died or gone missing in the floods, which have ravaged 3.53 million hectares (8.72 million acres) of farmland and flattened 28,000 homes. Economic losses total 82.23 billion yuan ($11.75 billion), state news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday.
According to the Ministry of Water Resources, 212 rivers have exceeded alerting levels since early July, with 19 of them rising to historical highs. 

China has blamed unusual weather conditions, including humidity carried from the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean, as the immediate cause, but it has also said long-term changes in climate patterns have made it more vulnerable.

""My thoughts go to Istanbul. I think of Santa Sophia and I am very pained,"" he said during his weekly blessing in St. Peter's Square.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has said the first prayers would be held in Hagia Sophia on July 24, after declaring the ancient monument was once again a mosque following a court ruling revoking its status as a museum.
The World Council of Churches has called on Erdogan to reverse his decision and Patriarch Bartholomew, the Istanbul-based spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, called it disappointing.
Erdogan said the nearly 1,500-year-old Hagia Sophia, which was once a Christian cathedral, would remain open to Muslims, Christians and foreigners.
He added that Turkey had exercised its sovereign right in converting it to a mosque and would interpret criticism of the move as an attack on its independence.

Greece has condemned the move and UNESCO said its World Heritage Committee would review Hagia Sophia's status and that Turkey's decision raised questions about the impact on its universal value as a site of importance transcending borders and generations.

Hungary lifted most of its lockdown restrictions in May and opened its borders to travellers from European Union states and neighbouring non-EU members.
On Sunday, Gergely Gulyas told an online news conference that new restrictions were needed to keep the coronavirus ""outside the borders"" in order to avoid the re-introduction of domestic lockdown measures.
""These restrictions serve to protect our freedom,"" Gulyas said.
Under the new rules, Hungarian nationals returning from high risk countries listed as ""yellow"" and ""red"" will have to go through health checks at the border and will have to go into 14 days of quarantine even if they are not infected. This can only be avoided with two negative COVID-19 tests from the previous 5 days, Gulyas said.
The same applies to foreigners coming from ""yellow"" countries, but those from ""red"" countries will be barred from entry.
Countries in the Balkans such as Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro and neighbouring Ukraine belong to the red category, among some other states. 
Serbia, Bulgaria, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom are among countries listed as ""yellow"", while travel from Croatia -- a popular holiday destination for Hungarians -- is free for the time being. The list will be regularly reviewed.
Transit and cargo travel, as well as business trips are exempt from the restrictions but health checks can be conducted.

Hungary, which has a population of around 10 million, had recorded 4,234 cases of COVID-19 and 595 related deaths as of Sunday. It reported five new infections on Sunday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of China's President Xi Jinping and the ruling Communist Party was released on Sunday after six days of detention, his friends said.
Xu Zhangrun, a constitutional law professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, returned home on Sunday morning but remained under surveillance and was not free to speak publicly about what happened, one of his friends, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Calls to the media departments of the Beijing police and Tsinghua University seeking comment went unanswered on Sunday. 
Xu, 57, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two-term limit for China's leader, which will allow Xi to remain in office beyond his current second term.
According to a text message circulated among Xu's friends and seen by Reuters, he was taken from his house in suburban Beijing on Monday morning by more than 20 policemen, who searched his house and confiscated his computer.
According to Xu's friends, police told his wife that he was being detained for allegedly soliciting prostitution during a trip to Chengdu, but at least two friends dismissed that allegation as character assassination.
Since the 2018 article, Xu has written other critiques of the party. At the peak of China's coronavirus outbreak in February, he wrote an article calling for freedom of speech.
Most recently in May, before China's delayed annual parliamentary meeting, he wrote an article accusing Xi of trying to bring the Cultural Revolution back to China.
Under Xi, China has clamped down on dissent and tightened censorship.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said on Tuesday the United States was deeply concerned about China's detention of Xu and urged Beijing to release him.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Prostitutes demonstrated in Hamburg's red light district late on Saturday evening demanding that Germany's brothels be allowed to reopen after months of closure to curb the spread of coronavirus.
With shops, restaurants and bars all open again in Germany, where prostitution is legal, sex workers say they are being singled out and deprived of their livelihoods despite not posing a greater health risk. 
""The oldest profession needs your help,"" read a notice held up by one woman in a brothel window in the Herbertstrasse, which was flooded with red light after being dark since March. 
Some protesters wore theatrical masks while one played folk songs on a violin in the street just around the corner from the Reeperbahn, famous for its nightlife.
The Association of Sex Workers, which organised the protest, says the continued closure of licensed premises is forcing some prostitutes onto the streets, which is illegal and a far more dangerous and unhygienic way of working.
It said brothels could easily incorporate pandemic safety measures adopted by other industries, including face masks, ventilating premises and recording visitors' contact details.

""Prostitution does not carry a greater risk of infection than other close-to-body services, like massages, cosmetics or even dancing or contact sports,"" the association said in a statement. ""Hygiene is part of the business in prostitution.""

The U.N. earlier this week said it was extremely concerned after water entered the engine room of Safer tanker, which carries 1.1 million barrels of crude oil and has been stranded off the Red Sea oil terminal of Ras Issa for over five years. 
The sources said that the Iran-aligned Houthi group, which controls the port, sent a letter approving the deployment of a U.N. technical team to the tanker.
The United Nations is also discussing with Yemen's warring parties about arranging the sale of the crude and dividing proceeds between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and the Houthi group that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.
The U.N. Security Council is scheduled to hold a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the Safer tanker issue which has been mired in disputes over control of ports and revenues.
Yemen's oil output has collapsed since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 against the Houthis, who control Sanaa and most big urban centres including the main Red Sea port of Hodeidah. The Saudi-backed government holds eastern and southern areas where Yemen's oil-and-gas fields are located. 
The war has killed more than 100,000 people and caused what the U.N. describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
The United Nations recently launched virtual talks among the parties to agree a permanent ceasefire and confidence-building steps to restart peace negotiations. But discussions have been complicated by a surge in violence since late May when a temporary truce prompted by the coronavirus pandemic expired.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poles were voting on Sunday in a knife-edge presidential election that has highlighted the country's deep political divisions and may shape its future relations with the European Union.
Incumbent Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), takes on liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski after a campaign that has shown sharply contrasting visions for the future.
Duda's re-election is crucial if PiS is to deepen judicial reforms that the European Union has criticised as increasing political control over the courts. 
The president holds the power of veto and Trzaskowski, who has said he is seeking a more open Poland, has promised that if he wins he will block legislation that he believes would undermine democratic norms. 
""(This election) is important because it will be crucial for the next 30 years in Poland,"" said Przemyslaw Bochenski, a 60-year-old doctor, at a polling station in northern Warsaw.
""If we do not take the right direction now I am afraid that Polish democracy and Poland, everything we have built, will collapse.""
Given that Poland's president holds few executive powers, it is unlikely Trzaskowski could bring about significant change if he won. But with the presidency as well as the upper house of parliament in opposition hands, PiS's ability to implement its agenda would be hampered.
Polling stations in the election, a run-off after a first round on June 28, close at 1900 GMT, at which point the results of an exit poll will be announced.
Duda has painted himself as a defender of Poland's Catholic values and the generous social benefit programmes that have transformed life for many, especially in the poorer rural regions of the country, the EU's largest post-communist member.
""I believe we can build the Poland we dream of, a fair Poland, a rich Poland, a strong Poland... a Poland that can protect the weak and doesn't have to fear the strong,"" he told supporters on Friday.
However, while Duda vows to stand with the weak, critics say his campaign has also drawn on homophobia and anti-Semitism.
He has compared what he calls LGBT ""ideology"" to Soviet-era communist indoctrination, while state TV, the mouthpiece of the government, has used the sensitive issue of Jewish property restitution to attack Trzaskowski.
MORE TOLERANT POLAND
Trzaskowski, mayor of Warsaw since 2018, became a target for religious conservatives for promoting gay rights after he took part in pride marches and pledged to introduce sex education classes in the city's schools in line with WHO standards.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS and Poland's de-facto ruler, told Catholic television station TV Trwam on Thursday that Trzaskowski was at the centre of attempts to allow minorities to ""terrorise"" the rest of society.
Trzaskowski says he seeks a more tolerant Poland and has criticised PiS's rhetoric, while vowing to abolish state news channel TVP Info. 
""Have you ever heard such homophobia, such anti-Semitism, such attacks on everybody who is brave enough to say 'we have had enough',"" he asked supporters on Friday, contrasting PiS's use of language with that of opposition politicians.
But while vowing to block PiS's judicial reforms and condemning attacks on minorities, Trzaskowski has stressed that he would leave PiS's popular social benefit programmes intact and not seek to raise the retirement age.

Trzaskowski has tried to portray himself as someone who can unite a divided nation, but many observers say a period of bitter conflict between the PiS-dominated parliament and the presidential palace awaits if he wins.

Western states had pressed for aid access to continue through two crossings at the Turkish border, but Russia, President Bashar al-Assad's main ally in his war against, and China vetoed a last-ditch effort on Friday to keep both open.
""In northwest Syria, where a vital cross-border lifeline has been closed ... it will be harder to reach an estimated 1.3 million people dependent on food and medicine delivered by the U.N. cross-border,"" aid agencies operating in Syria said in a joint statement.

In a separate statement, Physicians for Human Rights said the resolution had shut down ""direct routes to hundreds of thousands of displaced Syrians in dire need of food and medicine"".
Russia and China have argued that the northwest can be reached from within Syria, meaning via government-held territory, and that aid deliveries from Turkey violate Syria's sovereignty. 
""This issue should not be politicized,"" deputy Russian U.N. envoy Dmitry Polyanskiy said after the vote.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's most famous film star Amitabh Bachchan, and his son Abhishek, are in stable condition after testing positive for the coronavirus, a hospital official and government health authorities said on Sunday. 
The 77-year-old legendary actor said in a tweet on Saturday night that he had tested positive for the highly infectious virus.
Within minutes, his actor son Abhishek Bachchan, 44, tweeted that he had also tested positive. 
Both were moved to the Nanavati Hospital in Mumbai despite showing only mild symptoms and the father-son duo appealed to their millions of fans to stay calm.
On Sunday, an official at Nanavati and government health officials in Mumbai said both the father and son were in stable condition. Reports were awaited on the condition of Amitabh Bachchan's wife Jaya and Abhishek's wife Aishwarya, both also highly regarded actors.
Meanwhile civic authorities launched a massive sanitising drill at Bachchan's upscale residence in Mumbai, spraying disinfectant in the large compound and on cars parked there.
A Bollywood legend, Amitabh Bachchan has been a prominent figure in the fight against the coronavirus by appearing in public service advertisements in which he urges people to wear a mask, wash hands frequently and maintain social distance in his trademark baritone.
India's film industry recently resumed film shoots after a months-long hiatus following the imposition of a nationwide lockdown in late March.
But actors over 65, such as Amitabh, are banned from the sets because of their vulnerability to the virus.

Coronavirus cases have been rising steadily in India. The disease has infected over 820,000 people and killed over 22,000 in the country, according to a Reuters tally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council on Saturday approved aid deliveries to Syria through one border crossing from Turkey, a day after its authorization for the six-year-long humanitarian operation ended, leaving millions of Syrian civilians in limbo.
The United Nations describes the aid delivered from Turkey as a ""lifeline"" for Syrians in the country's northwest. The 15-member council had been deadlocked, with most members pitted against Syrian allies Russia and China, which abstained on Saturday in the council's fifth vote this week on the issue.
Veto-powers Russia and China wanted to halve the approved Turkey border crossings to one, arguing that the northwest of Syria can be reached from within the country. They also wanted to include language that Western diplomats said blamed unilateral sanctions on Syria for the humanitarian crisis.
German U.N. Ambassador Christoph Heusgen told his Chinese and Russian counterparts to report back to their capitals that he had asked: ""How those people who gave the instructions to cut off the aid of 500,000 children ... are ready to look into the mirror tomorrow."" 
Council members had also been split on whether to renew authorization for six months or one year. The short resolution finally adopted on Saturday, which was drafted by Germany and Belgium, simply authorized one crossing for one year.
""Russia is consistently in favor of humanitarian deliveries to Syria with full respect of the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity and with coordination of its legal government. This issue should not be politicized,"" deputy Russian U.N. envoy Dmitry Polyanskiy said after the vote. 
Twelve members voted in favor, while the Dominican Republic also abstained. The successful vote came after two failed votes on Russian proposals and two vetoes by Russia and China of resolutions drafted by Germany and Belgium.
Acting British U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Allen said after the vote that the loss of aid access through Bab al-Salaam border crossing would deprive ""1.3 million people in northwest Syria of cross-border humanitarian assistance that they rely on."" 
Germany and Belgium said in a joint statement after the vote: ""One border crossing is not enough, but no border crossings would have left the fate of an entire region in question.""
When the Security Council first authorized the cross-border aid operation into Syria in 2014 it also included access from Jordan and Iraq. Those crossings were cut in January due to opposition by Russia and China. 
China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun said China always had reservations about the delivery of cross-border aid, but given the current situation in Syria it does not object to retaining it ""at this stage."" Though he added that ""it should adjusted accordingly in light of the developments on the ground.""

Russia has vetoed 16 council resolutions related to Syria since Syria's President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on protesters in 2011, leading to civil war. For many of those votes, Moscow has been backed in the council by China.

Protesters, most of whom wore masks, walked in front of the parliament building in the Serbian capital, occasionally calling for President Aleksandar Vucic to step down.
""We hope that authorities will hear us,"" said Stefana Radjenovic, one of the protesters.
""We want authorities to stop lying to us and we want to know the entire truth about everything that has been happening in connection with the coronavirus epidemic."" 
Similar peaceful protests were held in the cities of Novi Sad, Zrenjanin, Cacak and Nis. 
Late on Friday, police clashed with demonstrators who threw flares and stones. Fourteen police officers were injured and 71 people arrested, police said. 
This week's demonstrations were initially driven by frustration over economically stifling measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, but soon evolved into anti-government rallies that demanded Vucic's resignation.
Critics say the government's decisions to allow soccer matches, religious festivities, parties and private gatherings to resume in May and parliamentary elections to go ahead on June 21 are to blame for a surge in infections. 
Many believe the government was playing down the outbreak in order to allow the elections to proceed. 
Vucic dismissed those claims and described the protests as ""senseless."" 
Serbia, a country of 7 million, has so far reported 18,073 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and 382 deaths.

It is the first country in Europe to have held elections since the pandemic was declared. A number of opposition parties boycotted the vote to protest Vucic's control of the media, which they said did not give them enough coverage. Vucic rejected those claims.

The provincial government raised its flood-control response level to I from II, the People's Daily said, the top of China's four-tier scale, signalling disasters such as dam collapses or extraordinary simultaneous floods in several rivers.
With downpours continuing to wreak havoc across swathes of China, several other cities along the Yangtze have issued their highest-level flood warnings, with parts of the river threatening to burst its banks because of the incessant rain.
The Jiangxi authorities expect severe regional flooding in Poyang, state television said, which is China's largest freshwater lake and joins the Yangtze near the city of Jiujiang.
The level of the lake was rising at an unprecedented pace and had reached 22.65 metres by 9 p.m. Saturday (1300 GMT), above the record high set in 1998 and well over the alert level of 19.50 metres, the CCTV said.
Jiangzhou county, an island in the middle of Asia's longest river at the end of the lake, issued a call on social media for everyone from the town aged 18 to 60 to return and help fight the flood, citing a severe lack of hands to reinforce dams.
As of 5 p.m. on Saturday, flooding had affected 5.2 million people in Jiangxi province since Monday, with 432,000 people evacuated. It had also damaged 4.56 million hectares of crops and toppled 988 houses, leading to direct losses of 6.5 billion yuan ($929 million), CCTV reported.
China's emergency management ministry said it had diverted assault boats, tents, folding beds and blankets to the province.
China's national observatory renewed its yellow alert for rainstorms on Saturday, warning of heavy weekend rain in places including Sichuan and Chongqing in the southwest, the central province of Hubei and Hunan province in the south.

Authorities in Jiangsu province in the Yangtze Delta issued orange flood alerts on Saturday - the second-highest - saying huge, long-lasting volumes of water would pour from the river.

On Friday, police fired gunshots and tear gas to disperse protesters who had occupied parliament and the state broadcaster as part of a civil disobedience campaign aimed at forcing President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita to resign for failing to tackle Mali's security and economic problems.
Security forces on Saturday morning targeted the headquarters of CMAS, an opposition movement led by influential Muslim cleric Imam Mahmoud Dicko that is part of the M5-RFP opposition coalition, the group said. 
""While our activists were in a meeting, they came and attacked and ransacked our headquarters,"" M5-RFP spokesman Nouhoum Togo said.
One protest leader, Issa Kaou Djim, has been detained and remains in custody, Togo said earlier.
There was no immediate comment from police.
The protest came after the coalition rejected concessions from Keita aimed at resolving a political stand-off that began after a disputed legislative election in March.
Mali's neighbours and outside powers fear the impasse could further destabilise the country and jeopardise a joint military campaign against Islamist insurgents in the West African Sahel region.
Three protesters were killed on Friday and several others seriously wounded, according to the United Nations MINUSMA peacekeeping mission in Mali, whose human rights division monitored the protests. 
Keita issued a statement deploring the violence and said an investigation would be launched.
""However, I would like to reassure our people once again of my desire to continue dialogue and reiterate my readiness to take all measures in my power with a view to calm the situation down,"" he said late on Friday.
The streets of Bamako appeared largely quiet following the protest. State television ORTM resumed broadcasting after going off air when its building was occupied. 
Social media platforms Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were restricted late on Friday, Internet blockage observatory NetBlocks said. Internet access remained patchy on Saturday.

SREBRENICA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Bosnians commemorated on Saturday the massacre of about 8,000 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica, marking the 25th anniversary of killings that shocked the world and have stood out as Europe's only atrocity since World War Two constituting genocide.
Nine newly identified victims were buried at a flower-shaped cemetery near the town, where tall white tombstones mark the graves of 6,643 other victims. 
""After 25 years we succeeded in finding his mortal remains, so they can be laid to their final rest,"" said Fikret Pezic, who buried his father Hasan. 
The remains of some 1,000 victims of the massacre in the eastern town during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war are still missing. 
Ifeta Hasanovic decided to bury incomplete remains of her husband, saying: ""We were aware they cannot be complete after 25 years, at least there are some, I did not want to make any new delays."" 
World leaders addressed the ceremony by video link, unable to attend because of coronavirus epidemic. Instead of the tens of thousands visitors who typically attend the commemoration each year, only a few thousand came after organisers banned organised visits.
During the Bosnian war, Bosnian Serb forces pushed non-Serbs out of territories they sought for their Serb statelet. Fleeing Muslims took shelter in several eastern towns, including Srebrenica, that were designated as United Nations ""safe zones"".
On July 11, 1995, the Serb forces commanded by General Ratko Mladic overran Srebrenica, which was protected by lightly armed Dutch peacekeepers. 
They sent women and children away and captured and executed the men and boys they found. The bodies were dumped into mass graves and later exhumed by U.N. investigators and used as evidence in war crimes trials of Bosnian Serb leaders.
""We grieve with the families that tirelessly seek justice for the 8,000 innocent lives lost, all these years later,"" said U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Washington brokered Bosnia's peace deal months after the massacre. 
Most people at the commemoration were Muslim Bosniaks, reflecting conflicting narratives about the bloodshed - which hinders reconciliation nearly 25 years after the end of war in which about 100,000 people were killed. 
The U.N. war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia convicted Mladic and his political chief Radovan Karadzic over Srebrenica genocide but they remained heroes for Serbs, many of whom deny that genocide happened.
On Saturday, the Serbs in the nearby town of Bratunac organised an event marking July 11 as the ""Srebrenica Liberation Day"". 
Sefik Dzaferovic, the Bosniak chairman of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, called for legislation that would ban denial of genocide.

""There can be no trust as long as we witness attacks on the truth, denial of genocide and glorification and celebration of executors,"" Dzaferovic told the commemoration gathering.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The Democratic Republic of Congo's Justice Minister Celestin Tunda tendered his resignation on Saturday in the wake of a dispute with the president over proposed laws that would give politicians more control over criminal prosecutions.
In a televised statement, Tunda gave no reason for his departure, which comes a week after President Felix Tshisekedi privately threatened to fire Tunda if he did not quit, sources close to the president said.
The disagreement over a proposal from Tunda's political allies to give the justice ministry more control over the judiciary highlighted strains in the coalition between Tshisekedi and his long-serving predecessor Joseph Kabila.
Tshisekedi had said in a speech he would oppose any reforms that undermined the independence of the judiciary.
""I leave the government with the conviction that my actions in the ministry of justice made a contribution to the consolidation of the rule of law,"" said Tunda, a senior figure in Kabila's FCC political alliance.
Peter Kazadi of Tshisekedi's UDPS party said Tunda had sent a letter to parliament approving the judicial reforms without consulting the government. 
""His resignation is normal because the minister acted in violation of the line laid down by the government,"" Kazadi told Reuters.
Tension mounted in late June when Tunda was briefly detained by police, prompting Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga to threaten the government would resign over the matter.
His resignation ""removes one element of tension between the two camps, but it's far from the only point of contention,"" said Vincent Rouguet at London-based security firm Control Risks. ""(It) is not going to be enough to restore collaboration.""
Tshisekedi has struggled to assert himself since forming a coalition government in January 2019 with Kabila, who maintains extensive powers through his parliamentary majority, control of most cabinet ministries and the army. 

Friction between their parties has spilt into the streets in recent weeks. On Thursday at least three people including a policeman were killed during protests in Kinshasa and elsewhere over the nomination of an election commission chief.

Washington and Beijing recently exchanged visa bans against each other's officials, underscoring the deteriorating relations.

The Chinese foreign ministry could not be immediately reached for comment outside of business hours on Saturday. Beijing called on Wednesday a similar warning issued by Australia about the risk of arbitrary detention in China ""completely ridiculous and disinformation.""

Several thousand people took to the streets accusing the country's chief prosecutor and centre-right government of deliberately delaying investigations into links between graft-prone officials and local oligarchs.
Bulgaria, the European Union's poorest and most corrupt member state, has long pledged to root out graft but has yet to jail any senior officials on corruption charges.
Anti-corruption protesters demonstrated for second day in a row after prosecutors raided the offices of President Rumen Radev, who has been a vocal critic of the government.
The ruling centre-right GERB party of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said Radev was stoking a political crisis, which would only benefit shady business interests. GERB remains Bulgaria's most popular political party, according to opinion polls.
In an address to the nation on Saturday, Radev said the protests showed that Bulgarians across the political spectrum had had enough and he called for the resignation of the government and the chief prosecutor.
""The corruption, the prosecutors' racketeering and inaction against the plunderers ... and the lack of justice is what people stood against,"" he said. 
There was another demonstration on Saturday on the Black Sea coast near Burgas, where hundreds of Bulgarians demanded access to a public coastline near the summer residence of Ahmed Dogan, a businessman and senior member of the ethnic Turkish MRF party.
The demonstration was organised after the head of a small liberal party was denied access to the coast by armed guards of the National Protection Service, who were protecting Dogan. 
Protesters, who say the move was a sign of toxic links between the ruling elite and shady interests in the Balkan country, were stopped by police to prevent them clashing with MRF supporters at the site.
Police detained several protesters, who were later released on the request of Borissov. Protesters, waving national flags and singing the national anthem, were eventually given access to the coast.

More anti-government protests were planned for later on Saturday in Sofia.

China's success in driving down COVID-19 infections has made it harder to conduct large-scale vaccine trials, and so far only a few countries have agreed to work with it.
""We are contacting and Russia, Brazil, Chile and Saudi Arabia (for the Phase III trial) and it's still in discussion,"" Qiu Dongxu, executive director and co-founder of CanSino, told an anti-viral drug development conference in Suzhou, in eastern China.
He said its Phase III trials were likely to start ""pretty soon,"" and the company plans to recruit 40,000 participants for the tests.
Its COVID-19 candidate Ad5-nCov became the first in China to move into human testing in March but is running behind other potential vaccines in terms of trial progress. Two experimental vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech and a unit of China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) are already approved for Phase III trials.
Qiu said its Phase II trials involving 508 people have yielded ""much better"" results than Phase I about the vaccines safety and ability to trigger immune response. He did not disclose specific evidence.
He said its new factory under construction in China will allow it to produce 100-200 million doses of coronavirus vaccines per year by early 2021.
China's military, whose research unit is co-developing the vaccine candidate, approved its military use last month, while Sinopharm's two experimental shots are offered to employees at state-owned firms travelling overseas.
Zeng Guang, former chief epidemiologist at Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told the conference that Chinese construction groups overseas in particular are keen to take experimental vaccines.
He also said discussion should start whether to launch emergency inoculation of experimental vaccines ""right now.""

There are no approved vaccines yet for COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, which has killed more than half a million people globally.

The number of new infections reached 140 on Saturday, the highest recorded so far in a single day. Most cases are in the capital Zagreb and in east of the country.
The national civil protection directorate said that from Monday face masks will be obligatory for both employees and clients in shops, and also for employees in bars, restaurants and other places where there is close contact with customers.
The use of face masks on public transport was made compulsory several weeks ago.
During the spring months Croatia successfully limited the spread of the disease and by early June the number of new cases had fallen to just a few daily or even none. However, the number of new cases has soared in recent weeks, with many blaming the spread on gatherings such as weddings.
Around 500,000 tourists from central European countries and Germany are currently holidaying on the Adriatic coast, but there have been very few cases of the virus among them.

So far Croatia has registered 3,672 cases of COVID-19 and 118 deaths. At the moment there are 1,088 active cases.

Shortly after Rouhani’s televised speech, a police official in Tehran announced the closure of all wedding and mourning venues in the capital until further notice.
Iran has been gradually relaxing its lockdown since mid-April, but has recently reported a sharp rise in the infection rate.
The death toll on Saturday rose by 188 over the previous 24 hours to 12,635, while the total number of diagnosed cases reached 255,117, up by 2,397 during the same period, Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari said on state TV.
“We must ban ceremonies and gatherings all over the country, whether it be wakes, weddings or parties,” Rouhani said.
“Now is not the time for festivals or seminars,” he said, adding that even university entrance exams may have to be suspended.
Rouhani and other officials have blamed the rise in infections partly on wedding parties, wakes and other public gatherings.
An advisor to Iran’s Coronavirus Task Force warned that if appropriate measures were not taken, between 50,000 and 60,000 people could die from the pandemic.

While struggling to curb the spread of COVID-19, Iranian authorities are concerned that tougher measures could wreck an economy already reeling under U.S. sanctions.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea denounced Britain on Saturday for announcing sanctions against two organisations that the British government has said are involved in forced labour, torture and murder in North Korean prison camps.
The move against the two organisations, named as the Ministry of State Security Bureau 7 and Ministry of People's Security Correctional Bureau, is part of the first sanctions under Britain's new global human rights regime. Sanctions on 25 Russians and 20 Saudis were also announced.
""Britain's latest move is a flagrant political plot to jump on the bandwagon of the United States' inimical policy,"" a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesperson said in a statement carried on state media KCNA. 
""We strongly condemn and reject the UK's daring to impose sanctions on the institutions responsible for our country's security as violent interference in domestic affairs.""
The sanctions will take the form of asset freezing.
North Korea and the United States have failed to find a compromise over North Korea's nuclear weapons programme or international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.

Recent North Korean statements, including one by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un, have reiterated Pyongyang's objections to what it sees as hostile and self-serving policies of the United States.

Earlier this month, some British retailers pulled Thai coconut products after a report by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) alleged that coconuts in Thailand were picked by abused monkeys with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fiancée Carrie Symonds calling on other supermarkets to do the same.
PETA in a previous statement said that it believes ""virtually all"" coconuts from Thailand are picked by monkeys.
But Nirun Wongwanich, 52, who trains monkeys to fetch coconuts at a “monkey school” in the southern province of Surat Thani, says most coconuts used for exports are harvested by humans with poles because the trees were shorter. 
Only a few farms in the south use monkeys for older, taller types of coconut trees, he said, adding that he sometimes trains monkeys for these farmers.
Nirun denied accusations of cruelty.
“There is no truth to that. I have been with monkeys for over 30 years … I have a bond, a relationship with them,” he told Reuters. 
Nirun says he only trains six to seven monkeys in a year and insisted hitting monkeys was not done because they would become stressed and not cooperate. 
Thailand’s government has fiercely denied the PETA report, saying the use of monkey labor was “almost non-existent.”
Mananya Thaiset, Thai deputy minister of agriculture, said Thailand’s 200,000 coconut growers overwhelmingly use human labour and machines for harvesting. 
""Even all the monkeys in the entire forest won't be enough for the industry because we export hundreds of thousands of coconuts (each year),” Mananya said.

Thailand last year produced over 806,000 tons of coconut over 1,243.7 square kilometers, government data shows. It exported coconut milk worth 12.3 billion baht ($396 million), about 8% of it to Britain.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>","Virus-free UK pilot, symbol of Vietnam's pandemic success, to return home","HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's most seriously ill COVID-19 patient, a British pilot who at one point seemed close to death, left hospital on Saturday on his way home after a dramatic recovery that attracted national attention.
The case of Stephen Cameron, a pilot for national carrier Vietnam Airlines, became a sensation in Vietnam, where a combination of targeted testing and an aggressive quarantine programme has kept its coronavirus tally to an impressively low 370 cases, and zero deaths.
""The odds say that I shouldn't be here, so I can only thank everybody here for what they've done,"" Cameron said, leaving hospital in a wheelchair and flanked by doctors holding flowers.
The 43-year-old Scot, who arrived in the Southeast Asian country from Britain in early March, was hospitalised three days after his first flight for Vietnam Airlines, following a visit to a bar in Ho Chi Minh City that became linked to a cluster of coronavirus cases.
Cameron's illness and the highly publicised efforts of Vietnam's doctors to save him became a symbol in Vietnam of the country's successful fight against the virus. 
At one point, medical officials said Cameron, initially identified only as ""Patient 91"", had just 10% of his lung capacity and was in critical condition. 
With the vast majority of Vietnam's COVID-19 patients already recovered, the news of a potential first death prompted a national outpouring of support, with dozens of people coming forward as potential lung donors.
State doctors turned the volunteers down, saying donated lungs should come from brain-dead donors.
But under round-the clock care, Cameron improved. By June he no longer required a lung transplant and was taken off life support.
Vietnam spent over $200,000 treating him. Vietnamese doctors will accompany Cameron on the special flight back to Britain, state media said.
""As soon as I get fit, I'm coming back,"" said Cameron. ""I'm still a pilot - my license has lapsed, that's all.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's ruling party, stung by its worst ever election results, on Saturday signalled a possible delay to its meticulous succession plans, and analysts foresaw other policy changes that could affect the international business hub.
The People's Action Party secured 83 of 93 parliamentary seats in Friday's election - a resounding win by international standards - and its share of the popular vote dropped near a record low, while the opposition won an unprecedented 10 seats.
The results showed ""a clear desire for a diversity of voices,"" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told an early morning news conference. ""Singaporeans want the PAP to form the government but they, and especially the younger voters, also want to see more opposition presence in parliament.""
Stability and predictability define Singapore's politics, dominated by the PAP since independence in 1965, proving crucial in developing the city-state into a global finance hub and regional trading centre.
But analysts said the unexpected setback for Lee's party likely means tighter rules on foreign employment and other changes to social policies to assuage concerns raised by opposition parties.
""Policymakers will have a tighter line to walk on foreigners in the labour force and to double-up efforts on the economic wellbeing of lower-income groups,"" said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB Private Banking.
In 2011, when the PAP polled a record low 60% of the popular vote, it tightened international hiring rules to address voters' sensitivities. Voters in Friday's election had also expressed concern about their job prospects and whether their wealthy, small island needs so many foreigners in top paid roles.
NEXT GENERATION LACKED 'PULL POWER'
The election results cast a pall over Lee's plans to seek a mandate for the next generation of leaders as he prepared to step down. 
Analysts said the strong Workers' Party showing, which prompted wild celebrations in the small hours of Saturday morning in stronghold seats, could make Lee's eventual handover more contested.
His designated successor, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, scraped through with 53% of the vote in his constituency in the first real test of his popularity.
""This was not a strong endorsement of the new leaders,"" said Bridget Welsh, honorary research associate at the University of Nottingham Asia Research Institute Malaysia. Heng, 59, ""lacked national pull power in the campaign,"" as did many other next-generation leaders, she said.
The prime minister, who took a gamble by calling the election in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic, said he would now ""see this crisis through,"" a statement analysts took to mean he may put his retirement plans on hold.
The 68-year-old son of Singapore's founding leader Lee Kuan Yew, who is only the nation's third premier since independence, had said he was preparing to hand over the reins to a new generation of leaders in coming years.
With an overwhelming parliamentary majority, the PAP rarely has to court public opinion on policy or government plans. Heng had been selected by his peers as a future leader in a secretive process compared to how cardinals pick a pope.

The PAP's setback ""reopens questions about who is next,"" said Chong Ja Ian political scientist and visiting scholar at the Harvard-Yenching Institute. ""No one knows for sure, but these questions are sure to arise.""

830,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 11, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Turkish parliament passes disputed bar associations law,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament passed a law on Saturday on changing the structure of bar associations, a move that lawyers argue will further undermine judicial independence in a country where they say the judiciary is already in disarray.
Thousands of lawyers have protested in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities against the plan, saying it aims to silence some of the few institutions still speaking out against the government's record on rule of law and human rights.
The legislation allows multiple bar associations to be formed in each province, in place of the current system where each province has a single association, diluting the institutions' power.
A lawmaker for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, Cahit Ozkan, said last week the law was needed because bar associations were no longer able to function properly following a 13-fold increase in the number of lawyers in Turkey since the previous law came into effect.
Opponents say it will strengthen small provincial bars at the expense of the large associations in the main cities. The larger associations currently predominate and are frequently critical of the government.
These associations say the judicial system has descended into chaos in recent years with lawyers jailed, defences muzzled and confidence in judges and prosecutors destroyed.
The law was passed with 251 votes in favour in the 600-seat parliament, with only 417 MPs voting. The AK Party has 291 seats in the assembly, while its nationalist MHP allies have 49 seats.
The legislation ""appears calculated to divide the legal profession along political lines and diminish the biggest bar associations' role as human rights watchdogs,"" Human Rights Watch and the International Commission of Jurists said.
Muharrem Erkek, deputy leader of the main opposition Republican People's Party, said the new law would erode and polarise the legal profession.

""Their aim is to create partisan bar associations. If you weaken the bars, if you divide them, the citizens will suffer harm,"" he said shortly before parliament began debating the bill on Wednesday.

The primaries come less than two weeks after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on the Asian financial hub, stoking concerns that wide-ranging freedoms not seen in mainland China will be crushed.
The law punishes what China describes broadly as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison and allows mainland security agents to operate officially in Hong Kong for the first time.
On the eve of the primaries, police searched the office of independent pollster Robert Chung, whose Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) helps organise the election, raising concerns among activists of interference in the poll. 
""The primary election is our first time to let Beijing know Hong Kongers never bow down to China,"" said pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong ahead of the opening of polling booths at noon (0400 GMT).
""We urge the world to put Hong Kong under the global spotlight.""
While the primaries are only for the opposition camp, observers are watching closely as they say the turnout at the election will serve as a litmus test of broader opposition to the national security law.
The election seeks to bolster the chance for democracy candidates to achieve a 35-plus majority in the 70-seat legislature in polls on September 6, potentially giving them power to block government proposals.
Hong Kong's opposition camp secured a landslide victory in district council elections in November, riding on support for an anti-government protest movement triggered by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial.

Protests that escalated in June last year and evolved into calls for greater democracy have fizzled since police arrested more than 300 people on July 1, the day after Beijing introduced the national security law.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the longtime associate of late financier Jeffrey Epstein, on Friday forcefully denied charges she lured underage girls for him to sexually abuse and said she deserves bail, citing the risk she might contract the coronavirus in jail.
Maxwell, 58, filed her request in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, eight days after being arrested in New Hampshire, where authorities said she had been hiding at a sprawling property she bought while shielding her identity.
A spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan declined to comment.
Maxwell has been housed since Monday at the Metropolitan Detention Center, a Brooklyn jail.
She said her detention there put her at ""significant risk"" of contracting the coronavirus, after 55 inmates and staff had tested positive for COVID-19 through June 30.
Maxwell faces six criminal charges, including four related to transporting minors for illegal sexual acts, and two for perjury in depositions about her role in Epstein's abuses.
In Friday's filing, Maxwell said she ""vigorously denies the charges"" and intends to fight them.
Her arraignment is on July 14, and prosecutors want her detained until trial. Maxwell is the daughter of the late British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell.
Epstein was found hanged last Aug. 10 in jail at age 66, in a death ruled a suicide.
He had before his arrest socialized over the years with many prominent people including Britain's Prince Andrew, U.S. President Donald Trump and former President Bill Clinton.
MEDIA CRUSH
Maxwell's proposed bail package includes a $5 million bond, the surrender of her passports, ""stringent"" travel restrictions, and home detention with electronic monitoring.
She said she will continue needing security guards to ensure her safety.
Maxwell also maintained she is not a flight risk, claiming to have remained in the United States since Epstein's arrest.
She ""did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention and its very real harms,"" the filing said.
Friday's filing also raised several legal challenges to the indictment, including that Epstein's 2007 nonprosecution agreement with the U.S. government covered ""any potential co-conspirators.""
In seeking Maxwell's continued detention, prosecutors called her an ""extreme risk"" of flight because of the possible long prison term, her wealth, her multiple passports and citizenships, and her having ""absolutely no reason to stay.""

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 07:21PM ET</span>",Erdogan declares Hagia Sophia a mosque after Turkish court ruling,"By Daren Butler and Ece Toksabay
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan declared Istanbul's Hagia Sophia a mosque on Friday with the first Muslim prayers to begin in two weeks, after a top court ruled the ancient building's conversion to a museum by modern Turkey's founding statesman was illegal. 
Erdogan spoke on Friday just hours after the court ruling was published, brushing aside international warnings not to change the status of the nearly 1,500-year-old monument that is revered by Christians and Muslims alike.
The United States, Russia and church leaders were among those to express concern about changing the status of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, a focal point of both the Christian Byzantine and Muslim Ottoman empires and now one of the most visited monuments in Turkey. 
Greece's culture ministry described the court decision as an ""open provocation"" to the civilized world, while UNESCO said it regretted it was not notified ahead of time and would now review the building's status.
Erdogan has sought to shift Islam into the mainstream of Turkish politics in his 17 years at the helm. He has long floated restoring the mosque status of the sixth-century building, which was converted into a museum in the early days of the modern secular Turkish state under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
""With this court ruling, and with the measures we took in line with the decision, Hagia Sophia became a mosque again, after 86 years, in the way Fatih the conqueror of Istanbul had wanted it to be,"" Erdogan said in a national address. 
In a telling of history at times critical of the Byzantine Empire and the modern republic's founders, Erdogan said Turkey could now leave behind ""the curse of Allah, profits and angels"" that Fatih - the Ottoman Sultan Mehmet II - said would be on anyone who converted it from a mosque. 
""Like all our mosques, the doors of Hagia Sophia will be open to all, locals and foreigners, Muslims and non-Muslims,"" said Erdogan, who earlier on Friday signed off on the Religious Affairs Directorate managing the site.
The U.S. State Department, which had urged Turkey to maintain the building as a museum, said in a statement it was ""disappointed"" by the decision but looked forward to hearing the plans ""to ensure it remains accessible without impediment for all."" 
APPLAUSE
The association which brought the court case, the latest in a 16-year legal battle, said Hagia Sophia was the property of Sultan Mehmet II who captured the city in 1453 and turned the already 900-year-old Greek Orthodox cathedral into a mosque.
The Ottomans built minarets alongside the vast domed structure, while inside they added panels bearing the Arabic names of God, the Prophet Mohammad, and Muslim caliphs. The golden mosaics and Christian icons, obscured by the Ottomans, were uncovered again when Hagia Sophia became a museum. 
In its ruling the Council of State, Turkey's top administrative court, said: ""It was concluded that the settlement deed allocated it as a mosque and its use outside this character is not possible legally. 
""The cabinet decision in 1934 that... defined it as a museum did not comply with laws,"" it said, referring to an edict signed by Ataturk. 
Erdogan, a pious Muslim, threw his weight behind the campaign before local elections last year which dealt a painful blow to his ruling Islamist-rooted AK Party. Members stood and applauded in parliament on Friday when his decree was read out.
In Istanbul, hundreds of people gathered near Hagia Sophia to celebrate the ruling. ""Those who built this did it to worship God as well,"" said Osman Sarihan, a teacher.
""Thank God today it reverted to its main purpose. Today God will be worshipped in this mosque."" 
REVERSING ATATURK STEP
By reversing one of Ataturk's most symbolic steps, which underlined the former leader's commitment to a secular republic, Erdogan has capped his own project to restore Islam in public life, said Soner Cagaptay, director of the Turkish Research Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.
""Hagia Sophia is the crowning moment of Erdogan's religious revolution which has been unfolding in Turkey for over a decade,"" he said, pointing to greater emphasis on religion in education and across government.
The Russian Orthodox Church said it regretted that the court did not take its concerns into account and said the decision could lead to even greater divisions, the TASS news agency reported.
Previously, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and based in Istanbul, said converting it into a mosque would disappoint Christians and would ""fracture"" East and West.

Turkish groups have long campaigned for Hagia Sophia's conversion, saying it would better reflect Turkey's status as an overwhelmingly Muslim country.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia and China vetoed a last-ditch attempt by Western members of the U.N. Security Council to extend approval - which expires on Friday - for humanitarian aid to be delivered across two border crossings into Syria from Turkey for the next six months.
The United Nations says millions of Syrian civilians in the country's northwest depend on the humanitarian aid delivered from Turkey, describing it as a ""lifeline."" The remaining 13 council members voted in favor of the resolution on Friday. 
The 15-member council has been split, with most members pitted against Syrian allies Russia and China, who want to cut the number of border crossings to one, arguing those areas can be reached with humanitarian help from within Syria.
Later on Friday the council voted on a Russian draft text to approve aid deliveries for one Turkish crossing for one year, but it failed after only garnering four votes in favor. 
Diplomats said work would continue to see if a compromise could be reached among council members.
The council has now unsuccessfully voted four times on the issue and Russia and China have cast two vetoes this week. 
The Security Council first authorized the cross-border aid operation into Syria six year ago, which also included access from Jordan and Iraq. Those crossings were cut in January due to opposition by Russia and China. 
On Tuesday, Russia and China vetoed a bid to extend for a year approval of the two Turkey crossings. The remaining 13 members voted in favor of the resolution, drafted by Germany and Belgium. Russia then failed to win enough support on Wednesday for its proposal to authorize one crossing for six months.
Russia has now vetoed 16 council resolutions on Syria since Syria's President Bashar al-Assad cracked down on protesters in 2011, leading to civil war. For many of those votes, Moscow has been backed in the council by China.

Sirkis, 69, was killed when the car he was driving hit a post on a highway outside his hometown Rio de Janeiro, broadcaster TV Globo reported citing firemen at the crash.
A former leftist guerrilla, Sirkis was involved in the kidnapping of foreign diplomats to secure the release of political prisoners during Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship.
Following years in exile and one year after Brazil returned to democratic rule, Sirkis co-founded the Green Party with fellow environmentalist Marina Silva, who came third in the 2010 elections with 19% of the vote.
Sirkis was elected to Congress but decided not to run for re-election in 2014. 
He was a regular member of Brazil's delegation to global climate change talks. In 2015, he founded a think tank, the Brazil Climate Center, that is affiliated with Al Gore's Climate Reality Project. 
He also served as coordinator of the government-backed Brazilian Forum for Climate Change until 2019, when he was fired by right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has sought to dismantle environmental protections in the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Faced with sliding poll numbers and multiple national crises, President Donald Trump has leaned into a familiar campaign strategy of divisive rhetoric and raucous rallies ahead of the November election. But a lot has changed in America since 2016.
Trump is juggling a pandemic that has killed more than 130,000 Americans, an economy that cratered after lockdowns to stop the spread of the virus, and a national uproar over racial injustice and police brutality after the death in May of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, in police custody. 
Enlivened by last week's Mount Rushmore event in South Dakota, attended by a 7,500-strong crowd who welcomed his criticism of protesters nationwide, Trump told aides on Air Force One that he was eager to do more such events and take his message on the road, one adviser said. 
On Friday, however, the campaign postponed a rally planned for Saturday evening in New Hampshire, a battleground state Trump lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. The White House cited Tropical Storm Fay, although rains were forecast to move out of the area by the afternoon.
The decision not to go comes after the crowd at a rally last month in Tulsa, Oklahoma, underwhelmed, leaving the arena only partly full. The event likely contributed to a rise in the number of coronavirus cases there, a local health official said on Wednesday. 
Some Republicans fear Trump's unapologetic appeals to his loyal base will cost him moderate and independent voters and lead to a crushing defeat against Democrat Joe Biden in November. 
But the president has bypassed some advisers by following his own instincts, several say. The adviser said the president believed his stance against the ""angry mob” and the ""radical left"" would play well with voters.
""He wants to go back to what wins, which is law and order, America First, stopping the lawlessness,"" he said.
'EVERYONE BUT HIM'
Trump was elected in part by stoking racial and religious divisions, capturing the vote of independents by 7 points, older Americans by 13 points, white men without a college degree by 29 points, white college-educated men by 1 point, and white women by 13 points.
According to the Reuters Election Day poll in 2016, 26% of Trump’s voters were either first-time voters or had voted https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-whitevoters-insight-idUSKBN1352MO for former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, in 2012. Trump needs those voters again. 
But there is a broad sense that this year is different, according to one former Trump adviser, ""to everyone but him."" That is showing in the polls, where the Republican president is not only losing support from independents, but among white men, white women and senior citizens. 
Several of Trump's 2016 advisers have reached out to him in recent weeks to persuade him to abandon the rhetoric and instead lay out his plan for a second term, another source said. Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie sent a memo to the president last week to that end, according to that source. Christie did not respond to requests for comment.
Trump spent the past week stoking culture wars. 
At Mount Rushmore and in a July 4 holiday address from the White House on Saturday, he assailed protesters for tearing down statues as part of the nationwide reckoning over racial inequality.
On Monday, he criticized NASCAR's ban of the Confederate flag and said Black race-car driver Bubba Wallace should ""apologize,"" after an investigation into a noose discovered in his garage determined no crime was committed. 
Trump's rhetoric has undercut his most effective remaining strategy, according to a former White House official: painting Biden as too liberal.
""That's all they've got left at the moment, with four months left in the campaign,"" the former official said. ""They're down to the last play ... and they're not playing it very well.""
BACK TO THE BASE
""When times get tough for Trump, he goes back to his base,"" said Republican strategist Alex Conant. ""Nobody is going to cheer a lecture on the pandemic. But some people in his base will cheer the defense of Confederate statues.""
Trump continues to aim at what Republican Richard Nixon called the ""silent majority"" - defined during his successful 1968 presidential campaign as mostly middle-class, middle-aged white Americans in Middle America.
Trump first adopted https://www.reuters.com/article/us-media-election-trump-ailes-commentary/commentary-trump-and-ailes-shades-of-nixon-in-1968-idUSKCN105066 the term in 2016 and tweeted on Wednesday that the group was stronger than ever. 
So far, polling numbers have shown a different story. From March to June, Biden increased support over Trump by 12 points among independents, according to Reuters/Ipsos data. Adults older than 55 gave Biden a 7-point advantage in support in June - a reversal from March, when they gave Trump a 3-point advantage.
The campaign had hoped to turn that around in New Hampshire. At Trump's last rally there in February, before the coronavirus outbreak hit, 17 percent of the 53,000 tickets handed out were to people who did not vote in the last election and 25 percent were to Democrats, it said.
""These rallies are a perfect opportunity to remind voters of President Trump's historic accomplishments,"" said spokesman Hogan Gidley.

The White House said the rally would be rescheduled for a week or two from now.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Police in Mali on Friday fired gunshots and tear gas to try to dislodge protesters demanding the resignation of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita from occupying the state broadcasting house and parliament, according to a Reuters witness.
Two sources said at least one person was killed outside the national assembly building. 
Mali's state television ORTM went off the air after hundreds of protesters occupied the building in the capital Bamako.
The protesters, called to a rally by an opposition coalition, also tried to take over two major bridges.
The protest was the third since June, and came after the opposition coalition rejected concessions from Keita aimed at resolving a months-long political stand-off that began after a disputed legislative election in March.
Mali's neighbours and outside powers worry the impasse could further destabilise the country and jeopardise a joint military campaign against Islamist insurgents in the West African Sahel region.
Protesters pelted the national assembly with rocks and shattered its glass facade, then ransacked and set fires in parts of the building.
Videos on social media sites showed a fire burning outside the building while protesters ran away with what looked like files, computers, furniture and other items. The authenticity of the videos could not be verified by Reuters.
Gunshots could be heard in the vicinity of both the national assembly and the ORTM building, a Reuters witness said, while other groups of protesters fought running battles with the police along a main bridge and surrounding neighbourhoods.
Leaders of the protest had called on supporters to occupy buildings, including the Prime Minister's office, as part of a civil disobedience campaign aimed at forcing Keita to resign for failing to tackle Mali's security and economic problems.
Before the rally, influential Muslim cleric Imam Mahmoud Dicko, one of the leaders of the protest, told France24 television that they had dropped the demand for the president to resign but wanted further gestures from him. 
""This is because we think it (the resignation) will cause more problems than it will resolve,"" Dicko said. ""Mali's problem is not about a government of national unity. It is a problem of governance.""
Other leaders of the coalition said at the rally they still want Keita to resign, however, and said they would persist with the disobedience campaign until he quits. 
Keita was re-elected in 2018 for a second five-year term but his leadership has faced mounting opposition amid a surge in jihadist violence and an economic crisis. 

J. Peter Pham, U.S. Special Envoy to the Sahel, warned that any unconstitutional change of government in Mali was out of the question.

Police in riot gear and mounted units deployed around the parliament building to prevent Vucic's opponents from storming it. Protesters, who pelted police with rocks and flares, chanted ""We will not give up Kosovo"" and ""Vucic thief."" 
Earlier in the day, Vucic said efforts by Germany and France to restart talks aimed at mending ties between Belgrade and Pristina were already paying off.

In Paris, Vucic accused his political opponents of orchestrating the protests and said that if they continue it would be difficult to contain the coronavirus epidemic.
""The problem is that they (the protests) became violent, because they (opponents) ... they don't have anything to offer to the people.""
In Belgrade, one protester was stabbed in the leg, the Interior Ministry said in a statement. 
This week's demonstrations were at first driven by frustration over economically stifling measures to contain the pandemic, but soon evolved into anti-government rallies with participants demanding Vucic's resignation.
Prime Minister Ana Brnabic announced on Friday that ""hospitals are packed with sick"" and said protests posed a major health risk.
Critics say the government's decisions to allow soccer matches, religious festivities, parties and private gatherings to resume in May and parliamentary elections to go ahead on June 21 are to blame for the new surge in infections.
Vucic dismissed those claims and dismissed protests as ""senseless."" ""You cannot seize power using force,"" he said.
Serbia, a country of 7 million, has so far reported 17,728 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 370 deaths.

Serbia is the first country in Europe to have held elections since the pandemic was declared. A number of opposition parties boycotted the vote to protest Vucic's control of the media, which they said did not give them enough coverage. Vucic rejected those claims.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau came under pressure on Friday from opposition parties he depends on for support in parliament amid heightening controversy over his family's ties to a charity at the heart of his conflict-of-interest probe.
The Bloc Quebecois said he should temporarily yield his post to his deputy, Chrystia Freeland, until the investigation is over, while the main opposition Conservative Party urged a criminal probe. The left-leaning New Democrats said the situation was ""more than disturbing"".
The Liberal leader lost his majority in parliament in October and depends on opposition parties for support, but none has said it wants to topple the government, and it would take a concerted effort by all of them to do so.
""For a few months, I think the prime minister must step aside and leave ... the responsibilities to the deputy prime minister,"" Bloc Quebecois Leader Yves-Francois Blanchet said in an interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC).
""This is a pattern of behavior with Mr. Trudeau,"" New Democrat leader Jagmeet Singh said in a statement. ""Canadians deserve to know the truth and need to know this won't happen again.""
Trudeau, 48, found himself facing a third investigation for conflict of interest in a little over three years last week after his government awarded a sole-sourced, C$900 million ($662.9 million) government contract to WE Charity Canada to administer a student grant program.
The charity backed out about a week after the contract was announced. Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, have regularly participated in WE Charity events, and Gregoire Trudeau hosts a podcast on the charity's website for which she is not paid.
But Trudeau's rivals went into attack mode on Thursday when WE Charity disclosed it paid honoraria to Trudeau's mother, Margaret, amounting to C$250,000 ($184,000) for speaking at some 28 events, while his brother, Alexandre, received about C$32,000 ($23,540). The payments were handed out between 2016-2020, during Trudeau's first mandate.
There was no immediate comment from Trudeau's office on Friday, but he has said he never accepted any payment from the charity.
Last week, Trudeau said: ""It's clear there are lessons to be learned about how we can deliver the best programs for young people without attracting controversies like this.""
'DO-GOODERITIS'
Trudeau's popularity took a beating last year ahead of his re-election bid when he was admonished from breaking conflict-of-interest guidelines in a corporate legal case. The first ethics sanction came in 2017 for accepting a vacation on the Aga Khan's private island a year earlier.
""Trudeau has do-gooderitis,"" a former Ottawa insider said. ""He thinks: 'My motives are so pure and I'm so good, how could anything I do be suspect?' He doesn't pause to think about what these things look like from the outside.""
Trudeau was not the only member of government to have ties to WE Charity. Grace Acan, who was born in Uganda but joined Finance Minister Bill Morneau's family as a teenager in 2010, works at the charity. 
""There is absolutely no link between her employment and any work that WE does with the Government of Canada,"" Morneau's spokeswoman, Maeva Proteau, said in a statement. 
Neither Trudeau nor Morneau recused themselves from the Cabinet decision to award WE Charity management of the grant program. They said the public service recommended the charity for the job.
Trudeau has proven to be resilient in the past, including after decades-old blackface images surfaced during last year's re-election campaign. Furthermore, the prime minister's approval rating doubled to about 70% on his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Ekos Research polling. 
""I don't know if he's made of teflon, but he's shown the capacity to make really good adjustments,"" said Frank Graves, president of polling company EKOS Research, adding that the opposition is doing ""a lot of sabre rattling"".

Darmanin, who denies the allegation, was promoted to the key post of interior minister in a government reshuffle on Monday. Darmanin, 37, had previously served as budget minister.
Demanding his immediate resignation, the women waved placards with messages such as ""Sexist government, feminist riposte"". Their protest follows a smaller one outside the interior ministry involving a few dozen women on Tuesday. 
A judge dismissed the case against Darmanin two years ago, but last month the Paris appeal court ordered the reopening of an investigation into the rape allegation, a judicial source has told Reuters.
The government has said the investigation against him was no reason to block his appointment. 

The court decision means that an investigating judge will now decide whether there is a case to pursue with a formal investigation, after it was previously dismissed after just a preliminary probe.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 02:11PM ET</span>","Singapore's ruling party seen retaining power, but opponents make gains","By Aradhana Aravindan, John Geddie and Tom Westbrook
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's ruling People's Action Party is on track to retain power comfortably, early counting of votes from Friday's general election showed, but opponents appear to have made historic inroads in a poll held under the cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In power since independence in 1965, the PAP had been widely expected to win and carry Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to what is likely his last victory before retirement as national leader. 
A random sample of 100 votes from each polling station showed the PAP retaining 83 out of 93 seats in parliament, according to the Elections Department.
But the early results also showed the main opposition Workers' Party ahead in 10 seats, which would be a record if confirmed in final counting, and drops in the PAP vote share in several hard-fought districts.
""It's been a bit of a punishment for the PAP,"" said Chong Ja Ian, political scientist and visiting scholar at the Harvard-Yenching Institute.
""They (voters) are not taken by the claims that the PAP knows everything and prefer some oversight.""
The PAP won 70% of the popular vote in 2015 and secured 93% of seats in parliament. The sample poll proved accurate then, although authorities have cautioned that the final results may be different this time.
Several districts reported close-run races, including a constituency being contested by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who has been earmarked to take over as the city-state's leader from PM Lee the coming years.
""That would upend the whole leadership renewal and succession plan,"" said Eugene Tan, a professor at Singapore Management University (SMU) and ex-member of parliament, when asked if Heng may not be returned by voters.
The PAP polled 54% of the sample votes from Heng's constituency compared with 46% for the main opposition Workers' Party, which previously held six seats in parliament. 
PANDEMIC ELECTION
Lee, the son of Singapore's founding leader, Lee Kuan Yew, called the election in the midst of rising coronavirus infections to seek a fresh mandate to guide the country through a crisis that has crushed the small but open economy.
He has held the premiership since 2004. But aged 68, he has flagged his intention to step aside in coming years - turning the poll into a barometer of approval for both the government's handling of the coronavirus and the next generation of leaders.
Stringent safety measures such as requirements to wear rubber gloves and regularly sanitise surfaces when voting led to long queues at polling stations across the island and prompted election officials to extend voting by two hours.
Final results, due by the early hours of Saturday, will be closely watched as even small shifts in the PAP's popularity can lead to major policy changes.
When concerns around immigration and jobs flared in 2011, the PAP polled a record-low 60% of the vote and tightened international hiring rules to address voters' sensitivities.

Those concerns have come to the fore again as the country emerges from lockdown to face its deepest recession.

The crew, on board a patrol boat, fulfilled a broad array of drills on their maiden voyage, simulating how they would react to an incursion by saboteurs including by tossing RGD-5 hand grenades into the sea.
""I decided to become a member of the crew because it's very interesting,"" said Olga Chelkova, a senior engine mechanic. ""It's promising and, most of all, it's an experiment that women have never taken part in before.""
The voyage marks a symbolic step in Russian women's quest to play a more active role in the armed forces, an institution dominated by men. 
The navy still holds barriers to entry for women. A decree signed by President Vladimir Putin in 2000 lists 456 jobs in 38 industries which women are barred from doing because they would entail ""heavy work and work in harmful working conditions"".
The role of captain is not on the list but seaman is, and serving a seaman's apprenticeship is standard practice for male cadets and a necessary step to take on a command role.
The Russian government plans next year to shorten the list of jobs women are barred from holding.

847,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 02:06PM ET</span>",Special Report: How the Trump administration secured a secret supply of execution drugs,"By Jonathan Allen
(Reuters) - If the Trump administration carries out the first federal execution since 2003 on Monday, as scheduled, it will mark the culmination of a three-year campaign to line up a secret supply chain to make and test lethal-injection drugs, a Reuters investigation has found.
Intent on enforcing the death penalty, President Donald Trump’s Department of Justice had started building the network of contractors it would need by May 2017, federal procurement records show. Since then, it has pursued a new drug protocol that could survive legal challenges through firms whose identities it has fought to keep hidden. Without the secrecy, the government has argued in court filings, its ability to procure the drugs would be “severely impaired” because the companies are not willing to supply or test execution drugs if they are publicly identified. 
In some cases, even the companies involved in testing the deadly pentobarbital said they didn’t know its intended purpose. Among them is DynaLabs in downtown St. Louis, a laboratory that years ago decided against doing quality tests on execution drugs because of the controversy surrounding capital punishment.
So co-founder Michael Pruett was surprised to learn from a Reuters reporter that his firm had been testing drugs that the Justice Department planned to use in lethal injections of condemned prisoners. The vials containing 50 milliliters of pentobarbital, a powerful barbiturate, began arriving at his firm for testing on April 9 of last year, according to laboratory records included in Justice Department filings. 
The samples came not from the government, but rather a regular DynaLabs customer, a so-called compounding pharmacy that mixes custom-ordered drugs. Because pentobarbital has other uses, such as euthanizing animals or treating seizures, Pruett said he had little reason to suspect they might be used to kill condemned prisoners.
""We decided seven or eight years ago we were not going to test for compounds that were being used for putting anyone to death,"" Pruett said in an interview.
Reuters identified DynaLabs, along with two other laboratories that were involved in testing, through redacted laboratory reports that the Justice Department produced in response to lawsuits filed by death-row inmates. In legal filings, the department had cited the testing firms’ results as evidence of the drugs’ safety. It blacked out the companies' names, logos and other identifying information.
All three firms confirmed that they had produced the test results cited by the Justice Department in court filings. One of the firms, ARL Bio Pharma Inc in Oklahoma City, said in a statement to Reuters that it was “not aware of the intended use” of the drugs. The third firm, Eagle Analytical Services Inc in Houston, declined to comment on whether it knew at the time that it was testing lethal-injection drugs for the government.
All three firms told Reuters the Justice Department did not hire them directly, saying they were contracted by a compounding pharmacy, which they declined to identify. The Justice Department has confirmed in court filings that it has hired one such pharmacy to make the execution drugs. Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle declined to name any of the companies in its supply chain or to answer detailed questions from Reuters about its efforts to secure lethal drugs.
Lawyers for death-row prisoners and death-penalty opponents argue that such secrecy prevents the public and condemned inmates from evaluating whether executions will adhere to the country’s strict drug-control laws and a constitutional ban on ""cruel and unusual"" punishments. Paul Enzinna, one of the lead attorneys representing the death-row inmates challenging the federal execution protocol, declined to comment for this story.
The difficulty in procuring execution drugs has forced states and the U.S. government to get their supplies of the drug from compounding pharmacies, which operate differently from large pharmaceutical companies — and with less oversight. Such pharmacies typically mix tailored versions of drugs suited to individual patients, for example by turning a pill into a liquid form for a patient who has trouble swallowing. Their products have short shelf-lives and do not require FDA approval, making them more prone to problems with potency or contamination that could lead to a needlessly painful death, health experts say.
Introduced in the 1970s, lethal injections have since replaced the electric chair as the primary method of U.S. executions, in part because states argued injection was a more humane method. But the drugs can inflict pain. Pentobarbital can rapidly damage capillaries in the lungs and force blood frothing into the airways, leading to a drowning sensation in a condemned inmate who has not yet lost consciousness, autopsies of executed inmates show. A degraded or substandard drug can cause suffering by delaying the moment of unconsciousness, lawyers for condemned inmates have argued in court filings.
The Justice Department has scheduled the executions of two men convicted of murdering children for next week, starting Monday, and a third in August. The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for the executions on June 29, when it declined to rule on a legal challenge brought by death row inmates. Their lawyers argued that the government’s move to create its own lethal-injection protocol violated a law requiring federal executions to follow the procedures of the state where an inmate was sentenced.
The department first announced in July 2019 that it would resume executions. But its work in lining up a lethal drug supply had started more than two years earlier, a timeline that has not been previously reported. In May 2017, the department — anticipating legal challenges — hired an Arizona litigation consulting firm, Elite Medical Experts LLC, according to contracting records in the government’s procurement database.
Elite lined up physicians and scientists who could assess whether pentobarbital was a humane method of execution that could replace the three-drug lethal injection protocol used in the last federal execution in 2003, the documents showed. The new drug protocol was needed because supplies of an anaesthetic in the three-drug cocktail, sodium thiopental, had dried up when the last remaining U.S. manufacturer, Hospira Inc, stopped making it in 2011. The company said at the time that it could not comply with a requirement from the government of Italy, where its factory was located, that it ensure the drug is not used for U.S. executions.
Elite’s founder, Burton Bentley, said in an interview that his firm only provided the department with expert witnesses and that he had no knowledge of what companies would supply the lethal drug.
The refusal by pharmaceutical companies to sell execution drugs to U.S. prison systems has choked legal supply channels for Texas, Missouri and the more than two dozen other states that still enforce the death penalty. Over the last decade, some states have resorted to promising anonymity to their lethal-drug suppliers, with at least 13 passing new laws to keep the companies’ identities secret. Other states say they have abandoned efforts to procure a reliable source of lethal-injection drugs because of the increasing difficulty, leaving their condemned inmates in limbo.
Many pharmaceutical firms avoid any involvement in supplying drugs for executions, reasoning that their medicines are intended to promote health rather than kill people. The industry has come under pressure by anti-capital punishment groups and had to comply with a 2011 European Union ban on execution drugs. It has since become standard for pharmaceutical firms to refuse to sell drugs for U.S. executions. The American Pharmacists Association, representing about 60,000 practicing pharmacists and other medical groups, tell members that aiding executions is unethical.
Only four drug companies have U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to make a pentobarbital drug for human use:  Akorn  (OTC:AKRXQ) Inc, which sells it under the trade name Nembutal, and three generic manufacturers: Sagent Pharmaceuticals Inc, Custopharm Inc, and Renaissance Pharma Inc. But all four makers have anti-capital punishment policies and refuse to sell the drug to U.S. prisons and the Justice Department.
DynaLabs wanted to avoid any protests from capital punishment opponents. It had decided its policy years before, and had previously turned down a compounding pharmacy in Missouri that asked DynaLabs to test execution drugs.
""It’s not that we don’t agree with the death penalty,” Pruett said. “It wasn't worth the controversy — the picket line out front that would eventually take place. That was our decision, and as far as I know, we stood by it.""
Justice Department court filings show that its compounding pharmacy sent at least 21 pentobarbital samples to DynaLabs for potency and stability testing in 2019. The work included a year-long study of the drug's shelf-life that was due to run through May.
After learning from Reuters that he was testing execution drugs, Pruett declined to comment - citing the advice of his attorney - on whether he would continue to run the commissioned tests on the pentobarbital samples.
SECRET SUPPLIERS
Most capital crimes in America are prosecuted by states. The federal government has only executed three people since 1963, all between 2001 and 2003. Currently, 62 people are on death row for federal crimes.
Eric Holder — attorney general in the administration of Trump’s Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama — expressed discomfort with capital punishment as he waited for state-level legal challenges to play out. “I think there are fundamental questions we need to ask about the death penalty,” Holder said in remarks to the National Press Club in 2015. 
The Justice Department’s stance changed under the Trump administration, but it needed to solve the drug-supply issues and set its sights on pentobarbital. Fourteen states now use pentobarbital in executions, either by itself or in combination with other drugs, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization.
By March 2018, the Justice Department had secured a compounding pharmacy willing to make an injectable pentobarbital, according to a memo from the department’s Bureau of Prisons written that month. By October of that year, the department had found a “bulk manufacturer” of the raw pentobarbital powder, according to the partially redacted laboratory records the department filed in court. The compounding pharmacy would then use the powder to make a sterile injectable solution, according to department court filings. The pharmacy would also order quality-control testing on sample batches of the drug. 
The bulk manufacturer’s first attempt to pass quality tests failed, department filings show. When ARL Bio Pharma tested that initial sample of the pentobarbital powder on October 20, it found it was contaminated with unknown impurities, according to results filed in court by the Justice Department. But the manufacturer “refined” its production processes and a subsequent batch of the pentobarbital powder passed purity tests in February 2019, according to an affidavit filed by an official with the Bureau of Prisons.
PAINFUL DEATHS
In executions involving compounded pentobarbital in Texas, seven out of the 22 inmates killed in 2018 and 2019 complained of a burning sensation in their veins after the drug was injected, according to accounts by the Associated Press, which attends all executions in the state.
Such cases make it important that lethal-injection drugs are secured through a transparent process, said Robert Dunham, director of the Death Penalty Information Center. ""It's important that the public be able to examine the history of the contractors,"" he said. ""Have they been involved in improper conduct in the past? How does their safety record look?""
But the identity of such contractors remains a closely guarded secret — even to some of the contractors themselves.DynaLabs’ Pruett wasn’t pleased to learn of his company’s involvement in testing lethal-injection drugs without his knowledge. He initially thought it was a mistake, but confirmed through his own records that his company had completed the tests cited in court by the Justice Department.
In a second interview, he said it seemed reassuring that the government had ordered extensive testing of the drugs. ""I'd rather know, if someone I knew was being put to death with lethal injection, that the injection was tested by a qualified laboratory,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - An advance team from the World Health Organization (WHO) has left for China to organise an investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus which sparked the global pandemic, a spokeswoman said on Friday.
The virus is believed to have emerged in a wholesale market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, since then closed, after jumping the species barrier from the animal kingdom to infect humans.
The two WHO experts, specialists in animal health and epidemiology, will work with Chinese scientists to determine the scope and itinerary of the investigation, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, declining to name them.
""They have gone, they are in the air now, they are the advance party that is to work out the scope,"" she told a briefing. 
This would involve negotiations on issues including the composition of the fuller team, she added. 
""One of the big issues that everybody is interested in, and of course that's why we're sending an animal health expert, is to look at whether or not it jumped from species to a human and what species it jumped from,"" Harris said.
""We know it's very, very similar to the virus in the bat, but did it go through an intermediate species? This is a question we all need answered,"" she said.
U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have said it may have originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, although they have presented no evidence for this and China strongly denies it. Scientists and U.S. intelligence agencies have said it emerged in nature.

""If there was wrongdoing - and we may never know that for sure - it will be very hard to uncover,"" Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law in Washington, D.C., told Reuters. 
""The wet market was closed immediately. There is no independent record, evaluation or investigation of a potential zoonotic source, so it will be very hard to go back and piece together,"" he said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian authorities said on Friday they had arrested two suspects over the killing of a popular political singer, whose death last week sparked protests in which 166 people were killed.
The shooting of Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, a musician widely revered among his Oromo ethnic group, ignited protests in Addis Ababa and the surrounding Oromiya region. Prime Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed described his killing as ""an evil act"".
In a televised statement, Attorney General Adanech Abebe said that the shooter was acting on the orders of an anti-government group, the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF-Shene).
The two men who were arrested included the suspected shooter and an accomplice. A third suspect was still at large, Adenech said.
""We have arrested those who killed him, and those who collaborated in the killing,"" Adanech said in the statement. ""We will continue to ensure the rule of law."" 
The suspects have not yet been charged.
Haacaaluu sang in Oromo, the language of Ethiopia's biggest ethnic group. His killing tapped into grievances fuelled by decades of government repression and what the Oromo describe as their long exclusion from political power.
Abiy, himself an Oromo, came to power in 2018 as the first modern Ethiopian leader from that ethnic group, after months of violent demonstrations led to his predecessor's resignation.
The unrest last week was the deadliest since Abiy took office. The prime minister has initiated a broad package of political and economic reforms in what has long been one of the most tightly controlled countries in Africa, and won last year's Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea.

But the increased freedoms under his leadership have also been accompanied by a rise in ethnic violence, and some Oromo figures say he has not done enough to address their longstanding grievances.

AJC Central Europe, an advocacy group, pointed to a report on public broadcaster TVP's flagship news show on Thursday that asked if opposition candidate Rafal Trzaskowski would ""comply with Jewish demands"", touching on the sensitive issue of Jewish property restitution.
Home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities before World War Two, Poland is the only European Union country that has not legislated on restoring property to pre-war Jewish owners or their descendants, despite U.S. pressure.
""What's wrong with Polish public TV?... Yesterday it again warned against 'satisfying Jewish demands'. Is that b/c you assume this hateful campaign would speak to many Poles? Think abt what message that sends,"" the AJC tweeted.
In a statement to Reuters, the AJC said it had been shocked by Polish public television's use of ""anti-Semitic tropes"".
""It's one thing when such messages are spread by fringe far-right groups. It's something quite different when this is done by state TV funded with taxpayers' money,"" it said.
International monitors have accused the public broadcaster of being heavily biased in its coverage of Polish politics.
The public broadcaster has previously criticised Trzaskowski for suggesting, while deputy foreign minister, that Poland should negotiate with Jewish groups on property restitution.
Jaroslaw Kaczynski, leader of the ruling Law and Justice Party, which is backing President Andrzej Duda in Sunday's election runoff, on Thursday accused Trzaskowski of lacking patriotism for his stance on restitution.
""How could anyone with even a bit of Polish soul, of Polish heart... say something like this? Trzaskowski clearly doesn't have this as he thinks this is a matter to discuss,"" Kaczynski said in an interview for Catholic broadcaster TV Trwam.
Trzaskowski slammed Kaczynski's comments on Friday.

""This is exactly what this election is about - whether we will live in a country where the leader of the ruling party can say that we are trash, that we don't have a Polish heart, a Polish soul,"" Trzaskowski told supporters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries and their open border neighbours were supposed to ease restrictions in unison in mid-June and then start allowing non-EU visitors in this month. 
However, the coordinated opening agreed by ambassadors last week has started to unravel, with a patchwork of widely differing rules and countries going it alone with new controls.
One senior EU diplomat said the issue was extremely difficult because the situation was unprecedented and dynamic, saying: ""It's learning by doing, and it is a moving target.""
The EU governments agreed on a list of 14 ""safe"" countries, including Canada, Japan and Serbia, from which non-essential travellers could come, with an update two weeks later with the idea of opening up more.
However, while some countries such as the Netherlands initially opened up to all 14, Italy and Belgium decided they would open to none. The Netherlands has since concluded that Serbia and Montenegro are no longer safe.
Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza called in a letter on Wednesday for rigorous new precautionary measures for all passengers travelling to EU countries from outside. 
An EU diplomat said the next list was likely to be shorter.
Marie De Somer, a migration and mobility expert at the European Policy Centre, said differing rules of entry and possible circumvention by visitors landing in one country and travelling to another could lead to the re-establishment of internal border checks, just weeks after they were lifted.
""Then the question would be when would they be lifted. Schengen is one of the most important achievements of the EU and is popular. It would also paint a bad picture about whether the EU countries can work together,"" she said.
The passport-free Schengen area travel zone includes some non-EU countries, including Norway and Switzerland.
Meanwhile, many restrictions remain for travel within Europe and spikes of cases in parts of popular holiday destinations Spain and Portugal have sparked new action.
Austria has issued travel warnings for Bulgaria, Romania and Moldova, while Hungary on Thursday announced a review of rules on travel to neighbouring Austria, Serbia, Croatia, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia. Greece also toughened rules for visitors from Bulgaria.
There are echoes of the period at the start of the health crisis in Europe when countries hoarded protective equipment and blocked crossings until they agreed on an export ban and closed external borders.

""It is certainly subject to improvement,"" said Jacques Pelkmans, single market expert at the CEPS think tank. ""We could have had less damage and irritation between EU member states. With medical supplies it was ugly.""

His brother, La Htoi, 23, was a local hero: a philosophy student and the first in the village to get into university, with a good job teaching at the local school. But then the coronavirus came, the school was shut and he was left desperate. So he went to the mines.
""The sadness is just indescribable,"" said Sut Seng Du, wiping away tears after he buried the body at a small cemetery near the mine. ""I did not have the strength to tell my parents about his death. I felt sorry for my mum and dad.""
Campaigners say the catastrophe shows both the desperation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic - which has driven countless workers to risk their lives in the mines - and the culpability of mining companies that leave behind teetering piles of waste.
“Those who perished were sacrificed on the altar of greed, by utter negligence and arrogance of companies that continue to dehumanize the poor of this land,” said Myanmar's Catholic Cardinal, Charles Bo.
“In these tragic times of COVID lockdown, there cannot be a lockdown of the fire of hunger that forced those poor to seek the crumbs of jade that fall from mega companies’ bulldozers.""
Myanmar produces 90 per cent of the world’s jade, most bound for neighbouring China. Most comes from Hpakant, in the remote jungles of the north, where rights groups say mining firms with links to military elites and ethnic armed groups make billions of dollars a year.
The waste they leave behind draws the informal fortune hunters known locally as ""yay ma hsay"", or “the unwashed”.
Reuters was unable to contact any of the mining companies for comment. A government spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment on the disaster and management of the sector.
GAME OF LIFE OR DEATH
Survivors of the July 2 disaster say heavy rain caused a huge tower of waste to collapse into a lake, triggering a tsunami of mud and water.
At first it had seemed as if only a small chunk of the cliff would collapse.
“Then suddenly, in a blink, less than five seconds, the whole mountain fell off,” said Yan Myo Aung, 23.
He survived by clinging to a barrel in the mud. A friend clung to something else.
“I asked him, ‘Brother, is that a tree log?’ He didn’t say a word. He just shook his head... It was a body.”
The coronavirus outbreak has forced migrant workers to return home to Myanmar from other countries in the region, and some have gone to the mines. Nhkum Seng Naw, 22, was one of at least 70,000 people who came back from Thailand.
“Working in the mines is a game of life or death,” he said. He went to Hpakant “because it is where the dream lies”. His own dream, he said, was simply to care for his mother and build a good home for his siblings: “So far, it has not come true.""
While no one knows just how many migrants have been driven to Hpakant by the pandemic, Dashi La Seng, Kachin State Natural Resources and Environmental Conservation Minister told Reuters by phone the virus was clearly a factor.
""COVID-19 is one of the reasons many people arrived,"" he said. Myanmar’s monsoon, which runs from May until October, was always ""high season"" because the companies finished work but left mounds of waste for the pickers. Mining companies now planned increased security to keep pickers out, he said.
""Most grassroots people all over Myanmar come to Hpakant, hoping they will be able to solve their livelihood problems,"" he said, ""Since they are citizens, it's practically impossible to kick them out.”
Between 300 and 500 pickers have died in landslides and other accidents since 2015, said Maw Htun Aung, a Myanmar-based mining expert and former country manager of the Natural Resource Governance Institute.
While the government had taken some measures, including suspending the issuance of new licenses to mining companies, the sector needed a “fundamental rethink”, he said.
Authorities had not implemented recommendations of a plan by an Australian mining company commissioned in 2016 by the state-owned Myanmar Gems Enterprise, which included advice on how to prevent landslides, he said.
A commission formed to probe last week’s disaster drew public ire after the head of the body, Minister for Environment and Natural Resources Ohn Win, blamed the greed of the pickers.
The government should not blame the victims, said Hanna Hindstrom, Senior Myanmar Campaigner at Global Witness.

“The accident should serve as wake-up call for the government about the urgent need to clean up the lawless sector and finally sever the link between jade mining, corruption and conflict.”

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia will halve the number of citizens allowed to return home from overseas each week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday, as authorities struggle to contain a COVID-19 outbreak in the country's second most populous city.
The state of Victoria reported 288 new cases on Friday, a record daily increase for any part of the country and sparking fears of a wave of community transmission in a country where most cases have involved returned travellers.
""The news from Victoria remains very concerning,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Since March, Australia has allowed only citizens and permanent residents to enter the country with some 357,000 having returned to date. 
Australia will now impose a cap of 4,175 people allowed to return each week and those returning will also have to pay for a mandatory 14-day quarantine in a hotel, which until now had been paid for by state governments.
""The decision that we took... was to ensure that we could put our focus on the resources needed to do the testing and tracing and not have to have resources diverted to other tasks,"" Morrison said.
Neighbouring New Zealand also introduced measures this week to limit the number of citizens returning home, seeking to reduce the burden on its overflowing quarantine facilities.
SECOND LOCKDOWN
The announcement of the new restrictions comes days after Victoria reimposed a lockdown in Melbourne for six weeks following a surge in cases linked to social distancing breaches in hotels where returned travellers were held in quarantine.
In addition to forcing 5 million people to stay home for all but essential business, the flare-up has led the rest of the country's states to ban Victorians from entering and dealt a blow to hopes for a speedy recovery for the nation's economy.
The state's chief health officer warned there would be a sharp rise in hospitalisations, intensive care cases and deaths in the coming days as a result of the spike in infections.
Victoria on Friday also became the first state in the country to urge people to wear masks when they leave home.
To ease the pain for businesses in Melbourne forced to shut again and holiday spots hit by cancellations, the state government also said it would provide a further A$534 million ($371 million), on top of A$6 billion already provided.
""This is us saying: 'We're here with you all the way through what will be a very traumatic, a very distressing and a very difficult time for all Victorians,'"" state Treasurer Tim Pallas said in a televised media conference.
The state, which makes up about a quarter of Australia's economy, expects unemployment to peak at 11%, up from 6.9% now. Victoria's economy is expected to shrink by 14% and take two to three years to recover, Pallas said. 
The outbreak has also slowed the planned opening of a quarantine-free ""travel bubble"" with New Zealand, which Morrison discussed with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Friday.
Despite surging case numbers, Victoria has relaxed restrictions on most of the 3,000 people who were locked down in nine public-housing towers in Melbourne. One of the nine towers will remain in a hard lockdown for another eight days.

Even with the latest outbreak, Australia has done relatively well in controlling the novel coronavirus so far, with around 9,000 cases and 106 deaths.

Since the easing of the coronavirus lockdown and the reopening of the borders within the European Union, migrants have begun to flock to Calais again, hoping to reach Britain via the Channel Tunnel.
On Friday, some 519 people living in the camp were taken by bus to various reception centres. Another 20 people deemed to have irregular immigration status were arrested and taken to detention centres, local authorities said in a statement.
The dismantling started at around 5 a.m. and was over by noon. Authorities said it went calmly.
According to a charities helping refugees, there are about 1,200 migrants in Calais, mainly of Sudanese, Eritrean, Afghan and Iranian origin.

Since the dismantling of the huge ""Calais Jungle"" in 2016, where up to 9,000 people lived, migrants are now scattered in several camps, most on the outskirts of Calais.

858,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Philippine lawmakers block license bid for broadcaster that angered Duterte,"By Karen Lema and Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lawmakers rejected the renewal of a 25-year license for country's top broadcaster on Friday, outraging activists who saw the move to keep ABS-CBN Corp off the air as part of a political vendetta on behalf of President Rodrigo Duterte.
A legislative committee overwhelmingly agreed with a working group's assessment that ABS-CBN, which employs 11,000 people and has an audience of tens of millions of Filipinos, was ""undeserving of the grant of legislative franchise"".
Aides to Duterte, 75, sought to distance the president from the decision, as activists have accused him of using courts, Congress and regulatory bodies to systematically stamp out opposition to his popular autocracy.
Phil Robertson, Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director, called it ""a black day for media freedom"" and ""an astounding display of obsequious behaviour"" by lawmakers kowtowing to Duterte.
""This move solidifies the tyranny of President Rodrigo Duterte,"" he said.
It comes a week after the passing of a controversial anti-terror law that Duterte fast-tracked through the legislature, granting his security chiefs powers to arrest and detain without charge or judicial approval anyone they consider a ""terrorist"". 
Critics fear it will be used as a weapon to target dissent, including journalists, bloggers, lawyers and civil society groups seeking his international indictment for thousands of killings in his war on drugs.
DUTERTE 'NEUTRAL'
ABS-CBN has been on tenterhooks since Duterte took office in 2016 and started threatening to block its renewal bid, in furious public outbursts stemming from the network's failure to air some of his paid election campaign commercials. It has since apologised.
Under Duterte, the market value of ABS-CBN has slumped 69% to $257 million. His spokesman, Harry Roque, said the president had always had ""a neutral stance"" on the franchise issue.
It was not immediately clear what the next steps would be for ABS-CBN, which continues to operate online, on cable and on social media, which are not impacted.
""This is a painful and sad day,"" said Regina Reyes, head of its news and current affairs.
""You feel your entire life's work was disregarded,"" she said, fighting back tears.
ABS-CBN's 21 radio and 38 television stations are a staple of news and entertainment across the Philippines and to the Filipino Diaspora, generating big advertising revenues from brands keen to tap mass audiences drawn to its talent shows, dramas and glamorous celebrities.
A caravan of cars carrying ABS-CBN employees and stars holding placards defending the network and media freedom circled the house. Its franchise loss was a top-trending issue on social media, with models and actors weighing in with support.
The decision follows a high-profile guilty verdict in a recent libel case against Maria Ressa, chief of news website Rappler, whose investigative reporting has frustrated the inner circle of Duterte, a maverick former mayor. 

Rappler is fighting several other legal cases filed by the state.

860,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",'Epic failure': U.S. election officials warn of November chaos due to budget crunch,"By Jason Lange and Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Michigan town wants machines to speed up counting of absentee ballots. In Ohio, officials want to equip polling places so voters and poll workers feel safe from the coronavirus. Georgia officials, rattled by a chaotic election last month, want to send voters forms so they can request absentee ballots more easily.
In all three cases, the money is not there to make it happen, say local officials responsible for running elections in the states - any one of which could determine who wins the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Presidential nominating contests held this year in states from Wisconsin to Georgia have exposed massive challenges in conducting elections during the worst public health crisis in a century. Closed or understaffed polling venues led to long lines, there were problems delivering absentee ballots, and the votes took days, even weeks, to count.
But instead of receiving more money for the all-important contest between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden, officials face budget cuts after tax revenues plunged in the virus-stricken economy, two dozen election officials across several battleground states told Reuters.
The consequences, they warn, go beyond practical headaches to the risk voters' faith in the process will be undermined. 
""What kind of price tag are you going to put on the integrity of the election process and the safety of those who work it and those who vote?"" said Tina Barton, the city clerk and chief elections official in Rochester Hills, Michigan, a state where Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes. ""Those are the things at risk.""
This year's nominating contests have shown that voting in the pandemic age costs more: Officials have to buy masks, face shields and other equipment to virus-proof polling places. They also must spend more to mail and count ballots.
Many officials say they don't have the funding to do either job properly. Election experts say Americans are likely to vote in record numbers in November, when control of Congress will also be up for grabs along with state governorships and legislatures.
A funding shortfall could lead to ""widespread disenfranchisement,"" said Myrna Perez, director of the elections program at New York University's Brennan Center for Justice, a non-partisan public policy institute. ""We run the risk of people really questioning the legitimacy of the election."" 
Congress approved $400 million in federal funding to help states hold the elections as part of the CARES Act coronavirus aid package passed in March - that's just one-tenth of the $4 billion that experts at the Brennan Center have estimated will be needed this year to hold safe and fair elections during the pandemic.
Introducing a vote-by-mail system in new locales will require officials to pay for new paper ballots and thick security envelopes, and to buy expensive new machines to sort and tabulate them. Postage alone will cost nearly $600 million, the center estimated.
A fresh coronavirus aid bill passed in May in the Democratic-led House of Representatives includes $3.6 billion in new election funding for state and local governments. Some Republicans said they were open to considering more election funding, but opposed planned rules to make states boost mail-in voting, and the bill has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate.
Trump and his Republican allies say mail voting is prone to fraud and favors Democrats, although independent studies have found little evidence of those claims. Democrats say efforts to discredit mail balloting, coupled with a possible fall in polling venues, could depress turnout. 
Hans von Spakovsky, a former Republican member of the Federal Elections Commission who works at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said officials could cut costs by focusing on keeping polling places safe, rather than trying to ramp up voting by mail. 
""I'm not saying that this is easy but it is not going to be as difficult as all these people are predicting,"" von Spakovsky said. 
(Graphic: Pandemic voting - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/nmovajbxwpa/index.html)
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell declined to comment. 
Amy Klobuchar, the senior Democrat on the Senate rules committee that oversees federal grants for elections, told Reuters money was so short that funds intended for election security, for instance, were being used to buy masks and cleaning supplies.
""That's not a one-or-the-other choice. We need voters to be safe and we need our elections to be secure,"" she said.
""EPIC FAILURE""
Some local governments are already squeezing election budgets, as cities across the country face a projected $360 billion revenue loss over the next three years due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
Georgia sent absentee ballot requests to all voters ahead of its June 9 elections, which officials cited in local media estimated would cost at least $5 million. The program helped fuel record primary turnout in a state that has long been solidly Republican but which polls show could be competitive in November.
Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, told state lawmakers late last month there was not enough money to do the same for November, and that the health crisis ""has somewhat dissipated."" He instead will ask voters to request their ballot through a website. Raffensperger's office declined to comment on the funding shortages, or on a rapid rise in COVID-19 cases in Georgia since then.
Most county governments in Georgia don't have the money to send out requests themselves, said Deidre Holden, co-president of the state's association of county election officials.
""If Congress doesn't act we are going to see epic failure once again,"" said Holden, an independent, who is also elections supervisor in Georgia's Paulding County, a Republican-dominated suburb of Atlanta.
In Philadelphia, falling revenues have left an election budget of $12.3 million, instead of $22.5 million that officials proposed in early March. The city's vote could be critical: Pennsylvania is a state where Trump won by less than a percentage point, and about a fifth of its registered Democrats live in Philadelphia. 
The city expects about $750,000 in CARES Act grant money, but it already spent more than its expected grant holding its June 2 primary, its top election official, Commissioner Lisa Deeley, told Reuters.
LaVera Scott is director of elections for Ohio's Lucas County, a Democratic-leaning area including Toledo in the battleground state that elected Democrat Barack Obama twice, but voted for Trump in 2016. Local officials asked her to cut her budget by 20%, and she has ruled out buying some safety equipment such as Plexiglas sneeze guards for more than 300 polling stations that the county hopes to operate.
""Feasibly, that's not a cost that we can do here,"" she said. 
Scott also worries about not having enough staffing. Elderly polling workers are sending her apologetic greeting cards to say they won't do the job this year for fear of catching the virus, she said.
RESULTS? ""WHO KNOWS WHEN""
Voting rights advocates and election experts have been warning for months that a chaotic election could cause voters to question the results. Worse, if those results are delayed, a candidate could claim victory prematurely. 
Without further federal funding, some election boards in Michigan won't be able to buy new machines to count ballots faster, or cover all the postage costs of mail-in ballots, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told Reuters.
She told U.S. House lawmakers in June that the state needs $40 million from the federal government, far above the $11 million allocated to the state under CARES Act.
""This means ... that election results may not be available until long after election night,"" Benson, a Democrat, said in an emailed statement.
Michelle Anzaldi, the clerk for Michigan's Pittsfield Charter Township, a suburb of Detroit, said her current vote-counting machines take between three and five seconds to count each ballot. A newer model can process more than 100 a minute but could cost more than $100,000. 
With a budget crunch looming, the count will just have to wait.

""Instead of being tabulated by 10 p.m. at night, it could be who knows when,"" she said.

Wildlife officials are trying to determine what is killing the elephants about two months after the first bodies were discovered. They have ruled out poaching and anthrax among possible causes.
Officials told reporters near the Okavango Delta on Thursday that they had now verified 281 elephant carcasses and that the deaths were concentrated in an area of 8,000 square km that is home to about 18,000 elephants.
""We have to wait for another set of results and reconcile the two to see if they are saying the same thing before we come to a definitive conclusion,"" Oduetse Kaboto, a senior official in the environment and tourism ministry, said in a televised briefing.
""We are hoping the second set of results will come in next week and that's when we should be able to communicate to the public the cause of deaths.""
Although the number of deaths so far represents a fraction of the estimated 130,000 elephants in Botswana, there are fears more could die if authorities cannot establish the cause soon.
Chris Foggin, from Zimbabwe's Victoria Falls Wildlife Trust, which conducted the tests on elephant samples from Botswana, said only that country's government could share the findings.
The Botswana wildlife department has said the government contacted neighbours Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Zambia but they had not seen similar elephant deaths.

Africa's overall elephant population is declining due to poaching, but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent's elephants, has seen numbers grow from 80,000 in the late 1990s.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Prominent U.S. civil rights groups are refusing to appear before a Justice Department law enforcement commission set up to recommend ways to increase respect for police and reduce crime, calling it out of touch with public anger over policing.
The Presidential Commission on Law Enforcement and the Administration of Justice was established in January, before the latest wave of mass protests over police use of force against Black Americans set off by the May killing of George Floyd. 
Its mission statement did not mention racial disparities in criminal justice or address excessive use of force by police, and unlike a similar Obama administration commission, its members represent only federal, state and local law enforcement, with no civil rights advocates, defense attorneys or even big-city police departments taking part.
Civil rights leaders told Reuters they only received invitations to testify after the NAACP Legal Defense Fund sued the commission in April, contending it was violating federal open-meeting laws and lacked diverse viewpoints. That case is pending, and the Justice Department has asked a federal judge to have it dismissed.
""It is so completely out of touch with what is happening,"" said Kanya Bennett, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union.
After the protests over Floyd's death began, the commission held some hearings about the excessive use of force and community policing, but they were announced with little advanced warning and were closed to the public. President Donald Trump has struck a strict ""law-and-order"" tone in his response to the protests.
A Justice Department spokeswoman said the commission would be addressing the issues outlined in a police reform executive order signed by Trump in June including ""accreditation and how to assist law enforcement and communities in their response to homelessness, addiction and mental health.""
The commission is expected to release a report in October offering recommendations for decreasing crime, addressing mental health and homelessness issues, and promoting respect for police officers. 
'SHAM COMMISSION'
U.S. civil rights groups including the ACLU have refused to attend the hearings, submitting only written testimony.
""The ACLU is not going to participate in a sham commission that was formed for the sole purpose of promoting a 'blue lives matter' narrative,"" Bennett said.
Commission Chairman Phil Keith said at a June meeting that of the nearly 30 civil rights and other advocacy groups invited to testify, only a handful accepted, including the North Carolina-based Racial Equity Institute and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL).
Deena Hayes-Greene, a co-founder of the Racial Equity Institute, said she learned other groups had declined invitations at the meeting she attended. Norman Reimer, executive director of the NACDL, said he was cynical about the commission but thought it was important to express his group's views.
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund said it had not received an invitation to participate.

The commission ""fails to consider ... the long and fraught history of police community relations, especially in Black and brown communities and the nexus between unconstitutional policing and the violations of civil rights,"" said Sakira Cook, director of the justice reform program with the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.

The envoy, Anna Lindstedt, was replaced in the post after she took part in the meeting in Stockholm in January 2019. The Swedish foreign ministry said it had not authorized the meeting and that she acted against Swedish policy by taking part. 
The Stockholm district court said in its verdict: ""Overall, it is established that the objective requisites for the crime of arbitrariness at negotiations with foreign powers are in no part fulfilled."" 
Gui, a Hong Kong-based Swedish citizen who has published books critical of Chinese Communist leaders, was sentenced in February in China to 10 years in prison after being convicted of illegally providing intelligence to foreigners.
Gui had been abducted in Thailand in 2015 and later appeared in custody in mainland China. The bookseller's case has soured relations between Sweden and China, also under strain over security concerns.
The case against Lindstedt was the first of its kind in Sweden. A conviction could have meant a maximum sentence of six years in prison.

Gui's daughter Angela has said she was invited by the ambassador to meet two unidentified businessmen who could help secure her father's release, and that she was advised during the meeting to keep quiet about her father's case.

AUB, which has been hit hard by Lebanon's economic meltdown, declined to comment on the case.
Lebanon is grappling with a crisis caused by decades of state corruption and bad governance. A hard currency liquidity crunch has led to an 80% weakening of the local currency since October.
Diab presented his-long planned resignation in January - the month he became prime minister.
""... He asked for an exit package in line with common practices and precedents at AUB. This request was denied ...,"" the spokesman said.
Diab had ""never made any special request for any payments to be made either in foreign currency or into foreign bank accounts. All AUB professors have their pensions paid in U.S. dollars, from a AUB foreign account"", the spokesman said.
""What the PM expressed was only what was already stated in the AUB retirement plan regulations and policies."" 
The private AUB, founded in the 1860s, is alma mater of some of the Arab world's leading figures in politics, medicine, law, science and art. Its president told Reuters in May Lebanon's catastrophic collapse represented one of the biggest challenges in the history of a university which has weathered many crises, including Lebanon’s 1975-1990 civil war.

The state, which defaulted on its foreign currency debt in March, owes AUB’s medical centre - which attracts patients from across the Middle East and Central Asia - more than $150 million in arrears, AUB President Fadlo Khuri said.

The text of the statement was not released, but the embassy said McConville and Apirat ""discussed modernisation, interoperability, joint training, and doctrine"".
The United States has sought to counter China's influence in Southeast Asia, most recently by sending two aircraft carriers to the South China Sea while the Chinese military conducted drills near islands that are also claimed by Vietnam.
Thailand is Washington's oldest ally in Asia, but relations were strained by a 2014 military coup led by then-army chief Prayuth that ousted an elected civilian government.
The United States scaled back some military exchanges with Thailand, and Bangkok responded by forging a closer ties with China.
But ties improved after last year's general election that officially restored civilian rule while keeping Prayuth on as a civilian leader, resulting in arms deal for U.S.-made armored personnel carriers and light attack helicopters last year.

Following the incident Hong Kong police had posted images on twitter of officer with a bleeding arm saying he was stabbed by ""rioters holding sharp objects"".
China's parliament adopted the security law in response to protests last year triggered by fears Beijing was stifling the city's freedoms and threatening its judicial independence, guaranteed by a ""one country, two systems"" formula agreed when it returned to China.
Beijing has denied interfering and officials say the law is vital to plug holes in national security defences exposed by the protests.

869,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 10, 2020 12:35AM ET</span>",Mayor of South Korean capital found dead after writing apology to 'everyone',"By Hyonhee Shin and Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - One of South Korea's most prominent elected officials and longtime mayor of the capital Seoul was found dead on Friday after he was reported missing by his daughter amid a criminal probe and media reports of alleged sexual harassment. 
Officers using drones and sniffer dogs found Mayor Park Won-soon's body at Mt Bugak in northern Seoul shortly after midnight following a search involving hundreds of police, the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency said. 
There was no sign of foul play and police did not give a cause of death. 
The apparent suicide came after one of Park's former secretaries filed a complaint on Wednesday alleging the 64-year-old had sexually harassed her, the Yonhap news agency reported.
Police confirmed a criminal complaint had been made against Park but did not elaborate on the nature of the allegations. 
""I apologise to everyone,"" Park wrote in a note left on his desk and released by the city government with the permission of his family.
""I thank everyone who was with me in my lifetime. I am so sorry to my family, to whom I have only caused pain.""
The note did not mention any allegations.
Many residents of Seoul, a city of nearly 10 million people, expressed shock over the sudden death of the former activist, women's rights advocate and lawyer who many saw as a potential presidential candidate in 2022.
""I admired him for his previous achievements, but I was disappointed at the sexual harassment,"" said one office worker, who asked to be identified only by her surname Lee. 
""I don’t know if it was guilt or embarrassment, but his death is irresponsible as it is a secondary harm to the victim.""
“SHOCKING AND REGRETFUL” 
Park's daughter reported him missing at 5:17 p.m. (0817 GMT) on Thursday, police said. He had left the mayor's official residence at around 10:40 a.m. on Thursday, wearing a black hat and a backpack, having cancelled meetings for the day.
His body was taken to Seoul National University Hospital, where five days of funeral proceedings were expected to begin.
Leading lawmakers of both ruling and opposition parties expressed condolences, as did the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, Harry Harris. 
Ruling party chief Lee Hae-chan said Park's death was “shocking and regretful,” recalling him as an old friend who fought together for democracy during the dictatorship in 1980s.
As Seoul mayor since 2011, Park was instrumental in its response to the coronavirus pandemic. He also played a vocal role in massive candlelight demonstrations that contributed to the ousting of former President Park Geun-hye in 2017.
An outspoken advocate of women's rights and gender equality, he was seen as a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in elections scheduled for 2022.
As a lawyer in the 1990s, he won one of South Korea's earliest cases on sexual harassment, and strongly advocated for the cause of ""comfort women"" who were forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels before and during World War Two. 
Park also praised women for their courage after a series of women accused powerful politicians and policymakers of sexual wrongdoings amid the #MeToo movement in 2018.

Oh Keo-don, the former mayor of Busan, South Korea's second-largest city, and another major player in liberal politics, stepped down in April after acknowledging unnecessary physical contact with a female staffer.

""I expect to be wearing a mask when I go into Walter Reed. You're in a hospital setting. I think it's a very appropriate thing. I have no problem with a mask,"" Trump told Fox News in an interview.
Trump said he would be visiting wounded soldiers as well as front-line workers seeking to contain the COVID-19 pandemic when he visits the government medical facility in Bethesda, Maryland. 
Trump did not say when he would visit, and the White House did not immediately respond to a query about his schedule. CNN has previously reported Trump plans to go on Saturday.
It was unclear whether Trump might be photographed wearing a mask since such visits are often closed to the media to protect the privacy of the wounded soldiers.
Trump, who had become increasingly isolated within the Republican Party for not promoting wearing a mask, has in recent weeks spoken more favorably about their use as COVID-19 cases have surged in the United States.

More than 60,500 new COVID-19 infections were reported across the United States on Thursday, according to a Reuters tally, setting a one-day record as weary Americans were told to take new precautions and the pandemic becomes increasingly politicized.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korea's leader, said another summit with the United States would only be useful for Washington at this point, adding her country had no intention of ""threatening the U.S.,"" according to state media.
Kim said in her personal opinion, there is unlikely to be another summit between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump this year but ""a surprise thing may still happen,"" news agency KCNA reported on Friday.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday he was ""very hopeful"" about resuming talks with North Korea about denuclearisation and appeared to leave open the possibility of another summit between the countries' leaders.
Kim Yo Jong's comments came a day after the U.S. point man for North Korea, Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, wrapped up a three-day visit to Seoul where he rejected speculation he was seeking to meet North Korean officials during his trip, but said the United States was open to talks.
Recent North Korean statements have rejected the idea of new talks, and Kim reiterated Pyongyang's objections to what it sees as hostile and self-serving policies of the United States.
""We would like to make it clear that it does not necessarily mean the denuclearisation is not possible,"" Kim Yo Jong said. ""But what we mean is that it is not possible at this point of time.""
Her comments were couched in a somewhat softer tone than previous statements, and she even noted she had received special permission to view recordings of the recent Fourth of July Independence Day celebrations in the United States.
""We do not have the slightest intention to pose a threat to the U.S.... Everything will go smoothly if they leave us alone and make no provocation on us,"" she said.
Kim said it was unclear if mixed messages of engagement and pressure from Trump and his aides are an ""intentional scheme or a result of the President's loose grip of power.""
She said her brother had instructed her to pass on greetings to Trump and send him wishes for success in his work. 
But even if the relationship between the leaders is good, Washington will return to being hostile and North Korea needs to shape its policies in preparation for leaders other than Trump, Kim said.
Kim Jong Un and Trump exchanged threats and insults in 2017 as North Korea rapidly advanced its missile and nuclear weapons technology, before ties warmed in early 2018.

The two leaders have met three times, but failed to find a compromise over the North's nuclear weapons programme, or the international sanctions imposed on Pyongyang.

Malaysian police called in Al Jazeera's reporters and staff for questioning on Friday after several officials accused the documentary of trying to tarnish the country's image.
""Locked up in Malaysia's Lockdown"", produced by the Qatar-based station's 101 East news programme, focused on the plight of thousands of undocumented migrants detained during raids in areas under tight coronavirus lockdowns.
Defence minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob called on Al Jazeera to apologise to Malaysians, saying allegations of racism and discrimination against undocumented migrants were untrue.
In a statement late Thursday, Al Jazeera said it stood by the ""professionalism, quality and impartiality of its journalism"" and called on Malaysia to withdraw the criminal investigation. 
""Charging journalists for doing their jobs is not the action of a democracy that values free speech. Journalism is not a crime,"" it said.
The prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the police said the police chief is expected to address the matter at a news conference later Friday.
Al Jazeera said that it had repeatedly sought to obtain the government's view but that requests for interviews with senior ministers and officials were not accepted.
Despite this, Al Jazeera said it ""still produced a balanced film by including comments made by the Defense Minister at two press conferences"". 
Al Jazeera also said its staff in Malaysia have faced abuse, death threats and disclosure of their personal details on social media, and expressed concern over hate speech targeting those interviewed in the documentary. 
Authorities this week issued a search notice for a Bangladeshi person interviewed by Al Jazeera.
Rights groups have raised concerns over crackdowns on media freedoms under Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's government, which came into power in March, as well as rising anger toward foreigners, who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and burdening state resources.
In May, police questioned a journalist from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post over her reporting on the migrant arrests.

873,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>",Lopez Obrador says Trump has 'completely changed' attitude toward Mexicans,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Thursday that Donald Trump had drastically changed the way he talks about Mexico's people, in the leftist leader's latest warm words about the U.S. president who has a history of upsetting Mexicans.
Lopez Obrador's comments came a day after the two men met for the first time at the White House, where the Mexican president praised Trump for showing ""kindness and respect"" toward his country. That drew angry responses from critics in Mexico.
Lopez Obrador told television network Telemundo that in the past, Trump, a Republican, had a certain ""vision"" of Mexicans. But that was different now, he said.
""He has completely changed his rhetoric,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""The relationship with President Trump is very good and, as I said yesterday, he has treated us like friends, not as distant neighbors.""
Trump described Mexican immigrants as rapists and drug runners during his previous presidential campaign and vowed to make Mexico pay for his planned border wall aimed at curtailing illegal immigration and the flow of illicit drugs. The Mexican government has consistently refused to do so.
Lopez Obrador took office in late 2018, seeking to distance himself from his predecessors. 
But within months, Trump threatened to put tariffs on all Mexican goods if Lopez Obrador did not curb illegal immigration into the United States.
Lopez Obrador's friendly remarks about Trump have troubled some U.S. Democrats, who worry that Trump wants to exploit the meeting with his Mexican counterpart to woo Mexican-American voters ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Right after the meeting, a Twitter account describing itself as the ""official bilingual account"" for Trump's campaign began using footage of Lopez Obrador praising the U.S. president, in a bid to portray him as a friend of the Hispanic community.
Many critics of Trump in Mexico are doubtful he will remain friendly all the way to the election.

A June 26-27 phone survey by newspaper El Financiero found that 70% of Mexicans saw Trump in a negative light, although 59% agreed with Lopez Obrador's plan to visit him in Washington.

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>","Mexican president exits Trump embrace smiling, Democrats grumble","By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Defying warnings that to seek out Donald Trump was to court disaster, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador instead emerged from their first meeting as a ""cherished friend"" of his U.S. counterpart, even as some Democrats looked on uneasily.
The spectacle of Lopez Obrador and Trump lavishing praise on each other on Wednesday was a far cry from the tension that has plagued bilateral ties since the American launched his bid for power in 2015 with repeated threats and jibes against Mexico. 
Meeting at the White House, the two leaders pledged to strengthen economic ties, and largely avoided the subject of immigration that Trump has used to extract concessions from Mexico on border security and trade since he took office in 2017.
""The forecasts were wrong. We didn't fight. We're friends and we're going to continue being friends,"" Lopez Obrador said, the leftist leader facing Trump as the two addressed the media before a dinner at the White House.
But while Mexican officials celebrated the generous words and warm sentiments, some Democratic lawmakers expressed concern that the encounter had been little more than a campaign ploy by the Republican Trump as he seeks to secure re-election in November.
""I think the meeting, for the most part, was a dog and pony show,"" Jesus Garcia, a Mexican-born Democratic congressman from Illinois, told cable TV network C-SPAN.
""It's also very telling that President Lopez Obrador would come and only meet with President Trump and not even arrange for a phone call with (Joe) Biden,"" he added.
Lopez Obrador said he would take no sides in the U.S. election and that it would not be right for him to speak to former Vice President Biden as the Democratic presidential candidate because he was on a work visit to Washington.
Garcia was one of more than a dozen members of the Hispanic Caucus - all of them Democrats - who in a letter had urged Trump to cancel the meeting, which they condemned as an attempt to distract from the coroanvirus pandemic and to politicize U.S.-Mexico relations.
The United States is home to more than 35 million people of Mexican origin and critics of both leaders fear the get-together could help Trump woo voters from that community.
ABOUT-TURN
Trump described Mexican migrants as rapists and drug runners during his last election campaign, promising to keep them out with a border wall which he said Mexico would pay for.
Biden himself pointed to this in a terse statement issued shortly after the two leaders met.
On Wednesday, Trump struck a quite different tone, referring to Lopez Obrador and Mexico as ""cherished friends.""
""Mexican Americans uplift our communities and they strengthen our churches and enrich every feature of national life,"" Trump said. ""They are hardworking, incredible people.""
While in opposition, Lopez Obrador compared Trump to Adolf Hitler for his treatment of migrants. He pledged to defend them if he won the presidency, which he did in July 2018. 
On Wednesday, Lopez Obrador thanked Trump for treating Mexico with ""kindness and respect.""
That angered domestic critics of the Mexican leader, who were also upset he did not publicly bring up the wall, or Trump's attempts to repeal a program that has protected so-called Dreamer immigrants in the United States, many of Mexican origin.
In a statement, Sylvia Garcia, a Democratic congresswoman from Texas, expressed dismay that immigration had been ignored at the meeting, which she saw as ""another White House photo op.""
Even if Lopez Obrador's intention had been to defend Mexico, his support for Trump only made it more likely that the real estate mogul would serve another four years, said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister.
""Trump has been bad news for Mexico for five years,"" said Rozental. ""I'm afraid ... that he will use this to his political advantage and that we will be caught in the crosshairs again.""
If Biden, who is leading in U.S. opinion polls, defeats Trump in November, Wednesday's scenes in Washington could weigh on relations with a Democratic administration, said Jorge Buendia, head of Mexican polling firm Buendia & Laredo.

A Democratic government may also be less indulgent toward Lopez Obrador on his nationalist energy agenda, which has threatened major investments in renewable power generation, a key issue for many on the left of the U.S. political spectrum.

The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself.
China, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its own territory, routinely denounces U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Taiwan has requested to buy components to upgrade its Patriot missiles ""in order to support an operational life of 30 years"", the State Department said on Thursday.
 Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) will be the main contractor and the total estimated cost will be $620 million, it added.
""This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting the recipient's continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,"" it said.
""The recipient will use this capability as a deterrent to regional threats and to strengthen homeland defence. The recipient will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.""
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said it expected the sale to take effect within the next month.
""This arms sale is the 7th by the Trump administration to Taiwan so far, fully demonstrating the importance attached to our national defence security, consolidating our security partnership with the United States, and jointly maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and the region,"" the ministry said.
Taiwan has been bolstering its defences in the face of what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by Beijing, such as regular Chinese air force and naval exercises near Taiwan.
While Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made hardware, China has huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment of its own such as stealth fighters.

The information is contained in a revocation of special authorisation dated July 1 provided by the department to Reuters on Friday.
Pakistan last month grounded almost a third of its pilots after discovering they may have falsified their qualifications.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency suspended PIA's authorisation to fly to the bloc for six months in a blow to the carrier's operations.
PIA was not available immediately for comment outside normal business hours.
Pakistan's Geo News reported PIA had confirmed the U.S. ban and said it would address the concerns through ongoing corrective measures within the airline.

Pakistan's grounding of pilots with dubious credentials followed the crash of a PIA jet in May that killed 97 people.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. general said on Thursday that the military had to take a ""hard look"" at symbols of the Confederacy, including the names of bases, and said he had recommended a commission to look at the issue even as President Donald Trump has ruled out renaming military bases that are named for Confederate leaders.
Despite Americans more conscious about race issues following the death of African American George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, Trump has favored keeping the names of 10 military bases from Virginia to Texas that are named for Confederate military leaders.
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley's comments could put him and the military on a collision course with Trump, who is campaigning for the November presidential election and has dismissed calls to rename bases as an attempt to erase American history. 
""I've recommended a commission of folks to take a hard look at the bases, the statues, the names, all of this stuff, to see if we can have a rational, mature discussion,"" Milley told a congressional hearing.
""There is no place in our armed forces for manifestations or symbols of racism, bias or discrimination,"" he said, noting that the American Civil War ""was an act of treason at the time.""
Milley added that the focus for the military, in which 43 percent of its members are minorities, was unity and cohesion. 
""For those young soldiers who go onto a base, a Fort Hood or a Fort Bragg or a fort wherever named after a Confederate general, they can be reminded that that general fought for an institution of slavery that may have enslaved one of their ancestors,"" Milley said.
Trump's rejection of renaming bases, via a tweet last month, slapped down Pentagon officials who are open to discussing the issue, which has emerged as a way of achieving racial reconciliation.
U.S. military bases named for Confederate military leaders are all located in former Confederate states. Many of those states helped elect Trump in 2016, and he is counting on them again for the Nov. 3 election.

The Republican-led U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to require the Pentagon to rename military bases named after Confederate generals.

The Japanese request included 63 F-35A and 42 F-35B aircraft, 110 Pratt and Whitney (N:RTX) F135 engines, and related equipment, it said, and implementation of the proposed sale, including technical support and training, would take 25 years.
""It is vital to U.S. national interest to assist Japan in developing and maintaining a strong and effective self-defense capability,"" the State Department said, adding that the proposed sale would not change the military balance in the region.
F-35 jets are made at a Lockheed Martin factory in Fort Worth, Texas, but allies assemble jets for themselves at two final assembly and check out facilities in Japan and Italy.

In March, the Pentagon said Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (T:7011) was closing the Japanese plant for one week due to concerns about the coronavirus.

(Reuters) - Keeping schools closed in the coming academic year is a greater risk to children's health than reopening them, even amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday.
Redfield said the guidelines the CDC has given on operating schools during the pandemic are designed to facilitate their reopening, and he would be ""disappointed"" if they were used as a rationale to keep them closed.
""I cannot overstate how important I think it is now to get our schools in this nation reopened,"" Redfield said at The Hill's Health Reimagined virtual summit. ""The reason I push it is that I truly believe it's for the public health benefit of these kids.""
On Wednesday, President Donald Trump blasted the CDC guidelines for schools to reopen as ""impractical"" and ""expensive."" Trump has called on schools to reopen, but there is no federal plan to coordinate the effort.
Redfield said on Thursday that none of the CDC's guidance on school reopening is inherently too costly for schools to handle.
He said he does not want schools to go ""overboard"" by failing to recognize that the virus is ""relatively benign"" for young people. 

U.S. schools are scrambling to prepare for the upcoming academic year as the pandemic surges nationwide, topping 3 million confirmed cases.

LONDON/BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - If Donald Trump loses in November, it's no secret that most European policymakers will be happy to see his back. But as they envision the possibility of a post-Trump future, many are wondering how quickly the trans-Atlantic alliance can be fixed.
Despite U.S. opinion polls showing Biden ahead, officials in capitals across Europe say they are making no assumptions about the likely outcome of the U.S. election.
Having failed to anticipate Trump's first victory, ""the German government already burned its fingers,"" said Jürgen Hardt, foreign affairs spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party and an expert on U.S.-German ties. ""I do not have the impression that the German government is waiting for another president – and I would advise them not to do it.""
Still, when they allow themselves to look ahead to the prospect of a Biden presidency, they don't necessarily see an instant resumption of the easier Barack Obama years. Though tone and style would shift overnight, policy substance on issues from China to Russia to trade could take longer to overhaul.
""I don't expect that, if we have a new president, everything will just fall into place,"" said Reinhard Buetikofer, a trade expert for the Greens in the European Parliament.
At best, if Biden wins, Buetikofer sees a chance for ""revisiting and reforming multilateralism"" after years of open U.S. hostility to institutions from NATO and the EU to the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization.
There are areas where frictions created by Trump could disappear as soon as Trump does: on climate policy, for example, a President Biden is likely to jump straight back into the Paris climate change accord that Trump quit.
The WTO trade dispute mechanism that has collapsed because of a U.S. veto of the appointment of judges could be put back together quickly.
European countries that have prized Western unity in rebuffing Russian advances in Ukraine will no longer have to worry that the president of the United States will invite Vladimir Putin to a G7 summit without consulting them, as Trump did last month.
""We would review all of the decisions that President Trump has taken,"" Antony Blinken, Biden's senior adviser on foreign policy, told Reuters, referring specifically to Trump's threat in recent weeks to withdraw U.S. troops from Germany.
IRAN, CHINA, TRADE
But there are also issues where a Biden presidency may not be able to simply pick up where Obama left off.
On Iran, for example, Europe has spent the past three years trying to salvage an Obama-era agreement to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran's nuclear programme. But so much has happened since Trump abandoned the pact in 2018, and so much has unravelled, it may be too late to save it.
And there are other issues where Europe and the United States have real differences that are not going to be simple to resolve, even with a friendlier figure in the White House.
On China, Biden's team wants to take a closer look at the security implications of Beijing's investment in European infrastructure such as ports, said Julianne Smith, a former Obama-era national security official advising Biden's campaign.
Biden is not expected to be any happier than Trump was about European countries' plans to incorporate technology from China's Huawei, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker, in their next generation mobile phone networks.
On trade, while Biden is not likely to be as trigger happy as Trump has been to impose tariffs on allies, there are serious disputes. Germany, for example, wants to help the exports of its big car manufacturers.
With the elections months away, European countries are still working on their own issues with the U.S. administration.
In the Netherlands, that means discussing whether Dutch chipmaker ASML should have a license to export technology to China. In France, the focus is on plans to tax big, mostly American tech companies, after Washington scuppered global talks.
European countries with nationalist leaders that have enjoyed warmer ties with Trump may use the next few months to consolidate diplomatic gains. Poland aims to solidify plans for a ""Fort Trump"" - a long sought-after base of U.S. troops.
But any big changes in the trans-Atlantic relationship will have to wait at least until November, said the Paris-based ambassador of a large EU country, predicting a ""moment of confrontation"" if Trump should win another term.
""Everybody is keeping their fingers crossed and will wait.""

(Reuters) - Record-breaking coronavirus cases and deaths in several U.S. states are dimming hopes of economic recovery, with cellphone data showing shoppers are staying away from stores in areas where cases are rising the most. 
In Arizona, Texas, Florida, Georgia and South Carolina, which were among the first states to reopen commerce in May, retail foot traffic now lags levels elsewhere, data firm Unacast said. 
More than 60,000 new COVID-19 infections were reported on Wednesday, the greatest single-day tally of cases by any country since the virus emerged late last year in China. U.S. deaths rose by more than 900 for the second straight day.
Florida on Thursday announced nearly 9,000 new cases and 120 new coronavirus deaths, a record daily increase in lives lost. California and Texas, the most populous states, announced record increases in COVID deaths on Wednesday.
The surge is making some Americans hesitant to return to public spaces and patronize businesses despite President Donald Trump's efforts to downplay the risks. 
Stephanie Porta, 41, a lifelong resident of Orlando, Florida, said only about half the people at her grocery store wore masks but that was an improvement from two weeks ago. 
""They're trying to make everything seem normal, when it's not. People are dying, people are getting sick. It's insane,"" she said. ""A lot of people are taking notice. But so many are being fed the message that everything is normal. If they're smart, they're scared."" 
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis called the rising cases a blip, downplayed the record increase in deaths and told residents not to be afraid. 
""I know we've had a lot of different blips,"" DeSantis said. ""We're now at a higher blip than where we were in May and the beginning of June.""
Florida is one of the few states in the nation that does not make public the number of COVID patients currently in its hospitals. However, more than four dozen hospitals reported their intensive care units (ICUs) reached full capacity earlier this week, according to state data.
MORE JOB LOSSES 
The increasing COVID cases weighed on the stock market with the Dow (DJI) and S&P 500 (SPX) ending down about 1% on investor worries the nation could face another lockdown to contain the surge. (N)
Governors in California, Florida and Texas have either ruled out ordering most businesses to close and residents to stay home or said it would be a last resort. So far closures have been limited to bars, beaches and a few other types of businesses. 
In California, where the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 has doubled over the past month, the 44-bed intensive care unit at Riverside University Health System east of Los Angeles is at capacity, so the hospital is expanding it. 
""It's been very consistent every day in the last couple of weeks,"" Riverside emergency room physician Dr. Stephanie Loe said. Referring to a saying among doctors that a full moon brings droves of patients to the emergency room, she said, ""Every day has been like a full moon.""
As cases rise in 41 of the 50 U.S. states over the last two weeks, the nation's educators are debating how best to resume school in the fall. 
Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Thursday that keeping schools closed would be a greater risk to children's health than reopening them, even amid the pandemic. 

Redfield said the guidelines the CDC has given on operating schools during the pandemic are designed to facilitate their reopening, and he would be ""disappointed"" if they were used as a rationale to keep them closed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes Russia has given support to Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan in the past but does not have intelligence to confirm it directed attacks against Americans or to corroborate that it paid bounties to kill American troops, the top U.S. general said on Thursday.
The remarks by Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, were under oath to Congress after lawmakers emerged from a separate classified briefing about U.S. intelligence that Russia may have paid the Taliban to kill American troops.
Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the U.S. military, which counts intelligence agencies including the National Security Agency (NSA) and Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), could not corroborate the intelligence, which sources say was collected by the CIA.
Milley did not dispute that Russia, like other countries, had long been involved in Afghanistan.
""But there's a big distinction between arming and directing (military activity). We know about arms. We know about weapons. We know about support, things like that,"" Milley told the House Armed Services Committee, sitting alongside Esper at a hearing.
""We don't have -- in the case of the Russians -- we do not have concrete corroborating evidence, intelligence, to show 'directing.' That's a big difference.""
He added that the United States was still looking into the matter and, if it were confirmed the Russians were paying the Taliban bounties, it would be a ""big deal.""
President Donald Trump, a Republican who has worked to cultivate warmer relations with Moscow, has downplayed the significance of the intelligence and denied being briefed on the matter before it was reported by news outlets last month.
A Republican lawmaker, Lee Zeldin, who is a strong defender of Trump, said at a separate hearing at the House Foreign Relations Committee that the intelligence was in a written February presidential brief prepared for Trump but was not orally briefed to him. 
Retired U.S. Army general John Nicholson, a former U.S. commander in Afghanistan, said the Russians had previously been arming, equipping and even giving money to the Taliban in modest amounts. 
But he said Moscow had in years past carefully calibrated its support to avoid becoming a ""game-changer"" on the battlefield. Nicholson cited one telling example, saying the Taliban wanted surface-to-air missiles but the Russians ""didn't give them."" 
He said Russian bounties, if they did occur, ""would mark a departure from this previously calibrated approach.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The judge hearing the criminal prosecution against U.S. President Donald Trump's former adviser Michael Flynn on Thursday asked an appeals court to reconsider a recent decision dismissing the case.
U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan asked the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the June 24 decision that directed him to drop the Flynn case.
The Justice Department sought to dismiss the case against Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, following pressure from Trump and his allies, leading to criticism that Attorney General William Barr was using his office to help the president's friends.
Sullivan refused to immediately sign off on the dismissal, instead appointing a retired judge to argue in favor of denying the Justice Department's request.
Sullivan has said he cannot serve as a “rubber stamp” and must carefully review the dismissal request.
In a 2-1 decision issued last month, a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit directed Sullivan to grant the department's motion to clear Flynn, who twice pleaded guilty.
“This is plainly not the rare case where further judicial inquiry is warranted,” Judge Neomi Rao, a Trump appointee, wrote for the court, adding that Sullivan had intruded on ""the executive branch’s exclusive prosecutorial power.""
Sullivan’s attorneys told the appeals court the panel decision marked a “dramatic break from precedent” that “threatens to turn ordinary judicial process upside down.”
Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was one of several former Trump aides charged under former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that detailed Moscow’s interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia’s then-ambassador, Sergey Kislyak.
He then switched lawyers to pursue a new scorched-earth tactic that accused the FBI of entrapping him, and asked the judge to dismiss the charge.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York's mayor joined activists on Thursday to paint ""Black Lives Matter"" in giant yellow letters on the city's exclusive Fifth Avenue in front of Trump Tower, once the crown jewel in President Donald Trump's property empire.
As doormen at the luxury apartment building's shiny gold doorstep watched, Mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife, along with Reverend Al Sharpton, who eulogized George Floyd in Minneapolis in early June, joined dozens of mask-wearing people pushing paint rollers to create the block-long mural.
The Black Lives Matter movement gained momentum after George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white officer knelt on the Black man's neck. [n1N2DN137] 
High school student Betty Kubovy-Weiss, 16, of Manhattan, said her work painting the ""V"" and ""E"" of ""LIVES"" was aimed at counteracting the ""negativity and violence"" of Trump's presidency.
""Black Lives Matter is an important statement in and of itself. Our president has generally been highly critical of the movement in a way that I think is very dangerous and damaging to our nation,"" Kubovy-Weiss told Reuters.
Trump on Twitter last week called the mural a ""symbol of hate.""
Similar Black Lives Matter murals are planned in each of New York City's five boroughs and have appeared across the United States. They started in Washington, D.C., where the massive message covered a street near the White House after authorities used pepper spray to disperse peaceful protesters and clear the way for Trump's June 1 photo opportunity of him holding a Bible in front of St. John's Episcopal Church.
""It doesn't mean that other lives don't matter - it just means that this shouldn't be happening,"" said James Wallace of New York. ""We won't turn our heads and deny that there is racial violence occurring.""

As a hot sun beat down on hundreds of gallons of paint drying outside one of Manhattan's most prestigious addresses, de Blasio's office tweeted a photograph of the mural with the words, ""NYC has a message for the world: #BlackLivesMatter.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Border Patrol detained roughly 30,000 migrants attempting to cross the southwest border with Mexico in June, a 41% increase from the previous month, even as sweeping coronavirus-related border restrictions instituted by President Donald Trump remain in place.
Roughly nine in 10 of those caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in June were single adults, according to statistics released on Thursday by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number of single adults from Mexico detained at the border is on pace to rise this year, a shift away from arrests of mostly Central American families and unaccompanied children in 2019. 
Trump, a Republican, faces reelection on Nov. 3 and has made his efforts to restrict illegal immigration - including the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border - a focus of his 2020 campaign. His presumptive Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, would end the diversion of billions of dollars in military funding for wall construction.
(For a graphic on the candidates: https://graphics.reuters.com/USA-ELECTION/POLICY/ygdpzwarjvw/index.html#link-immigration)
As the coronavirus spread across the United States in March, the Trump administration restricted non-essential travel across the borders with Mexico and Canada to contain the disease. At the same time, the administration put in place health-focused rules that allowed U.S. border authorities to rapidly expel migrants caught trying to cross illegally, arguing they could bring the virus into the United States. 
The number of migrants caught by Border Patrol - particularly families and unaccompanied children - plummeted in April as the new measures went into effect and countries in the region initiated lockdowns. 

Despite gradual increases seen both in May and June, the crossings still remain far below last year, when arrests peaked in May at 133,000.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - At least three people were killed during protests in Congo's capital and elsewhere on Thursday, a U.N. rights body said, after the nomination of an election commission chief stirred public anger and further tension in the ruling coalition.
Police fired tear gas to disperse thousands of supporters of President Felix Tshisekedi and democracy campaigners as they marched through the streets of Kinshasa, Lubumbashi, Goma and several smaller towns.
The United Nations Joint Human Rights Office (UNJHRO) said it was ""concerned about the use of lethal force by law enforcement which led to the death of two protesters.""
In its post on Twitter, the UNJHRO also condemned the death of a police officer.
The police declined to comment.
The protesters were upset at the move to appoint Ronsard Malonda as president of the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), whose nomination was ratified by the national assembly last week but is yet to be signed off by the President.
Tshisekedi's supporters accuse Malonda of being close to former President Joseph Kabila, who still wields extensive powers through his parliamentary majority, control of most cabinet ministries and the army.
The coalition government, an awkward alliance formed after the 2018 election between Tshisekedi, Kabila and several smaller parties, has shown increasing signs of disharmony in recent months.
In Kinshasa the crowd tore down part of a building belonging to Kabila's party, a Reuters witness said.
""They want to make Mr Malonda the head of CENI to block us in the elections of 2023,"" said Hague Mata, a UDPS supporter.
Opposition party Lamuka have accused Malonda, who has worked in senior positions in CENI for many years, of ""being an agent"" of Kabila's party and helping with the 2018 ""electoral heist"" that denied them victory.
Kabila's political alliance denied in a tweet they had anything to do with Malonda's nomination, and said responsibility for the appointment rested with civil society and religious organisations.

(Reuters) - The actors' union representing 750 Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) World performers has filed a grievance against the Orlando, Florida-based theme park alleging retaliation against its members over the union's demand that they be tested for the coronavirus.
Walt Disney Co plans to reopen Disney World on Saturday, with attendance limits, social distancing rules and new health and safety protocols. Florida has seen a spike in coronavirus cases in recent weeks. In June, Florida infections rose by 168% or over 95,000 new cases.
The Actors' Equity Association, in a statement on Thursday, said Disney had announced plans on June 23 to recall members for rehearsals the following week.
On June 25 the union publicly stated that actors needed to be tested because they cannot practice social distancing, the statement said. But on June 26, Walt Disney World rescinded all of its recall notices for members of the union.
The union said it sent its grievance to Disney on Wednesday.
""Seven unions signed agreements to have their employees return to work, the Actors' Equity rejected our safety protocols and have not made themselves available to continue negotiations, which is unfortunate,"" a Disney spokeswoman said in a statement. ""We are exercising our right to open without Equity performers.""
Over 19,000 people, including some workers, have signed a petition asking Disney to delay the park's reopening. Unions representing workers at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, also pushed back on that park's reopening, which was scheduled for July 17 but which the company has delayed indefinitely.

When Disney World reopens, guests and employees will be required to wear masks and undergo temperature checks. The resort will suspend parades, fireworks displays and other activities that create crowds.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario is taking steps to make its ""broken"" education system more equitable for Black and indigenous students in Canada's most populous province, Premier Doug Ford said on Thursday.
New measures include phasing out the so-called practice of streaming, when 9th grade students must choose whether they want to take university-track ""academic"" courses or hands-on ""applied"" courses in high school.
A 2017 report from York University in Toronto found streaming disproportionately channeled Black students into applied or vocational courses, while their white counterparts took academic courses.
Applied courses are seen as less academically challenging. The report said students and educators felt they affected self-esteem, discouraging students from continuing on to university.
Ontario is the only province in the country to still use streaming.
""It's unfair and it's not right to ask these students at such a young age to make a decision that will determine the rest of their high school and post-secondary careers,"" Ford said at a press briefing in Toronto.
""At this age everyone needs the same foundations for learning ... The system is broken,"" he said, adding that about half of the province's Black youths were not entering the academic stream.
Other new measures include proposals to reform punitive suspensions for kindergarten to Grade 3 students, and strengthen sanctions for teachers who display racist behavior, Ford said.

Ontario is expected to reopen its schools amid the COVID-19 pandemic in September, although school districts are being asked to prepare for a range of reopening scenarios.

Indoor gyms and swimming pools in England will also be able to reopen from July 25.
The latest moves follow the reopening of non-essential shops on June 15 and last weekend's reopening of pubs, restaurants, cafes and hairdressers.
Dowden told a news conference that from July 11 theatres, opera and dance groups can put on outdoor performances to socially distancing audiences.
He said that meant for example music lovers can attend opera at Glyndebourne in East Sussex, southern England, which plans to stage a summer season of open-air concerts and operas during July and August.
Dowden said that when gyms reopen, operators would have to use time-booking systems to limit numbers, restrict class sizes, space out equipment and step-up cleaning regimes.
He added: ""At the beginning we all stayed at home to protect the (National Health Service) and save lives. Now the British public has a new part to play - it's time to eat out to help out, to enjoy the arts to help out and to work out to help out."" 

He said the government was working with public health experts to pilot some indoor theatrical and musical performances to work out how socially distanced audiences can attend.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia on Thursday failed in a second U.N. Security Council bid to cut aid access to Syria from Turkey, diplomats said, and the council will now vote on a last-ditch attempt to extend approval for cross-border aid deliveries before it expires on Friday.
The 15-member council has been split, with most members pitted against veto-powers Syrian ally Russia and China, who want to halve the number of border crossings for aid deliveries to Syria from Turkey to one, arguing those areas can now be reached with humanitarian help from within Syria.
The United Nations says millions of Syrian civilians depend on the humanitarian aid delivered from Turkey. 
""The cross-border operation into NW (northwest) Syria is a vital lifeline,"" Mark Cutts, U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, said in a post on Twitter. ""It's vital that the Security Council extend the cross-border resolution ... We cannot fail these people.""
A crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Moscow backing Assad and Washington supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions have been internally displaced.
For six years, the Security Council annually authorized the delivery of aid to Syria from four border crossings, two in Turkey, one in Jordan and one in Iraq. In January, it allowed the aid operation to continue from Turkey for six months, but dropped Iraq and Jordan due to opposition by Russia and China.
On Tuesday, Russia and China vetoed an attempt to extend for a year the approval of the Turkish border crossings. The remaining 13 members voted in favor of the resolution, drafted by Germany and Belgium.
Russia then proposed that just one crossing be authorized for six months, but it failed with just four yes votes on Wednesday.
Germany and Belgium have now put forward a compromise that would authorize the two Turkish crossings for six months. Russia put forward an amendment to cut it to one crossing. The council voted on the amendment and diplomats said on Thursday that it had failed, only receiving two votes in favor. 
So now the council will vote on the compromise by Germany and Belgium. During the coronavirus pandemic, the council has been operating virtually and members have 24 hours to vote. 
The result will be announced on Friday. If the resolution is not adopted, then the U.N. cross-border aid operation will end.

Poland is gearing up for a close vote in the election pitting President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, against centrist Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski.
The comments by the PiS leader Kaczynski, come after Duda slammed a German-owned tabloid newspaper last week for reporting on a pardon that he granted to a man who had served his sentence in a paedophilia case. 
On Wednesday, Poland's foreign ministry summoned a German charge d'affaires over a series of articles published in the German press.
""An unusually brutal, very far-reaching intervention by the press took place. Let's not brush this aside. German press, simply said. In the future, we have to prevent these sorts of situations,"" Kaczynski told Catholic broadcaster TV Trwam in an interview. 
Duda has repeatedly criticized the foreign press during the campaign.
Trzaskowski has in turn criticised PiS for eroding media freedom and has accused public broadcaster TVP of bias and politicisation. 
German politicians also criticised PiS' position towards German-owned media outlets.
""The paranoia of Poland's PiS government camp is leading to the usual reaction: Anti-German tirades meant to protect one of their politicians from a possible defeat in the elections,"" Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, deputy chairman of Germany's opposition pro-business Free Democratic party, told Reuters on Thursday.

PiS has long said it would like less foreign ownership of private media in Poland, accusing such outlets of anti-Polish bias.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Leaders from Ivory Coast's ruling party agreed at a closed-door meeting late Wednesday to press President Alassane Ouattara to seek a third term in October's election following the sudden death of Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, two sources said.
Ouattara announced in March that he would not stand for re-election after 10 years in office and designated Gon Coulibaly, his closest political ally, as the RHDP party's candidate.
Gon Coulibaly's death on Wednesday, less than a week after he returned to Ivory Coast from an extended medical leave in France for heart issues, left the RHDP scrambling to choose a replacement.
The election is expected to be the most hotly contested since 2010, when Ouattara's victory over incumbent Laurent Gbagbo sparked a brief civil war in which 3,000 people died.
A small group of senior RHDP leaders, presided over by the party's executive secretary, Adama Bictogo, met informally on Wednesday, said the two sources, both party members, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""We think unanimously that only President Ouattara can carry the flag. He alone can unite us,"" said one of the sources. ""It is true that he said he did not want to be a candidate, but the situation has changed."" 
A more formal leadership meeting is planned for Thursday, the sources said. The deadline to submit the candidate's name is Sept 1. 
The presidency declined to comment on Thursday. 
Ouattara has previously said he would prefer to hand over power to a new generation but that he has the right to run again under a new constitution adopted in 2016. His opponents dispute that.
""He has always been a unanimous choice within his own camp. But (running again) would be extremely dangerous, particularly vis-a-vis the opposition, which would find a common enemy,"" said Rinaldo Depagne, International Crisis Group's West Africa project director.

The RHDP candidate will face off against former President Henri Konan Bedie, who declared his candidacy last month, while other politicians could join the race ahead of the filing deadline.

It followed a report in April by Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons investigators, which found that Syrian Sukhoi Su-22 military planes and a helicopter dropped the bombs on the village of Ltamenaha in the Hama region in March 2017.
Syria, which joined the OPCW in 2013 to avert military intervention by the United States over a previous chemical attack, has said it fully destroyed a stockpile of chemical weapons declared to the OPCW, but inspectors have found undeclared toxins and munitions during site visits.
In a vote of 29-3, a decision was adopted by the politically-divided 41-member Executive Council of the OPCW in The Hague. Nine countries abstained.
A stronger response to Syria's violation of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention could follow at the next meeting of the OPCW's full membership, the Conference of States Parties, which starts in late November.
""The Council ...condemned the use of chemical weapons as reported by the OPCW Investigation and Identification Team (IIT), which concluded that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Republic used chemical weapons in Ltamenah, Syria in March 2017.""
It ""establishes that the Syrian Arab Republic failed to declare and destroy all of its chemical weapons and chemical weapons production facilities,"" the decision said.
Along with its military ally Russia, Syria has repeatedly denied the use of chemical weapons in the civil war.
The OPCW council said it ""expresses deep concern that the Syrian Arab Republic did not cooperate with, and provide access to, the IIT.""
Thursday's decision gave Damascus 90 days to declare ""the facilities where the chemical weapons, including precursors, munitions, and devices, used in the 24, 25, and 30 March 2017 attacks were developed, produced, stockpiled, and operationally stored for delivery.""
In the event Damascus fails to meet the deadline, the council will recommend taking action limiting Syria's OPCW membership rights at the Conference of States Parties later this year. The CSP could also recommend reporting Syria to the U.N. Security Council.

GENEVA/ZURICH (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday it was setting up an independent panel to review its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the response by governments.
The announcement follows strong criticism by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration of the global agency's role in the crisis - though the WHO said the review was not linked to the United States.
Former New Zealand prime minister Helen Clark and former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf have agreed to head the panel, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
""The magnitude of this pandemic, which has touched virtually everyone in the world, clearly deserves a commensurate evaluation, an honest evaluation,"" Tedros told a virtual meeting with diplomats.
The panel will provide an interim report to an annual meeting of health ministers in November and present a ""substantive report"" next May, he said.
Trump has accused the WHO of being too close to China and not doing enough to question Beijing's actions at the start of the crisis. Tedros has dismissed the suggestions and said his agency kept the world informed.
EXPERTS
In May, Trump said the United States, the agency's biggest donor, would pull out of the organisation unless there were real reforms, a threat he followed up on this week by giving a one-year notice of withdrawal.
""The President has been clear that the WHO needs to get its act together. That starts with demonstrating significant progress and the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks with transparency and accountability,"" a senior U.S. official in Washington told Reuters on Thursday.
The WHO issued a statement saying the review was not linked to the United States and that its 194 member countries had asked in May for an evaluation of the global response. 
More than 12 million people are reported to have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and 548,429​ have died since the virus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to a Reuters tally.
Lawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law in Washington, D.C., said the panel should not be ""an inside job"" driven by states close to the WHO, nor should it pander to what he called ""Trump's conspiracy theories"". 
""What is really vital is we have truly independent experts from a variety of disciplines that will honestly and frankly review the situation with COVID,"" Gostin told Reuters.

""Are they going to review China's action, are they going to review WHO's initial response to China, look at things like ... WHO's power to independently verify states' reports?,"" he added.

The Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency found his body at Mt Bugak in northern Seoul, near where his phone signal was last detected during a late night search, Yonhap said.
Yonhap said the mayor's daughter reported him missing at 5:17 p.m. (0817 GMT) and said his phone was off and that he had left a message ""like a will"".
As longtime mayor of the city of nearly 10 million people, Park was one of the country's most influential politicians and played a high-profile role in its response to the coronavirus pandemic.
He was seen as a potential presidential hopeful for the liberals in the 2022 presidential elections.
Hundreds of South Korean police using drones and dogs had searched for the mayor on Thursday after his daughter reported him missing, officials said.
Park left the official residence at around 10:40 a.m., wearing a black hat and a backpack, having cancelled a policy meeting that was scheduled for Thursday morning, according to multiple local reports.

Park, who was mayor of Seoul since 2011, played a vocal role in the huge Candlelight Demonstrations that helped lead to the ousting of former President Park Geun-hye in 2017.

HAMBURG (Reuters) - Jens Boysen disembarked one of the world's largest container ships on Thursday after 167 days at sea when he has acted not only as captain but also as doctor, dentist, mental coach and entertainment director for his stressed-out crew.
Almost 200,000 seafarers like Boysen are stuck onboard merchant ships, some for more than a year, because coronavirus travel restrictions make it almost impossible to rotate crews, according to the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization (IMO).
The crews, who come from all over the world to meet their ships, suffer the mental stress of not knowing when they can return home, their plight worsened by a lack of access to medical treatment.
Boysen, captain of the Emma Maersk, said two crew members developed toothache but were not allowed to leave the ship. 
""I got medical advice, and then I pulled the teeth out,"" Boysen said, standing on the dock in Hamburg after bidding his crew farewell. ""It felt almost like a war situation,"" he added.
The IMO has called the situation a ""humanitarian crisis"" and maritime welfare charities have warned of an increase in suicides by seafarers. Last month, Pope Francis paid tribute to the stranded seafarers in a special video message, saying they were ""not forgotten"".
SO CLOSE YET SO FAR
Boysen, a German national, finally left the ship in Hamburg on Thursday along with two other crew members, after passing up an opportunity to leave the ship in April when it last docked in the same city. 
""I felt it was my duty as captain not to leave the ship first, even though I really wanted to see my family,"" said Boysen, who lives with his wife and three children near Flensburg in northern Germany.
""That was my low point in April, being in Hamburg and staying on the ship although I could see the city through the port fence,"" he added.
To keep up the crews' spirits, he organised karaoke tournaments, bingo and piggy-back races. 
About 90% of world trade is transported by sea, and Boysen said immigration and shipping authorities should agree exemptions from lockdown measures for seafarers to ensure crews can be changed and supply chains protected. 
""The public does not really understand what we do in container shipping. We are part of a logistics chain that is not visible to most people but supplies them with most of the things they need.""
Now though the captain, who has accrued a vast amount of holiday along with some paternity leave, has no intention of taking a brief vacation - he's taking the rest of the year off.

SERONGA, Botswana (Reuters) - Botswana wildlife officials investigating hundreds of unexplained elephant deaths have verified six more carcasses and say it is still not clear what is killing the animals, around two months after the first bodies were spotted.
Officials told reporters near the Okavango Delta on Thursday that they had now verified 281 carcasses and that the deaths were concentrated in an area of 8,000 square km that is home to about 18,000 elephants.
Flying over the area in a helicopter, a Reuters reporter saw one carcass splattered in droppings from vultures, which had eaten some of the flesh, and red paint from officials marking verified carcasses. Hundreds of live elephants wandered nearby.
""We are not dealing with a common thing, it looks like it's a rare cause,"" said Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer at the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, adding the death rate in the affected area was below 2%. 
""We cannot rule out anything at this stage, it could be a virus, vegetation, overnutrition after last year's drought ... We have asked the community not to interact with the carcasses.""
He said officials were expecting to receive test results this week on samples sent to South Africa and Canada.
Some campaign groups have criticised the government for acting too slowly to solve the mystery of the dying elephants, an accusation Reuben has denied.
Although the number of deaths so far represents a fraction of the estimated 130,000 elephants in Botswana, there are fears more could die if authorities cannot establish the cause soon.
Wave Kashweka, a senior veterinary officer in Botswana's North-West district, said officials had found elephants which appeared to have died recently, adding aerial surveys would try to find more carcasses.
In their initial inquiries, authorities ruled out poaching and anthrax among possible causes.
Cyril Taolo, acting director of the wildlife department, said the government had contacted neighbours Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Zambia but they had not seen similar elephant deaths.

Africa's overall elephant population is declining due to poaching, but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent's elephants, has seen numbers grow from 80,000 in the late 1990s.

BARTLESVILLE, Oklahoma (Reuters) - District Court Judge Curtis DeLapp was renowned for his hair-trigger temper. Mispronounce his name, come to court a few seconds late, fail to rise as quickly as he’d like – no slight was too small to set him off.
For almost a dozen years, DeLapp used his power to terrify people who appeared before him, pressing contempt charges against defense attorneys, prosecutors and even a prospective juror who brought children to court when she couldn’t find daycare, court records show. 
Another juror was fined $340.70 after she objected to how DeLapp was treating people who appeared before him. “I never want to be a juror or ever go back to court again,” said Carolyn Duffey Love, now 68. “He treated me like a dog.”
In 2015, DeLapp grew incensed when he learned someone had dropped sunflower seeds in his courtroom, according to witnesses. After scouring footage from a courtroom security camera, the judge summoned a spectator to his chambers, charged her with contempt and ordered her jailed for four days.
Local attorneys had grown convinced that DeLapp was violating the state’s judicial conduct code by abusing his authority. But they felt it would be futile to file a complaint with the Oklahoma agency that investigates judicial misconduct, because the state hadn’t filed charges against a judge for misconduct since 2004. The lawyers also say they worried that crossing DeLapp risked retaliation against both them and their clients.
Not until 2018 – after DeLapp sentenced courtroom spectator Randa Ludlow to nearly six months in jail for talking to her boyfriend during court – did local lawyers find the courage to act. 
They enlisted a lawyer from 50 miles away who seldom practiced in DeLapp’s courtroom. And they worked collectively to build a voluminous complaint alleging that DeLapp had unlawfully jailed not just Ludlow but also many dozens of people in the prior two years alone. The complaint also contained an explosive charge: that the judge may have fabricated a court document to justify jailing Ludlow. 
Had DeLapp fought the charges, he risked more than disgrace. If it could be proved that he submitted a forged document to the supreme court, he might land in prison.
Instead, DeLapp, 53, struck a deal. He resigned and agreed never again to seek office as a judge. The case against him was dismissed. His state pension and law license remained intact. And DeLapp received a written assurance that neither his departure nor the settlement constituted an admission to the “validity of any of the allegations.”
In leaving the bench, DeLapp became one of at least 341 judges across the United States to escape punishment or further investigation in the past dozen years by resigning or retiring amid misconduct allegations, Reuters found. 
DeLapp, who is still practicing law in Bartlesville, declined to comment. In court documents, his attorney said the former judge denies any wrongdoing.
The DeLapp case shines a light on one of the most opaque and dormant judicial disciplinary systems in America. In Oklahoma, repercussions for wrongdoing have been so unlikely that judges could behave with impunity. 
Although each U.S. state has a judicial oversight agency to screen and investigate misconduct complaints, their powers are often limited. In most states, the ultimate disciplinary authority over a judge rests with other judges.
In Oklahoma, the chief justice wields enormous discretion over judicial misconduct cases. After the state’s Council on Judicial Complaints completes a confidential investigation of a complaint about a judge, the chief justice has the power to handle discipline privately – except in rare cases serious enough to justify removing the accused judge from the bench. 
During their tenures, two former state supreme court chief justices told Reuters, about one or two wayward judges a year were quietly summoned to the supreme court. There, they received a tongue-lashing behind the closed doors of the chief justice’s chambers. No official record was kept of those meetings, the justices said. 
As former Chief Justice Joseph Watt put it: “I’d much rather woodshed my brethren in private and not in public.” He added: “How does that judge feel, knowing he’s being taken to the woodshed in front of God and everybody?”
Confidential justice for judges is common in America. At least 38 states – Oklahoma among them – issue private sanctions when judges misbehave. The name of the judge remains secret, and most of these states keep from the public details of the transgression and the discipline. At a minimum, most states release summary statistics of how many judges are privately disciplined each year. Oklahoma doesn’t make that information public.
This practice – law professor Stephen Gillers calls it “judges judging judges” – undermines the system’s ability to prevent misconduct on the bench. 
Gillers said the killing of George Floyd, the Black man who died in May under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, has fueled concerns about how judicial misconduct is handled, too. “The public has been alerted as it never has been before to the way police misconduct is concealed,” said Gillers. “The same is true for judges.” 
When judges are the ones evaluating misconduct by other judges, they “tend to be more sympathetic, more understanding, more forgiving” to their own, said Gillers, a scholar on judicial ethics who teaches at New York University.
Privacy also robs the system of a deterrent effect: Concealing the punishment fails to discourage bad conduct by other judges, who may never learn of the consequences, Gillers and other ethicists say. 
That’s precisely the dynamic that played out in Oklahoma, local lawyers say. Until Chief Justice Douglas Combs petitioned for DeLapp's removal, Oklahoma hadn’t publicly filed misconduct charges against a judge in 14 years – the longest stretch of inaction of any state in recent decades.
In its investigation into judicial misconduct across America, Reuters sought to quantify the personal toll inflicted by judges who break the law or violate their sworn oaths. Over a dozen years, Reuters found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge’s misconduct. The victims ranged from individuals who were subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges to those illegally jailed.
“This is a broken system that absolutely empowered judges like DeLapp to operate with impunity,” said Josh Lee, the out-of-town attorney who led the effort to rein in DeLapp. “For more than a decade, not a single judge was publicly disciplined. What kind of message does that send?” Lee said that DeLapp “had no reason to fear that anyone would stop him.”
MASKING MISCONDUCT
The state of Washington is among a dozen states that handle judicial discipline more openly.
In 1989, Washington voters abolished the practice of private sanctions. Since then, every case brought against a judge by the Washington judicial conduct commission is made public. Reiko Callner, the commission's executive director, said judges should be treated the same as anyone who appears before them.
“The norm is that anything that happens in a court has the name of the participants on it – the names of a criminal defendant, the crime victim, people involved in a lawsuit,” Callner said. “Why should a judge who has been found to have violated the code that governs their conduct be allowed to keep that fact from the public?”
Many state commissions say there are sound reasons to discipline judges privately. “It’s quick, it’s inexpensive and you don’t have to hold a public hearing,” said Cynthia Gray, director of the Center for Judicial Ethics at the National Center for State Courts, an independent nonprofit research and training organization. 
Often, Gray said, states see benefits to keeping matters confidential. “If it’s one-time, minor misconduct by a judge, and the judge shows remorse, you can issue a private sanction or letter and then move on,” she said. That means commissions can focus “on the judges who are out there committing patterns of misconduct and are fighting every step of the way.” 
Still, a Reuters investigation found that private discipline has been used to mask significant violations of the law. For example, in 2018, state records show, a Texas judge failed to “maintain professional competence” and illegally jailed indigent defendants. And in 2017, a California judge engaged in sexual harassment and showed a “lack of candor” when accused of misconduct, records show. Neither their names nor their punishments have been made public.
In Colorado, the judicial commission has publicly disciplined four judges since 2008 but has privately sanctioned 52. Among those whose names and other identifying information remain hidden from the public: judges disciplined for sexual harassment, for drunken driving, for delayed rulings, and for demonstrating a “pattern of errors in handling trials or issuing rulings that indicate a lack of competence.” 
Granting anonymity to rogue judges is routine.
A Reuters examination of judicial misconduct nationally identified 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined judges in private, withholding from the public details of their offenses – including the identities of the judges themselves. 
Over the same period, 26 state oversight councils resolved more judicial misconduct cases privately than publicly, the news agency found. In Massachusetts, for instance, reviews of judicial conduct commission annual reports show that about 9 in 10 judges disciplined were privately sanctioned.
Some judicial oversight agencies take their independence and secrecy to extremes. 
California’s oversight agency went to court to try to prevent an audit of its records, a review that ultimately discovered sloppy investigations of judges. In Illinois, the agency misplaced or lost hundreds of complaints, which have not been recovered or investigated.
Kathy Twine, who directs the Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board, declined to comment on the lost files. Twine also would not provide routine complaint and investigation statistics to Reuters – statistics disclosed to the news agency by almost every other state.“We’re like an island,” the official said. “We don’t have to disclose anything.”
A comparison between Oklahoma and a state of similar size highlights the discrepancies in how judges are treated. 
From mid-2004 to mid-2018, Oklahoma did not file misconduct charges against any of its 600 judges, Reuters found. By contrast, the state of Mississippi – with virtually the same code of judicial conduct and almost the same number of judges – publicly sanctioned 75 judges in the same period.
“I’m sure every state would like to think it has a judiciary that is above reproach, but every profession’s going to have a few bad apples,” said Darlene Ballard, who retired last week as director of the Mississippi commission. “It sounds like other states like to keep their problems in-house so that it appears to the public that they don't have any bad judges.”
Steve Scheckman, who investigated misconduct cases in Louisiana and New York, said states that report so few cases are failing in their primary mission: to defend, before the public, the integrity of the justice system.
“To think that there’s no misconduct in your state, you’re either really naive, in denial or protecting people,” he said. 
Former Oklahoma Justice Steven Taylor disputes such characterizations. Taylor, who served on the state’s top court from 2004 through 2016, said he was proud that the state had so few cases of public discipline. To him, the small number of cases doesn’t demonstrate weak oversight. It shows “a judiciary in Oklahoma that is ethical, doing their work and highly disciplined.”
“If we had 6o or 70 cases, I would be ashamed or embarrassed,” Taylor said.
As chief justice in 2011 and 2012, Taylor recalled, he visited the Washington County courthouse in Bartlesville, where he met Judge DeLapp and others. Taylor said no one mentioned any concerns about how DeLapp ran his courtroom. 
But Reuters identified scores of contempt charges issued by DeLapp in traffic and other cases before, during and after Taylor’s time leading the bench. Some dated back a decade. In 2008, for instance, DeLapp charged a defendant with contempt for “being vocal” after the man protested because he had “no money to pay towards his fines & court costs,” according to a court record.
Taylor said he was “extremely disappointed” when he heard in 2018 that DeLapp had acted so inappropriately for so many years. He also was surprised that lawyers had remained silent for so long.
“Why didn't someone report this?” the former justice asked.
The local lawyers who kept quiet for years offer a simple answer, rooted in the state’s desire to keep judicial misconduct secret: An unchecked judge has the ability to cow his community.
In Bartlesville, the Washington County seat, four judges hear criminal and civil cases, with traffic infractions representing the bulk. The city of 36,000 is an hour north of Tulsa. The courthouse is convenient for visitors, who park for free just steps from the entrance. It also is an easy place for a judge to escape scrutiny. 
That’s because in Washington County and thousands of other courtrooms nationally, there is no requirement to record or transcribe most proceedings. Employing a stenographer or recording the proceedings is considered too expensive and largely unnecessary for the assembly-line pace of misdemeanor cases that make up most of the court’s business. 
This lack of an official and detailed record posed an obstacle to the local attorneys alarmed by DeLapp’s behavior. Absent transcripts or recordings to corroborate their concerns, six lawyers told Reuters, they worried that a complaint alleging misconduct would come down to their word against the judge’s. 
The local lawyers say they felt vulnerable to reprisal. DeLapp wielded authority to appoint attorneys to cases involving indigent defendants. They say the per diem pay for this work made the difference for some lawyers between insolvency and eking out a living.
That explanation bothers Taylor, the former state high court justice. “It's sad that the lawyers were intimidated,” Taylor said. “Part of the hallmark of being a lawyer is speaking truth to power. They should have spoken up.”
But many of those lawyers say they weren’t simply concerned about themselves. They worried that, if DeLapp got wind of a complaint, he might take it out on defendants as well. “It’s not just your livelihood at stake. It’s also clients,” said defense attorney Marty Meason, who practiced before DeLapp and once ran unsuccessfully against him for district judge. “Nobody wanted to take on the system.”
That changed in early 2018, when DeLapp ordered Randa Ludlow jailed for five months and 27 days in jail. Her alleged offense: talking during court with her boyfriend, a traffic defendant. Ludlow declined to comment. 
The sentence seemed outlandish to Meason and other lawyers who had questioned DeLapp’s behavior for years. They suspected DeLapp broke the law by failing to afford Ludlow a hearing to challenge the contempt order, violating a basic constitutional right. They also believed he’d failed to properly document his reasons for jailing her. Whether DeLapp followed proper procedure in punishing Ludlow would become a key component in the misconduct complaint against him. 
A few days after Ludlow was jailed, the lawyers decided to reach out to Lee, an attorney whose office was about an hour's drive from Bartlesville – and thus had less to fear because he didn’t regularly appear before DeLapp. 
Lee remembers the call his firm received from a Washington County lawyer. The message was clear: You have to help us stop this judge.
“Everyone feared retaliation,” Lee said. “I worked far enough away that I might be safe. Plus, I was the only one crazy enough to do it.”
A DISPUTED DOCUMENT
About seven weeks after DeLapp had jailed Ludlow for contempt, Lee sought her release by filing a writ of habeas corpus with the state supreme court challenging her detention. The high court quickly heard the case in Oklahoma City.
At the hearing, DeLapp told the court that he had been unable to locate the specific document legally necessary to jail Ludlow. In the document, called a Contempt Court Minute, judges must lay out the rationale for the order. The document must also be time stamped and signed. 
Shortly after the supreme court hearing, DeLapp notified the high court that he had located the missing record. Nonetheless, the high court voided DeLapp’s contempt order, and Ludlow was immediately released.
The case as it related to Ludlow was over. But now, Lee had grown suspicious of DeLapp, in particular the judge’s claim that he had so quickly located the missing Contempt Court Minute he used to justify jailing Ludlow. When DeLapp produced the missing Contempt Court Minute, the document seemed odd, Lee recalled. 
It included a stamp that made no sense. It was dated two days before DeLapp claimed to have created the document. In other words, it appeared to be backdated, and poorly at that.
Lee wondered: Had DeLapp fabricated the document because one had never been filed in the first place? In late March, Lee received a call from Meason, the Bartlesville attorney who was quietly helping him build a misconduct case against DeLapp and harbored similar suspicions.
“I found the evidence,” Meason recalled telling Lee. “We’ve got him.”
DeLapp, Meason explained, had often used security cameras to monitor the conduct of people in the courthouse. He had used footage from one camera to identify the sloppy sunflower-seed eater. 
There was also a security camera in the clerk’s office. Playing a hunch, Meason went to the sheriff’s office and requested a copy of weeks of video beginning in February 2018. To his surprise, he said, a staffer quickly handed over the footage on a flash drive.
Reuters reviewed the video, which has never been made public. It shows DeLapp leaving the clerk’s office with files. A clerk then leaves her desk. She returns later with what appears to be a single-page document. The clerk examines the page, then stamps it in two places. 
Meason and Lee say they were convinced that the document shown on the security tape was the same Contempt Court Minute that DeLapp submitted later that day to the high court. The footage, they believe, showed the clerk backdating the document, apparently to make it look as though it had been filed at the time DeLapp issued his contempt order.
Lee submitted a 44-page complaint against DeLapp with the state judicial council, characterizing the contempt document as “suspect at best.” Meason mailed a copy of the unabridged footage to the oversight council. Lee captured key frames and created a video presentation, which he also submitted. “I wanted to make it simple for them,” Lee said. 
The state’s judicial council investigated Lee's complaint about DeLapp. According to council director Taylor Henderson, the matter was then forwarded to Chief Justice Combs with a recommendation that DeLapp be removed from office. The council director declined further comment but records show that a short while later, Combs moved to oust DeLapp, publicly filing a 20-page petition with the Court of Judiciary, the nine-member tribunal that has the authority to remove judges.
In the petition, the chief justice accused DeLapp of “gross neglect of duty,” “oppression in office” and “complete disregard” for the law. The justice also criticized DeLapp for abusing his judicial power and declared him unfit for office.
In a section titled “Falsified Court Documents and Misrepresentation,” Combs chastised DeLapp for “gross misrepresentation” of the contempt of court document. If DeLapp created the document and pretended it was “newly discovered,” it may have constituted “a grossly intentional misrepresentation to the Oklahoma Supreme Court” – one that could be construed as a felony.
This was not the first time that DeLapp had failed to properly file a contempt of court document, then produced it after the fact, Combs concluded. In the 2015 case of a woman jailed for eating sunflower seeds in court, DeLapp waited more than two years before he “drafted” a required sentencing order. DeLapp filed the missing document “only after” his misuse of contempt powers came to light in 2018 in the Ludlow case, Combs wrote.
Combs detailed more allegations against DeLapp. One involved a father and son who became lost in the hallway of DeLapp’s courthouse. The boy asked DeLapp for directions to another courtroom, and the judge yelled at him, according to witnesses. DeLapp threatened that if the boy couldn’t find his way, “he could sit his ass in jail,” Combs wrote.
And the chief justice cited evidence that DeLapp had inappropriately contacted the county attorney’s office about a deferred prosecution agreement for DeLapp’s son, who was charged with traffic violations. 
Rather than fight the misconduct allegations, DeLapp resigned without admitting to any wrongdoing.
Not every state is forgiving of judges facing misconduct charges who opt to resign. California, Texas and a dozen other states have pursued disciplinary cases and impose sanctions even after judges leave the bench.
West Virginia is among them. On average, West Virginia disciplines about four or five judges each year. Often, one or two of these cases involves a judge who resigned during a misconduct investigation, said Teresa Tarr, counsel for the state’s judicial oversight commission.
“It would be very easy for us to dismiss cases if they resign,” Tarr said. “I think the right thing to do is to hold them accountable, because it gives the public the understanding that the judiciary as a whole is not going to tolerate misbehavior. It also lets the other judges know what’s acceptable conduct and what’s not.”
Not so in Oklahoma, where the focus is on protecting the judge, not informing the public. “We want to try to self-police,” said Watt, the former chief justice. Handling matters informally is “the best way to take care of” wayward judges, “and not drag them through the mud.”
Settlement agreements like the one Oklahoma approved for DeLapp do more than permit accused judges to walk away without admitting guilt. When an accused judge leaves the bench, the commission’s investigation into misdeeds ends – even if other wrongdoing is suspected. 
Because state judicial investigations are sealed, the public is left to wonder about a judge's culpability. Potential victims of misconduct may go undiscovered. And commission officials are prohibited from discussing cases under penalty of law. That silence can empower an accused judge to declare his or her innocence without citizens ever knowing the facts of the case.
DeLapp resigned to preserve his livelihood, his wife posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). “He could’ve fought it, which he wanted too (sic) but did not want to risk losing his retirement, pension, Bar license, etc.,” she wrote.

In one of his last acts as a judge, DeLapp issued a statement in which he praised his judicial accomplishments and said he was leaving the bench with ""a heavy heart but clear conscience.""

""Factories, workers, teachers, agriculture, craftsmen, are now represented by the League,"" said Matteo Salvini, leader of the anti-immigrant, eurosceptic League, speaking on Italian TV.
Italy's Communist Party was one of the largest in the Western world after World War Two but steadily lost support and was formally disbanded in the early 1990s.
Many working class voters have switched to Salvini's League in recent years amid stagnant wages and large-scale immigration while Italy's economy has flatlined.
The League's new office will open by the end of July opposite the large, austere building that used to be the Communists' headquarters in Botteghe Oscure street. Its national headquarters will remain in Milan.
Once known as the Northern League, the party had campaigned for the secession of wealthy northern Italy from what it saw as the fiscal oppression of ""thieving Rome"".

But Salvini, tapping into public discontent with illegal immigration and the European Union, has turned it into a national party which now tops opinion polls with support at around 26%.

Bolsonaro made his announcement on Tuesday. His illness is a potent symbol of his government's botched response to the outbreak in Brazil, the second-worst in the world. More than 1.7 million people in Brazil have tested positive for coronavirus and nearly 68,000 have died.
Brazilian broadcasters pulled journalists off the job after they were exposed to Bolsonaro in the interview, quarantining them until they test negative for the disease.
In its complaint, the press association alleged that Bolsonaro had committed at least two crimes related to putting someone's life or health at imminent risk and failing to prevent the spread of an infectious disease.
The Brazilian Press Association, a prestigious professional group that advocates for journalism, asked that its complaint be sent to the attorney general's office to decide on whether there were grounds to proceed with a criminal probe.
Bolsonaro, 65, is currently in quarantine, and has said he is feeling well. The far-right former army captain has a prickly relationship with journalists, alleging unfair treatment and he is quick to label unfavorable coverage as fake news.
The president's office did not respond to a request for comment.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday suspended a network of social media accounts it said were used to spread divisive political messages online by aides to the president and two of his sons.
The allegations by Facebook add to a crisis in Brazil, where Bolsonaro's sons and supporters have been accused of running a coordinated online campaign to smear opponents.
The accusations have spurred a congressional inquiry and a separate Supreme Court investigation into attacks on the judiciary, which led to police raids in May on the homes and offices of Bolsonaro allies. 

Bolsonaro, who is under mounting criticism over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, has said the court's investigation is unconstitutional and risks establishing censorship in Brazil.

906,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 10:41AM ET</span>",Advisor's killing deepens Iraqi leader's face-off with militias,"By John Davison
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi talked tough after the killing of a high-profile analyst and government advisor, pledging to hunt down his assailants and curb the actions of armed groups.
But the face-off between the U.S.-friendly Iraqi leader and powerful Iran-backed militias whom his entourage privately blames for Monday's murder of Hisham al-Hashemi indicates how difficult this will be. 
A series of bold moves by Kadhimi in his first two months in office, including two unsuccessful arrest raids against militias, showed the limits of his power in the face of hostile groups with influence across state institutions, according to government officials, politicians and diplomats.
Kadhimi in May succeeded Adel Abdul Mahdi, during whose tenure Iraqi militias loyal to Iran's theocratic government deepened their sway over Iraq's politics and economy.
Abdul Mahdi was toppled last year during mass anti-government protests in which hundreds of demonstrators were killed.
Political insiders believe the killing of Hashemi is part of the tussle with Kadhimi and leaves him with a stark choice: take on the militias, or back down and lose face.
Hashemi, a well-known analyst who had advised the government on defeating Sunni Muslim Islamic State militants and curbing the influence of the pro-Iran Shi'ite militias, was gunned down outside his Baghdad family home on Monday by men on a motorbike.
Iran-aligned paramilitary officials deny any role in the killing. Some Islamic State supporters cheered his death, but no group has claimed the murder nor been fingered publicly by the government.
Some close to Kadhimi say the killing related directly to Hashemi's recent work on pro-Iran groups. 
""He'd been threatened over the phone by men from a militia three days before his death, warning him over publishing articles,"" one government official who spoke to him about those threats said.
The official and a second government source close to Kadhimi said Hashemi had been advising on plans to curb the power of pro-Iran groups, and bring smaller paramilitaries who oppose Iran under closer state control.
""This is why he was killed – they saw his work as an existential threat,"" the first official said.
Hashemi's work also dealt with how to wrest control of Baghdad's fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions, from Iran-aligned groups, they said.
BOLD RAIDS, QUICK RELEASES
Those paramilitaries showed how easily they could overrun the Green Zone last month after Iraqi forces arrested 14 fighters from one accused of involvement in rocket attacks on U.S. installations. 
Militiamen drove vehicles into the zone to pressure authorities to release their comrades. All but one were released in the following days.
A raid in southern Basra in May failed to bring any prosecutions. Security forces had arrested members of the Iran-aligned Tharallah group, accused of shooting protesters, and closed their headquarters. 
Those detained were released and the office reopened, police said. In both cases judges cited lack of evidence to prosecute the militiamen.
The United States, which is in talks with Kadhimi over Washington's future relationship with Baghdad, praised the June raid. But that angered powerful groups which already viewed Kadhimi with suspicion as being too friendly towards Washington.
Qais al-Khazali, the leader of one Iran-aligned group, said Kadhimi's duty as premier was to hold early elections and deal with economic and health crises, not to take on militias.
Senior paramilitary official Ahmed al-Asadi criticized his first moves in office.
""Factions felt targeted by Kadhimi's actions. They were already angry that he was in talks with the U.S. without involving negotiators from more of Iraq's political parties,"" he said.
Pro-Iran groups demand the government set a date for the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq whose primary task is fighting Islamic State but who are reducing their numbers.
'PICKING FIGHTS'
Kadhimi's supporters say without standing up to militias any efforts at political and fiscal reform in Iraq will be piecemeal. But they said his decision to go after militias so publicly could put his leadership in jeopardy and will hamper his ability to undertake any reform.
One senior politician said Kadhimi needed to focus less on his busy social media posting and more on strengthening his position before taking on powerful armed groups.
""Things are looking bad. Kadhimi made a big mistake in raising expectations about what he wants to deliver, and he's losing face. His move against Kataib Hezbollah was right but at the wrong time,"" he said.
Kadhimi's media office said the premier was ""doing his best"" in the face of security and fiscal challenges that have mounted since the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. 
Another senior government official said Hashemi's killing was a sign of desperation. ""When you feel threatened you act this way. If you're strong you don't need to kill an analyst.""
Analysts say if Kadhimi loses the political elite he will need support from ordinary Iraqis to survive. But some of those are losing faith.
A pledge to release protesters detained last year has brought no releases, the semi-official Human Rights Commission says.
Most painful for Iraqi activists is that the country remains a U.S.-Iran battleground.
""Iraq is split between politicians who side with either of the two occupiers,"" said Hassan Adel, an activist who demands the end of U.S. and Iranian involvement in Iraq.

""We don't trust any of them.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday recognized about half of Oklahoma as Native American reservation land and overturned a tribe member's rape conviction because the location where the crime was committed should have been considered outside the reach of state criminal law.
The justices ruled 5-4 in favor of a man named Jimcy McGirt and agreed that the site of the rape should have been recognized as part of a reservation based on the historical claim of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation - beyond the jurisdiction of state authorities. Conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the court's four liberals in the majority.
The ruling means that for the first time much of eastern Oklahoma is legally considered reservation land. More than 1.8 million people live in the land at issue, including roughly 400,000 in Tulsa, Oklahoma's second-largest city.
Tribe members who live within the boundaries are now set to become exempt from certain state obligations such as paying state taxes, while certain Native Americans found guilty in state courts may be able to challenge their convictions on jurisdictional grounds. The tribe also may obtain more power to regulate alcohol sales and expand casino gambling. 
The ruling could affect the other four of the ""Five Tribes"" in Oklahoma: the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole tribes.
The ruling voided McGirt's sentence of 1,000 years in prison but he could face a new trial in federal court rather than state court.
Under U.S. law, tribe members who commit crimes on tribal land cannot be prosecuted in state courts and instead are subject to federal prosecution, which sometimes can be beneficial to defendants. Reservations were established beginning in the 19th century after U.S. authorities expelled Native Americans from their traditional lands. 
McGirt, 71, has served more than two decades in prison after being convicted in 1997 in Wagoner County in eastern Oklahoma of rape, lewd molestation and forcible sodomy of a 4-year-old girl. McGirt, who did not contest his guilt in the case before the justices, had appealed a 2019 ruling by a state appeals court in favor of Oklahoma. 
McGirt is a member of the Seminole Nation. The crime occurred on land historically claimed by the Creek Nation. 
At issue was whether the Muscogee (Creek) Nation territory where the crime was committed should be considered a Native American reservation or whether Congress eliminated that status around the time Oklahoma became a state in 1907.
Oklahoma argued that the Creek Nation never had a reservation. But even if one existed, the state and President Donald Trump's administration argued it long ago was eliminated by Congress.
The justices weighed a complex historical record that started with the forced relocation by the U.S. government of Native Americans, including the Creek Nation, to Oklahoma in a traumatic 19th century event known as the ""trail of tears."" 

A reservation is land managed by a tribe under the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and generally exempt from state jurisdiction including taxation.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lawmakers concluded a hearing on Thursday on the license renewal of top broadcaster ABS-CBN, paving the way for a critical vote on whether a major media group that angered President Rodrigo Duterte should be allowed back on air.
The telecom regulator ordered ABS-CBN and its 21 radio and 38 television stations to cease operations on May 5, after the lower house failed to conclude hearings on renewing its 25-year license before it expired. 
ABS-CBN's fate rests with one committee that must decide on a franchise renewal that Duterte has threatened to block during repeated public outbursts at ABS, which stemmed from its failure to air one of his paid 2016 election commercials. ABS-CBN has since apologised. 
House speaker Alan Peter Cayetano, who was Duterte's running mate, said the committee could now make a ""legally and morally sound decision"" after 12 hearings.
Cayetano said, however, that ABS-CBN had used public airwaves to further its agenda, like promoting its preferred election candidates. The network says its reporting is ""accurate, fair and balanced.""
He stressed the issue was not about media freedom, hitting back at critics who accuse the president's allies of punishing ABS-CBN, at a time when legal cases mount against another news organisation, Rappler, whose gritty reporting has riled Duterte.
The vote is expected as early as Friday and will be closely watched as concern grows about human rights and media freedom under Duterte in one of Asia's most liberal democracies.
It follows a guilty verdict in a recent libel case against Rappler chief Maria Ressa, and the passing of a sweeping anti-terror law that critics say will be used to target Duterte's opponents.
Dozens of activists gathered outside Congress in support of the 66-year-old broadcaster and its 11,000 staff, many holding placards saying ""VoteYestoABSCBN"", ""Defend Press Freedom"" and ""Fight For Freedom and Democracy"". 
Many Filipinos depend on free TV and radio for news and entertainment and ABS-CBN says it reaches 70% of the 107 million population.

Congressman Mark Go said a franchise must be ""swiftly granted"" because ABS-CBN was a vital public service during a health crisis, while representative Rodrigo Abellanosa said failure to do that would be ""tantamount to curtailment of the freedom of expression"".

GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - One of the largest rebel groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo announced overnight that it had ousted its leader, accusing him of human rights abuses, and planned to surrender.
Elsewhere in the region a different militia killed at least 25 villagers on Wednesday, local officials said. 
The NDC-R armed group, which control vast areas of North Kivu province and earns money from the illicit gold trade, said late on Wednesday it had expelled its leader, Shimiray Guidon, who is the target of U.N. sanctions. 
In a statement, the group accused Guidon of ""deviant behaviour"" and criticised him for human rights abuses. It said Guidon's deputy had taken over and that fighters plan to disarm as soon as possible, without giving further details.
Researchers following the NDC-R said a faction of the militia had tried to resist the ousting and the end result could be a split in the group. 
""As fighting between the factions is ongoing, the short-term effect will likely be a destabilisation of the area controlled by the NDC-R,"" said Christoph Vogel, a researcher at Ghent University. 
Army spokesperson Guillaume Ndjike Kaiko said Guidon's departure was a result of military pressure, even though analysts say the army often uses the NDC-R as a proxy force to go after other militias in eastern Congo. 
In neighbouring Ituri province on Wednesday, fighters from an ethnic militia killed at least 25 people and burned more than a dozen houses in the Hema village of Bynzenzele, local officials said. 
Ezra Licey, the chief of Bunzenzele, said the attackers were from the CODECO militia, an armed group drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, which has been blamed by authorities for killing hundreds of civilians this year.
Rich in natural resources, Ituri was the site of some of the country's worst fighting between 1999 and 2007. After years of relative calm, violence between the Hema and Lendu erupted again in December 2017.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration issued a new rule this week that would bar foreign students from remaining in the United States if their universities are not holding in-person classes during the upcoming fall semester because of coronavirus. 

""We have urged the U.S. side that we need to keep in mind the role that educational exchanges and people to people relations have played in the development of our relations,"" Anurag Srivastava, spokesman at India's foreign ministry told a news conference.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Nearing 100, Gitu Wa Kahengeri clearly remembers the day when, as a prisoner of Kenya's colonial occupier Britain, he wanted to die.
""I was beaten the whole day until I did not feel pain any longer,"" he said, of one episode of abuse during the seven years he spent in the camps that the British ran in the decade before Kenyan independence in 1963.
The camps, where tens of thousands are thought to have died, are a traumatic but largely forgotten part of Kenya's past.
They were set up to jail activists and sympathisers during the Mau-Mau uprising of 1952-1960, in which Kahengeri, born in the 1920s and a Secretary General of the independence movement's Veterans Association, participated.
Using eye-witness accounts, documents and field visits, Kenyan and British historians from the Museum of British Colonialism are now building an online archive of the period, complete with 3D recreations of some of the camps. 
They include 27-year-old Chao Tayiana Maina.
""I've been through the public education system ... and not once do I remember hearing about detention camps,"" she told Reuters. ""There was a sense of betrayal. I didn't understand how this was not taught."" 
Maina recalls the shock she felt when, a few years ago, she read ""Britain's Gulag"", an account by American historian Caroline Elkins, who estimates more than 100,000 detainees may have died in the camps, victims of the combined effects of exhaustion, disease, starvation and systematic brutality.
Other historians have put the death toll in the tens of thousands.
The British High Commission was not available for comment.
In 2013, Britain made an out-of-court settlement of 20 million pounds to five claimants represented by the Mau Mau Association, and a public statement of regret for abuses committed.
When Maina delved more deeply, she discovered her own great-grandmother was a prisoner for seven years.
Her grandfather Daniel Sindiyo was only 16 when his mother was taken. ""If anyone collapsed (there), it was none of your business. If anyone died there, too bad,"" the 82-year-old former civil servant said.
Founded in 2018, the online museum is getting a second lease of life from the Black Lives Matter movement catalysed by the May 25 death of George Floyd in U.S. police custody, and its questioning of ""official"" versions of history.
""We have neglected or silenced certain voices,"" said Maina. ""Thinking we can continue to live without understanding what truly happened is an injustice.""

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israeli opposition leader Yair Lapid said on Thursday protests over the economic slowdown could soon turn violent as restrictions to contain the coronavirus are reimposed and state assistance for the jobless lags.
Alarmed by a new spike in COVID-19 cases, conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week ordered a slew of businesses to shut back down and disbanded some children's summer camps, dashing hopes for relief from record 21% unemployment.
Protesters from across the political spectrum have taken to the streets with demands for speedier compensation from a coalition government they see as overstaffed and ineffectual. Less than half of $29 billion in pledged aid has been paid out.
Israeli police said there had been no sign of violence at protests, but Lapid, a centrist, cautioned that could change.
""We are talking to people who are becoming more and more desperate and angry, who feel, and rightly so, that the country has deserted them at their hardest hour,"" Lapid told Reuters.
""We are trying to be responsible...to calm things down, telling people, 'You know violence is not the answer',"" he said.
""But it's getting harder by the day...I sympathise with the anger and I also worry about the possibility of violence as a result of this anger. What I am trying to do is not to encourage it but to raise a red flag as to what might happen.""
Tamar Hermann, a political scientist and sociologist at the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute, said violence had been rare at past domestic demonstrations.
""In Israel, violence has always created a backlash against the protesters,"" she said. But Hermann said Israelis from many income groups were now feeling economic pain. ""The big question is what the government plans to do in the coming days."" 

Asked how far Israel was from violent unrest, Lapid said: ""Not that far. Not far enough"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In a squalid slum below a partially built flyover in eastern Delhi, Satyendra Pal stands by a whiteboard propped against a straw hut, with half a dozen children wearing masks and sitting on the floor looking up at him.
This is Pal's open air classroom, where he teaches children in their early teens, giving them their only lessons at present after India's schools shut four months ago as part of a lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus. 
While the lockdown has been eased in recent weeks, schools are unlikely to reopen anytime soon, as experts warn the peak of the virus in India could still be months away.
The government has pushed for classes to move online, but in India only 23.8% of households have access to the internet, according to a 2017-18 government report. 
A maths graduate who hails from a village in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, Pal said he was inspired to teach by his readings and faith in Buddhism. Students are not required to pay for his classes. ""I take whatever they give,"" he said.
Pal's students live in the slum and many spend their days helping parents as farm hands after class. There is no power in the area, and water supply is erratic.
""Our school has online classes, but there is no proper internet here,"" said Preeti, a class 10 public school student. ""I could not study on my own. I do feel scared about the virus but I am also worried about exams.""
Pal began teaching a dozen or so kids in 2015 under a tree in the slum, but by early this year he had some 300 students. With the help of his fellow slum-dwellers he built an indoor classroom inside a hut. Desks and benches were donated.
""I stopped the classes in March because it was too dangerous, but parents requested me to teach again,"" he said.
He restarted the classes in July for a limited number of students to ensure social distancing. Charities helped provide masks and sanitisers.
His parents, he says, often tell him he could be earning better by working another job. 

""I want to earn money, but if I focus on myself I will earn alone. If I help these kids, they will all earn with me.""

Human Rights Council urged member states on Thursday to pressure Saudi Arabia to free women activists before a G20 nations summit which Riyadh will be hosting in November. 
At least a dozen prominent women's rights activists were arrested in Saudi Arabia in 2018 as it lifted a ban on women driving cars, a step that many of the detainees had long campaigned for. The women were rounded up as part of a broader crackdown on dissent that extended to clerics and intellectuals.
In a speech to the council in Geneva, Agnes Callamard, the U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said Saudi Arabia should release ""prisoners of conscience, women, human rights defenders that are currently in prison for demanding the right to drive"".
There was no immediate comment from Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 major economies.
Several of the arrested women have alleged torture and sexual assault in detention. Saudi officials deny this and said the detainees were suspected of having harmed Saudi interests and offered support to hostile elements abroad.
Some of the activists are now on trial, but few charges have been made public. Charges against at least some of the activists relate to contacts with foreign journalists, diplomats and human rights groups. 
Their prosecution has drawn global criticism, particularly following the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's Istanbul consulate.
The families of some of the activists, included Loujain al-Hathloul, raised concerns earlier this year when they were unable to contact their detained relatives in prison for several weeks. Contact was eventually restored. 
Callamard, who led a U.N. investigation into Khashoggi's killing, also said that ""far more needs to be done"" internationally regarding accountability for his death.

She welcomed efforts by Turkey, which last week began trying 20 suspects in absentia over Khashoggi's killing. Callamard attended those proceedings.

916,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>","In echo of Mao era, China's schools in book-cleansing drive","By Huizhong Wu
BEIJING (Reuters) - As schools reopened in China after the COVID-19 outbreak, they have thrown themselves into a nationwide exercise to remove books deemed politically incorrect, deepening Chinese President Xi Jinping's push to instil patriotism and ideological purity in the education system.
A directive from the Ministry of Education last October called on elementary and middle schools to clear out books from their libraries including ""illegal"" and ""inappropriate"" works. Now teachers have removed books from schools in at least 30 of mainland China's 33 provinces and municipalities, according to a Reuters review of social media posts, publicly available school and local government documents, and interviews with teachers.
From western Gansu province to Shanghai, the review of publicly announced measures pointed to books being cleared by the hundreds of thousands. 
Censorship in China has been intensifying under Xi, but analysts say this is the first national campaign aimed at libraries in decades. It comes as government employees in Hong Kong last week removed books by pro-democracy activists from public libraries to see whether they violate a new national security law. 
""This is the first movement targeted at libraries since the Cultural Revolution,"" said Wu Qiang, a political analyst based in Beijing and former political science lecturer at Tsinghua University. In the late 1960s, zealous teenagers driven by Mao Zedong carried out a nationwide campaign targeting libraries and destroying or burning what they could get their hands on, as part of a wider destruction of traditional culture. 
This campaign is more selective, and directed from the top, with schools putting groups of teachers in charge of interpreting the order. The books removed have mainly been out-of-date, shabby or pirated texts, but the drive has also covered those which, while they may be legally available, are sensitive.
The ministry directive did not list titles, but said illegal books are those ""that damage the unity of the country, sovereignty or its territory; books that upset society's order and damage societal stability; books that violate the Party's guidelines and policies, smear or defame the Party, the country's leaders and heroes."" 
Inappropriate books are ""not in line with the socialist core values; that have deviant world views, life views and values"" or are books ""promoting religious doctrines and canons; promoting narrow nationalism and racism."" 
Neither the Ministry of Education nor the State Council Information Office, which acts as a spokesperson for the central government, responded to requests for comment. 
One middle-school teacher in a rural area told Reuters their school had removed traditional comic-like picture books called lianhuanhua, or ""linked images,"" popular in China until the 1990s; books about Christianity; books about Buddhism; and notably, copies of ""Animal Farm"" and ""1984"" – George Orwell's classic novels about authoritarianism which have been available in China for decades.
The teacher, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a small group of staff were led by their librarian in an after-hours operation in late April to inspect and remove the books. 
Each night in sessions of up to five or six hours over seven days, they flicked through thousands of titles, selected about 100 that met guidelines issued by the local government and removed them, filling in a form to report their actions. 
""Of course, these books, the students don't really look at them anyway,"" the teacher said. ""So if we had to get rid of some, we would start with this."" 
Some schools and counties have taken to social media such as Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), China's Twitter-like platform that is subject to official censorship, to broadcast their participation.
""Book inspection and clean-up is meticulous but tedious work, shouldering the heavy responsibility of watering the flowers of the motherland,"" announced a Weibo post in May by Xianlai school in Jiangxi province, above a picture of a woman in a floral dress sorting books on a shelf. 
""Our school has taken concrete action to cultivate a virtuous youth, and has raised the quality of our library books one step further.""
The Xianlai school principal did not answer a phone call from Reuters. 
School phone numbers are not publicly available in China.
Reuters tried to call more than 100 other schools across the country to inquire about the removal campaign; 44 of the numbers were functioning. Of those, officials at 23 declined to comment or hung up. There was no response from the rest. 
It is unclear how the books will be disposed of, teachers say. For now, they have been sealed up and put into local storage.
The titles are being replaced with new books from a 422-page list published in the directive by the Ministry of Education. Suggestions include the ""Communist Manifesto and the new era,"" the poems of Mao Zedong, and ""Uncle Tom's Cabin,"" the influential 19th-century abolitionist novel of slavery in America. 
Censorship in China is a continuously shifting line. One of the books on the approved list is ""Winnie the Pooh,"" the children's classic about a boy and his teddy bear. In the past, online posts that likened Pooh's appearance to that of President Xi have been censored, and in 2018, China turned down Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's request to allow screenings of a movie featuring Pooh.
IDEOLOGICAL PERILS 
Xi, who came to power in 2012, has led a campaign to strengthen the Communist Party and reaffirm its ideology. In 2013, the Party issued a directive known as Document No. 9, naming seven ideological perils from the West that were endangering Chinese society, including terms such as ""universal values,"" ""constitutionalism,"" ""civil society,"" and ""democratic politics,"" that had become more commonly used and debated in China. 
At a national summit on education in 2018, Xi spoke of the challenges facing education in the country and issued nine resolutions to tackle them. 
First, according to a summary of his speech published in a Party journal, he said the nation should ""deeply understand and strengthen the fundamental requirement for the Party's total leadership of education."" 
Initially, universities were the focus: Since 2017, many higher education institutions have been tasked with placing Xi's ideology, which he has branded ""Xi Jinping Thought,"" at the core of their curricula, and the government has tasked universities to start research centres for it. 
Later, the drive broadened to younger minds. In 2018, the government launched a campaign to expunge unapproved foreign content from compulsory education textbooks used in the first nine years of school.
The ministry's notice from October called on schools to carry out an ""inspection and cleaning programme"" of books. It said three types should be rejected: illegal books, inappropriate books and books with poor appearance or no value. 
It also called on schools to perfect a mechanism of managing a library's catalogue so any incoming book is inspected. If a problem arises, both the person who recommends the book to students and the one who decides to use it must be held responsible, it said. 
""Contending for the youth's brains is one of the most important things for the Party,"" said Wu, the political analyst in Beijing. 
Young protesters in Hong Kong last year have shown why China is so determined to keep a tight control of the education of young people. 
People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has said Hong Kong's education was ""poisoned."" State media has run multiple editorials in recent months attacking the city's tradition of civic education. The party, said Sun Peidong, a professor with Shanghai's Fudan University, thinks: ""why that protest happened so brutally is because of the lack of patriotic education in Hong Kong."" 
BURNING BOOKS
The western province of Gansu was among the first to remove offending material. 
In December, a picture of two women burning books in front of a library in Zhenyuan, a small Gansu county, went viral online. The book-burning incited public criticism on Weibo. 
Some posts said China was ""burning books and burying Confucian scholars,"" an edict supposedly issued by China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, more than 2,000 years ago to destroy works he regarded as politically dangerous.
Gansu had issued a province-wide notice to follow the Ministry of Education's directive in late October, but Reuters could not determine if the Gansu librarians were part of the campaign targeting schools. The county government said at the time that by burning the books, the women had not followed regulations.
Schools have not boasted of book burnings since. But schools and local governments in four regions publicly stated how many books they removed, totalling more than 60,000 for that small sample, Reuters found. 
For example:
Anning city in southwestern Yunnan province removed a total of 16,365 volumes, including 1,835 ""inappropriate"" volumes and 14,530 books that were ""of poor appearance or had no value,"" according to a social media post by the local government.
In the city of Zhoushan, near Shanghai, 100 schools cleaned out 11,871 books that had ""old and outdated content that is not suitable for students to read, or had a poor appearance and no preservation value,"" according to an education periodical published by the provincial government. 
In Xixia county, in central Henan province, schools cleaned out a total of 6,000 books that were ""inappropriate or had a poor outer appearance,"" and 22,700 that had no value, local media reported.
Many school libraries, especially in rural areas, are small and do not have many sensitive books, teachers say. However, their shelves are often filled with old or pirated books. 
Some of these were falling apart, one teacher in Gansu province said. His school in a rural village removed about 80 volumes. After completing the work, he said, they put the books away in storage. 
CULTURAL REVOLUTION
Although ""1984"" and ""Animal Farm"" were removed from a rural school, they are still available from stores and online in China. 
The school clear-out also has included lianhuanhua picture books from the time of the Cultural Revolution, the rural teacher said. 
At one stage, the comic books from that era engaged in political criticism, targeting figures like Mao's rivals and Confucius, whose writings Xi has resurrected. But the Cultural Revolution has become a more sensitive subject in recent years. 
For instance the Fudan University professor Sun, an expert on the history of the period who now lives in Paris, said she has faced increasing censorship since 2015. In 2019, she stopped teaching her long-time class about the era and quit the history department.
The authorities ""don't want the ordinary people of China, especially the younger generation of China to know"" about it, Sun said. 

The head of the history department said Sun chose to resign, citing personal reasons.

DUBAI/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Syria could face severe bread shortages for the first time since the start of the war, another challenge for President Bashar al-Assad as he grapples with an economic meltdown and fresh U.S. sanctions, a U.N. official, activists and farmers said. 
Any major disruptions to Syria's bread subsidy system could undermine the government and threaten a population highly dependent on wheat as rampant inflation drives up food prices. 
""There is already some evidence of people cutting out meals,"" said Mike Robson, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization's Syria representative. 
""...If the currency continues under pressure, imports will be difficult to obtain and the months leading up to the 2021 wheat harvest may see real shortages."" 
Syria's economy is collapsing under the weight of its complex, multi-sided conflict, now in its tenth year, and a financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, choking off a vital source of dollars. 
Soaring prices have made life harder for Syrians ravaged by a war that has killed hundreds of thousands and displaced millions.
In the past six months alone, the number of ""food insecure"" people in Syria is estimated to have risen from 7.9 million to 9.3 million, according to World Food Programme data. 
""My 50,000 pound (monthly) salary ($21 on the informal market) is barely enough for a few days and I am living on debt. People are selling their furniture... In our lives this has never happened,"" said state employee Yara.
The United States in June imposed its most sweeping sanctions on Syria yet. Washington says the Caesar Act excludes humanitarian aid and aims to hold Assad and his government accountable for war crimes.
Syrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread hardship among ordinary citizens. 
The Syrian pound, which held steady at around 500 to the dollar for several years, went into free fall last year, hitting a low of 3,000 in June, in anticipation of fresh sanctions. 
That currency drop is hindering Assad's plans for buying up all of this year's wheat to make up for a shortfall in imports that is drawing down on strategic reserves.  
Before the war, Syria could boast more than a year of wheat reserves. 
The government declined to answer questions on the current size of reserves and wheat procurement. FAO's Robson said he did not have data. 
Abdullah, a confectionary trader from Damascus, has never seen poverty on this scale. 
""We had always been self-sufficient. Why we have reached this point where even a loaf will soon become a dream, I really don't know,"" he told Reuters in a text. 
BREAD POLITICS  
Assad has regained control of much of the country from rebels, with backing from Russia and Iran. But the main wheat regions remain in the hands of Kurdish-led fighters who seized vast territory from Islamic State. 
Syria has had drastically lower output since the conflict erupted. It used to produce 4 million tonnes in a good year and was able to export 1.5 million tonnes. 
This year, Syria is estimated by the FAO to have produced between 2.1 million and 2.4 million tonnes. The government expects to have produced 2.8 million tonnes. 
Demand across the country is around 4 million tonnes, leaving a shortfall to fill from abroad. 
But international import tenders conducted by the state's main grain buyer, Hoboob, have repeatedly failed since last year. The government declined to comment on how many deals it managed to conclude. 
While food is not restricted by Western sanctions, banking restrictions and asset freezes have made it difficult for most trading houses to do business with Syria. 
With major grain traders out of the equation, the government relied on businessmen to conclude transactions to sustain the bread subsidies. 
""They import quantities to Lebanon and then take it to Syria by land unless it is Russia giving direct shipments, government to government, then they can deliver to (the port of) Latakia,"" said Ayman Abdel Nour, a U.S.-based political analyst.
""Now that window has closed with the problems in Lebanon.""
Reuters data shows that since June 2019, Hoboob has issued at least 10 international tenders for between 100,000 and 200,000 tonnes of wheat, failing to report results for most. 
Youssef Kassem, the head of Hoboob, has been quoted by media as stating that 1.2 million tonnes of Russian wheat imports were contracted throughout 2019 amounting to $310 million. Reuters could not independently verify that information.  
Hoboob tried to barter some of Syria's durum wheat, used in making pasta, for soft bread-making wheat twice in September 2019, with no result announced.
When bread lines started to get longer in government-held areas around March, Russia was urged to send the full amount of the 100,000 tonnes of wheat it had promised as humanitarian aid since 2019. 
""Maybe for the first time since the start of the Syrian uprising, you basically had a shortage of subsidised bread in ovens and that led to the development of a thriving black market,"" Elizabeth Tsurkov, Fellow at the U.S.-based Foreign Policy Research Institute think tank and a Syria expert, said. 
Russia, the world's largest wheat exporter, has been a steady supplier of wheat to Syria but the size of its wheat aid has not met demand. 
Russian customs data does not show supplies to Syria, and the size of real supplies varies wildly.
""The supplies are going on. There are however, problems with the payment and availability of vessels ready to deliver to this destination,"" a Russian industry source told Reuters. 
The source estimated only about 150,000 tonnes of commercial wheat had reached Syria between July 2019 and May 2020. 
A RACE FOR RESERVES 
The government blamed bread lines on technicalities and with the start of its wheat buying season in June announced it would buy every single grain of its local crop. 
By mid-June, Hoboob said it had so far procured around 212,000 tonnes. FAO estimates that around 700,000 tonnes of the total crop lie in government-controlled territory this year. 
But the three provinces which account for over 70 percent of production lie mostly in the hands of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), led by the Kurdish YPG militia.
The government has historically lured farmers to sell their crop by paying a higher price than its rivals, even as the wheat remained in areas outside its control. 
This year, with the collapse of the pound, it has upped its price from the 225 pounds a kilo announced at the beginning of the season to 425 pounds. 
But facing a currency crash and in fear of a ripple effect from Caesar sanctions on the economy of the areas they control, the Kurdish-led authority not only raised its local wheat purchasing price but also pegged it to the going rate of the dollar, pledging to pay 17 U.S. cents a kilo no matter how far the pound slips. 
Salman Barodo, head of the region's economy and agriculture board, said so far 400,000 tonnes had been bought and warned against any attempts to smuggle the crop outwards. 

The Kurdish-led authority, that runs the SDF region, is aiming to stockpile 18 months' worth of supply and only open sales to government territories in the case of a surplus.

HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - When college graduate Wong, 23, leaves Hong Kong to escape Beijing's new national security law, it will be his friends, the stunning views over Victoria Harbour and the city's famous dim sum he will miss the most.
Wong is joining a flood of fellow Hong Kongers fleeing what they see as a more authoritarian era under the legislation, which punishes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and colluding with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
China says the new law is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by months of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the city over the last year. 
Waving a Union Jack flag, Wong and his family attended some pro-democracy rallies and called on the British government to support residents of its former colony, an act that could now violate the vaguely defined law.
Wong said while the prospect of a new life in a different country is exciting, his family is also fraught with sadness.
""When you pack everything, you're packing your memories in Hong Kong. You got photos and toys from childhood, you are packing your memories into a box and sending them to a foreign country, so it's a very emotional time,"" he told Reuters.
""Hopefully I can pack up everything,"" said Wong, who declined to give his full name for fear of retribution. 
Wong's parents, an accountant and social worker, both have British National Overseas passports, providing them a path to citizenship in the United Kingdom, where they will fly to next year. 
Wong hopes to accompany them but says if he can't due to visa issues, he will consider South Korea until he can join his parents and members of his extended family, who are also leaving for the United Kingdom.
The speed at which Beijing raced through the legislation and a lack of transparency until it took effect close to midnight on June 30 drew criticism from all corners of the world, including Washington, Ottawa, London, Taipei and Japan.
On Thursday, Canberra said it was suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong and announced measures to attract people and businesses from the global financial hub.
The Chinese government has condemned foreign interference in the affairs of its freest city. 
A Hong Kong immigration lawyer told Reuters she had been inundated with inquiries from people eager to get to Britain since the law was introduced, with a noticeable spike in the number of extended families seeking information.
""One of my friends is a teacher in Hong Kong. She's been teaching for over 10 years and she said she has four siblings and the five families altogether they want to move,"" said Janine Miu, Managing Director at UK Immigration Specialist. 
Miu said she had also seen a shift in the demographic of people rushing for the exit, from more wealthy and experienced people to younger individuals and couples with small children.
Critics of the law fear it will be used by mainland and local authorities to crush dissent in Hong Kong, while supporters say it will bring stability after months of unrest.
Although China's law also applies to activities abroad, Wong plans to lobby overseas support for those he leaves behind.

""I will not turn my back on my own people,"" he said.

CHENNAI, India (Reuters) - Five more policemen were arrested in a widening investigation into the deaths of a father and his son while in police custody in southern India, an officer said on Thursday, in a case that has put policing in the country under a spotlight.
J Jayaraj, 59, and Bennicks Immanuel, 31, were detained for allegedly violating coronavirus lockdown rules in the town of Sathankulam last month and subjected to a brutal thrashing that resulted in rectal bleeding and eventual death, according to a letter to government officials written by Jayaraj's wife J Selvaran.
Police Inspector General K Shankar said the five policemen arrested on Wednesday were accused of holding the two men down in a police station in Tamil Nadu state while others beat them. 
""They have been held for abetment,"" Shankar said. 
Five other policemen are already in custody and face charges of murder in a case that people on social media have compared with the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of police in the United States. 
India's federal police will soon take over the investigation from the state police. 
India's National Human Rights Commission says there are nearly 15 cases of custodial violence and torture reported each day from the country and that ""it has become almost routine.""
The father-son duo were accused of keeping their mobile phone shop open despite the lockdown, an offence that at worst would have got them three months in prison, legal experts said.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in Washington on Wednesday that U.S. and unidentified allied forces had interdicted a vessel off Yemen's coast on June 28 that was carrying Iranian arms to the Houthis.
""Lying, accusations and spreading hatred are key elements of America's foreign policy, especially in the current regime,"" Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, quoted by state television. ""Pompeo's remarks stem from this approach.""
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has taken a hardline with the United Nations to push it to strengthen the embargo on Iran, saying that lifting it would allow Tehran to acquire weapons that could fuel conflicts in the Middle East.
""Americans are trying to provide excuses to continue their maximum pressure on Iran, advance their malicious goals and to extend the arms embargo on Iran,"" Mousavi said. 
Relations between the longtime foes have worsened since 2018 when Trump abandoned an international accord under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions.
The United States has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran's oil trade and pressure Tehran to renegotiate the deal, give up its ballistic missiles, and cease its involvement in regional wars.
Iran-aligned Houthi rebels have been fighting the Yemeni government, backed by a Saudi-led coalition, since 2015. It denies charges by Saudi Arabia and the United States that it gives financial and military support to the Houthis.
""The United States and Saudi Arabia have imposed a siege on the Yemeni people,"" Mousavi said. ""With such baseless accusations, they are trying to evade accountability and responsibility for their crimes in Yemen.""

BRUSSELS/TOKYO (Reuters) - The European Parliament urged Japan to comply with international rules on child protection and to allow for joint parental custody after a number of EU citizens were denied access to their children by Japanese mothers.
Unlike most countries, Japan does not recognise joint custody after divorce and children often lose contact with the non-custodial parent. 
In a non-binding resolution approved late on Wednesday, EU lawmakers expressed concern over ""children in Japan being abducted by (one) parent"" and urged Tokyo to enforce domestic and foreign court decisions on the return of the child and on access and visiting rights.
The EU Parliament has been lobbied by EU citizens such as Frenchman Vincent Fichot and Italian Tommaso Perina who live in Japan and are being denied access to their children.
""It is time for Japan to demonstrate integrity and good faith in the best interests of the children. It is time for all kidnapped children to come home,"" the two fathers said in a joint statement to Reuters.
Emboldened by the growing number of foreign victims-turned-activists, more Japanese parents who have suffered similarly from the lack of joint custody have begun to speak up, lobby for change and sue the government.
French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Giuseppe Conte have raised their concern on the issue with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Some Japanese and foreign parents have collectively launched a complaint to the United Nations' human rights body. 
Responding to the European Parliament's resolution on Thursday, Japan's foreign ministry denied that the country was not compliant with international agreements on child abductions and said it would continue to explain its actions to EU nations.
In a small but significant step, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party’s judiciary research commission recommended last month that Tokyo address the problem of child ""abductions"", noting their detrimental impact on children.
It said Japan should ""learn from other countries' systems"" to explore a possible alternative to its single-custody system after divorce.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian security forces on Thursday detained a regional governor who staged an election upset against the country's ruling party in the Far East in 2018 and accused him of organising the murder of several entrepreneurs 15 years ago. 
Masked agents in camouflage pulled Sergei Furgal, the governor of Khabarovsk region, out of his vehicle before putting him in a van, footage published by the Investigative Committee, which styles itself as a Russian version of the FBI, showed. 
Furgal would be charged shortly, the agency said in a statement. He could face up to life in prison, if found guilty of the allegations dating from 2004-2005 that also included attempted murder. 
The agency did not detail the alleged crimes, but said four members of an organised crime group had already been detained and that people involved in the murders had provided evidence against him. 
It was not immediately possible to identify a lawyer for Furgal to seek comment.
Furgal, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party known as the LDPR and a former lawmaker, was popular in the Pacific region where he swept to power in 2018 after defeating a rival from the ruling United Russia party that backs President Vladimir Putin.
The LDPR is also supportive of Putin, but Furgal's victory was seen as a blow to the ruling party's grip on power in the regions. 
The arrest is likely to fuel fears of a mounting wave of repression following last week's adoption of sweeping constitutional reforms that clear the way for Putin, if re-elected, to serve two more terms in the Kremlin until 2036. 
Abbas Gallyamov, a political analyst, said the arrest also served as a warning shot to opposition forces planning to challenge the ruling party at regional elections this September. 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the LDPR's head, threatened to have his party and allies in parliament resign their posts in protest. 
""We gave you the constitution. And you're putting us in handcuffs!"" he said.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - At an open-air, riverbank factory where the Blue Nile and White Nile meet in Sudan, Mohamed Ahmed al Ameen and his colleagues mould thousands of bricks every day from mud deposited by summer floods. 
""I consider the Nile something I have not parted with since I was born,"" Ameen said, as workers around him shaped bricks with blistered hands and laid them out to dry in the sun. ""I eat from it, I farm with it. And I extract these bricks from it."" 
But the labourers on Tuti Island in Sudan's capital Khartoum fear a giant dam Ethiopia is building close to the border between the two countries could endanger their livelihood. 
They worry the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam upstream could weaken the Blue Nile's force, putting at risk an industry that locals say provided bricks for some of Khartoum's first modern public buildings around a century ago.
Pottery makers, farmers and fishermen around the Nile's convergence share similar concerns, though other residents displaced by flooding last summer see benefit in a dam that will regulate the powerful river's waters.
The dam ""will stabilise the Nile and we will get less flooding"", said Mutasim al-Jeiry, a 50-year-old potter in a village outside Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, where workers craft jars with clay from the river. 
""But on the other hand we will get less clay and less water. Farmers, brick and pottery makers will be seriously affected,"" he predicts.
The residents' views are a snapshot of the hopes and fears thrown up along the length of the Nile by the vast hydropower project, which has triggered a high-wire diplomatic stand-off between Ethiopia and Egypt downstream.
Ethiopia, which says it is finally asserting its right to harness the Blue Nile's waters to power its economy, promises to start filling the dam's reservoir later this month. 
Egypt, which sees a risk to its scarce water supplies, is frantically trying to secure a deal that would guarantee minimum flows from the Blue Nile, the source of about 86% of the waters of the Nile, which flows into the Mediterranean.
Sudan's government says the dam could threaten the safety of some 20 million Sudanese living downstream and damage the country's flood-plain agricultural system if not built and operated correctly.
But it also sees potential benefits in controlling floods during the rainy season and improving the performance of its own dams. 
That ambivalence is echoed in the village of Wad Ramli, 60km (37 miles) downstream from Khartoum, where flooding was especially bad last summer. Some residents whose houses were damaged or destroyed were displaced to canvas tents pitched nearby. 
""It is true the Renaissance dam will lower the Nile's water levels and prevent flooding,"" said Manal Abdelnaay, a 23-year-old living in one of the tents. ""However, it will impact farming, and the Wad Ramli area is one that lives off farming."" 
On Tuti Island, farmers and landowners are anxious that if the dam saps the river's strength, there will be less water to irrigate and replenish the soil. 
""I came to Tuti in 1988 because the land here is the best for agriculture and close enough to supply markets, and it makes good incomes"" says Mussa Adam Bakr, who farms a plot where vegetable fields back onto citrus and mango groves, next to the brick factory.
""Through the year the Tuti earth produces all sorts of vegetables like potatoes, onions, aubergines,"" says Bakr.
Sudan was long overshadowed in the dispute over the dam by its two larger neighbours, but has recently stepped up to broker new negotiations between the three countries. 
Its citizens will be watching carefully for any changes in the waters they are so dependent upon. 

""A fish out of water will die, it cannot survive,"" says Ashraf Hassan, a 45-year-old fish trader in Omdurman. ""Us too, we live as part of the water, or around it.""

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian leaders hope Democrat Joe Biden will tone down Washington's pro-Israel policies if he becomes U.S. president, and Palestinian-Americans have been pressing his campaign for a change, sources familiar with the efforts said.
So far, their efforts have had little impact, the sources said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, moved the U.S. Embassy to the city and made peace proposals envisaging Israeli sovereignty over parts of the occupied West Bank, territory Palestinians seek for a state.
Trump's moves -- including aid cuts to the Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank -- have prompted Palestinian officials to sever ties with Washington.
""If Mr Biden (is) elected in November, we hope that it will be a totally different dynamic,"" Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said last week during a virtual conference with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
Biden is the presumptive Democratic challenger in November's election. He is on record as challenging plans by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank -- de facto annexation of territory Israel seized in a 1967 war.
""Biden opposes any unilateral action by either side that makes the prospects of a two-state solution less likely - including annexation, which Biden opposes now, and would continue to oppose as President,"" campaign spokesman Michael Gwin said in a statement for Reuters.
Gwin did not address what action Biden might take if he were president and Israel annexed West Bank land.
Netanyahu's proposed move, under Trump's peace blueprint, has been criticised by Arab and European nations. The Israeli leader is awaiting the green light from Washington. 
PROGRESSIVE SUPPORT
Buoyed by support from progressives in the Democratic party, Palestinian diaspora activists want Biden to take a more critical look at Israel's treatment of the Palestinians.
More than 120 prominent Palestinian-Americans have signed a ""Statement of Principles"" that they say determine their community's support for candidates for federal office.
They include making aid to Israel conditional on it ending ""practices that violate Palestinian rights and contravene international law"", and revoking any potential U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty in occupied territory.
""We want to see Biden embrace the party's progressives, who have recognised the shared struggle between Palestinians living under military occupation, and Black and brown Americans who face police brutality, systemic racism and injustice,"" said Zeina Ashrawi Hutchison, a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in August.
Those positions have failed to gain traction with Biden's team, three people familiar with the campaign's thinking said. 

""The progressives want a full-throttle platform change -- a pro-Palestinian flank, an anti-annexation flank -- but there just isn't appetite in the campaign so far,"" one of the sources said.

925,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Sacred sites blast exposes Australia's laws skewed to mining,"By Melanie Burton and Jonathan Barrett
MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - When mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) blew up two ancient caves in Western Australia's iron-ore rich Pilbara with state approval, the destruction was met with anger from indigenous landowners for whom the sites were of deep cultural and sacred importance.
    The blasts in late May became one facet of the Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, which saw thousands of people demanding an end to racial inequality in a country where Aboriginal groups have long suffered higher rates of imprisonment, unemployment and lower life expectancy.
    Now, however, the ground may be shifting.
    The Western Australian government told Reuters it would push for indigenous groups, rather than a departmental committee, to be responsible for evaluating the importance of sacred sites.
    The state's planning department said the legislation, which followed a two-year review of cultural heritage laws, would be introduced to the state parliament before the end of the year.
The bill is in the final stages of drafting and will be released soon for final consultation, it added. 
The proposed legislation may fall short of demands of some indigenous groups since it is unlikely to give them a veto on development and could face opposition by lawmakers who see too much red tape, indigenous activists and a land rights lawyer said. 
    But the bill comes at a time when public outrage over the caves' destruction, fuelled by the Black Lives Matter movement, could yield different outcomes from a legal structure that has almost always greenlighted mining development at the expense of cultural sites. 
  Western Australia accounts for nearly all production of Australia's most valuable export - iron ore - which the government expects to be worth more than A$100 billion ($69.64 billion) this financial year. 
    Since July 2010, miners have submitted more than 460 applications to disturb or destroy sites of potential cultural significance in the region, according to state parliament records, including Rio's Pilbara request. All but one of those applications were approved.  
    Now there are signs of change - the sole request to be declined occurred last month. 
The decision came after the Rio blasts at Juukan Gorge, which destroyed a site that showed 46,000 years of human occupation and focused attention on the heritage laws.
    Rio acknowledged that it had blasted two caves as part of its expansion of the Brockman 4 iron ore mine and apologized for the distress it caused the traditional landowners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people.
    In addition to the detonated caves, Rio was cleared in 2013 by the state government to destroy four additional rock shelters at Juukan, according to government records, as part of its application to disturb the ancient gorge.
Artefacts had previously been found at or near the sites, records show, and permission was granted before more extensive archaeological work could be conducted, with no ability to review that decision later.
Mapping data that Rio filed with the state’s Department of Planning, Lands and Heritage and viewed by Reuters indicate two of the caves were within metres of the ones blasted in May. The other two are about 170 metres away. 
     Reuters could not independently verify whether the four additional sites have been damaged. Rio declined to comment on the four additional sites and referred to its May 31 statement saying it was reviewing all work in the area since the May 24 blast.  
       
    POWER IMBALANCE
    The Rio case highlights the power imbalance in the world's biggest iron ore precinct between miners and indigenous Australians who have no legal veto over development projects on their ancestral land, said indigenous academic Marcia Langton.  
    Unlike their title suggests, traditional owners don't own the land and are only sometimes considered stakeholders in its management.
    ""The missing ingredient in all of these arrangements is the right of the traditional owners to consent or refuse requests to destroy their sites,"" she said.
    Under state rules, miners can destroy heritage sites like the ones at Juukan Gorge - where archaeologists had previously salvaged part of a 4,000-year-old belt made of plaited hair that provided a direct genetic link to the present day PKKP - for mine development by applying for an exemption to its Aboriginal Heritage Act.
    As part of the state exemption process, a review is made by a departmental committee, which considers the economic value of the project rather than acting solely on behalf of traditional owners who have no right of appeal in the process.  
    The inclusion of indigenous voices in the heritage legislation is potentially an improvement, if it includes relevant local groups, said land rights barrister Greg McIntyre, who said he has was yet to see the details.
    But the new legislation won’t affect existing agreements with miners where there is a clause that prohibits traditional owners from filing any formal objections with state or federal authorities.
    ""After the event, there is no remedy for Aboriginal people if the site is damaged,"" said McIntyre, who led a historic case in the 1980s and 90s that recognised land rights of traditional owners had existed since before British settlement.
    The Chamber of Minerals and Energy of Western Australia (CME) said it supported a review of current legislation.
    “CME and its members remain committed to working with Government towards reforms to the Aboriginal Heritage Act that will provide positive, mutually-beneficial outcomes for both industry and Indigenous Australians,” it said in a statement. 
    Rio declined to comment on clauses in its contracts but referred Reuters to an earlier statement. 
    “As a company with strong ties and a long history of partnership with Indigenous Australians we are committed to updating our practices and working together so that we can co-exist for mutual benefit.""  
   
    DEMOLITION OF SITES
    The decision to go ahead with the blast has confounded industry watchers given Rio had developed a strong reputation in the industry for its work with indigenous communities.
    High standards that Rio had set in the past have been eroded by departures of senior archaeologists as social responsibility reporting has become a largely tick-the-box exercise that can be done from an office, said Glynn Cochrane, an anthropologist and former senior advisor for Rio Tinto for nearly two decades.
    “They’ve lost their base. They’re not dealing with communities anymore. They’re not interested in these folks at village level,” said Cochrane, who left Rio Tinto in 2015.
    Rio said its iron ore team had around 100 people doing communities work in the Pilbara, many of whom have been with Rio Tinto for years.
   ""We employ anthropologists, cultural heritage experts, archaeologists and many Indigenous people, many of whom are based at our assets and embedded in our operations,” it said in a statement to Reuters. 
    To be sure, many miners have spent years developing relationships with traditional owner groups. And, besides royalty and tax benefits for governments, mining also drives employment.
    But the too frequent demolition of heritage sites has become a burning issue, particularly with companies under more pressure to show they are supportive of racial justice and acting in the best interests of all stakeholders.
    ""I don’t see family plots or churches demolished at a rate of knots where there is a city development,"" said Nolan Hunter of indigenous land rights group the Kimberley Land Council.
    ""Why would they have a different expectation when it comes to Aboriginal people?""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan is to release more Taliban prisoners in the hope of getting peace talks going, a government spokesman said on Thursday, after the insurgent group provided the government with a revised list of several hundred of their detainees.
Disagreement over about 600 prisoners from a total of 5,000 the Taliban want released has prevented the launch of U.S.-brokered peace talks aimed at ending nearly 19 years of war since the Islamist militants were ousted.
While releases by both sides have taken place, the Afghan government has said it does not want to release some prisoners for security reasons and its Western allies also object to some of them being set free.
""They have given us another list, the release process will continue but direct talks should also start immediately,"" Javid Faisal, spokesman for the National Security Council, told Reuters. 
The Taliban could not be reached for comment and it was not clear if they would be willing to start talks based on the release of the prisoners on the list.
The United States and the Taliban struck a landmark agreement in February on the withdrawal of U.S. forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.
As part of the pact, the Taliban agreed to open power-sharing talks with the U.S.-backed government.
But a senior government official said there was still no agreement on starting the talks. 
""The government will start the process of release in the coming few days and will complete the release whether the Taliban agree or not,"" he said.
A diplomatic source said U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has overseen the negotiations with the Taliban, has been pressing Taliban leaders to compromise on the prisoner issue and there were hopes the hurdle would be overcome.

""Momentum is such that it would not be possible for any side to back out,"" the source said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia said on Thursday it was suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in response to a new security law imposed there and announced measures to attract businesses from the Asian financial hub, provoking an angry response from Beijing.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the law introduced last week in Hong Kong was a fundamental change of circumstances and Australia would suspend the extradition agreement.
""There will be citizens of Hong Kong who may be looking to move elsewhere, to start a new life somewhere else, to take their skills, their businesses,"" Morrison said, outlining changes to visa programmes.
Morrison said Hong Kong students, graduates and workers in Australia on temporary visas will have the opportunity to stay and work for an extra five years and apply for permanent residency after that time.
Future student visas would also be offered for five years, however Morrison said they were ""not expecting large numbers of applicants any time soon"".
Speaking in Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Morrison's government should change course and stop interfering in Chinese affairs, warning that China, the biggest customer for Australian exports, reserved the right to take retaliatory action.
Two-way trade between the countries was worth A$235 billion last year. And the Chinese embassy in Canberra warned earlier that unless Australia stopped meddling ""it will lead to nothing but lifting a rock only to hit its own feet"".
WELCOMING TALENT
There are 10,000 Hong Kong citizens in Australia on student visas or temporary work visas, with a further 2,500 outside Australia and 1,250 applications on hand, according to the government. Hong Kong applicants would be prioritised under Australia's Global Talent Scheme and business visa programme.
""There is so much talent in Hong Kong,"" said Acting Immigration Minister Alan Tudge. ""There are great businesses in Hong Kong. And we know that many individuals now might be looking elsewhere, because they do want to be in a freer country, they want to be in a democratic country.""
Australia offered asylum to some 42,000 Chinese students who were in Australia after a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests Tiananmen Square in 1989.
Imposed after months of mass protests that sometimes resulted in violent clashes between police and pro-democracy supporters, Hong Kong's new security law punishes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. 
BUSINESS PITCH
Morrison also made a pitch for international financial services, consulting and media businesses with regional headquarters in Hong Kong to relocate to Australia, saying his government would proactively encourage that.
He said measures would be accommodated within Australia's existing caps on permanent resident visas, and Hong Kong citizens could also apply to the humanitarian and refugee visa programme.
Hong Kong student Dennis Chan, who attends university in New South Wales and is a spokesman for community group Australia-Hong Kong Link, welcomed the stance taken by Australia.
But, he said some graduates were worried they weren't covered, as many had returned to Hong Kong and were on bridging visas, unable to return to Australia because of COVID-19.
""People who protested in Hong Kong are facing difficulties leaving Hong Kong to come to Australia,"" he told Reuters.
Australia changed its travel advisory for Hong Kong, where around 100,000 Australians live and work, to say ""reconsider your need to remain in Hong Kong"" if they are concerned about the new law.
Canada last week announced it would suspend its extradition treaty with Hong Kong in the wake of the legislation and could boost immigration from the former British colony.

New Zealand said it was also reviewing its relations with Hong Kong, and would review extradition arrangements, controls on exports of strategic goods and travel advice.

ANKARA (Reuters) - A Turkish court is likely to announce on Friday that the 1934 conversion of Istanbul's Hagia Sophia into a museum was unlawful, two Turkish officials said, paving the way for its restoration as a mosque despite international concerns.
President Tayyip Erdogan has proposed restoring the mosque status of the sixth-century UNESCO World Heritage Site, which was central to both the Christian Byzantine and Muslim Ottoman empires and is now one of the most visited monuments in Turkey. 
The prospect of such a move has raised alarm among U.S., Russian and Greek officials and Christian church leaders ahead of a verdict by Turkey's top administrative court, the Council of State, which held a hearing last Thursday.
At issue is the legality of a decision taken in 1934, a decade after the creation of the modern secular Turkish republic under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, to turn the ancient building into a museum. 
""We expect the decision to be an annulment (and) the verdict to come out on Friday,"" a senior Turkish official told Reuters.
An official from Erdogan's ruling AK Party, which has Islamist roots, also said the decision ""in favour of an annulment"" was expected on Friday. 
Pro-government columnist Abdulkadir Selvi wrote in the Hurriyet newspaper that the court had already made the annulment ruling and would publish it on Friday.
""This nation has been waiting for 86 years. The court lifted the chain of bans on Hagia Sophia,"" he wrote. 
The association that brought the case said Hagia Sophia was the property of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II, who in 1453 captured the city, then known as Constantinople, and turned the already 900-year-old Byzantine church into a mosque.
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and based in Istanbul, said a conversion would disappoint Christians and ""fracture"" East and West. The head of Russia's Orthodox Church said it would threaten Christianity.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Greece have also urged Turkey to maintain the museum status. 

But Turkish groups have long campaigned for Hagia Sophia's conversion, saying it would better reflect Turkey's status as an overwhelmingly Muslim country.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, on Thursday sought a court order to stop the publisher of the Mail on Sunday tabloid from publicising the names of five friends who could be witnesses in an ongoing legal dispute, according to a court filing. 
Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers over articles the Mail on Sunday printed last year which included parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018. 
Markle and his daughter have not spoken since he pulled out of appearing at her wedding to Harry in May 2018 after undergoing heart surgery and following news he had staged photos with a paparazzi photographer.
The Mail justified publishing the letter by saying five unnamed friends of Meghan had put her version of events in interviews with the U.S. magazine People.
Her legal team say it was untrue she had authorised or arranged for her friends to tell People about the letter, and on Thursday said Associated Newspapers were threatening to publish their names.
""These five women are not on trial, and nor am I. The publisher of the Mail on Sunday is the one on trial,"" Meghan said in a witness statement to London's High Court reviewed by Reuters.
""Each of these women is a private citizen, young mother, and each has a basic right to privacy,"" she added, saying their names had appeared in a confidential section of her legal papers.
Meghan, Harry and their baby son Archie are living in Los Angeles having stepped down from royal duties at the end of March, partly because of intense media intrusion into their lives.
In documents filed last week as part of Meghan’s privacy case, her lawyers said her friends had spoken out because of the ""tremendous emotional distress and damage to her mental health"" caused by some of ""false"" British tabloid press articles.

In May, the judge in the case rejected part of her claim that the paper had acted dishonestly and stoked the rift with her father. The full trial is not expected until next year.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two Russian activists involved in a campaign against what they say are President Vladimir Putin's illegal plans to remain in power were detained by authorities on Thursday and four others had their homes searched, an anti-Kremlin group said. 
Moscow's Investigative Committee, which looks into serious crimes, and the city's police force did not immediately respond to comment requests.
Activists had planned a protest in central Moscow on July 15 advertised on social media as ""No to an eternal Putin"".
A landslide vote this month handed Putin the right to run for two more presidential terms, an outcome the Kremlin described as a triumph. [nL8N2E82EI] 
Opposition activists say the vote was illegitimate, marred with violations, and that it's time for Putin, who has ruled Russia for over two decades as president or prime minister, to step down.
Mass gatherings are currently banned in the capital due to COVID-19 restrictions and protests of more than one person require authorities' advance consent in normal times. 
Open Russia, a movement founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, said its offices in central Moscow were being searched and that two of its employees, including executive director Andrei Pivovarov, had been detained. 
Pivovarov earlier on Thursday posted a link on Twitter encouraging people to attend next week's protest. 
Yulia Galyamina, a Moscow city councillor, said police arrived at her apartment early on Thursday and threatened to tear down the door if they weren't let in.
""It's because of the campaign against the (constitutional) reforms,"" she told Reuters. ""It's because of the planned protest.""
The homes of Tatiana Usmanova and Olga Gorelik, from Open Russia, were also searched on Tuesday, Open Russia said. 
Sergei Prostakov, editor-in-chief of MBKh Media, a news outlet founded by Khodorkovsky, was also targeted by the searches, his organisation said. 
Alexei Navalny, a prominent opposition figure, said the searches were designed to scare Kremlin critics.
""This is an attempt to demoralise those who are against Putin and publicly punish those who opposed Putin's amendments,"" Navalny wrote on Twitter.

932,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 09, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>",Down but not out: Berlusconi could hold key to Italian government's future,"By Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - He is 83 and has lost most of his former support, but Italy's four-times prime minister Silvio Berlusconi is manoeuvring to put his centre-right Forza Italia party back into government and could make his move as early as September, sources say.
Berlusconi aims to exploit divisions in the ruling coalition over whether Italy should seek a loan from the euro zone's bailout fund which could provide cheap money for its coronavirus-battered health system, say sources close to the media tycoon.
The centre-left Democratic Party (PD) wants Italy to tap the fund, known as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), while the co-ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement is fiercely against the proposal, saying it will pave the way for austerity.
The issue is lacerating the coalition and a 5-Star party source says it could bring down the government when the vote is held, probably in September.
""When it happens, there will be an attempt to form a new majority, and the underlying division in the 5-Star between those who want to stay in government and those who don't will come to light,"" the 5-Star source said.
With the economy reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, the ESM is not the only problem facing the coalition parties, which often quarrel over issues ranging from justice to reform of public tender rules.
Berlusconi's rightist allies, the League and Brothers of Italy, share 5-Star's position on the ESM, but the ex-premier has broken ranks, lining up with the PD and presenting a pro-European image.
""We will vote in favour of the ESM because it is for the good of Italy,"" Berlusconi told daily newspaper Corriere della Sera on Wednesday. He denied any party political motives.
With the political jigsaw increasingly complex, such a scenario could pave the way for a new government centred on the PD and Forza Italia, a mainstream, pro-European option that may go down well with Italy's partners and financial markets.
""NO TABOO"" 
The PD says it wants an open discussion with Forza Italia in the name of their shared commitment to the EU. Former centre-left leader Romano Prodi, who defeated his long-time rival in two national elections, said on Wednesday bringing Berlusconi into government ""should certainly not be seen as a taboo"".
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a technocrat with no party affiliation, has praised Berlusconi's ""constructive"" attitude.
""Conte is telling the 5-Star he is able to find new supporters if they become an obstacle,"" said Giovanni Orsina, director of the School of Government at Rome's Luiss University.
""Berlusconi is allied with the eurosceptics but at the same time he is a pro-European, so he is at the centre of the two political camps,"" Orsina said.
Berlusconi denies seeking a strategic marriage with the PD, his traditional adversary, and says new elections remain his favoured outcome. But with Forza Italia's poll ratings down to around 7%, a senior party source said its members had little appetite for a new vote.
Moreover, with the euro zone's third largest economy set to contract by around 10% this year, a new election is widely considered unlikely due to the risk of political instability.
""If this government collapses, lawmakers from different parties ready to support another coalition to avoid losing their seats would immediately emerge,"" the Forza Italia source said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second-most populous state will relax restrictions on many of the 3,000 people locked down in nine public-housing towers despite surging numbers of COVID-19 cases, state premier Daniel Andrews said on Thursday.
Victoria state on Saturday confined residents of the towers in their homes amid a spike in COVID-19 cases, prompting widespread criticism from residents.
Andrews said that after testing all 3,000 people in the towers, residents in eight of the high-rise buildings would be allowed to leave their homes for essential reasons, the same rules in force throughout the state.
""There are such numbers of positive cases, together with known close contacts, that the assumption has got to be that everybody in that tower is a close contact of someone who is positive,"" Andrews said of the tower that will remain in lockdown.
The relaxation of the rules relieved residents, many of whom have said they have been left without sufficient food and supplies.
""I can't keep my kids anymore inside. I can't, whether they shoot me or not. I don't think I can stay any more here, not allowed even an hour to play outside,"" said Amina Yussuf, an Australian citizen of Somali descent who lives with her seven children in two-bedroom apartment in one of the Melbourne towers for which the strict lockdown is ending.
SECOND LOCKDOWN
Victoria state has imposed broad restrictions on nearly 5 million in an attention to curb the spread of coronavirus, allowing people to leave their homes only to work, buy food or seek medical attention.
Australia has avoided the high casualty numbers of other countries to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has killed 544,055​ people globally, but the outbreak in Victoria has stoked concerns of a second wave nationally.
Other states and territories have recorded few or zero cases in recent weeks and are continuing to reopen their economies, but Prime Minister Scott Morrison told residents not to become complacent.
""We must continue to follow those social distancing protocols all around Australia, even in states or territories where the number of cases is effectively zero,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Many states have shut their borders with Victoria in an attempt to stop COVID-19 from spreading.
The northern state of Queensland said it would ban non-residents arriving from Victoria. It will open its borders to people from other states and territories on Friday. 
Even people travelling from Victoria who were willing to pay for the mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine would be banned, the Queensland government said.
""They are making the decision that that two weeks and that cost is worth it to get out of Victoria,"" deputy premier Stephen Miles said in a televised news conference.
The country's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), closed its heavily trafficked border to neighbouring Victoria on Wednesday. South Australia also closed its border with Victoria.
NSW says anyone arriving from Victoria must self-isolate for 14 days.
The island state of Tasmania kept its border closed to Victoria and extended a state of emergency to the end of August because of the Victorian outbreak. Tasmania itself has not reported a new case in nearly eight weeks.
Western Australia state had closed its border to the rest of Australia indefinitely before the latest outbreak in Victoria.
After enforcing restrictions early in the coronavirus outbreak compared to most other countries, Australia had begun to ease its lockdown in May to revive its economy after a significant slowdown in infection rates.
Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday said the Victoria state lockdown would cost the national economy A$1 billion ($698.5 million) each week.
Australia has so far recorded about 8,900 infections and 106 deaths by Thursday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The United States has stressed the importance of resuming talks with North Korea, South Korea said on Thursday, even though North Korea has said it has no intention of returning to the negotiating table.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who wound up three days of talks in Seoul, earlier rejected speculation he was seeking to meet North Korean officials during his visit, but said the United States was open to talks.
""Biegun emphasised the importance of reopening dialogue with North Korea,"" the office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in said in a statement.
Biegun, the top U.S. envoy on efforts to press North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, met South Korea's national security adviser, Suh Hoon.
Biegun is due to arrive in Japan later on Thursday. 
South Korea has been trying to promote peace efforts and Suh was instrumental in arranging summits between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Trump and Kim met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes for a negotiated end to North Korea's nuclear programme. But their second summit, in 2019 in Vietnam, and later working-level talks, fell apart.
Trump said on Tuesday he was open to another meeting with Kim and thought it might be helpful, Voice of America said, citing a transcript of Trump interview with Gray Television (NYSE:GTN), due to be aired on Sunday.
But North Korea, apparently frustrated that there's been no sign of any easing of punishing sanctions against it, has said in recent weeks it had no intention of sitting down again with the United States.
Tension flared last month when North Korea blew up a joint North-South liaison office on its side of the border, before just as suddenly dropping a threat of military action against the South.

Biegun has led working-level talks with North Korea but the negotiations have been stalled since the two sides last met in Sweden in October.

(Reuters) - The former U.S. police officer charged in the death of George Floyd told him to stop shouting and save his breath as he knelt on his neck and Floyd gasped for air, according to a newly released transcript of police body camera footage.
The death of Floyd, a Black man, in police custody on May 25 led to anti-racism protests and demonstrations against police brutality across the United States and around the world with protesters calling for racial equality and police reforms.
""Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead,"" Floyd said during the nearly nine minutes that the officer knelt on him as he went lifeless. 
Floyd pleaded for help as he was pinned to the ground, according to the transcript made public on Wednesday as part of a motion filed in the Minneapolis state court.
""I'm through, through. I'm claustrophobic. My stomach hurts. My neck hurts. Everything hurts. I need some water or something, please. Please? I can't breathe officer,"" he said.
""You're going to kill me, man,"" Floyd said.
Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd, replied: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling, it takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk.""
Chauvin, who is white, was arrested on May 29, four days after Floyd's death. He has pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree murder and manslaughter. 
Three other former Minneapolis police officers, who are white, Black and Asian American, have been charged with aiding and abetting in the case.
At one point, one of those officers, Thomas Lane, suggested that Chauvin roll Floyd on his side, according to the transcript.
""No, he's staying put where we got him,"" Chauvin responded.
All four of the officers have been fired from the Minneapolis police department. None of them entered a plea during a brief hearing on June 29.

The transcript was made public as part of an effort by Lane's lawyer to have charges that he aided and abetted Floyd's murder thrown out by a judge, according to U.S. media.

China and the United States should jointly explore ways for peaceful coexistence and release more ""positive energy,"" State Councilor Wang, who is also foreign minister, said in a speech posted on his ministry's website.
Washington and Beijing have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, China's actions in the former British colony of Hong Kong, a long-running trade dispute, and frictions over Taiwan and the South China Sea.
""Current U.S. policy towards China is based on strategic misjudgments which lack a factual basis, and is full of emotional outbursts and McCarthyist prejudice,"" he said, referring to an anti-communist witch hunt inspired by a U.S. senator in the 1950s. 
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the world should not permit China's ""bullying"" to take place, highlighting the country's territorial disputes with India, Vietnam, and Japan. 
The two countries should not seek to change each other, said Wang. ""China cannot and will not become another America,"" he said, adding that a socialist system was suited to China and the choice of its people. 
Wang said he hoped the United States would build a more objective understanding of China and formulate a more rational and pragmatic China policy. 
More dialogue, separating out different issues and setting to one side the areas of greatest disagreement, and cooperation in fighting against the coronavirus pandemic would help put bilateral relations on the right track, said Wang.

Despite the soaring figures, Mexico's coronavirus czar, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, said the pandemic was ""slowing.""
The figures pushed Mexico's overall tally of infections to 275,003 cases. Mexico on Wednesday also recorded 782 additional fatalities, bringing its overall death toll to 32,796, the world's fifth highest total.
The government has said the real number of infected people and deaths is likely significantly higher than the confirmed numbers due to low levels of testing.
Lopez-Gatell, the deputy health minister and who spearheads Mexico's coronavirus response, said the new figures do not mean the spread of the virus is accelerating.
""The epidemic in Mexico is slowing down,"" he said, adding that the velocity of the spread was decreasing.
He highlighted progress in Mexico City, the epicenter of the virus. He said despite officials in the capital loosening restrictions and reopening for business two weeks ago, there have been no signals the virus was on the rise.
But he warned the virus remains ""active,"" and citing a rise in infections in Western Europe, said Mexico faces a risk of fresh outbreaks now that it has reopened its economy.

Mexico's previous one-day record was last week on Thursday when 6,741 new cases were registered.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a new book, a niece of President Donald Trump applies her training in psychology to conclude that the president likely suffers from narcissism and other clinical disorders - and was boosted to success by a father who fueled those traits.
In ""Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man,"" Mary Trump writes of a ""malignantly dysfunctional family"" dominated by a patriarch, Fred Trump, who showed little interest in his five children other than grooming an heir for his real-estate business. 
Ultimately, he settled on Donald, she wrote, deciding that his second son's ""arrogance and bullying"" would come in handy at the office, and encouraged it.
""He short-circuited Donald's ability to develop and experience the entire spectrum of human emotion,"" Trump writes. ""Donald requires division. It is the only way he knows how to survive - my grandfather ensured that decades ago when he turned his children against each other.""
The book, due out next Tuesday, is the first Trump biography written by a family member. Reuters obtained a copy of the book. The president's brother Robert has tried unsuccessfully, so far, to block its publication. The court battle continues but is not expected to halt publication.
White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said on Tuesday that it was a ""book of falsehoods."" Its publication comes as Trump, a Republican, seeks a second term in the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Mary Trump has a troubled history with her uncle, who clashed with her father, Fred Jr., before he died at age 42 after a battle with alcoholism. 
Mary and her brother also engaged in a protracted legal battle over Fred Sr.'s estate after his death in 1999. She writes she secretly helped New York Times reporters on a 2018 investigation that outlined how Trump and his siblings avoided millions of dollars in taxes.
Speculation about Trump's mental state is common among his political detractors. Mary Trump brings a different perspective, however, because she has a PhD in psychology and decades of first-hand experience with Trump and his broader family.
""I have no problem calling Donald a narcissist ... but the label gets us only so far,"" she writes, adding that the president might also suffer from other pathologies that prevent him from accepting responsibility for his actions and empathizing with others. She writes that he also may suffer from learning and sleep disorders.
""He knows deep down that he is nothing of what he claims to be,"" she writes. ""He knows he has never been loved.""

939,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 09:11PM ET</span>","With apps and remote medicine, Japan offers glimpse of doctor visits in post-corona era","By Kaori Kaneko and Izumi Nakagawa
TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis has prompted Japan to ease regulations on remote medical treatment, creating an opening for tech companies and offering a glimpse of the future of healthcare in the world's most rapidly ageing society.
As coronavirus cases spiked in April, Japan temporarily eased restrictions on remote medical care, allowing doctors to conduct first-time visits online or by telephone and expanding the number of illnesses that can be treated remotely.
The changes mark a potential shake-up in one of the world's biggest medical markets, which has lagged countries like Australia, China, and the United States in telemedicine. The reforms could also help Japan grapple with both a skyrocketing healthcare burden and few doctors in rural areas. 
Previously Japanese doctors were only allowed to treat recurring patients remotely, and for a limited number of diseases. 
The rapid pace of change caught executives at Line Corp off guard, forcing Japan's most popular social networking service to accelerate plans for the roll-out of its Line Healthcare business in the coming months.
""The effect that COVID-19 brought was a huge innovation in the healthcare industry,"" said Shinichiro Muroyama, representative director of Line Healthcare. ""The situation has totally changed, much more rapidly than we thought."" 
Line, which says it has 84 million users in Japan, aims to link doctors and patients by video. 
Homegrown medical start-ups such as Medley Inc and MICIN Inc say they have also seen a surge in demand. Both companies offer application services for appointments, video consultations and payments.
Telehealth, or telemedicine, refers to technology that includes online consultations, cloud-based medical records, remote monitoring of patients and use of artificial intelligence to screen for diseases.
Japan's market for such technology is set to grow by 60% to nearly 20 billion yen ($185 million) in the five years to March 2024, according to the Yano Research Institute.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made deregulating the medical industry part of his growth strategy.
BETTER OUTCOMES
So Ishii, a doctor who runs a clinic in Tokyo that started offering telehealth in 2017, has seen a jump in online consultations since the outbreak, with 600 patients using the service as of mid-June compared to 400 two months earlier.
Ishii said telehealth could lead to better treatment for patients with lifestyle-related diseases that require continuous attention because it gave them easier access to doctors. Such ailments typically include diabetes and high-blood pressure.
""Ideally, medical care should be designed to provide necessary support for patients regardless of whether it is online or on site,"" he said.
About 16,100 Japanese medical institutions excluding dentists - nearly 15% of all such facilities - offered remote medical services, including by telephone, as of early July, according to the health ministry. 
That marks substantial growth since July 2018, when only 970 medical institutions were registered to offer online care.
Still, the health ministry has not decided whether to make the changes permanent, while the national medical association is less than enthusiastic, citing concerns about misdiagnosis.
""We should be extremely cautious about using evidence drawn from telemedicine in the emergency situation for consideration of how it should be after the coronavirus infection wanes,"" Japan Medical Association President Toshio Nakagawa told Reuters. He was vice-president at the time of the interview.
Analysts say telehealth can also put smaller clinics at a financial disadvantage.
Goichiro Toyoda, representative director and a medical doctor at Medley, agrees doctors can better check first-time patients in person but says telehealth suits patients who want second opinions, have trouble visiting hospitals or need long-term treatments. 
""Telemedicine will not replace face-to-face treatment,"" said Toyoda. ""But I've been stressing the importance of it becoming an option.""

Omar Prieto was admitted on Tuesday night to a private clinic near Zulia's capital of Maracaibo where he is receiving preventative treatment while he awaits the results of a COVID-19 test, according to two of the sources.
A positive test result would underscore the severity of the outbreak in Zulia, which borders neighboring Colombia, and signal that high-ranking officials in Maduro's government are at risk in the pandemic.
Prieto's press office and Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Zulia has been among states hardest hit by Venezuela's crumbling power and water services, hampering efforts to maintain basic sanitation even in hospitals.
Officials say many of the cases originated in a sprawling food market known as the Maracaibo Flea Market that has long been known for its overcrowding and poor sanitation. 
Maduro in a televised broadcast on Wednesday announced 317 new cases of the virus, taking the total to 8,010. 
He did not mention Prieto.
The ruling Socialist Party says Venezuela has handled the outbreak better than other Latin American nations, and that most of the country's cases come from Venezuelan migrants returning from Colombia and Brazil. 
Opposition leaders have questioned the official figures, pointing to a lack of transparency in reporting cases and persecution of journalists and health workers who question official data.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New Jersey adopted a stringent coronavirus face-mask order on Wednesday, and New York City unveiled a plan to allow public school students back into classrooms for just two or three days a week, as COVID-19 cases soared elsewhere in the United States.
Officials in New Jersey and New York, the hardest-hit states at the outset of the U.S. outbreak, want to preserve progress against the virus in the face of its resurgence elsewhere, primarily the U.S. South and West.
More than 47,000 people have perished from COVID-19 in the two northeastern states, accounting for more than a third of the U.S. death toll of more than 132,000, according to a Reuters tally.
New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy unveiled an executive order requiring face coverings outdoors where social distancing was not possible, saying the measure was necessary because of a rise in the state's coronavirus transmission rate.
""Wearing a face covering, I remind you, is not about politics. It's about quite simply being sick or healthy. It's about life and death,"" Murphy, a Democrat, said at a briefing.
Many states require masks in public indoor settings and recommend them outside, but have stopped short of mandating their use outdoors.
""I think that's the right thing to do,"" said Jordan Grant, 23, a real estate accountant who expressed dismay at seeing groups still congregating outside restaurants or at backyard barbecues without masks. ""It's what we should have been doing months ago.""
Republican state Senator Mike Doherty, however, accused the New Jersey governor of ""exploiting a public health crisis for power,"" calling the new mask directive ""oppressive.""
In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a plan for 1.1 million students in the nation's largest public school district to return to classes in September. Pupils would alternate attending school two or three days weekly and spend the remaining time at home. 
'BACK TO SCHOOL'
Republican President Donald Trump, who has exhorted Americans to return to their daily routines, threatened to cut off federal funding to schools that fail to reopen on their normal schedule due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
States are chiefly responsible for primary and secondary education, but the federal government provides some supplementary funding.
Vice President Mike Pence said the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would soon issue new back-to-school protocols after Trump criticized current recommendations as too strict and costly. But Pence stressed that CDC guidelines are advisory.
Coronavirus cases have been on the rise in 42 of the 50 states over the past two weeks, according to a Reuters analysis. The percentage of people testing positive among those who are screened has climbed above 5% - to levels health experts deem concerning - in some two dozen states.
On Tuesday, the number of confirmed U.S. cases crossed the 3 million mark, roughly equivalent to 1% of the population and about 25% of all known infections worldwide. 
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who faces Trump in a Nov. 3 election, described the grim milestone as ""awful"" and ""avoidable."" He accused Trump of putting the nation in a precarious spot by not ramping up testing and deliveries of protective equipment.
The virus, which first surfaced in China late last year, is sweeping through a number of heavily populated states, including California, Florida and Texas. Twenty states have reported record increases in cases this month.
Houston, the largest city in Texas and the U.S. oil industry's hub, registered more than 1,000 new cases on Tuesday, a single-day record, Mayor Sylvester Turner tweeted on Wednesday, calling the spread ""severe and uncontrolled.""
Turner, a Democrat, ordered the cancellation of a Texas Republican Party convention scheduled for July 16-18 in Houston, citing public health concerns.
The surge has forced authorities to backpedal on moves to reopen businesses, such as restaurants and bars, after mandatory closures reduced economic activity to a virtual standstill in March and April and put millions of Americans out of work.
Health officials worry hospitals will be inundated with COVID-19 patients, leading to a spike in deaths. 

In Arizona, one of the latest epicenters of the U.S. outbreak, 91 percent of all adult intensive care unit beds are occupied, the state health department said on Wednesday.

""The Zoological Society of London has made an outstanding contribution to conservation and our understanding of wildlife for 200 years,"" said Attenborough, noting that the two zoos are home to over 20,000 animals, some of them endangered.
""The national institution is now itself at risk of extinction,"" said Attenborough, 94, who is famed worldwide for his documentaries on the natural world.
The ZSL has lost vital income after the coronavirus pandemic forced its zoos to close for the first time since World War Two, he said, urging people to make donations via the link zsl.org/justgiving.
In a separate press release, ZSL director Dominic Jermey said the zoos would be unable to recoup the money lost even though they have now been allowed to reopen, due to social distancing measures and heavily restricted visitor numbers.
""Unlike any other UK zoo, our zoos are the lifeline for ground-breaking research at the world-renowned ZSL Institute of Zoology and fund our global conservation projects – work that has never been more vital,"" he said.

The research includes looking into how diseases such as coronaviruses transfer from wildlife to humans, he added.

The evening before, violence erupted when a crowd stormed parliament in protest at plans to reimpose a lockdown following a new spike in COVID-19 cases. Forty-three police officers and 17 protesters were injured and there were 23 arrests.
Hours before Wednesday's protest, President Aleksandar Vucic called on people to stop attending anti-government rallies to avoid a further spread of the coronavirus, warning there were no beds left in hospitals.
""There are no free beds in our hospitals. We will open new hospitals,"" he said in an address to the nation. He accused far-right groups and unspecified regional ""intelligence officials"" of orchestrating riots to ""undermine Serbia's position"".
Most of the protesters on Wednesday evening wore face masks, blew whistles and shouted ""Vucic leave!"" as they faced off with riot police guarding the parliament complex. Some threw stones and flares at police who responded with volleys of tear gas.
Protesters also skirmished with police in the northern city of Novi Sad. 
Although he had on Tuesday said a new lockdown would be imposed in Belgrade this weekend, Vucic said on Wednesday he had ultimately advised the government and health authorities not to introduce it. The government will announce a new set of restrictive measures on Thursday, he said.
Serbia, a country of 7 million, has reported 17,076 COVID-19 cases and 341 deaths. Health authorities say hospitals are running at full capacity and staff are exhausted. The number of new infections rose to 357 on Wednesday from 299 on Tuesday. 
Critics say the government's decisions to allow soccer matches, religious festivities, parties and private gatherings to resume, and parliamentary elections to go ahead on June 21, are to blame for the new surge in infections. 

The government blames a lack of sanitary discipline among the public, especially in nightclubs.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft urged her Security Council counterparts on Wednesday to oppose a Russian bid to cut border access for aid deliveries to millions of Syrian civilians, describing the choice as ""good versus evil.""
Russia and China cast vetoes on Tuesday to block the 15-member council from extending its approval for a year of aid deliveries to Syria from Turkey through two border crossings. Russia then put forward its own text that would only approve one of those crossings for aid access for six months.
""This is a good versus evil, this is a right versus wrong and it is the right thing to do to vote against the Russian text,"" Craft told Reuters. ""It is the right thing to do to really work toward having the two border crossings remain open.""
""We're talking about the difference between life and death for millions of Syrians,"" she said.
Russia and China have argued that cross-border aid deliveries are not needed as those areas can be accessed from within Syria. 
The more than six-year long cross-border aid operation is currently authorized until Friday, so if the Russian resolution fails to pass another council member could put forward a new proposal for a vote. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain.
During the coronavirus pandemic the council has been operating virtually, which means members have 24 hours to cast a vote on a draft resolution. The result of the vote on the Russian text will be announced later on Wednesday. 
Craft said she had been lobbying her council counterparts - all of whom voted in favor of the draft resolution vetoed by Russia and China on Tuesday - as had Russia and China.
Craft accused Russia and China of wanting to end all cross-border humanitarian assistance for Syria in an effort to help ""prop-up"" Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government. 

A crackdown by Syrian Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Moscow backing Assad and Washington supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions are internally displaced.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Amadou Gon Coulibaly, Ivory Coast's prime minister and the ruling party's candidate for an October presidential election, died on Wednesday, President Alassane Ouattara said.
The 61-year-old Gon Coulibaly, who had heart surgery in 2012, became unwell during a weekly cabinet meeting and was evacuated to a hospital where he passed away, Ouattara said in a statement read on national television. 
Gon Coulibaly had returned to Ivory Coast last Thursday after two months in France to undergo a heart exam and rest.
""Fellow compatriots, Ivory Coast is mourning. It is with deep pain that I announce to you that Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly has left us,"" Ouattara said in a statement read by the presidency's secretary general. 
Gon Coulibaly's death is likely to set off a scramble within the ruling RHDP party to replace him as its candidate in an election that is considered a key test of stability for the world's top cocoa producer. 
Ouattara's first win in 2010 over incumbent Laurent Gbagbo sparked a brief civil war in which about 3,000 people died, and political tensions have been rising ahead of October's poll. 

Ouattara designated Gon Coulibaly as the RHDP candidate in March after announcing that he would not seek a third term.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the Security Council on Wednesday that the conflict in Libya has entered a new phase with ""unprecedented levels"" of foreign interference and mercenaries in the oil-producing country.
Libya descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, it has been split, with an internationally recognized government controlling the capital, Tripoli, and the northwest, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey.
""The conflict has entered a new phase with foreign interference reaching unprecedented levels, including in the delivery of sophisticated equipment and the number of mercenaries involved in the fighting,"" Guterres said. 
Russian private military contractor Wagner Group has up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya, strengthening Haftar's forces, according to a confidential May report by independent sanctions monitors to the U.N. Security Council Libya sanctions committee.
""We continue to oppose all foreign military intervention in Libya,"" said U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft. ""There is no place for foreign mercenaries or proxy forces in Libya, including ... Russian government proxies.""
Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected the accusations of Russian involvement in Libya. 
""But we know about other countries' military personnel, including from those countries that accuse us, to be present on Libyan soil, East and West,"" he told the council, calling on all states with influence on the Libyan parties to push for a truce. 
United Arab Emirates minister for foreign affairs, Anwar Gargash, told the council there were ""roughly 10,000 Syrian mercenaries operating in Libya, approximately twice as many as there were six months ago."" 
The warring parties are currently mobilizing forces at the new frontlines between the cities of Misrata and Sirte. Egypt has warned that any Turkish-backed effort to take Sirte could lead its army to directly intervene.
""We are very concerned about the alarming military build-up around the city, and the high-level of direct foreign interference in the conflict in violation of the U.N. arms embargo, U.N. Security Council resolutions, and commitments made by Member States in Berlin,"" Guterres said. 
Guterres said that between April and June this year the U.N. mission has documented at least 102 civilians deaths and 254 civilians injuries - a 172% increase compared to the first quarter of 2020. He said there had also been at least 21 attacks on medical facilities, ambulances and medical personnel.

Guterres also called on the Security Council to take action over the obstruction by several key national officials of an international audit of the Central Bank of Libya.

951,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Explainer: Why is the new U.S. policy for international students causing backlash from colleges?,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The administration of President Donald Trump issued new rules this week that could force tens of thousands of international students to leave the United States if their schools hold all classes online amid the coronavirus pandemic, causing panic among colleges and foreign students.
Two of the country's most elite universities, Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), sued to try to stop the rule, and the attorney general of Massachusetts, which is home to both schools and numerous other colleges and universities, signaled her state was likely to bring a legal challenge as well.
Here is what is known so far:
WHAT IS THE NEW POLICY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS?
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said Monday it would not allow holders of certain student visas to remain in the country if their school courses were fully online for the fall. 
The guidance exempts students at schools with full-time in-person instruction, as well as most students attending schools with a blended curriculum of in-person and online learning if those programs are approved by ICE.
Students enrolled in online-only programs must transfer to institutions with at least some in-person study or leave the country. If not, they could potentially face deportation.
Existing U.S. regulations limit online instruction for foreign students to one class or three credits per semester. But ICE implemented temporary rules in March due to the pandemic that allowed academic institutions to move classes fully online amid public health lockdowns around the country.
When ICE issued the March guidance, the agency said it would remain in effect ""for the duration of the emergency.""
WHY DO THE NEW RULES MATTER?
There are more than a million foreign students at U.S. colleges and universities, and many schools depend on revenue from foreign students, who often pay full tuition.
The new rules mean that potentially tens of thousands of international students in the United States on F-1 and M-1 visas could be faced with the prospect of having to leave the country mid-pandemic if their schools go fully online. Some academic institutions have said they will try to comply with the new guidelines so students will be able to remain in the United States.
Reuters spoke with a dozen students attending schools across the United States who described feeling devastated and confused by the Trump administration's announcement.
HOW ARE UNIVERSITIES REACTING?
Harvard and MIT filed a lawsuit in federal court on Wednesday, asking a judge to temporarily block the rule and invalidate it.
Harvard and MIT, which had previously announced they would move most of their 2020 classes online, argued in the lawsuit that the new rule threw their operations, and the operations of ""virtually all of higher education in the United States,"" into chaos. 
Several universities said Tuesday that they were reviewing ICE's new guidance and would develop a hybrid model of online and in-person classes in an attempt to meet the requirements.
WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE POLICY CHANGE?
ICE did not offer a reason for the change, but an agency spokeswoman said a working group that included officials from U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the Department of State had developed the plan.
The move aligns with a recent Trump administration push to reopen public schools in the fall, a step favored by business groups and conservatives despite surging caseloads in nearly two dozen states.
During a White House roundtable on school reopenings on Tuesday, Trump criticized a decision by Harvard to conduct courses online in the upcoming academic year, calling it ""ridiculous"" and ""an easy way out.""
IS THE MOVE PART OF TRUMP'S TOUGH IMMIGRATION STANCE?
Opponents contend Trump has used the health crisis as a pretext to enact his hawkish immigration agenda and said the latest move was just another part of that effort.
Trump has enacted a number of sweeping immigration restrictions during the pandemic, including a shutdown of non-essential travel across the borders with Canada and Mexico, a rule to swiftly deport immigrants caught crossing the border illegally and a suspension of many guest worker visas.
Advocates for lower levels of immigration have pressed Trump to limit the ability of foreign students to work in the United States, as well.

Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security ,said Tuesday that ""there isn't a reason for a person holding a student visa to be present in the country"" if campuses do not hold in-person classes

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan said it invited India on Wednesday to file a review against a military court's death sentence last year on former Indian navy commander Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav on charges of espionage and sabotage.
India had asked the United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) to intervene, calling the Pakistani trial unfair. The court ordered Islamabad last summer to conduct an ""effective review"" of the ruling, saying a ""continued stay of execution"" was needed for that to happen.
""While Commander Jadhav's mercy petition is still pending, India is invited to file review and reconsideration petition to give effect to the Judgment of the International Court of Justice (ICJ),"" Pakistan's foreign ministry said in a statement.
India responded that Pakistan was dragging its feet on the world court's order in letter and spirit.
""Despite our repeated requests, Pakistan continues to deny India free and unimpeded access to Shri Jadhav,"" India's external affair ministry said in a statement.
The ministry said India had repeatedly asked to allow a lawyer from outside Pakistan to appear for any review and reconsideration proceedings, but ""Pakistan has denied it."" 
Islamabad said Jadhav was arrested early 2016 in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan, where nationalist and separatists groups have long waged a low level insurgency demanding a larger share in the mineral rich region's resources.
Islamabad accuses India of backing the separatists groups, a charge New Delhi denies. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has blamed India for last month's attack on the Karachi stock exchange, which one of the separatist groups claimed to have launched.
The two South Asian nations have fought three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Catalonia on Wednesday ordered all residents and visitors to wear face masks in public at all times, becoming the first Spanish region to toughen a national directive mandating their use when in close proximity to others.
The order, which takes effect on Thursday, was announced by regional leader Quim Torra four days after more than 200,000 people in the Segria area were placed under a local lockdown following a series of coronavirus outbreaks there.
""Masks will be mandatory all over Catalonia, not just in the Segria region... I think it's an important measure,"" Torra told the regional parliament. ""We will distribute protective equipment.""
Another Spanish region took a similar decision shortly afterwards. Authorities in the Basque Country made masks mandatory regardless of the distance between people in the small town of Ordizia, where another cluster of nearly 50 cases has been detected, said the region's health counsellor.
Spanish authorities last month made wearing masks compulsory indoors and outdoors in all circumstances in which 1.5 metres (5 ft) of social distancing could not be maintained, and until a coronavirus cure or vaccine is found.
Torra's order removed that social distancing exception for Catalonia, making masks compulsory in all social situations.
The tougher measure aims to stave off a relaxation in attitudes towards the virus observed among some citizens, officials said.
100 EURO FINE
Masks will be mandatory in Catalonia for people above six years old outdoors and in any indoors space open to the public regardless of the physical distance between people, regional government spokeswoman Meritxell Budo told a press briefing.
Breaking this obligation will result in a 100 euro fine, she added. 
The pandemic has hit Spain harder than most other European countries, causing more than 28,000 deaths and close to 270,000 infections, according to official data.

In Italy, also badly affected, the same strict mask-wearing rules are in effect until July 14 in regional COVID-19 epicentre Lombardy. Elsewhere in the country, wearing masks is not obligatory outside for those who can keep a safe distance from others.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci said he will travel to the Netherlands on July 13 to be interviewed by international prosecutors following his indictment for war crimes and crimes against humanity over his role in its independence conflict.
On June 24 a special prosecutor’s office in The Hague dealing with Kosovo's 1998-99 uprising against Serbian rule said it had indicted Thaci, former parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli and others for murder, enforced disappearances, persecution and torture.
Both Thaci and Veseli, who served as top commanders in the former Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), have denied the accusations.
""I would like to share with you that on Monday I will also travel to The Hague, invited by the Specialist Prosecutor’s Office, to be interviewed,"" Thaci said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
""While my compatriots as well as me will face international justice with dignity and integrity, I call upon you to stand united in dealing with the challenges that our country is facing.""
The Specialist Chamber was set up in The Hague in 2015 to handle cases of alleged crimes by KLA guerrillas during the war that led to Kosovo’s independence from Serbia a decade later.
Some 250 people have so far been interviewed.
The indictments against Thaci and Veseli are not final and a judge will now take several months to decide whether the cases built by the special prosecutor’s office are strong enough to put them on trial or not.
The indictments of Thaci, Veseli and others also include nearly 100 murders.
The Specialist Chamber is governed by Kosovo law but is staffed by international judges and prosecutors.

Local efforts to investigate alleged KLA war crimes have so far been foiled by widespread intimidation in Kosovo, a poor country where clan loyalties run deep and former rebels are seen as liberators.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused China of taking ""incredibly aggressive action"" in a recent clash with India over a disputed section of the nuclear-armed neighbors' border, saying Beijing had a pattern of instigating territorial disputes.
On the night of June 15, Chinese forces and Indian troops fought for hours with rods and clubs, a dramatic escalation that left 20 Indian soldiers killed, with some falling to their deaths in the freezing waters of the Galwan river in the western Himalayas.
On Monday, Indian government sources said China began pulling back troops from along the border with India, after weeks of talks between senior military officials on how to ease tensions. China has yet to confirm whether it suffered casualties but the Indian deaths were the highest along the border in more than five decades.
""The Chinese took incredibly aggressive action. The Indians have done their best to respond to that,"" Pompeo said in a news conference at the State Department. ""I’d put this in the context of General Secretary Xi Jinping and his behavior throughout the region, and indeed, throughout the world."" 
""From the mountain ranges of the Himalayas to the waters of Vietnam's Exclusive Zone, to the Senkaku Islands, and beyond, Beijing has a pattern of instigating territorial disputes. The world shouldn’t allow this bullying to take place, nor should it permit it to continue,"" Pompeo said.
His comments reflect the deep running tensions between Washington and Beijing, which have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, China's actions in the former British colony of Hong Kong and a nearly two-year trade dispute between the U.S. and China.
The Chinese military on Monday was seen dismantling tents and structures at a site in the Galwan valley near where the latest clash took place, said the Indian government sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Poles will vote in a knife-edge run-off vote on Sunday, which pits President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski of the centrist Civic Platform (PO).
Duda, seeking a second, five-year term, has previously accused international media of misrepresenting his words.
His camp also reacted furiously to coverage in a partly German-owned Polish tabloid of a presidential pardon granted in a paedophilia case, suggesting Germany may be seeking to meddle in the election. 
""In connection with a sequence of articles in German media using manipulation and creating a clear impression of favouring one of the candidates... I today summoned the German charge d'affaires to the Foreign Ministry,"" Deputy Foreign Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek wrote on Twitter.
A spokeswoman for the German embassy in Warsaw confirmed that the charge d'affaires had been summoned.
Szynkowski vel Sek did not specify which articles he was referring to. The Polish foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""The German government of course does not try to influence the Polish presidential election,"" said Steffen Seibert, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday.
""And of course the German government does not influence the work of correspondents in Germany or abroad,"" he added. 
PiS has long said it would like less foreign ownership of private media in Poland, accusing such outlets of anti-Polish bias.
It has annoyed Germany - Poland's biggest trade partner and a NATO ally - with repeated calls for war reparations over the Nazi occupation of Poland in World War Two. Germany says all financial claims linked to the war have been settled.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology sued the Trump administration on Wednesday, seeking to block a new rule that would bar foreign students from remaining in the United States if their universities move all courses online due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The two universities filed a lawsuit in federal court in Boston asking for an emergency temporary restraining order on the new directive issued by the government on Monday. 
""We will pursue this case vigorously so that our international students - and international students at institutions across the country - can continue their studies without the threat of deportation,"" Harvard President Lawrence Bacow wrote in a statement addressed to the Harvard community.
The lawsuit, filed by two of the most elite U.S. universities, is the first to challenge the order that could force tens of thousands of foreign students to leave the country if their schools switch fully to remote learning. 
Harvard had announced it would hold all classes online in the coming fall term. 
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said in a statement the state was also planning to sue over the rule, which she called ""cruel"" and ""illegal."" 
Her office said it was still working out the details of any potential legal action but that it had been in touch with Harvard and other major colleges and universities in the state to ""support their efforts to protect students.""
The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing schools across the country to re-open in the fall.
The Trump administration announcement blindsided academic institutions grappling with the logistical challenges of safely resuming classes as the coronavirus pandemic continues unabated around the world, and surges in the United States, especially among young people.
There are more than a million foreign students at U.S. colleges and universities, and many schools depend on revenue from foreign students, who often pay full tuition. 
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agency rule said most students on F-1 and M-1 visas could stay if their programs were in person or offered a mix of online and in-person instruction.
The announcement left students, professors, and universities scrambling to figure out exactly who would be affected by the rule and how those affected could comply without having to leave the country. On Twitter, professors across the country offered to teach outdoor in-person independent study courses for affected students.
The ICE policy change marked an unexpected reversal of exceptions to the rules limiting online learning for foreign students when colleges and universities in March rushed to shutter campuses and move to virtual classes as the pandemic forced lockdowns.
ICE ""proceeded without any indication of having considered the health of students, faculty, university staff, or communities,"" the complaint said. 
The suit alleges the government skirted the proper rulemaking process and is asking the court to strike it down.

Judge Allison Burroughs, appointed by former President Barack Obama, is assigned to hear the case. In 2017, she ordered a halt to Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries, a policy that was eventually upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.

(Reuters) - A Los Angeles cafe has filled its parking lot with individual greenhouse dining pods to help diners feel safe during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The Lady Byrd Cafe in the city's trendy Echo Park neighborhood closed its doors at the start of the pandemic in March. 
When outdoor dining was allowed to resume, owner Misty Mansouri was ready, having transformed the restaurant's blacktop parking lot into a garden filled with flowers, herbs and plants with private glass cabins.
The investment has paid off as the governor has once again banned indoor dining in much of the state, having allowed restricted openings in late May, after coronavirus cases broke records and hospitalizations rose 50% in two weeks. 
Mansouri said the pods, which have windows to allow air flow, are cleaned and sanitized after each use and comply with guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
""The CDC guidelines are really you just have to be six feet apart, right? I just went the extra step to make sure that people feel extra comfortable,"" she said. ""Many of the people who have dined here, this has been their first experience and they feel super-safe.""
Mansouri was inspired by images of similar dining spaces in Europe. Dutch restaurant ETEN introduced glass dining huts on its waterside patio in May. 
Thessa Villegas, 34, who convinced her reluctant friend Rebecca High to go out for lunch by showing her the greenhouses on the cafe's website, called the experience the ""holy grail of dining.""
""I think this is amazing. This is what I think we have needed for a very long time in merging that safety plus the whole experiencing social interaction,"" she said.
The only drawback to the pods, Mansouri said, is that, although they have roof windows and fans, they can get warm inside during the heat of a Los Angeles summer day. 

""They're really lovely in the evening and they're really lovely in the morning,"" she said.

The 7-2 decision embraced a broad interpretation of the ""ministerial exception,"" a legal doctrine recognized by the Supreme Court in a 2012 case that bars ministers or people in similar roles from suing religious institutions for workplace bias. The court blocked two teachers from pursuing lawsuits accusing the two Catholic elementary schools in California of discrimination based upon age and disability.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, said there was ""abundant"" evidence that the two teachers performed ""vital religious duties"" and therefore fell under the exception.
""Educating and forming students in the Catholic faith lay at the core of the mission of the schools where they taught,"" Alito wrote.
President Donald Trump's administration sided with the schools, saying the ministerial exception should apply to any employee of a religious organization who performs an important religious function.
The ruling could strip more than 300,000 lay teachers working in religious schools of employment law protections and could impact industries including nurses in Catholic hospitals, the plaintiffs said in a court filing.
In a dissent, liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the decision had ""no basis in law and strips thousands of schoolteachers of their legal protections.""
The teachers ""taught primarily secular subjects, lacked substantial religious titles and training, and were not even required to be Catholic,"" Sotomayor wrote in the dissent, which was joined by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
At issue was the breadth of a ""ministerial exception"" that protects religious organizations from employee suits alleging violations of laws such as Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars employers from discriminating against employees on grounds including sex, race, national origin and religion.
The ministerial exemption was grounded in the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of religious freedom, language meant to prevent government interference with religion.
The ruling arose from separate lawsuits brought by teachers Agnes Morrissey-Berru and Kristen Biel against two private schools that operate under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles.
Biel accused St. James School in Torrance of unlawfully dismissing her when she requested time off to undergo surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer. Biel died last year but her husband has continued the litigation on her behalf. 
Morrissey-Berru brought an age discrimination case against Our Lady of Guadalupe School in Hermosa Beach after being told in 2015, just before her 65th birthday, that her contract would not be renewed. 
Morrissey-Berru and Biel taught their students religion several days a week in addition to secular subjects.
Federal judges concluded that the ministerial exception barred both claims. The San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals subsequently ruled that both lawsuits could proceed.

In a separate dispute affecting religious schools, the court on June 30 endorsed Montana tax credits that helped pay for students to attend religious schools, a decision paving the way for more public funding of faith-based institutions.

Monaco's appeals court in December ordered the closure of a preliminary investigation opened by local authorities into art dealer Yves Bouvier in 2016 in response to a complaint brought by Dmitry Rybolovlev. 
Rybolovlev is the wealthy owner of Monaco's soccer team, who in 2008 bought an oceanfront property in Palm Beach, Florida, from Donald Trump.
The Monaco Court of Revision confirmed the decision to cancel ""all criminal proceedings against Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier"", Bouvier's lawyers said in a statement.
However, Bouvier still faces criminal proceedings brought by Rybolovlev in Geneva, where he is also charged with fraud, abuse of trust and money laundering, Rybolovlev's lawyers said.
Rybolovlev's lawyers have accused Bouvier of telling the oligarch's family companies that he had negotiated a high price for artworks when ""in fact he had already negotiated - for himself - a price much lower"" than the payments he collected. 
Bouvier's lawyers said that the art dealer has always respected the law and the binding nature of his contracts.

General Kenneth McKenzie's visit to Beirut, a big recipient of U.S. military aid, comes after Hezbollah stepped up criticism of U.S. ambassador Dorothy Shea on Tuesday, accusing her of blatant interference in Lebanese affairs.
Lebanon is in throes of an acute financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war. 
The heavily armed Hezbollah, founded by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is classified as a terrorist group by the United States. It is also a major player in Lebanese politics and backs the government of Prime Minister Hassan Diab.
A U.S. embassy statement said McKenzie ""reaffirmed the importance of preserving Lebanon’s security, stability, and sovereignty...""
Several dozen protesters, some waving Hezbollah flags, gathered at Beirut airport in a protest which the group's al-Manar TV said carried several messages against Washington.
These included a rejection of a U.S. embassy plan to hold a memorial for 241 U.S. service personnel killed in 1983 by a bomb attack in Beirut during McKenzie's visit, an al-Manar broadcaster said.
The U.S. embassy statement said McKenzie's one-day visit included ""a brief stop at memorials honouring the memory of those who have perished in service to their country"". 
The United States says Hezbollah carried out the 1983 attack, which was preceded by the bombing of the U.S. embassy in Beirut. 
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, in a speech on Tuesday night, said Shea had intervened in official appointments at the central bank, calling this ""colonial"" behaviour. 

Shea has said the appointments were a matter for Lebanon to decide and she tried her best to convey the importance of credible and internationally respected experts being appointed.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday described corruption allegations surrounding former King Juan Carlos as disturbing after several media published details relating to an investigation into possible payments linked to a rail contrcat.
""There are worrying allegations that disturb everyone, myself included,"" Sanchez said at a news conference with his Italian counterpart Giuseppe Conte. 
In June, Spain's Supreme Court opened an investigation into Juan Carlos' involvement with a high-speed rail contract in Saudi Arabia after Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper reported he had received $100 million from the late Saudi King. 
Through his lawyer, Juan Carlos, 82, has repeatedly declined to comment on the allegations.
Over the past week, several Spanish media published further details of that transfer. 
""There are media that won't look the other way, a judiciary that is taking action and the Palace is distancing itself,"" Sanchez said.
Spanish monarchs have immunity during their reign but Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014, making way for his son Felipe's ascension to the throne and potentially leaving him vulnerable to prosecution. 
King Felipe put an end to his father's palace allowance and renounced his inheritance in March, following the allegations of secret offshore accounts.
Juan Carlos came to the throne in 1975 after the death of General Francisco Franco and was widely respected for his role in helping guide Spain from dictatorship to democracy.
But his popularity sank in later years, harmed but such episodes as an elephant hunting trip to Africa and a corruption scandal invoving his daughter Cristina and her husband, leading him to step down.

The Geneva prosecutor's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Benedict's long-serving private secretary Archbishop Georg Gaenswein choked back tears as he read the tribute, which recalled Ratzinger's dedication to leading the famed cathedral choir in Regensburg, southern Germany, for 30 years.
""This service was a great joy to him,"" the 93-year-old Benedict wrote, expressing gratitude that he had been able to pay his brother a final visit in June. It was Benedict's first trip outside Italy since 2013, the year he resigned the papacy.
""He did not ask me to visit him, but I could feel that the time had come to travel to him once again,"" Benedict said in his message.
The choir, the Regensburg Domspatzen - or Cathedral Sparrows - performed at the funeral service, where Rudolf Voderholzer, bishop of Regensburg, recalled Ratzinger's early musical gift and his three decades of directing the Cathedral choir.
In his later years, Ratzinger faced criticism after allegations surfaced of choirboys having been abused by other staff there. Ratzinger always denied any knowledge of the abuse. 
He and his brother entered a seminary to train as priests at the same time in January 1946 after both serving in the army before Nazi Germany's defeat at the end of World War Two. 
Even following Benedict's elevation to the papacy in 2005, the brothers remained in close touch, with Georg telling the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that his brother would regularly call him on a private phone whose number only the Pontiff knew.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Homicides in El Salvador fell over 50% in President Nayib Bukele's first year in office, with officials citing tougher enforcement, while a study on Wednesday suggests gangs may have eased up on violence and made informal deals with authorities.
Homicides were already in decline in El Salvador, which has recently had one of the world's highest murder rates, when Bukele took office in June 2019. 
From then through May, murders fell 51.3% from the prior year, official data show. During the first half of 2020, homicides decreased 62.5% compared with 2019, touching historic lows. 
Bukele has attributed the improvement to an increased police and military presence on the streets, and tighter security in jails controlled by the powerful Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 gangs.
Nevertheless, the Brussels-based International Crisis Group (ICG) said in a report that its analysis suggested other factors have contributed to the drop alongside Bukele's crackdown. 
""While the public celebrates his well-known 'iron fist' policies, the reasons for success might lie in quiet, informal understandings between gangs and the government,"" ICG said.
""Several civil society representatives and politicians believe that gangs have decided to lower homicides, possibly as a consequence of an informal non-aggression pact with authorities."" 
ICG noted it had no evidence of any direct talks between officials and gangs. El Salvador's government has denied carrying out any negotiations. 
""There has not been any contact (with gangs), obviously we're not going to have any contact,"" Salvadoran security minister Rogelio Rivas said in a recent interview with Reuters. 
In the nearly 50-page document that cites statistical analysis and interviews with people including high-level politicians and former gang members, ICG also stressed that the exact causes for the lower homicide rate are unclear.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian journalists have launched a petition demanding treason allegations against a former reporter be made public, fearing the case is bogus and that media are being increasingly persecuted.
Ivan Safronov, a former newspaper journalist working at Russia's space agency since May, was detained by security agents outside his flat on Tuesday and accused of passing military secrets to the Czech Republic. He denies the charges.
At a closed hearing, the court ordered Safronov to be held in custody for two months. One of his lawyers, Ivan Pavlov, said the hearing was unusual as the state investigator had not presented any evidence. 
""Now they've taken Ivan Safronov,"" read the petition circulated online by journalists at investigative newspaper Novaya Gazeta and signed by nearly 7,500 people.
The petition said the case should be declassified and the allegations made public, adding: ""Otherwise it's fake. The evidence is hidden when it is fake."" 
The Kremlin noted what it described as some emotional media reactions, but said those outlets had not seen the evidence, which would be reviewed in court. It said it had seen no signs of a campaign of pressure against reporters. 
Several journalists were photographed staging one-person pickets in various Russian cities on Wednesday, demanding Safronov be freed. Dozens of people, including journalists, were detained by Moscow police on Tuesday.
On Monday, a court in the city of Pskov found another journalist guilty of justifying terrorism. She denied the charge.
Mediazona, a private media outlet, wrote that it looked like law enforcement agencies were trying to ""force us to stay silent"".
Police opened a criminal case this week against Mediazona's publisher, Pyotr Verzilov, for failing to declare dual Canadian citizenship. He is an anti-Kremlin activist.

CRNI VRH, Bosnia (Reuters) - Dozens of survivors of the Srebrenica genocide marched through the woods of eastern Bosnia on Wednesday along the route they took to escape Bosnian Serb death squads a quarter of a century ago this week. 
Organisers had banned more people from joining due to the coronavirus pandemic and participants could not start the peace march as customary in the village of Nezuk due to a rising number of infections in the area.
Wearing face masks and waving Bosnian flags, the marchers passed the mass graves in which thousands of victims' bodies have been found over the past two decades.
""We are sending messages to our kids so they will not forget what happened in Srebrenica,"" said march participant Salih Mulalic. ""I hope the genocide will not happen to anyone again."" 
Bosnian Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladic attacked the eastern enclave of Srebrenica where about 40,000 Bosnian Muslims had found shelter under United Nations protection.
After Srebrenica fell into Serb hands on July 11, 1995, the women and children were separated from men and bussed to territory controlled by the Bosnian army. 
Some 8,000 men and boys were then executed by Bosnian Serb forces, about 6,000 of them as they tried to escape through the woods and buried in mass graves.
In previous years, thousands of Bosnians and supporters have joined the three-day march along a 100-km forest trail.
This year, the commemorations will be marked mainly through exhibitions and conferences, and eight recently identified victims will be buried at a cemetery on July 11, anniversary day.
""This march is sad, depressing, it's unusual without people,"" said survivor Ramo Kadric, who was one of 15,000 men and boys trying to flee Bosnian Serb forces. ""It reminds me of war.""

The Bosnian Serb government is indoctrinating children with denials of the genocide and wrecking attempts at reconciliation, the head of a U.N. court said in an interview.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congo's deputy health minister has accused cabinet members of receiving kickbacks on government contracts for the coronavirus response while health workers went unpaid for months.
Albert M'peti Biyombo told Reuters on Wednesday that a confidential letter from him to the prime minister dated June 29, which was widely shared on social media, was authentic, adding: ""I don't know how it got out."" 
The letter accused unnamed members of the cabinet of colluding with networks within the health ministry to embezzle funds from the government and its aid partners even as state hospitals lacked drugs and basic equipment.
The allegations are likely to worsen a standoff over pay with those responding to the coronavirus epidemic in Democratic Republic of Congo. Last week, health workers in the capital Kinshasa began a partial strike in protest at not being paid bonuses for months.
""These mafia networks require kickbacks of up to 35% from structures benefiting from these funds,"" Biyombo said in the letter, where he recalled a previous request for a financial audit of the response.
He said that Health Minister Eteni Longondo had signed off large disbursements of funds - for ambulances, beds and other medical equipment - without seeking his deputy's counter-signature, overriding government procurement rules.
Longondo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""I am regularly under pressure to sign non-priority and unrelated financial documents,"" Biyongo said. He pointed to examples including the payment of medical fees for coronavirus treatment at a hospital not designated for free care by the government. 
Since confirming its first case of coronavirus in March, Congo has recorded over 7,700 cases, overwhelmingly in Kinshasa. But health authorities say a shortage of test kits and widespread stigmatisation around testing mean the true number of infections is likely to be far higher.

In March, Longondo's predecessor Oly Ilunga was sentenced to five years of forced labour for embezzling more than $400,000 from Ebola response funds.

During Greece's long debt crisis, which began in late 2009 and led to three international bailouts, Syntagma Square outside parliament became the scene of massive anti-austerity protests. 
Demonstrations have continued during the subsequent economic recovery but turnout has fallen, and the government argues that they disrupt traffic and business activity. 
Parliament, where the government holds a majority, is expected to vote on the draft legislation on Thursday.
It mandates the appointment of a liaison officer, restrictions on demonstrations or outright bans if authorities deem they threatens public safety. It also holds organisers responsible for any harm or damage caused by protesters.
Civil Protection Minister Michalis Chrysohoidis told lawmakers that there were nearly two protests a day in May and June, and that most Greeks wanted them regulated. 
But the issue is a sensitive one in a country where the right to protest is enshrined in the constitution, and where many believe abuse of power by the political elite was largely responsible for the debt crisis. Older citizens recall the excesses of the military junta that ruled from 1967-1974. 
The bill is intended to replace a 1971 junta decree restricting rallies.
The largest public sector union, ADEDY, staged a work stoppage on Wednesday and more protests are planned for Thursday. 

""We'll do everything possible to make sure it won't pass,"" said ADEDY member Odysseas Ntrivalas.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's cabinet approved a civil partnership bill on Wednesday that would recognise same-sex unions with almost the same legal rights as married couples, in one of the most liberal moves yet for a largely conservative nation known for its tolerance.
If passed by parliament, the legislation would make Thailand only the second place in Asia to allow registration of same-sex unions, with couples able to adopt a child and afforded rights to inheritance and joint property ownership. 
""The Civil Partnership Bill is an important step for Thai society in promoting equal rights and supporting the rights of same-sex couples to build families and live as partners,"" Ratchada Thanadirek, a deputy government spokeswoman, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
The bill, however, stipulates that one party in a same-sex union must be Thai.
A largely conservative Buddhist society, Thailand has a reputation for openness and free-wheeling attitudes. 
It has long been a draw for same-sex couples, with a vibrant lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender social scene for locals and expatriates, and targeted campaigns to attract LGBT travellers. 
The bill was introduced in 2018 but the previous legislature was unable to pass it before last year's election.
Taiwan last year became the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage. Vietnam has decriminalised same-sex weddings but does not recognise unions of the same sex.
Kittinan Daramadhaj, president of Rainbow Sky Association of Thailand, said the bill essentially allows same-sex couples to marry but stops short of calling it a ""marriage"", which is legally defined as being between a man and woman.
""What's in a name? It's the content that matters,"" he told Reuters.
""'Civil partnership' shouldn't distract from the fact that it's about the legal registration of unions.""
Kittinan said the bill, if passed, would ""sufficiently alleviate pains and support the human rights of LGBT people"". 
A Thai lawmaker representing LGBT groups is pushing separately for marriage to be redefined as being between ""two persons"".

976,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 08:41AM ET</span>",Special Report: Hong Kong's top cop overshadows embattled leader Lam as China cracks down,"By Greg Torode, James Pomfret and David Lague
HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Hong Kong fretted over tough new national security legislation Beijing was fashioning earlier this year, Chris Tang enthusiastically supported the move. It was needed, Hong Kong's combative police chief said, to extinguish calls for the city's independence and restore order.
Last week he got his wish. Just an hour before the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's handover to China on July 1, the ruling Communist Party imposed the law, in the process arming Tang with a range of powerful tools to quell popular dissent. The effect was immediate.
Within 24 hours, Tang's officers had arrested 10 people under the new law along with about 360 others suspected of existing offenses as protests erupted over Beijing's move. China's most open and free-wheeling city began to clam up. Political groups disbanded. Activists fled overseas. Shops ripped down posters supporting the protests that convulsed the city last year. And public libraries pulled books written by some pro-democracy authors from their shelves.
The sweeping legislation, which punishes crimes related to secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, expands the powers of Tang and his officers. Their new tools will include enhanced powers of searching premises and electronic devices, freezing or confiscating assets and demanding people and groups provide information. With the approval of Hong Kong's political leader, rather than its courts, police will be able to conduct electronic surveillance and intercept the communications of an individual suspected of endangering national security. And Tang's police aren't operating alone: Mainland China's feared secret police are now operating inside the city.
With Beijing stepping in to crush Hong Kong's democracy movement, Chris Tang has become the dominant figure in a city administration whose top priority now is regaining control. Tang will be responsible for a new police unit - the Special National Security Unit - that will tackle threats to national security, run by one of his deputies. He will also sit on a new Hong Kong body, supervised by mainland officials, that will coordinate actions against national security threats.
Bolstered by the new law, the 55-year-old Tang is moving to douse any efforts to revive a movement that began as a protest against an extradition bill and morphed into a call for greater democracy, posing the biggest popular challenge to the Chinese Communist Party since the 1989 Tiananmen uprising. With his aggressive tactics, he is overshadowing the city's embattled political leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam. She ignited the crisis last year with proposed laws that would have allowed extradition of people from Hong Kong to the mainland for trial. She later withdrew the bill under intense pressure from the street, battering her own authority and delivering a blow to her chief backer, Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
""China won't take any chances anymore with national security, and Chris Tang is someone they trust,"" a senior police source, who deals regularly with Tang, told Reuters ahead of the new law being imposed.
Along with Tang, Secretary for Security John Lee and Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng have emerged as key local players in Beijing's imposition of a harsher law-and-order regimen in Hong Kong. The three joined Lam when she visited the Chinese capital last month to discuss the security law with China's leaders.
A police spokesperson, responding to questions for Tang from Reuters, said violent attacks by protesters last year - including the use of ""sharpened instruments, metal rods, bows and arrows, petrol bombs, corrosive liquid and explosive substances"" - had put ""national security"" at risk. This threat to public safety and ""forces"" advocating independence, the spokesperson said, required ""effective measures to prevent the situation from deteriorating.""
The police force, the officer said, will ""fully perform its duties and strictly enforce the law to restore social order and ensure the effective implementation of the National Security Law"" in Hong Kong.
Explaining the need for the new law, a Hong Kong government spokesman said that in addition to ""frequent violence over the past year,"" there had also been ""actions in pursuit of independence."" The spokesman was responding to questions sent to Lee and Cheng.
Lam did not respond to questions about the increasingly dominant role played by Tang. Mainland authorities did not respond to questions from Reuters for this story.
PIVOTAL SHOWDOWN
Though the new law came into effect last week, Tang had already begun spearheading the crackdown in Hong Kong months earlier. In mid-November, the city was in open revolt. Months of protests had shattered the authority of the local government and demoralized its 30,000-strong police force. As the demonstrations reached a climax, Beijing announced the appointment of Tang.
He moved into the Commissioner of Police's office in November, just as a pivotal showdown was underway. Demonstrators, some armed with Molotov cocktails and bows and arrows, had barricaded themselves inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University. It was a tactical blunder. Police pounced.
In earlier protests, demonstrators were able to melt away through the labyrinth of Hong Kong streets and regroup elsewhere. This time they were trapped. Hundreds of police sealed the entrances to the campus and seized any protesters attempting to leave. More than 1,100 were eventually arrested. It was a turning point for the embattled authorities. For the first time in months, beleaguered police officers had outmaneuvered the protesters.
At the end of Tang's first day in the top job, he went straight to the front line to congratulate his officers. Dressed in a dark civilian jacket and trousers, he stood out. He shook hands and chatted with weary riot police in helmets and heavy protective gear.
Tang has since remained on the offensive, aided in part by the COVID-19 pandemic, which effectively shut down the protests for several months. He has used pre-emptive arrests and stop-and-search measures to prevent protests, and issued blunt rallying cries to buoy his officers. After police thwarted a protest in late May at the city's Legislative Council, Tang took to police radio to congratulate the force.
Pro-democracy lawmakers, academics and foreign diplomats say that the new security law signals the death of the ""one country, two systems"" model used to govern Hong Kong. In place since the 1997 handover of the city to China, the arrangement has afforded Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and has protected a wide array of freedoms enjoyed by the city's residents, such as freedom of expression and the press, that don't exist on the mainland.
Many say the city is increasingly being run from Beijing. Mainland Chinese officials have been appointed as the city's top national security adviser and head of a new national security agency in Hong Kong that will have overarching authority, including an enforcement role in the most serious cases.
""We are in a situation where the Chinese Communist Party controls the police, and the police controls Hong Kong,"" said veteran pro-democracy legislator James To, who has monitored policing and security matters for decades. ""It is not the way Hong Kong is supposed to work, or has worked up until recently.""
Hong Kong, he added, has become ""a security police state.""
The new law quickly sent a chill through the city. Hours before it was imposed, pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said that Demosisto, a group he led, was disbanding, while a prominent member of the group, Nathan Law, departed the city. Wong told Reuters the group took the decision because it was concerned about the safety of its members.
A man carrying a popular protest slogan – ""Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our times"" - drove his motorcycle into a police line last week knocking over three officers in protest against the security legislation. He became the first person to be charged with incitement to secession and terrorist activities under the law. The man, who has yet to enter a plea, was later denied bail and remanded in custody. The city government said the slogan connoted separatism or subversion under the new law.
'HOME-GROWN TERRORISM'
The legislation, Tang said this week, was doing its job. He told China's state broadcaster CCTV that the enactment of the law was already having a ""positive effect"" on the stability of Hong Kong. It appeared to have led to some people dropping out of the protest movement, he said, without naming anyone.
Tang has likened the actions of some of the protesters to terrorism - a line that the leadership in Beijing has used to justify the legislation. In a May 25 statement, he said that police had uncovered 14 cases involving explosives and five cases where genuine firearms and ammunition were seized since the protests began.
And he highlighted the threat of what he called ""home-grown terrorism"" in a video published on a government-backed website in mid-April. The video included footage of explosions during the siege at Polytechnic University, where protesters hurled Molotov cocktails and fired arrows at police. It also shows a plane slamming into one of the World Trade Center towers on Sept. 11, 2001, as Tang is heard explaining to viewers that the incidents involving explosives in Hong Kong are ""very similar to these overseas cases.""
Critics of the video called the comparison ludicrous. The Hong Kong protests grew out of broad, grassroots opposition in the city to the extradition bill. The 9/11 attacks, which killed thousands of people, were carried out by members of al Qaeda.
A police spokesman said that Tang, ""by no means, compared peaceful protests to terrorism.""
Tang makes no secret of where his loyalties lie. In December, he made his first official trip to Beijing as police chief. On a crisp and clear December morning, he was in Tiananmen Square to watch soldiers raise the Chinese national flag, in a choreographed appearance that senior colleagues say is typical of his working style.
""Today is the first time I've watched the flag-raising ceremony at such close range,"" he told state television. ""In my heart I felt very emotional to see our country's national flag fluttering. I could feel our country's power.""
Tang's visit to the capital was widely seen as unusually high profile for a Hong Kong police commissioner. While he was in Beijing, top Chinese leaders toasted his success. Public Security Minister Zhao Kezhi told Tang that the central government and the security ministry were fully behind the Hong Kong police, according to the ministry's website. Tang was quoted as replying that his force would ""throw all of its energy"" into curbing the violence and unrest in Hong Kong.
When China's State Council in November announced Tang's appointment, the message communicated from Beijing was clear, a senior Hong Kong police officer said. ""Tang had to act fast,"" the officer said. ""The police were near mutiny, they were so angry at Lam"" for not resolving the political impasse.
Another senior police officer said another message came down from the Chinese leadership. As he put it: ""You can't compromise with the protesters anymore,"" a reference to situations last year where demonstrators had been allowed to escape when police could have arrested them.
NEW MOTTO
Like all of his predecessors in post-colonial Hong Kong, Tang was carefully vetted by the Communist Party for loyalty and ability, several senior police officers told Reuters. Tang's official biography details his international connections along with his stints at elite party and security schools in mainland China. It also includes spells at Interpol headquarters in the French city of Lyon, the Royal College of Defence Studies in London and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation's training academy in Quantico, Virginia.
What is not mentioned is a domestic role that was key in his rise. Promoted to senior superintendent of the Hong Kong force in 2007, Tang returned from Lyon and began working at the Liaison Bureau, a small office in one of the most secure wings of the police headquarters building. Tang helped ease lingering suspicions between what had been an anti-communist British colonial force and mainland police loyal to the Communist Party, say those who knew him at the time.
Tang played a key role in forging new working-level ties between Hong Kong and mainland police, establishing joint investigation protocols and an electronic information-sharing network. In a 2016 academic paper published by Hong Kong researcher Sonny Lo, Tang was cited extensively after being interviewed on his liaison work in the 2000s with Chinese law enforcement, including criminal investigation, intelligence sharing, evidence collection and tactical training. Tang lectured to the force on this work and how to foster close relationships with mainland counterparts as ties expanded, according to an account in an internal police newspaper.
Tang studied at the elite school for Communist Party cadres on the outskirts of Shanghai, known as the Chinese Executive Leadership Academy. He later attended the People's Public Security University in Beijing.
By 2015, Tang was promoted to assistant commissioner, and then, in 2017, to the powerful role of operations director, considered a stepping stone to the top job.
Tang has made a concerted effort to be seen as the public face of the force since he got the top job. Senior officers who have worked with him say Tang insists on tight control over media appearances. He's always perfectly groomed, even if called out late at night, as he was when he visited police at the Polytechnic University showdown last year.
On the day he took office, Tang introduced a new police motto, altering its communal focus: ""We Serve with Pride and Care"" became ""Serving Hong Kong with Honour, Duty and Loyalty.""
The Hong Kong government has lavished resources on Tang's force. In March, the police won a 25% budget increase to recruit an extra 2,500 officers and procure the latest surveillance tools and protective gear.
Some rank-and-file cops say Tang's hard-charging approach has revived morale in the force, shattered last year by the protests and a barrage of public complaints about police brutality. Amnesty International accused the Hong Kong police of carrying out ""arbitrary arrests"" and ""brutal beatings.""
The police chief is confronting his critics. A massive backlash against pro-Beijing parties in the aftermath of the extradition bill delivered control of 90% of local district councils to pro-democracy forces in elections last November. Tang endured hostile questioning from some of these councils when asked to explain police tactics and answer allegations of police brutality. He stood his ground. It's the protesters who should ""apologize,"" not police, he told one council meeting in January where members criticized the police.
Tang's higher-octane approach was on display when he took to the radio to congratulate his officers after they foiled the late-May protest at the Legislative Council, allowing for a debate over a bill outlawing insults to the Chinese national anthem to proceed. The law ultimately passed.

""As long as the upper and lower ranks of the police force share the same spirit, victory will come,"" he told his officers. Tang was quoting from the ancient sage of Chinese military strategy, Sun Tzu, author of ""The Art of War.""

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The Bosnian Serb government is indoctrinating children with denials of the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica of 8,000 Muslim men and boys, and wrecking attempts at reconciliation, the head of a U.N. court said in an interview. 
Judge Carmel Agius, president of the court completing war crimes trials stemming from the breakup of Yugoslavia, added unhealed ethnic divisions in Bosnia were driving the younger generation away in their tens of thousands.
The 1992-95 Bosnian war claimed roughly 100,000 lives and left Bosnia deeply divided along ethnic lines, split into two autonomous regions joined by a weak central government.
Members of the Republika Srpska government have repeatedly questioned the number of Bosnian Muslims killed in Srebrenica a quarter of a century ago this week. They also accuse the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal of anti-Serb bias.
""What you find is a humongous effort on the part of the authorities to indoctrinate their children with their own version of the events,"" Agius told Reuters.
The Serb member of Bosnia's tri-partite presidency, Milorad Dodik, last year called the Srebrenica genocide ""a fabricated myth"". He has also opened a student dormitory named after former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who is serving a life sentence after being convicted of genocide for Srebrenica.
Last month in the northern town of Gradiska Bosnian Serbs put up a huge mural at a primary school of Ratko Mladic, military leader of Bosnian Serb forces as they overran Srebrenica, which had been declared a U.N. safe area in 1993 and was protected by lightly armed Dutch troops.
The Bosnian Serb army seized the area on July 11, sending the women away in buses and transporting the men to dozens of execution sites. Their bodies were dumped in mass graves.
Mladic has appealed his conviction for genocide over Srebrenica, war crimes and crimes against humanity.
In 2018 Bosnian Serb authorities withdrew a 2004 report by their predecessors acknowledging the genocide and established a panel to review the number of victims. 
Bosnian Serb Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic said last weekend a new report would be completed in a month or two.
""In this way the Serb Republic government wants to bring the truth about the suffering of Serbs...closer to the international community and historians, who when they write about these events one day, will have clear evidence that truth is not only what one side states,"" Viskovic said.

Agius said the international war crimes cases have left no room for misunderstanding: ""They all come to one conclusion: namely that what happened in Srebrenica was genocide.""

KANDAHAR, Afghanistan/KABUL (Reuters) - A Taliban suicide bomber detonated an explosive-packed military vehicle on the approach to the provincial governor's residence and police headquarters in the Afghan province of Kandahar on Wednesday, killing at least three people, authorities said.
Bloodshed is escalating anew in Afghanistan even as the United States tries to broker a peace deal between the Taliban and Afghan government after almost two decades of war.
""At around 4 a.m., a suicide bomber driving a large (Afghan security force) truck came under fire from security forces before reaching his goal, but detonated explosives near police headquarters and the governor's residential complex,"" the governor's spokesman, Bahir Ahmad Ahamdi, said. 
Three members of the security forces were killed and 14 people wounded, including civilians, in the attack in the Sha Wali Kot district of Kandahar, he said, and the police headquarters and governor's compound suffered severe damage.
The Taliban claimed responsibility, saying in a statement that the police headquarters had been used as a military hub for security force operations against the Islamist insurgents.
Diplomats say the resurgence of attacks is heightening mistrust just as the Afghan government and Taliban are set to enter peace negotiations and as the United States withdraws forces under a deal with the Taliban struck in February. 
On Tuesday, a car bomb blast in the eastern province of Nangarhar killed a local police commander and three other people, and wounded 11, according to the provincial governor's spokesman. There was no claim of responsibility for the attack. 
An explosion in Kabul on Tuesday injured two civilians and security forces said they had thwarted large attacks in and around the capital.
Disagreement over a release of prisoners - with Kabul refusing to free 600 of the 5,000 Taliban it holds - is proving to be one of the last major hurdles to the start of full peace negotiations in the Qatari capital Doha.

""France expresses its outrage over Mr Soumaila Cisse's situation. He is the opposition leader, he was candidate in the presidential election and he was taken hostage three months ago and we are strongly calling for his release,"" Le Drian told the National Assembly when asked about Cisse.
Cisse and several members of his delegation were ambushed by unidentified gunmen in March on the campaign trail in the northern region of Timbuktu. His bodyguard was killed and two others wounded, Cisse's Union for the Republic and Democracy (URD) said at the time. 
Militants with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State stage frequent attacks on civilian and military targets in the area, but there was no claim of responsibility and no request for ransom has been received. 
France, the former colonial ruler, has troops in Mali to counter the jihadist threat.
Cisse, 70, is Mali's leading opposition figure and was finance minister from 1993 to 2000. He lost the 2013 and 2018 elections to President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.
Mali's government has said the military is trying to find the hostages. Mali has been in political turmoil since the disputed election in March.

SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun rejected on Wednesday reports that he was seeking to meet North Korean officials during a visit to South Korea this week, but reiterated that the United States was open to resuming talks.
The U.S. point man for North Korea, Biegun was in Seoul for meetings with South Korean officials, overshadowed by the North's insistence that it had no intention of returning to denuclearisation negotiations as long as the United States clings to ""hostile policies"".
Biegun briefly met South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha before formal talks with Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young and chief nuclear negotiator Lee Do-hoon.
The talks ranged over issues from coronavirus response and cost-sharing for the U.S. military deployment in South Korea, but North Korea dominated the agenda, the South's officials said.
Biegun's visit had sparked speculation about a last-ditch effort to revive the North Korea talks ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, but he played down expectations for new meetings.
""Let me absolutely be clear, we did not request a visit,"" Biegun told a news conference after meeting Lee. ""This visit this week is to meet with our close friends and allies, the South Koreans.""
But Biegun said he was ready to resume talks at any time the North Koreans designated.
""We look forward to continuing our work for a peaceful outcome of the Korean peninsula, I believe this is very much possible,"" he said, adding that U.S. President Donald Trump had given his full support. 
Biegun reiterated that the United States was willing to be flexible and reach a ""balanced agreement"" with North Korea, should it decide to return to talks, Lee said.
Biegun is also likely to meet Suh Hoon, Moon's new national security adviser and former spy chief who was instrumental in paving the way for summits between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, a South Korean official said.
'OLD WAY OF THINKING'
Talks with North Korea have since stalled, and its officials, including a top diplomat Biegun met in negotiations, Choe Son Hui, say they have no intention of sitting down with the United States. 
Biegun, in a separate statement issued by the U.S. embassy, said both Choe and former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton - who recently published a memoir criticising Biegun for being soft on North Korea - were ""locked in an old way of thinking, focused on only the negatives and what is impossible, rather than thinking creatively about what is possible"".
Earlier, Biegun said he did not focus on the North's statements but was guided instead by the ""vision"" Trump and Kim outlined at their meetings.
The two leaders met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes for a negotiated end to North Korea's nuclear programme. But their second summit, in 2019 in Vietnam, and later working-level talks, fell apart.
Trump said on Tuesday he was open to another meeting with Kim and thought it might be helpful, Voice of America said, citing a transcript of Trump interview with Gray Television (NYSE:GTN), due to be aired on Sunday.
On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the United States held the key to breaking the stalemate on the Korean peninsula.
Kim has kept a low profile in recent months, with far fewer public appearances than usual, say analysts who track his movements. 
On Wednesday, North Korean state media said Kim had marked the death anniversary of his grandfather, founding leader Kim Il Sung, with a visit to his mausoleum in Pyongyang.

Biegun has previously played down the likelihood of another Trump-Kim summit, saying the virus made one unlikely before the election.

(Reuters) - A Texas inmate who was convicted of fatally shooting an elderly man at his home as he robbed him of his truck nearly three decades ago is scheduled to be executed by lethal injection by the state on Wednesday. 
Billy Joe Wardlow, 45, is set to be put to death at 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) at the state's execution chamber in Huntsville for the murder of Carl Cole, 82, in 1993.
Texas has executed more prisoners than any other state since the U.S Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Wardlow would be the third inmate in Texas and the seventh in the United States to be executed in 2020. 
Wardlow's lawyers have filed a request with the U.S. Supreme Court to halt the execution, arguing that since Wardlow was 18 at the time of the crime, he was not fully capable of understanding his actions and thus should not face the death penalty. 
As of Wednesday morning, that request was pending. 
Prosecutors accused Wardlow and his girlfriend Tonya Fulfer of going to Cole's house in Cason, a rural town in northeast Texas, on June 14, 1993. After Wardlow shot Cole once in the head during a struggle, the couple fled with Cole's Chevrolet pickup truck, court records showed.
The pair planned to use the truck to drive to Montana, but traded in the truck for a 1987 Ford Mustang convertible at a Nebraska car dealership the next day.
They were arrested a day later in South Dakota. Authorities found a pistol in the Mustang that matched the weapon used in the murder, court documents showed. 

Wardlow was found guilty of capital murder in 1995 and sentenced to death. Fulfer received 10 years' probation, according to local media.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - Some Hispanics and Native Americans in a New Mexico valley want to reinstate the statue of a Spanish colonial ruler that officials removed in June as anti-racism protests swept the nation.
Rio Arriba County authorities carried off the Juan de Oñate sculpture on June 15, fearing its destruction, as Native American activist group Red Nation planned a protest. It came down the same day a protester 60 miles (97 km) southwest in Albuquerque was shot by a man protecting another Oñate sculpture.
The death of unarmed black man George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in May sparked widespread racial justice protests. Demonstrators across the country have defaced or toppled dozens of statues of European colonizers, Confederate generals and figures who subjugated native peoples.
The Oñate statue was unveiled in 1994 in Alcalde, around 30 miles (48 kms) north of Santa Fe. 
Red Nation organizer Elena Ortiz, of the nearby Ohkay Owingeh Native American community, declared its removal part of ""the pueblo revolt of 2020,"" comparing it to the 1680 indigenous uprising that drove Spanish settlers from the area. 
The statue had long outraged those who trace Oñate's brutal 1598 colonization of New Mexico to contemporary problems ranging from gender inequality to institutional racism.
But Ohkay Owingeh Governor Ron Lovato and Rio Arriba's Democratic state representative Joseph Sanchez, who is Hispanic, opposed removal in a joint statement. The two noted that their communities had lived in harmony for centuries.
“This group that’s pushing for this movement, they’ve created something that didn’t exist, creating tensions between some of the people,"" said Sanchez. ""Onate did bad things, but he helped settle the Hispanics, that was a different time.""
ELECTION-YEAR ISSUE
U.S. President Donald Trump has made memorials to the pro-slavery Civil War Confederacy an election issue. Other statues that have fallen include monuments to Spanish Jesuit Junipero Serra who founded missions in California; and explorer Christopher Columbus, long credited with discovering America but also accused of engendering genocide against Native Americans. 
Oñate statues popped up along the Rio Grande in the 1990s as communities celebrated the 400th anniversary of his arrival. At the time, folklorist Enrique Lamadrid advised Albuquerque on the celebrations and urged organizers to steer clear of Oñate. He recalled that many cities chose the statue of the ""wrong guy.""
""We shook our heads in dismay and said 'this is going to explode at some point.'"" said Lamadrid, noting that the frontiersman soldier was convicted and exiled in his own time for executing his men and a massacre at Acoma Pueblo. 
TEACHING HISTORY 
It is now up to Rio Arriba's county commission and residents to decide the future of the Alcalde statue. Española personal trainer April Marie Moya-Salazar started an online petition to reinstate the sculpture and has over 600 signatures.
“Most of the younger generation has no idea what is going on, they think we’re celebrating genocide,"" said Moya-Salazar, 41, who traces her Spanish ancestry back 14 generations.
Roberto Valdez, an Española college history lecturer, went to the Alcalde site on June 15 to try to explain Oñate's significance to a young protester dancing on the empty plinth. 
""The statues arose because we were keenly aware of the erosion of our culture and heritage,"" said Valdez, who is Hispanic.
For Hispanic community advocate Fred Sandoval, the Oñate sculpture needs to go in a new museum for ""reconciliation.""
""We have to tell the entire story from different perspectives, the good, the bad and the ugly,"" said Sandoval, director of a Latino behavioral health group. 
Ohkay Owingeh's Lovato said the valley should be focused on its opioid crisis and the coronavirus pandemic rather than taking down monuments.
""I’m more concerned with, call them the Oñates of today, the enemies of today, than bronze statues that can't hurt me anymore,"" said Lovato. 

But he said the Oñate statue could go back up with one of Popé, the Ohkay Owingeh religious leader who started the 1680 Pueblo Revolt, to represent both Hispanics and Native Americans.

The pope, who has in the past called for the camps to be closed, made his comments in his homily during a Mass to mark the seventh anniversary of his trip to the Italian island of Lampedusa, landing place for many migrants making the perilous crossing from north Africa.
Departing from his prepared address, he recalled how an interpreter translating his conversation with a migrant seven years ago, gave him only a ""distilled"" version of what the migrant was actually saying.
""This is what is happening today in Libya. They give us the distilled version,"" said Francis, who has made defence of migrants a major part of his seven-year-old papacy.
""Yes, there is a war (in Libya) and we know that is ugly but you cannot imagine the hell that people live there in those lagers of detention,"" he said.
Lager is an abbreviation of the German word 'Konzentrationslager', or concentration camp.
""All these people had was hope as they were crossing the sea,"" Francis said.
Thousands of refugees and migrants are held in about 20 official detention facilities in Libya, some controlled by armed groups, as well as an unknown number in squalid centres run by traffickers, according to the United Nations.
Human rights groups say abuses, including beating and forced labour, are rife in the detention centres.

Detainees in the Libyan camps include those who left on boats for Europe and were brought back by the European Union- backed Libyan Coast Guard, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) says.

Although currently chaired by a woman, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, and although it gave Germany its first female Chancellor in Merkel, women make up only a quarter of its members - something the party leadership wants to change.
According to the plan, thrashed out by leaders of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) in overnight talks, women must make up 40% of all governing bodies, from the regional level upwards, from 2023 onwards, rising to 50% by 2025.
Other parties, in particular the Greens, running a distant second to the CDU in most national polls, have long had policies in place to ensure women are prominent in the party, including having a woman and a man as co-leaders of the party.
The CDU will apply a similar rule in composing its slates for elections to the state, national and European parliaments. Local party organisations will also have to report to the centre on their progress in increasing their share of women members.
The plan must still be adopted formally, most probably at the party's congress in December, the party sources said.
Currently, only a fifth of the CDU's national parliamentarians are women, compared to a third of the Bundestag's overall membership. Germany's share of women legislators is low by Scandinavian standards.

There will be a get-out clause, however: party bodies will not need to fulfill the quota if not enough women apply.

(Reuters) - When the phone rang Tuesday morning, Raul Romero had barely slept.
The 21-year-old Venezuelan, on a scholarship at Ohio's Kenyon College, had spent hours pondering his options after U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced Monday that international students taking classes fully online for the fall semester would have to transfer to a school with in-person classes or leave the country.
A college employee called Romero to say he would not be immediately affected, but warned that a local outbreak of COVID-19 could force the school to suspend in-person classes during the year. If that happened, he may need to go home. 
Romero is one of hundreds of thousands of international students in the United States on F-1 and M-1 visas faced with the prospect of having to leave the country mid-pandemic if their schools go fully online.
For some students, remote learning could mean attending classes in the middle of the night, dealing with spotty or no internet access, losing funding contingent on teaching, or having to stop participating in research. Some are considering taking time off or leaving their programs entirely.
Reuters spoke with a dozen students who described feeling devastated and confused by the Trump administration's announcement. 
In a Venezuela beset by a deep economic crisis amid political strife, Romero said his mother and brother are living off their savings, sometimes struggle to find food and don’t have reliable internet at home.
“To think about myself going back to that conflict, while continuing my classes in a completely unequal playing field with my classmates,” he said. “I don’t think it’s possible.”
And that's if he could even get there. There are currently no flights between the United States and Venezuela.
WORKING REMOTELY WON'T WORK
At schools that have already announced the decision to conduct classes fully online, students were grappling with the announcement’s implications for their personal and professional lives. Blindsided universities scrambled to help them navigate the upheaval.
Lewis Picard, 24, an Australian second-year doctoral student in experimental physics at Harvard University, has been talking nonstop with his partner about the decision. They are on F-1 visas at different schools. 
Harvard said Monday it plans to conduct courses online next year. After the ICE (NYSE:ICE) announcement, the university's president, Larry Bacow, said Harvard was “deeply concerned” that it left international students “few options.”
Having to leave “would completely put a roadblock in my research,” Picard said. “There’s essentially no way that the work I am doing can be done remotely. We’ve already had this big pause on it with the pandemic, and we’ve just been able to start going back to lab.” 
It could also mean he and his partner would be separated. “The worst-case scenario plan is we’d both have to go to our home countries,” he said. 
'CAN'T TRANSFER IN JULY'
Aparna Gopalan, 25, a fourth-year anthropology PhD student at Harvard originally from India, said ICE’s suggestion that students transfer to in-person universities is not realistic just weeks before classes begin.
“That betrays a complete lack of understanding of how academia works,” she said. “You can’t transfer in July. That’s not what happens.""
Others were considering leaving their programs entirely if they cannot study in the United States, and taking their tuition dollars with them. International students often pay full freight, helping universities to fund scholarships, and injected nearly $45 billion into the U.S. economy in 2018.
“It doesn't make much sense to me to pay for an American education, if you're not really receiving an American education,” said Olufemi Olurin, 25, of the Bahamas, who is earning an MBA at Eastern Kentucky University and wants to pursue a career in healthcare management. 
“It’s kind of heartbreaking,” she said. “I've been building my life here. As an immigrant, even if you are as law-abiding as it gets, you still are always waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under you.""
Benjamin Bing, 22, from China, who was planning to study computer science at Carnegie Mellon in the fall, said he no longer feels welcome in the United States. He and his friends are exploring the possibility of finishing their studies in Europe. 

“I feel like it's kicking out everyone,” he said, of the United States. “We actually paid tuition to study here and we did not do anything wrong.”

(Reuters) - More than 150 world renowned academics, writers and artists signed a letter published on Tuesday expressing support for global anti-racism protests while lamenting an ""intolerant climate that has set in on all sides"".
American linguist and activist Noam Chomsky, veteran women's rights campaigner Gloria Steinem, authors J.K. Rowling and Salman Rushdie, and journalist Fareed Zakaria were among the signatories.
The letter on ""justice and open debate"" was published by Harper's Magazine and will appear in many leading global publications.
It supported ongoing demonstrations against police brutality and racial inequality that have spread from the United States across the world, following outrage over the death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him in Minneapolis on May 25.
However, the letter also said that the sentiments unleashed have hardened a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments to the detriment of open debate, and allowed ideological conformity to erode tolerance of differences.
""As we applaud the first development, we also raise our voices against the second"", the letter said, adding that resistance should not be allowed to ""harden"" into a brand of ""dogma or coercion"".
Free exchange of information and ideas are becoming more constricted on a daily basis, the letter warned.
It said that censoriousness was spreading widely across the culture through public shaming, a tendency to dissolve complex policy issues in a ""blinding moral certainty"" and an intolerance of opposing views. 
""The way to defeat bad ideas is by exposure, argument, and persuasion, not by trying to silence or wish them away. We refuse any false choice between justice and freedom, which cannot exist without each other"", the letter added.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday the United States would restrict visas for some Chinese officials because Beijing obstructs travel to Tibet by U.S. diplomats, journalists and tourists and ""human rights abuses"" in the Himalayan region.
The moves come as relations between the United States deteriorate over trade, technology, the coronavirus pandemic and the former British colony of Hong Kong.
The United States ""should stop going further down the wrong path to avoid further harming China-U.S. relations and communication and cooperation between the two countries,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing.
China sent troops into remote, mountainous Tibet in 1950 in what it officially terms a peaceful liberation and has ruled there with an iron fist ever since.
Zhao said Beijing would not allow foreign interference in Tibetan affairs and said Beijing implements some ""protective measures"" on visitors due to Tibet's geography and climate. 
Pompeo said in a statement the United States remained committed to supporting ""meaningful autonomy"" for Tibetans and respect for their fundamental human rights.
""Access to Tibetan areas is increasingly vital to regional stability, given the PRC's human rights abuses there, as well as Beijing's failure to prevent environmental degradation near the headwaters of Asia's major rivers,"" Pompeo said, referring to the People's Republic of China.
""Today I am announcing visa restrictions on PRC government and Chinese Communist Party officials determined to be 'substantially involved in the formulation or execution of policies related to access for foreigners to Tibetan areas',"" he said.
U.S.-China relations have reached their lowest point in years since the coronavirus pandemic that began in China hit the United States hard.

Pompeo said last week the new national security law China has imposed on Hong Kong, despite the territory's guarantee of wide-ranging autonomy, was an affront to all nations.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Indian police have arrested 12 LG Polymers officials, including its South Korean Chief Executive Sunkey Jeong, an officer said on Wednesday, two months after a gas leak at the company's south Indian chemical plant killed 12.
The arrests were made under a case of culpable homicide filed against the company, a unit of South Korea's LG Chem Ltd, and its officials, stemming from the leak that occurred in the early hours on May 7 in the port city of Visakhapatnam, the city police commissioner Rajiv Kumar Meena said. 
""A total of twelve members including the CEO and two directors were arrested on Tuesday evening,"" Meena said, adding that among those arrested were two directors, one of whom was a South Korean.
LG Polymers said it had nothing to share in an email responding to a Reuters request for a comment on the arrests.
Toxic styrene gas leaked from the chemical plant choking many people who were sleeping.
This week, a government-appointed committee recommended that the plant should be shifted away from human habitation and called for action against the top employees. It said LG Polymers had been negligent and warning systems were not working.
The company had ignored potentially hazardous chemical reactions at the plant in April before the leak, when it was working with reduced staff due to a coronavirus lockdown, the committee said.
The temperature inside the oldest of the three storage tanks holding styrene monomer, a liquid used in making polystyrene products, rose to more than six times the permitted level, after which it evaporated, the committee found.
LG Chem Ltd said on Monday it had co-operated with the investigation and would respond to the probe result and take corresponding measures.
The police case included counts of culpable homicide, negligent handling of poisonous substances and causing hurt and endangering public life.

Meena said the charges could draw prison terms of up to eight years if proven in court.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China opened its powerful national security office in Hong Kong on Wednesday, turning a hotel near a city-centre park that has been one of the most popular venues for pro-democracy protests into its new headquarters.
The office, which operates beyond the scrutiny of local courts or other institutions, will oversee the Hong Kong government's enforcement of the sweeping national security legislation that Beijing imposed on the city last week.
The legislation gives its agents, operating openly in the global financial hub for the first time, enforcement powers.
It allows them to take suspects across the border for trials in Communist Party-controlled courts and gives them special privileges, including that Hong Kong authorities cannot search or detain them, or even inspect their vehicles.
It was unclear how many mainland agents will be stationed in the former Metropark Hotel, a 266-room, 33-storey building in the shopping and commercial district of Causeway Bay, near Victoria Park.
At the opening ceremony, chief of the security office Zheng Yanxiong said he would enforce the law strictly ""without infringing on the legitimate rights and interests of any individual or organisation"".
Luo Huining, head of China's Liaison Office in the city, Beijing's top representative office, said the office was ""the gatekeeper of national security"" and people who loved China and Hong Kong welcomed it.
""Those with ulterior motives and who are anti-China and seek to destabilise Hong Kong have not only stigmatised the office, but also smeared the legal system and rule of law in the Chinese mainland in an attempt to stir up unnecessary worries and fears among Hong Kong residents,"" Luo said.
RED LINE
The new security law has pushed China's freest city onto a more authoritarian path and drawn condemnation from some Western governments, lawyers and rights groups.
It punishes acts of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. Police have arrested at least 10 people, including a 15-year-old, under it for suspected threats to China's national security. 
Critics fear it will crush coveted freedoms in the Chinese-ruled city, while supporters say it will bring stability after a year of sometimes violent protests that plunged the former British colony into its biggest crisis in decades.
Hong Kong and Beijing officials insist rights and freedoms would remain intact, but say national security is a ""red line"". The new security legislation has already started to change life in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong authorities on Wednesday banned school students from singing ""Glory to Hong Kong"", the unofficial anthem of the pro-democracy protest movement.
Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung said students should not participate in class boycotts, chant slogans, form human chains or sing songs that contain political messages, referring specifically to the popular protest anthem.
Books by some pro-democracy activists and politicians have been removed from public libraries. The ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times"" slogan is now illegal. Activists have disbanded their organisations or fled. Shops have removed protest-themed products and decorations.
Chief Executive Lam has said the security law was mild compared with that of other countries, without naming them, but pro-democracy advocates say its contents are vague and worry about Beijing authorities having final interpretation rights.
In a reflection of the widespread unease over the legislation, major U.S. internet companies including Facebook (O:FB), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Twitter and Zoom have announced they have suspended the processing of requests for user data from the Hong Kong authorities while they study it.

The United States has begun removing Hong Kong's special status in U.S. law as Washington no longer deems the global financial hub sufficiently autonomous from mainland China.

Washington has repeatedly called for China to join in trilateral negotiations to extend New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the United States and Russia that is due to expire in February next year. 
Fu Cong, head of the arms control department of Chinese foreign ministry, reiterated to reporters in Beijing on Wednesday that China has no interest in joining the negotiation with former Cold War-era superpowers, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.
""I can assure you, if the U.S. says that they are ready to come down to the Chinese level, China would be happy to participate the next day,"" he said. ""But actually, we know that's not going to happen.""
Fu asserted that for the United States, asking China to participate in trilateral negotiations is ""nothing but a ploy to divert attention"" and an excuse for the United States to walk away from the New START extension.
""The real purpose is to get rid of all restrictions and have a free hand in seeking military superiority over any adversary, real or imagined,"" said Fu.

Fu maintained China is not ""shying away from the international nuclear disarmament process"" and is prepared to discuss within the framework of the United Nations Security Council's five permanent members all issues related to the reduction of nuclear risks.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - From ski resorts to beach cafes, businesses on the border of Australia's two most populous states are the latest casualties of the novel coronavirus, with Victoria isolated from the rest of the country to stop a surge in infections.
Hotels and campgrounds faced mass cancellations and pubs and cafes prepared to dump food as the state of New South Wales shut its border with Victoria on Tuesday and Victoria's capital, Melbourne, reimposed lockdowns on Wednesday.
Dealing another blow, New South Wales on Wednesday urged its citizens to stay away from the border region.
""It's a double whammy for us,"" said Mark Francis, chief executive of Murray Regional Tourism, referring to the restrictions on both sides of the border.
""Whilst it's saving us from a health crisis, it is shutting down the visitor economy.""
The moves to contain a flare-up of coronavirus cases in Melbourne, home to 4.9 million people, come in the middle of school winter holidays, halting travel plans for thousands of families on both sides of the border.
The July-September quarter would normally bring about 1.6 million visitors to the Murray River region, generating about A$1.4 billion ($970 million), Francis said. 
Businesses that suffered a hit from devastating bushfires in January and February and the coronavirus lockdowns in April were just gearing up for the winter season.
Motel and campground owners said cancellations poured in this week, dragging occupancy rates down from more than 90% typical for this time of year to about 15%.
""We've had a mass evacuation of Victorians,"" said Ray Bell, owner of the Twofold Bay Motor Inn in Eden, a beach town in the south of New South Wales.
At a campground in Swan Hill, another border town, the owner was busy taking cancellations and rolling some bookings to later dates.
""I feel for restaurants and pubs where they're going to have to throw money in the bin. They're probably worse off than we are,"" said Peter Dowell, owner of the Swan Holiday Park.
""You can't freeze a lettuce.""
Tourist spending in Victoria this year is expected to drop by 72% to about A$9 billion due to the bushfire and the COVID-19 crises, the Victorian Chamber of Commerce said. 
""It hasn't been the best year. It's going to take us quite a while to get over it all,"" said Sue Scanlan, owner of the Wine Village Motor Inn in Rutherglen.

New security legislation imposed on Hong Kong by Beijing requires the Asian financial hub to ""promote national security education in schools and universities and through social organisations, the media, the internet"".
The school anthem ban will further stoked concerns that new security laws will crush freedoms in China's freest city, days after public libraries removed books by some prominent pro-democracy figures from their shelves.
Authorities also banned protest slogans as the new laws came into force last week.
The sweeping legislation that Beijing imposed on the former British colony punishes what China defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison. 
Secretary for Education Kevin Yeung, responding to a question from a lawmaker, said students should not participate in class boycotts, chant slogans, form human chains or sing songs that contain political messages. 
""The song 'Glory to Hong Kong', originated from the social incidents since June last year, contains strong political messages and is closely related to the social and political incidents, violence and illegal incidents that have lasted for months,"" Yeung said. ""Schools must not allow students to play, sing or broadcast it in schools.""
Earlier on Wednesday, China opened its new national security office, turning a hotel near a city-centre park that has been one of the most popular venues for pro-democracy protests into its new headquarters.
Both Hong Kong and Chinese government officials have said the new law is vital to plug gaping holes in national security defences exposed by the anti-government and anti-China protests that rocked the city in the past year.
They have argued the city failed to pass such laws by itself as required under its mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law. 
Critics of the law see it as a tool to crush dissent, while supporters say it will bring stability to the city.

In a statement last month, China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, Beijing's top representative office in the city, blamed political groups ""with ulterior motives"" for ""shocking chaos in Hong Kong education.

997,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 08, 2020 12:30AM ET</span>",Gay rights: the taboo subject in Singapore's election,"By John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Among a record eleven parties set to contest Singapore's election on Friday, there has been virtual silence on one of the conservative city-state's most controversial issues, gay rights.
Advocacy groups have stepped up awareness campaigns with scorecards for politicians and online rallies in recent weeks over what they see as everyday discrimination that stems from a rarely-used, colonial-era law banning sex between men. 
But for some gay Singaporeans, casting their vote in the mandatory July 10 ballot will serve as a reminder that they have few political allies on one of the issues that matters most to them. 
""It's a non-topic with the parties, the choices we have,"" said Victor Ong, a 44-year-old Singaporean who lives with his British husband Harry, whom he married four years ago in London, and their amber-coloured cat Whisky. 
""As much as I want to make my decision based on their stance on that, there isn't any material to work with.""
Ong's marriage is not recognised in Singapore, meaning the couple are not eligible for some benefits like housing and tax. They also say they avoid public displays of affection due to worries about social norms shaped by the 377A law which effectively criminalises them.
Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has previously called the law an ""uneasy compromise"" as society ""is not that liberal on these matters"". 
There is no mention of gay rights or 377A in the manifesto of his People's Action Party, which has ruled Singapore since independence in 1965 and is widely-expected to be returned to power, or that of any other party in the election.
Of the four main parties contesting, only the new Progress Singapore Party responded to a request for comment. A spokesman said it did not object to removing criminal punishment for homosexuals but the debate over 377A was a ""proxy combat zone"" for other issues like family structures and marriage.
Political analyst Loke Hoe Yeong said the issue was considered ""political suicide"" for parties who feel they will be punished by either conservative or liberal voters.
Yet advocacy groups do sense a growing awareness around the issue, especially after India repealed a similar law in 2018.
""That tacit acceptance of the status quo is giving way to a sense of frustration amongst the younger voters,"" said Clement Tan of Pink Dot SG, which hosted an online rally last month for Singapore's LGBT community. 
An ally has also emerged in Lee Hsien Yang, the prime minister's estranged brother and son of the city-state's modern day founder Lee Kuan Yew, who has become an increasingly vocal critic of the government in the run up to the vote. 
""The tidal wave against discrimination on sexual orientation has swept across the world,"" Lee, whose son is gay and married overseas, told Reuters.
""The British, from whom we 'inherited' 377A, have repealed it decades ago. A repeal merely decriminalises and ends this discrimination.""
Nearly 70 countries around the world criminalise gay sex, mainly in Africa and the Middle East. 
Another rights group Sayoni changed tack ahead of this election. With parties mum on the issue, they decided to score individual politicians on their LGBT stance by reviewing public comments they had made and ranking them from A to F.
Ong says he will vote on Friday based on ""basic needs"" but he hopes that the future will bring change from a younger generation more supportive of gay rights.

""We are sons and daughters of Singapore, whether we are gay or straight, and to vote, I think it should be accounted for.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - For all the predictability of elections in Singapore, one result will be keenly watched when the city-state votes on Friday as finance minister Heng Swee Keat must win an unsafe seat to show people he has what it takes to be a future leader.
Promoted last year to deputy prime minister, 59-year-old Heng is in line to succeed Lee Hsien Loong, as the son of Singapore's modern founder Lee Kuan Yew has said he will step down in coming years.
Having held power since independence in 1965, the People's Action Party (PAP) is expected to notch another victory in the July 10 election.
But in a late re-jig of its nomination list, the PAP has set Heng the task of winning an East Coast seat where it scored just 60.7% of the vote in 2015, among its narrowest winning margins. 
Analysts say the contest will test public support for the mild-mannered technocrat at a time when Singapore is facing its deepest ever recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Heng is thus under pressure not just to win for the PAP, but achieve an emphatic result,"" said Garry Rodan, a political scientist at the University of Queensland.
The East Coast seat is one of Singapore's so-called group representation constituencies, where parties field teams of candidates that include members of ethnic minorities to ensure their representation in the Chinese-majority city-state.
Heng - who steered the central bank through the global financial crisis - has already doled out nearly S$100 billion ($72 billion) in stimulus this year to help carry Singapore through the recession.
Inderjit Singh, a former PAP lawmaker, said even a narrow win would help ""legitimise"" Heng's future premiership as the PAP was expected to lose the seat before the vote was called.
Making his nomination day speech last week, the former central banker and policeman's campaign got off to a rocky start, as he stumbled over his words. 
The flub spawned online memes and was mocked in marketing campaigns by restaurant chain Nandos and the tourism board in neighbouring Malaysia.
Unused to their leaders sounding so unclear, some Singaporeans questioned Heng's ability to represent the country on a global stage, but others said it made him more relatable.
Still, analysts say, Heng's lack of charisma and seemingly soft approach could be a handicap if he needs to persuade people to back unpopular policy decisions.
Lee Kuan Yew once described Heng as ""one of the finest minds among the civil servants"" but questions were also raised about Heng's health after he suffered a stroke and collapsed during a cabinet meeting in 2016.

When he awoke from a six-day coma, Heng scribbled: ""Is there a Cabinet meeting today? Where are the papers?"", according to local media reports.

""Available evidence suggests government forces were involved in mass extrajudicial executions,"" HRW said. It called for the government to hold those responsible to account.
The Burkina Faso government told HRW it will investigate the claims.
Minister of Defence Moumina Cheriff Sy said the killings could have been committed by jihadist groups using stolen army uniforms and logistical equipment. 
""It is difficult for the population to distinguish between armed terrorist groups and the defence and security forces,"" he said.
Burkina Faso has been battling militant groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State since 2017. Hundreds of civilians have been killed and almost a million displaced by the conflict, which is also affecting neighbours Niger and Mali. 
Despite promises to investigate and prosecute previous reports of rights abuses, rights groups say the government had done little.
Concerns over increased reports of abuses by soldiers prompted European Union and Sahel leaders to warn during a security summit on June 30 that any of their troops found guilty of human rights abuses would be punished severely.
The HRW report said the killings in Djibo likely took place between November 2019 and June 2020. Residents who saw the bodies told HRW that the dead were all men.
It said the bodies were left in groups along major roadways, under bridges, and in fields and vacant lots around Djibo. 
""Burkina Faso authorities need to urgently uncover who turned Djibo into a 'killing field,'"" said Corinne Dufka, Sahel director at Human Rights Watch. 
A community leader in Djibo told HRW, ""Many of the dead were blindfolded, had their hands tied up...and were shot in the head.""
Many who spoke to HRW said they were fearful of being killed by government forces as well as jihadi militants.
""At night, so many times I'd hear the sound of vehicles and then, bam! bam! bam! ... And the next morning we'd see or hear of bodies found in this place or that,"" a Djibo farmer said.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Tuesday evening that stricter measures including the lockdown of Belgrade over the weekend would be introduced because of the rising number of coronavirus infections.
Opponents blame the increase on the government and say people should not have to pay the price for another lockdown.
After Vucic's statement, several thousand people began gathering in front of the parliament in Belgrade's central square. 
Around 10 p.m., a small group of protesters pushed past a police cordon, broke through a door and entered the parliament building. But police later pushed them back.
The crowd demanded Vucic's resignation and shouted: ""Serbia has risen."" A Reuters cameraman said the police threw teargas, pushing the crowd away from the parliament building. Police reinforcements later arrived. 
""People gathered spontaneously. Discontent can be felt in the air,"" Radomir Lazovic of the Do Not Let Belgrade Drown opposition group told N1 television.
Serbia, a country of 7 million people, has reported 16,168 coronavirus infections and 330 deaths. But the numbers are spiking and 299 cases and 13 deaths were reported just on Tuesday. 
Epidemiologists and doctors warned that hospitals were running at full capacity and that medical workers were tired. 
In early March, Serbia introduced a lockdown to halt the spread of the coronavirus. 
But in late May, the Balkan country was among the first to open up and set elections for June 21. During the campaign, Vucic's ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (SNS) organised rallies at which people did not wear masks. 
Top party officials, including the president's adviser, were infected after celebrating their election victory in a small room while not wearing masks.

Opposition parties, many of which boycotted the election, criticise Vucic for using the lockdowns to strengthen what they call his autocratic rule.

Guaido - who invoked his position as congress' speaker to assume an interim presidency in early 2019, arguing President Nicolas Maduro rigged his re-election - has called on opposition parties to boycott the December vote due to expected tampering by the unpopular Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse. 
The court named a politician who was expelled from Popular Will earlier this year under accusations of being a shadow ally of the ruling Socialist Party as the new party leader, a move that mirrors its interventions in the Democratic Action and First Justice opposition parties last month.
It has also named directors to the National Electoral Council (CNE), a responsibility the constitution ascribes to the National Assembly. The new CNE leadership proceeded to increase the number of seats in parliament to 277, from 167 currently, citing a population increase in a country where some 5 million people have emigrated to escape crushing poverty.
Leopoldo Lopez, Voluntad Popular's leader, said the party would not obey ""dictatorial impositions.""

""The foreign minister had a long conversation with his counterpart,"" Costa told a news conference. ""It is very important we build a confident relationship.""
Last week Portugal was left off a list of more than 50 countries that Britain considers safe enough for travel without coronavirus-related restrictions, meaning holidaymakers returning from Portugal would have to quarantine for 14 days.
British Transport Minister Grant Shapps said on Monday the decision will be reviewed by July 27. 
""We have maintained permanent contact with the United Kingdom,"" Costa added.
The exclusion will be a major deterrent for British tourists, who accounted for 2.1 million of Portugal's foreign visitors last year, and is set to hurt the country's tourism-dependent economy, especially the southern Algarve region.
Over a dozen countries have imposed restrictions on travel from Portugal as a doggedly high toll of several hundred new cases per day concentrated on the outskirts of Lisbon in the past month has worried authorities.

Portugal has only reported 1,629 fatalities, which it attributes to its high testing rate, though Britain has surpassed the country in terms of tests per million people, according to the worldometer.info website.

Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed Hezbollah, said a ""calm discussion"" was underway with the Beirut government over the idea that would ease the pressure on Beirut's hard currency reserves.
Lebanon is suffering an acute financial crisis and hard currency liquidity crunch. The Lebanese pound has lost some 80% of its value since October, when the long-brewing crisis came to a head.
""We started a discussion...to see where this option can go,"" Nasrallah said in a televised speech. ""This track is moving...What's the result going to be? I don't know. But we have to try,"" he said. Iran will announce its official position on the matter at the appropriate moment, he added. 
The Shi'ite Muslim Hezbollah, which is classified as a terrorist group by the United States, supports Prime Minister Hassan Diab's government.
Nasrallah also criticised the U.S. ambassador to Lebanon, Dorothy Shea, for what he described as interference in the country's affairs.
Hezbollah lawmakers will submit a petition to the foreign ministry to summon her to ask that she adheres to agreements on diplomatic norms, he said.
A Shi'ite judge last month issued a ruling banning media in Lebanon from interviewing Shea after she heaped criticism on Hezbollah, saying her comments had incited sectarian strife.
Shea was later summoned for a meeting at the foreign ministry after which she said the page had been turned on the incident. Lebanese Foreign Minister Nassif Hitti emphasised the importance of media freedom and the right to free expression during the meeting, the ministry said in a statement.

Relations between some NATO members have soured over the Libya as Turkey has accused France of backing Haftar's forces. Paris denies this and accused Turkish warships of aggressive behaviour in a June 10 incident when a French frigate under NATO command tried to inspect a cargo ship suspected of smuggling arms to Libya in violation of a U.N. embargo.
The European Union recognises the GNA but there are differences between member states. Italy, whose state-controlled oil and gas major Eni is the biggest foreign oil producer in Libya, has sent troops to train GNA security forces.
European countries worry about Libya because of its energy supplies and - given its chronic disorder - its role as a major source of undocumented migration to Europe and as a haven for Islamist militants. 

Italian Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini said all parties need to work together to achieve stability in the Mediterrenean, according to the Turkish ministry readout.

The mercurial leader last week signed the anti-terrorism bill, prompting rights groups to stage protests and lawyers to question the law before the Supreme Court.
""For the law-abiding citizen of this country, I am addressing you with all sincerity, do not be afraid if you are not a terrorist,"" he said in a televised national address mainly to update Filipinos on the coronavirus outbreak.
Those not planning to bomb churches and public utilities to derail the nation have nothing to fear, Duterte said, adding that communists are among the terrorists.
The conflict between the government and the armed wing of the communist party has raged for half a century and killed more than 40,000 people. In the volatile south, the Philippines faces piracy, kidnappings and extremism by groups influenced by Islamic State, who occupied a southern city in 2017 and are now increasingly carrying out suicide bombings.
The new law creates an anti-terrorism council appointed by the president, which can tag individuals and groups as terrorists and detain them without charge for up to 24 days. It also allows for 90 days of surveillance and wiretaps, and punishments that include life imprisonment without parole.

Local and international human rights groups had said that while the Philippines does have clear security threats, the legislation could be abused to target administration opponents and suppress peaceful dissent.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday said it was deeply concerned about China's detention of Xu Zhangrun, a law professor who has been an outspoken critic of the ruling Communist Party, and urged Beijing to release him.
Xu, 57, a professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two-term limit for China's leader, which allows Xi to remain in office beyond his current second term.
According to a text message circulated among Xu's friends and seen by Reuters, he was taken from his house in suburban Beijing on Monday morning by more than 20 policemen, who also searched his house and confiscated his computer.
""We are deeply concerned by the PRC's detention of Professor Xu Zhangrun for criticizing Chinese leaders amid tightening ideological controls on university campuses in China. The PRC must release Xu and uphold its international commitments to respect freedom of expression,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus wrote in a tweet.
The detention comes as a new national security law came into effect in Hong Kong last week. The sweeping legislation that Beijing imposed on the former British colony punishes what China defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.
Critics say the aim of the law is to stamp out a pro-democracy movement that brought months of protests, at times violent, to the city last year. 
The imposition of the new law further deteriorated ties between Washington and Beijing, which had been at loggerheads for months over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and a nearly two-year trade war.
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States is ""certainly looking at"" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, suggesting it shared information with the Chinese government, a charge it denied.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The crack of fireworks mixed with gunfire over the Independence Day holiday weekend in New York City.
In Brooklyn's Cypress Hills neighborhood just after midnight on Sunday, a 20-year-old man was fatally shot at a home still decorated with birthday balloons, one of 64 people reported injured or killed over the weekend amid an increase in shootings. 
The man's mother and sister sat in lawn chairs across the street, answering detectives' questions, while local residents continued to illegally light fireworks in the street just beyond the yellow crime-scene tape, a noisy release in a city riven by the coronavirus pandemic and more than a month of protests about police violence.
A little later in Brooklyn's East Flatbush, at about 4:22 a.m., a 19-year-old man and a 27-year-old man were shot. The teenager was pronounced dead at the hospital.
Less than an hour passed before a 40-year-old man was killed in the Langston Hughes public housing project in Brownsville.
""It must bleed that mother's heart to know her baby is no longer here,"" Brenda Coke, 62, said after escorting her sister home to one of the nearby buildings.
There were 205 shootings in June, up 130% from the same period a year before, and 39 murders, according to data released by the New York Police Department this week, although it remains a fraction of the high crime rates seen in the early 1990s, when more than 2,000 New Yorkers were murdered each year. Chicago and other cities have reported similar upticks.
Officials and criminologists do not often agree on the causes of increasing crime, except to say those causes are complex and exacerbated this year by a pandemic that killed more than 23,000 city residents and wreaked havoc on employment and the economy.
""There's not one cause for something like this,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters on Monday. ""The fact that the court system is not working, the economy's not working, people have been pent up for months and months: so many issues underlying this challenge.""
Leaders at the NYPD have taken a different view, blaming a wave of police reforms prompted in part by more than a month of protests against police violence sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
The NYPD's chief of department, Terence Monahan, attributed the rise in part to bail reform and the compassionate release of some prisoners from Riker's Island, the city's main jail, and criticized a new law that makes it crime for police to use restraints that can hamper someone's breathing.
""It means a lot of different individuals are on the street that should not be on the street, and we have seen them involved in violence,"" he told reporters.
Chidi Duke, the program director of a neighborhood non-profit group called East Flatbush Village, said the violence was traumatizing.
""Over the Fourth of July weekend, some kids had to be taken out of a neighborhood because they were scared of the sound of firecrackers after hearing guns fired on their block,"" she said.

CALMATUIU, Romania (Reuters) - Romanian Alberto Gogu worked exhausting shifts in freezing temperatures at Germany's biggest meat-packing plant. An outbreak of coronavirus infections there only made things worse.
So he has quit and gone back to his home village on the River Danube plains to fix up his house and try his hand at goat-farming.
The 44-year-old father of eight had heart surgery but that had not stopped him from unloading heavy boxes packed with pork sausages off a conveyor belt for 7.5 euros (6.77 pounds) per hour at the Rheda-Wiedenbrueck plant in North Rhine-Westphalia.
The coronavirus outbreak did.
""However hard it would be here in Romania, I'm not going to leave again because of the pandemic. I'm scared,"" he told Reuters from his home village of Calmatuiu, 140 km (90 miles) southwest of Bucharest.
All the areas in Germany that had jobs for migrants had high infection rates, he said.
""I have a bit of work to do now at my house,"" Gogu said.
The task at hand was to fix tiles in his bathroom. After he had finished doing up the house, he was going to focus on goats.
""I need to learn more about this market. For the start, because I don't know much about this type of farming, I want to buy 30 goats to produce milk and cheese."" 
Gogu said a scarcity of jobs in Romania, which is also plagued by corruption, forced him to chose Germany to work together with his wife Maria. He did various seasonal jobs ranging from house painter to elderly carer to forklift driver over the past decade.
He had worked at the slaughterhouse three different times.
""Hundreds of Romanians like me quit the slaughterhouse in June fearing the coronavirus infection,"" he said.
Gogu's day at the plant began at 4 a.m. after a one-hour walk from his crammed apartment six km (four miles) from the plant.
His work was a test of fitness and strength, he said.
""Literally, when I got back my room I didn't feel like I could eat nor even take a shower so dirty as I got, I fell into bed.""
The outbreak at the plant, near Guetersloh, forced more than 600,000 people back into lockdown in late June - and started a debate about standards in the German food industry and its reliance on migrant labour, particularly from Romania. Poles and Bulgarians also work there.
The Romanian foreign ministry, citing official German data said last month that a quarter of the nearly 4,000 Romanians at the plant tested positive and are under quarantine.
Gogu's wife Maria, who also worked at the slaughterhouse, has remained in quarantine. The plant has temporarily closed but was still paying her 1,200 euros a month.

""She is contributing now to our dream of having goats,"" Gogu said.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron's reshuffled government took office on Tuesday, with conservatives given prominent roles in efforts to rescue France's coronavirus-ravaged economy from the worst depression in decades.
Reappointed as finance minister, Bruno Le Maire promised a company-focused recovery plan to revive growth, but said he would not lose control over spending.
Le Maire said he faced a ""crushing task"" confronted by the severest economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s. ""My road map is clear and simple: it will be recovery - morning, noon and night.""
The coronavirus crisis has unravelled the hard-fought gains of a liberal economic reform agenda that provoked waves of protests during Macron's first three years in office.
Before the pandemic hit, French growth was among the highest in the euro zone, unemployment was falling and foreign investors were rewarding Macron for deregulating parts of the economy.
But now the jobless rate is rising, the government forecasts the economy will shrink by 11% and debt is spiralling higher.
""It is out of the question that economic stimulus gets done at the expense of well-managed public accounts over the long term,"" Le Maire continued.
The reshuffle saw former conservatives, including Le Maire, in control of the most influential ministries - a sign Macron will seek to consolidate support among centre-right voters ahead of a possible re-election bid.
An Odoxa-Dentsu Consulting poll showed eight in 10 people believed the reshuffle would not lead to a shift in policy direction. 
At least two small groups of feminist protesters targeted the new government. 
Three topless women protested in front of the Elysee Palace, one of them bearing the slogan ""RIP The Promises"", as Macron prepared to convene the cabinet for the first time.
In a second action, protesters took aim at new Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, against whom an investigation into a rape allegation was reopened last month. 
Darmanin, who was previously Macron's budget minister, denies rape.
Macron redrew the political landscape when he swept to power three years ago, carving out a niche in the centre ground and poaching ministers from the left and right. 

On Monday, he let go of several former Socialist ministers, while promoting others from conservative ranks.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal's Goree Island, which for centuries served as a way station in the Transatlantic slave trade, has changed the name of its Europe Square in response to the death of George Floyd in the United States and the global movement it inspired.
It will now be known as Freedom and Human Dignity Square, the municipal council decided.
The palm tree-lined Europe Square, in the shadow of an old French fort at the island's northern tip, was given its name in 1998 in recognition of European funding for renovations at the World Heritage Site.
But some residents thought the name was nevertheless inappropriate.
""The name Europe Square was, in a way, a symbol of friendship between peoples,"" said Doudou Dia, president of the island's tourism commission. 
""But we also said to ourselves...that in another sense it is celebrating the persecutor,"" he said. ""What happened to George Floyd was the final straw."" 
Lying off the Senegalese capital Dakar, Goree was a transit point over several centuries for enslaved Africans being shipped to the Americas. UNESCO designated it a World Heritage Site in 1978. 
These days, it is a popular tourist attraction with its cobblestoned streets and historic houses. It is known primarily for its House of Slaves, which several U.S. presidents, Nelson Mandela and Pope John Paul II have all visited. 
Alassane Niang, a chef from Goree, said the move - which comes as governments around the world consider changing street names and bringing down public monuments associated with racism - was long overdue. 

""For me, it could even be Africans Square. That would be better because the majority who live here are Black,"" he said. ""The Senegalese - Africans - deserve the square.""

(Reuters) - Germany said on Tuesday it wants European Union nations to overcome a deadlock on how to handle refugees and migrants this year, weighing in on a bruising dispute that has divided the 27-member bloc for years.
With Berlin holding the EU's rotating presidency until the end of the year, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said he wanted to get ""at least a political agreement on the most important issues"" to reform the bloc's asylum system that collapsed in 2015 during a major increase in migrant arrivals to Europe.
""It's always (just) a small number of member states willing to admit migrants and this in unworthy of the EU,"" he said.
""If they are entitled to international protection, we should expect solidarity from all EU member states to admit these people. You cannot solve this question by leaving it to Italy, Spain, Malta or Greece.""
That goes to the heart of the dispute in the EU, where ex-communist, eastern countries including Poland and Hungary have dug in their heels, refusing to host any of the people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. 
The EU has turned to tightening its borders and asylum laws, slashing the number of arrivals from more than one million in 2015 to 123,000 last year, according to U.N. data.
Seehofer said he hoped the reluctant countries would now reconsider, though a Polish diplomat stressed any legal obligation to host the new arrivals was a no-go for Warsaw. 
Brussels is due to propose an overhaul of the EU's troubled asylum rules after the 27 national leaders agree on a mass economic stimulus to recover from the coronavirus pandemic - another thorny theme requiring unanimity of all EU countries. 
""Human mobility and cross-border trade... will be essential to recover from the COVID-19 engendered crisis,"" the U.N. migration agency said in a statement on Tuesday, calling on the EU to ensure safe and legal migration, including for job openings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - FBI Director Christopher Wray on Tuesday urged China-born people in the United States to contact the FBI if Chinese officials try to force them to return to China under a program of coercion that he said is led by Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Wray issued the unusual appeal in an address to a think tank in which he reiterated U.S. charges that China is using espionage, cyber theft, blackmail and other means as part of a strategy to replace the United States as the world's dominant economic and technological power.
He said Xi has ""spearheaded"" a program called Fox Hunt aimed at strong-arming people born in China living outside of the country who are regarded as threats to return home in order to silence criticism of Beijing's political and human rights policies.
The families of those who refuse to return are threatened and some have been arrested in China ""for leverage,"" he said
""Hundreds of these Fox Hunt victims that they target live here in the United States, and many are American citizens or green card holders,"" he continued. ""The Chinese government wants to force them to return to China and China's tactics to accomplish this are shocking.""
He related a case in which he said the Chinese government sent ""an emissary"" to visit a family in the United States of an unidentified target who could not be located. The emissary left a message that the target could chose between returning to China or committing suicide, Wray said.
""I want to take this opportunity to note that if you believe the Chinese government is targeting you, that you are a potential Fox Hunt victim, please reach out to your local FBI field office,"" he said.
Wray also said that almost half of nearly 5,000 active FBI counterintelligence cases now underway are related to China.

""We've now reached a point where the FBI is opening a new China-related counterintelligence case about every 10 hours,"" Wray said in his address to the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Institute think tank.

Ahmed Bassam Zaki, in his early 20s, was the target of a campaign on Instagram last week from an account that included postings by women accusing him of sex crimes. He is not known to have addressed the accusations publicly and Reuters was not able to locate a lawyer representing him.
Zaki faces charges of ""attempting to have sex with two girls without their consent and indecent assault against both of them and a third girl"" between 2016 and 2020, as well as blackmail, the public prosecutor said. One of the alleged victims was under 18 at the time.
Zaki was arrested on Saturday. The public prosecutor said late on Monday that a court had ordered him detained for 15 days.
The case has attracted widespread attention from media, religious figures and women's groups in a country where rights defenders say sexual harassment or abuse often goes unpunished.
The legal system is commonly used to enforce conservative social mores, which some say places more blame on women accused of provoking sex crimes than on men for committing them. Several women are being prosecuted for ""promoting debauchery"" online as influencers on the social media platforms TikTok and Instagram.
Al-Azhar, Egypt's top Sunni Muslim authority, appealed for victims to speak out and be supported.
""Women's clothing - whatever it is - is not an excuse for attacking their privacy, freedom and dignity,"" it said. 
Zaki's case is ""a message for every girl and woman to be assured that her right, no matter how late, will not be lost"", said Maya Mursi, head of Egypt's National Council for Women.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Marcin Stasko did not hesitate to vote for the candidate of the small far-right Confederation party in the first round of Poland's presidential election last month, attracted in part by his promise to cut taxes.
But Stasko, a 50-year-old labour inspector, faces a harder decision in Sunday's runoff, when he must choose between the incumbent, Andrzej Duda, a social conservative with a left-leaning economic agenda, and the pro-European mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, who favours a more market-based economy.
""I am a devout person, and I make my life choices based on that,"" said Stasko, a father of three, a standpoint likely to lead him in the end to back the staunchly Catholic Duda.
Many supporters of the Confederation, a motley grouping of free market liberals, fringe anti-Semites and ultra-conservative anti-feminists, are unhappy with the generous welfare programmes of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which supports Duda.
But they also share Duda's belief that Poland is under attack from a liberal West that wants to destroy the nation's traditional Catholic identity and force it to embrace ""alien"" ideas such as LGBT rights.
""Trzaskowski is an enemy of what it means to be Polish, which is tradition, the nation, Christianity ... He supports the attack on our civilisation,"" Stasko said. ""What I disagree with is the socialism, the communism of PiS."" 
Such right-wing voters may hold the key to whether Duda can secure a second five-year term in what has become a tight race. A Duda win would help PiS to press on with reforms of the judiciary that the European Union says erode the rule of law and democratic standards in the country of 38 million people.
WAVE OF ANGER
The Confederation won 6.81% of votes in a parliamentary election last October, one of the best results of any far-right group in Poland since the 1989 end of communism, riding a wave of anger against the establishment among the young.
It believes Poland should leave the EU, although its presidential candidate, Krzysztof Bosak, 38, acknowledges timing might not be right, with a majority of Poles supporting membership.
It wants to further restrict access to abortion in Poland, already among the most limited in Europe, and to cut the number of economic migrants from neighbouring Ukraine.
At the entrance of Bosak's office in Warsaw, posters advertise the All-Poland Youth, a far-right movement with roots in a 1930s organisation that called for an economic boycott of Jews in Poland. Bosak rejects any accusations of anti-Semitism. 
Bosak, who won nearly 7% in the June 28 round, has avoided telling his supporters whom to back in Sunday's runoff.
""I don't want any of our voters to feel overlooked or pigeonholed,"" he told Reuters. ""We ask our voters to follow their... conscience, and we know they are reaching different conclusions.""
Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist, believes a third of Bosak's electorate will support Duda and another third will vote for Trzaskowski.
""Another third might not vote at all,"" she added.
Konrad Korf, a 27-year-old computer programmer from Gdansk, a traditionally liberal city on the Baltic coast, plans to vote for Trzaskowski, after favouring Bosak last month, because of his demands for less state involvement in the economy.
Trzaskowski has said he supports the government's welfare programmes but has pledged to veto any increases in taxes if elected president. 

""Economic freedom is what's most important to me,"" Korf said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Syrian and Russian planes have carried out deadly aerial strikes on schools, hospitals and markets in Idlib province that amount to war crimes, U.N. investigators said on Tuesday in a report that also condemned attacks by Islamist militants.
They said that ""indiscriminate bombardment"" by pro-government forces, ahead of a March ceasefire brokered with Turkey, claimed hundreds of lives and forced one million civilians to flee, which may amount to a crime against humanity.
The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria also accused Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist group that controls part of northwest Syria, of firing artillery into civilian areas ""with no apparent legitimate military objective"".
Fighters from HTS, a group formerly known as Nusra Front, have tortured and executed detainees, it added.
""All sides likely committed war crimes,"" Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. panel, told a news briefing. 
""Children were shelled at school, parents were shelled at the market, patients were shelled at the hospital. Entire families were bombarded, even while fleeing these attacks.""
The report, covering November 2019 until June 2020, was based on overflight data and witness testimony. 
It examines 52 ""emblematic attacks"" in northwest Syria, including 47 attributed to the Russian-backed Syrian government.
""We document two incidents in the report where we think it was Russian airplanes that conducted those attacks,"" said panel member Hanny Megally.
The report said Russian warplanes were solely implicated in a deadly March 5 strike on a poultry farm near Marat Misrin that sheltered displaced people, and in three strikes that damaged a hospital in the rebel-held town of Ariha on Jan. 29.
Russia denies involvement in the latter attack, it said.
The government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has denied many previous U.N. accusations of war crimes.
The region is home to a mix of Islamist militant and opposition groups, many of which fled other parts of Syria as Assad, with Russian backing, seized back territory from them in the nine-year-old conflict.
The U.N. investigators urged major powers to open up a wider humanitarian aid corridor to reach 1.5 million people stuck in cramped tents and not allowed to cross into Turkey.
The U.N. Security Council, which in January allowed a cross-border aid operation to continue from two places in Turkey until July 10, is due to vote by Friday whether to extend it.

The boys, all aged between 15 and 17, had lived in refugee camps on outlying Greek islands. They have no relatives in Europe.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing conflict and poverty countries used Greece as a springboard to European countries in 2015 and 2016, when an EU-brokered accord with Turkey all but halted the flow, trapping many in Greece.
At least 5,200 migrant children from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and Africa currently live in Greece, many of them in harsh conditions.
Tuesday's transfer was part of a voluntary plan to relocate minors from Greek camps to other European countries amid concerns about the impact of the coronavirus on vulnerable groups.
""Europe is doing its duty for those who have the greatest need, and require protection,"" said Irene Agapidaki, special secretary responsible for unaccompanied minors at the Greek migration ministry.
She was speaking from Athens airport after bidding farewell to the children.

(Reuters) - As Confederate Civil War monuments fall across the United States, one central Florida community with a racist past will vote on plans to put up a statue of a Confederate general who lived in the Sunshine State briefly as a child.
The 2019 decision to be the new home of the 9-foot-tall bronze statue of General Edmund Kirby (NYSE:KEX) Smith, now in the National Statuary Hall in Washington, D.C., is under review.
Lake County commissioners will vote on Tuesday whether to ask Florida's governor to find another place for it.
The commission's chair, Leslie Campione, did not respond to requests for comment, but sent Reuters a copy of a draft letter to Republican Governor Ron DeSantis saying the county no longer wants it because the general was not from Lake County and the decision had created ""division and strife in our community.""
DeSantis is an ally of President Donald Trump, who has said ""mobs"" are trying to erase history with efforts to remove or rethink monuments. Trump is campaigning to be re-elected in November.
The debate over Confederate monuments has been a long-simmering battle between those demanding the removal of symbols seen as pro-slavery from the public sphere, and those who believe monuments honor the tradition and history of the South. 
Smith, a member of the Ku Klux Klan, was born in coastal St. Augustine in St. Johns County, about 100 miles northeast of the Lake county seat, Tavares, but grew up in Tennessee.
His statue in the National Statuary Hall will be replaced by that of Florida African-American educator and civil rights pioneer Mary McCleod Bethune.
Reverend Mike Watkins, 60, who is Black, said putting the statue of Smith in the county court house calls attention to the building's racist past.

""That's where the jail was and where the 'Groveland Four' happened,"" he said, referring to four black youths wrongly accused of raping a woman in 1949. One was killed and the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the convictions of the other three.

State television reported the Chinese government's office for flood control raised the response level to III from IV on its four-tier scale, and said 13,117 emergency response and rescue staff had been deployed to deal with the floods. 
As of last Friday, there were 119 people dead or missing nationwide as a result of the rainstorms, while the emergency ministry estimated economic losses to be in excess of 40 billion yuan ($5.7 billion). 
Guizhou, Anhui, Hunan and Hubei provinces were expected to record 250-280 millimetres (10-11 inches) of rain on Tuesday, according to the China Meteorological Administration. In the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus epidemic first erupted in December, a record-breaking 426 millimetres (16.8 inches) of rain fell on Sunday, the official China Daily reported, and authorities were using giant pumps to remove water from flooded roads. 
The official Xinhua news agency reported that a key reservoir for flood control in southeastern Zhejiang province opened its spillways for the first time in nine years to lower water levels. 
With nearly 11 million students set to sit their college exams, the weather agency warned parents to heed forecasts and prepare school journeys carefully.
Exams in some parts of Anhui province were postponed as a result of the worst flooding for 50 years, the local government reported. 
The city of Qianjiang in the central province of Hubei became the first city to issue a Level I flood response alert on Monday after roads and farmland were inundated. 
Authorities in Hubei and neighbouring Hunan province have also issued orange flood alerts - the second highest - with some rivers 2-3 metres higher than warning levels, according to water ministry data. 

State media also reported that 21 people died and another 15 were injured after a bus crashed into a reservoir in southwest Guizhou province. It was not clear how many people were in the bus at the time of the crash or what caused the accident.

KAMENICE, Bosnia (Reuters) - Srebrenica genocide survivor Ramiz Nukic has made himself a promise - he will search for the remains of victims of the mass killing 25 years ago until the last of them is found.
Walking through the woods above his home in the hamlet of Kamenice near Kravice village, Nukic has found remains and personal belongings that have helped identify about 300 out of 1,000 men killed by Bosnian Serb troops there in July 1995.
""It has become my quest,"" said the 59-year-old father of five, explaining that he begun the search 15 years ago hoping to find the remains of his father, uncle and two brothers who went missing after the slaughter. 
""When I find a bone, it's for me as if I found the whole body, I know some mother will get peace,"" Nukic told Reuters, showing a human skull and a bone he found in the forest a couple of weeks ago.
He passes his findings on to investigators of the Institute for Missing Persons, who then match the human remains with DNA samples donated by the relatives of the missing in order to identify them.
The massacre took place 25 years ago this month during the Bosnian war of the 1990s. Bosnian Serb forces commanded by General Ratko Mladic attacked the eastern enclave of Srebrenica, where about 40,000 Bosnian Muslims had found shelter under United Nations protection.
After Srebrenica fell into Serb hands on July 11, 1995, the women and children were separated from men and bussed to territory controlled by the Bosnian army. The men and boys were killed, while others who tried to escape through the woods were captured, detained and executed.
The United Nations war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia had established the killings of more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys constituted genocide, and convicted Mladic and his political mentor Radovan Karadzic of genocide in Srebrenica. 
After the Serbs attacked Srebrenica, Nukic sent his family to the U.N.-protected camp in nearby Potocari while he joined 15,000 men on an escape march through the woods.
He survived and was the only one who returned in 2002 to his village. He found the first skeleton while cleaning his ruined house. 
""About 130 men who were killed here are still unaccounted for,"" he told Reuters at the site of the killings. ""I will not give up searching until the last one of them is found.""

Britain imposed sanctions on 25 Russians and 20 Saudis on Monday as part of post-Brexit measures foreign minister Dominic Raab said were aimed at stopping the laundering of ""blood money"".
""We can only regret such unfriendly steps,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. ""Of course, the principle of reciprocity and some kind of retaliatory response will apply to the extent that it suits the interests of the Russian Federation.""
Asked about the warning from Moscow, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The Foreign Secretary has made clear that this sanctions regime is not intended to target countries. It's a smart tool allowing for the targeted sanctioning of individuals and entities involved in serious violations or abuses of human rights.""
The sanctions targeted Russian nationals who Britain says were involved in the death of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky.

Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer arrested in 2008 after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud, died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.

Mourners, wearing facial protection to guard against spreading the coronavirus, filed into St. Johann's Church past the coffin of Georg Ratzinger, who for many years led the city cathedral's famed Domspatzen boys' choir.
In his later years, Ratzinger faced criticism for his leadership of the choir after allegations surfaced of children having been abused by other staff there. Ratzinger always denied knowledge of the abuse.
""I have never sung under a greater choir master,"" said Reinhard Kreuzinger, a former chorister. ""He took the Domspatzen into the world. Whatever he's accused of - I can't really comprehend that because he was a child of his time.""
Georg and Benedict entered a seminary where they both trained to be priests at the same time in January 1946, after both serving in the army before Nazi Germany’s defeat at the end of World War Two.
The Pope Emeritus paid his brother a final visit in late June, leaving Italy for the first time in seven years.
Even following Benedict's elevation to the papacy in 2005, they remained in close touch, with Georg telling the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that his brother would regularly call him on a private phone whose number only the Pontiff knew.

The Court of Appeal last year ruled that Britain broke the law by allowing arms sales to Saudi Arabia that might have been deployed in the war in Yemen.
The court concluded that Britain's government had erred in law in its decision-making processes on arms export licences to Saudi Arabia, after activists said there was evidence the weapons had been used in violation of human rights statutes.
While the court's decision did not mean Britain had to halt arms exports to Saudi Arabia, it did mean it had to pause the granting of new export licenses to sell arms to the kingdom - Britain's biggest weapons purchaser.
Trade minister Liz Truss said the government had ""now re-taken the decisions that were the subject of judicial review on the correct legal basis, as required"". 
""It follows that the undertaking (given) to the Court – that we would not grant any new licences for the export of arms or military equipment to Saudi Arabia for possible use in Yemen – falls away,"" she said in a written statement.
The legal action against the British government was brought by the Campaign Against the Arms Trade, which wants to end the global arms trade and argued that British weapons were likely to have been used in Yemen in violation of human rights law.
Truss said the review found that Saudi Arabia had ""genuine intent and the capacity to comply with IHL (International Humanitarian Law)""

""On that basis, I have assessed that there is not a clear risk that the export of arms and military equipment to Saudi Arabia might be used in the commission of a serious violation of IHL,"" she said.

The announcement came as Verzilov, publisher of the private Mediazona news outlet, had just been released following a 15-day stint in jail after he was found guilty of petty hooliganism for swearing in public.
Russia's Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said it had discovered Verzilov held a Canadian passport while conducting a search linked to his participation in unauthorised protests last year.
The Investigative Committee said Verzilov had not notified the Russian authorities that he holds dual citizenship, an offence that can lead to a fine or compulsory labour.
Verzilov wrote on Twitter that he was already being questioned by investigators and called the criminal case against him ""crazy"".
Russia in 2014 adopted legislation requiring its nationals to declare their dual citizenship or face criminal prosecution. At the time critics said the law would place people with two passports under suspicion and expressed fear that its aim was to whip up nationalist fervour. 

Verzilov was one of four Pussy Riot activists who ran onto the pitch wearing police uniforms during the final of the 2018 World Cup at Moscow's Luzhniki stadium, a stunt they said aimed to draw attention to human rights abuses in Russia.

In letters to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, published on President Janos Ader's official website, Ader said Hungarian authorities could not clean up all the waste in the Tisza and Szamos rivers.
""It is disappointing that pollution of the Tisza river with waste has not been reduced ... and poses a lasting threat to the fragile ecosystem of the river,"" Ader said in the letter to Zelenskiy. He asked the Ukrainian president to help to resolve the problem urgently.
""Our machines are no longer able to handle the piles of garbage that come in unstoppable quantities,"" Ader said.
Ader, whose role in Hungarian politics is largely ceremonial, said in the letters that since mid-June Hungarian authorities had removed 938 cubic metres of waste from the Tisza river and 846 cubic metres of waste from the Szamos river.
The Tisza, one of the main rivers in eastern Europe, starts in Ukraine and flows across Hungary to join the Danube in Serbia. The Szamos flows from Romania to Hungary and joins the Tisza there. Massive pollution on the two rivers has been a problem for years.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - As soon as Kenya introduced a coronavirus curfew, Dr. Jemimah Kariuki, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Nairobi's Kenyatta Hospital, started seeing more death and complications. 
""Every time I went to the hospital it was fewer numbers but more complications...and when women died alone in childbirth, I was like 'in 2020?' You are dying? Alone?,"" she said.
Mothers in labour and their babies die more frequently during disease outbreaks in Africa. Women are either too afraid of infection to give birth in hospitals, or drivers are too afraid to take them if police are enforcing movement restrictions.
That means disruptions to health systems caused by COVID-19 could result in an additional 1.1 million additional child deaths and 56,700 maternal deaths in low and middle-income countries, a study by Johns Hopkins researchers showed.
In 2014, amid Sierra Leone's Ebola outbreak, the number of women delivering babies at health facilities plunged by 30%, a study by the United Nations Population Fund found. That year, Sierra Leone's maternal mortality ratio rose 3.5%, World Health Organisation data shows.
In the first 10 days of neighboring Uganda's coronavirus lockdown, the lack of transportation killed seven women and two babies, a rights group said.
Kariuki was determined not to let that happen. Police had already beaten a motorobike driver to death after he transported a woman in labour to hospital after curfew and she knew Kenya, like most African nations, had no public ambulance services.
So she started Wheels for Life, a free ambulance service for mothers in labour after dark. The program has received more than 5,000 calls and delivered around 600 babies.
Patients call '1196.' A worker at a call center checks if it is an emergency. If not, they send a taxi with an overnight movement pass. If it is, the call goes to Rescue.co, a subscription-based Uber (NYSE:UBER) service for ambulances that runs a dispatch center.
One such call was from Christine Wanjiru, whose waters broke at midnight. She was stunned when an ambulance appeared within five minutes.
""I didn't expect that,"" Wanjiru said. ""I was so happy.""
Wheels for Life is free. Public partners and corporate donors are covering costs.
Now Dr. Kariuki is hoping it might become permanent.
""We're getting calls from all over the country...we're even getting calls during the day,"" Kariuki said. ""Women don't need to stress about how they are going to get to the hospital.""
A permanent ambulance service could save more lives. About 362 Kenyan women per 100,000 die in childbirth even when there is no pandemic, according to the health ministry.

""Curfew is only part of the problem,"" she said.

1037,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",France-Turkey tensions mount after NATO naval incident,"By John Irish and Robin Emmott
PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - For France, it was the final straw. For Turkey, it was a misunderstanding. For NATO, it could be a turning point.
The incident unfolded quickly in the eastern Mediterranean on June 10, when a French frigate under NATO command tried to inspect a Tanzanian-flagged cargo ship suspected of smuggling arms to Libya in violation of a U.N. embargo.
The French armed forces ministry, speaking on behalf of the government, said the frigate was harassed by three Turkish navy vessels escorting the cargo ship. A Turkish ship flashed its radar lights and its crew put on bulletproof vests and stood behind their light weapons, it said.
Turkey disputes this. It denies trafficking arms to Libya and says the cargo ship, the Cirkin, was carrying humanitarian aid. It has accused the French navy of aggression. 
Turkey's ambassador to France, Ismail Hakkı Musa, said on July 1 the three Turkish warships were helping NATO enforce the U.N. arms embargo.
NATO ordered an investigation, but its contents are classified and NATO has not commented on its outcome. Two European diplomats told Reuters that France sent a letter to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in early July saying the report did not ""correctly establish the facts."" 
The U.S. Pentagon declined to comment on the incident. 
For France, the incident highlights what many NATO allies see as President Tayyip Erdogan's tendency to act against the Western alliance's interests and values.
FRACTURES
After a series of disagreements, from Turkey's purchase of weapons from Russia to gas drilling operations near Cyprus, France concluded that suspicions of Turkish arms smuggling to Libya were too serious to ignore, four NATO diplomats and officials told Reuters.
France has suspended its participation in NATO's Mediterranean mission, Sea Guardian, instead offering its assets to a European Union mission that is upholding the U.N. arms embargo but does not involve Turkish ships, diplomats said.
""What do you do when you have a NATO surveillance mission ... and one of those in the alliance is the one doing the trafficking, while saying it is implementing the (U.N.)embargo?"" said an official from France's armed forces ministry, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The United States, frustrated by Turkey's purchase of Russian S-400 missiles and its military operations in Syria, has been seeking to calm the tensions in NATO, the diplomats said. 
Last October, U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said Turkey was ""going in the wrong direction"". While U.S. President Donald Trump enjoys a close relationship with Erdogan, he urged Turkey in May to help de-escalate the Libyan conflict.
The Pentagon ""strives to preserve our relationship with Turkey while encouraging the Turkish government to pursue more constructive policies regarding the S-400 and other areas of disagreement,"" said U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Campbell, a Pentagon spokesman.
FRENCH DEMANDS 
French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly told the European Parliament on July 2 that NATO must make Ankara realise it cannot ""violate"" NATO rules. But French diplomats also say Paris is not looking to expel Turkey, and NATO has no formal mechanism to punish or expel members.
Still, NATO could threaten to remove assets from Turkey, such as a radar, Patriot missiles or NATO AWACS aircraft.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian wants EU foreign ministers to consider new sanctions on Ankara during a video meeting on July 13.
""The main problem for Europe is Russia. The ambivalence of Turkey, with one foot in each camp, is the troubling factor,"" said Marc Pierini, a former EU ambassador to Turkey with the Carnegie Europe think tank. 
Turkey has the second-largest military in NATO and gives the alliance a strategic presence, notably on the Black and Mediterranean seas. 
""Imagine NATO without Turkey! You would have no NATO,"" ambassador Musa said.
France made four concrete demands of NATO in its July letter to Stoltenberg, the contents of which were laid out to Reuters.
It wants all 30 allies to reaffirm commitment to respecting the U.N. arms embargo on Libya, to ensure NATO signals are not used during national missions, to improve coordination between the NATO and EU missions in the Mediterranean, and to avoid similar incidents in the future.
At the last NATO defence ministers' meeting in late June, via video link, eight countries including Germany, Italy and Spain backed seeking a more cooperative approach from Turkey.
French diplomats cite Turkey signing off on a NATO defence plan for the Baltics and Poland late last month, after holding it up for months, as a first sign of success.
Yet there is a risk of a long-term rift at NATO if Erdogan does not change course, analysts say. 

""Turkey considers itself big enough now to be independent from all sides,"" Pierini said.

The Palestinian Authority, which wants the West Bank for a future Palestinian state, opposes the move. The United States has yet to give its approval to the annexation plans.

The Turkish-flagged ship's activities had been monitored for a long time and migrants were seen boarding the vessel in western Turkey's Izmir province on Monday evening, the coastguard statement said.
It said an operation including coastguard vessels and police teams was launched. The migrants were from countries including Syria, Iran, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Somalia, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported.
Photographs distributed by the coastguard showed security force members watching over those detained in the ship, most apparently wearing face masks to protect against coronavirus.
More than a million people reached Greece from Turkey in 2015-16. A 2016 agreement between the European Union and Turkey for Ankara to take migrants back in return for funds led to a sharp fall in the numbers.
At the end of February, Turkey said it would no longer try to stop people crossing the border into Europe, prompting tens of thousands of migrants to try to cross into Greece via land and sea.
The flow slowed as the new coronavirus spread, but Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday that Turkey would ""continue to implement its decision"" regarding migrants who want to leave the country.

The government said it would double rescue and relief personnel as heavy rain destroyed homes and caused landslides in what is shaping up to be Japan's worst natural disaster since Typhoon Hagibis killed 90 people in October.
Rain front was expected to remain over the area until Thursday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news briefing.
""Rain is expected over a wide front stretching from western to eastern Japan,"" he said.
Police, Self-Defense Force (SDF) and Coast Guard units were carrying out search and rescue efforts, said Suga, urging people to take necessary precautions to keep safe.
The death toll has risen to 56 with missing, according to public broadcaster NHK. It showed swollen rivers, destroyed homes, roads covered in landslides and stranded residents being plucked to safety by military helicopters.
Kyodo News reported at least 71 landslides across 12 prefectures, citing the land ministry, and said more than 1.3 million people had been ordered to leave their homes.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government would double rescue and relief personnel, from day-earlier levels, to 80,000, including some 20,000 SDF troops.
Some companies in the region have temporarily halted operations but Suga said he did not expect major disruptions to supply chains, as happened two years ago when deadly floods also hit Kyushu.
The government will continue to liaise with local firms, Suga said, adding: ""We want to quickly take the necessary steps such as support for small and mid-sized firms depending on the situation ahead."" 
Carmakers  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) and Mazda Motor (OTC:MZDAY), and electronics conglomerate Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp all halted operations at certain plants on Monday due to heavy rain. 
Mazda cancelled the second shift at its plants in Hiroshima, and Hofu, Yamaguchi Prefecture, on Tuesday, with plans to open on Wednesday. Panasonic said its sensor plant in Kagoshima was operating normally on Tuesday.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan police on Tuesday fired teargas and arrested activists gathering for a march against perceived government injustice that has been given extra impetus this year by allegations by rights groups of police brutality during the COVID-19 lockdown.
Activists said protesters from several areas had planned to march from their homes to the centre of the capital Nairobi, but many were dispersed or arrested before reaching there. Samuel Kiriro said six of his colleagues from rights group the Ghetto Foundation in the Mathare slum had been arrested.
For those who made it into the city centre, police fired more teargas and made further arrests, a Reuters witness said.
Activists rally each year on July 7, marking the date in 1990 when opponents of late president Daniel Arap Moi launched a bid to open up multiparty politics. The protest is called ""Saba Saba"" - ""seven seven"" in Swahili - because of the date.
This year, protesters have been galvanised by mounting accusations of police brutality during the coronavirus lockdown.
""The police have been killing a lot of people ... During this pandemic, it has gotten worse,"" said Michael Njau, an activist at Kiamaiko Justice Centre.
Police were not immediately available to respond to multiple requests for comment.
Rights group Amnesty International said Kenyan police had killed at least 100 people in 2020, with 21 related to COVID infractions, such as curfew or mask violations. In March, in the first 10 days of the curfew, at least six people were killed, Human Rights Watch has said.
Over the weekend, protesters in western Kenya set fire to a police station after an officer allegedly killed a hawker for selling fake hand sanitisers. The officer was taken into police custody, a police report seen by Reuters said.
Kenya police spokesman Charles Owino told Kenyan TV station NTV in June, responding to allegations of brutality, it was fair to highlight the issues ""but it is also important for us to try and get results of investigations for each and every matter"" to avoid setting the public against the police.

Since June last year, authorities have shut the internet in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin states - home to about a million people. 
Justified on emergency grounds amid a growing insurgency, it is the longest internet blackout in the world, rights groups say.
""People are in a difficult situation because the internet is being shut down and so activists are doing their duty and organizing protests,"" Maung Saung Kha told reporters at the end of the hearing in a court in the city of Yangon.
The free-speech activist is accused of putting up a protest banner and faces a police lawsuit filed under part of a Peaceful Assembly Law, which outlaws unauthorized assemblies and can carry a maximum three-month prison sentence, a fine or both.
Rakhine State is the region from which hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled in 2017 after a military crackdown that the government said was ordered in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
But since then, a new conflict has emerged between the army and rebels from the largely Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group, a majority in the state. 
Last month, on the anniversary of the internet blackout, a banner reading ""Is the internet being shut down to hide war crimes and killing people?"" was draped on an overpass in the centre of Yangon.
Maung Saung Kha declined to comment to reporters on whether he put the banner up.
Also on the anniversary, Maung Saung Kha organized a virtual protest with hundreds joining a video call. He is not facing charges in connection with that.
He said after the hearing that he should not face charges since no physical assembly had taken place.
The prosecutor declined to comment outside the court.
The next court hearing is due on July 14.
Two youths in Rakhine State also face a lawsuit for taking part in the virtual protest.

In February, nine students were charged under the same law for organizing another protest in Yangon over the internet shutdown.

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Lockdown measures were reimposed in Australia's second biggest city on Tuesday, confining Melbourne residents to their homes unless undertaking essential business for six weeks, as officials scramble to to contain a coronavirus outbreak.
The decision, which affects around 4.9 million people, was announced just hours before the busy border between Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, and New South Wales is scheduled to close for the first time in a century.
From midnight on Wednesday, everyone in Melbourne will be required to stay home unless travelling to work, studying, shopping for food or attending medical appointments. Restaurants, cafes and bars will be able to provide takeaway service only, gyms and hair salons closed, household gatherings limited to two people and the current school vacation extended.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said the restrictions were onerous but necessary.
""I would, with the greatest of respect, put it to you getting this virus and dying from it is very onerous too,"" he said during a televised media conference.
Victoria was responsible for 191 of the 199 new cases reported nationally on Tuesday, the biggest one-day rise since early April. The spike has worried officials, even though the national total of almost 8,800 cases and 106 deaths is far below many other countries.
""We have to be clear with each other that this is not over,"" Andrews said. ""And pretending that it is because we all want it to be over is not the answer. It is indeed part of the problem. A very big part of the problem.""
Andrews had over the weekend reinstated strict social-distancing orders in more than 30 Melbourne suburbs and put nine public housing towers into complete lockdown because of the recent outbreak.
Hundreds of police officers and army troops were being deployed to enforce the closure of Victoria's border with New South Wales from midnight on Tuesday. 
The state line is highly porous, stretching hundreds of kilometres. It is heavily used daily by commuters, school children and road freight. 
People caught crossing the border without permission via any of the 55 roads, or several river and wilderness crossings, will face penalties including a fine of A$11,000 ($7,700) and six months imprisonment.
A second region in Victoria, where recent COVID-19 cases have been detected and which is home to 44,000 people, will face lockdown restrictions similar to Melbourne.
The border closure and reintroduction of restrictions in Melbourne deal a blow to Australia's hopes for quick economic recovery as it approaches its first recession in nearly three decades, driven by social distancing restrictions imposed in March.
BORDER CONTROL
For businesses on the border, which last closed during the Spanish flu pandemic in 1919, it also poses an immediate logistics headache.
Daily travel permits will be granted to people who live in border towns and cities but with the closure just hours away, the application system was still being developed. 
Kevin Mack, the mayor of Albury, a border town on the NSW side, said with an estimated 50,000 car movements across the state line every day ""it will be a nightmare for everyone.""
""About a quarter of my staff like me live in NSW, and cross that border every day to come to work,"" said Paul Armstrong, who runs a petrol station in Wodonga, a border town on the Victorian side. ""I don't know if they are going to be able to get in."" 

Outside of the border towns, Victoria residents will be able to apply for a permit, but will need to prove a special need for their travel. Freight transporters will be free to cross the border without a permit, but will be subjected to random stops.

Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and tolerates little criticism.
Nguyen Quoc Duc Vuong, 29, was charged with ""making, storing, spreading information, materials, items for the purpose of opposing the state"" at a one-day trial in the Central Highlands province of Lam Dong, the Ministry of Public Security said in a news release.
Vuong was accused of livestreaming 110 hours of videos and writing 366 posts on his Facebook account to smear the image of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam's founding leader, and spread anti-state propaganda, the ministry said.
Reuters could not reach Vuong's lawyer for comment.
Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, said Vuong's sentencing was ""outrageous and unacceptable"".
""Vietnam must recognise that expressing political views contrary to Communist Party line should not be a crime,"" he said in an email statement.
The court will also place Vuong under three years of house arrest after serving his jail term, the ministry said.
Arrests of political activists in Vietnam have steadily increased since late last year as Vietnam gears up for a key Party congress in January 2021.

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 05:11AM ET</span>","In Tokyo, a temple offers pandemic-hit Vietnamese workers a safe haven","By Sakura Murakami
TOKYO (Reuters) - A few hours after sundown last week, Thi Tu Luong dragged her suitcase down a side street in Tokyo's business district, looking for the temple that would take her in for the night.
Luong, a 22-year old Vietnamese worker, had just been fired from her job at a hotel in a hot springs town north of Tokyo.
After a few minutes of walking the street, she saw Jiho Yoshimizu, who runs a support group for Vietnamese workers, waving her in from the entrance of a concrete building.
The three-storey Buddhist temple, Nisshinkutsu, has become a haven for young Vietnamese migrant workers, one of the groups hardest-hit by the economic slump that followed the novel coronavirus outbreak in Japan.
""I felt abandoned,"" said Luong, shortly after she arrived at the temple. ""I'm just really grateful I can be here.""
Lured by higher wages but often burdened by debt to recruiters, Vietnamese are the fastest-growing group of foreigners in Japan. They numbered 410,000 in 2019, up 24.5% from the previous year.
In ordinary times, nuns at the temple would offer prayers for the deceased, but with the coronavirus upending the economy, they now spend their time making care packages for Vietnamese scattered across the country.
Inside the temple, young Vietnamese workers whose lives are in limbo study Japanese, cook Vietnamese food, look for work or book flights home. 
""We do everything. We take care of people from when they're inside the womb to when they're inside an urn,"" said Yoshimizu, who heads the Japan-Vietnam Coexistence Support Group, a nonprofit based out of the temple.
The temple became known to Vietnamese circles after it took in Vietnamese workers who were left homeless after the 2011 earthquake in northern Japan. 
As Yoshimizu's reputation spread in the community, she started receiving messages from young Vietnamese – including women seeking abortions, workers who were abruptly dismissed with nowhere to go, and labourers fleeing abusive employers. 
In 2019, Yoshimizu handled about 400 cases, but since April that number has spiked. She now receives between 10 and 20 messages a day, all pleas for help from Vietnamese across Japan.
""I've lost count,"" she said, sitting next to a phone that beeps and rings ceaselessly with calls and messages from labour brokers, employers, and desperate Vietnamese workers. 
""No one else in Japan right now can provide this kind of support,"" she said. 
When Luong was fired without warning and told to leave her dorm, she turned to Yoshimizu for help. 
""I have no job, no place to stay right now. Please, please help me,"" Luong messaged Yoshimizu. ""Can I come to the temple today?""
Luong graduated from a vocational school in March and started a job in mid-April at a high-end hotel in Nikko, a tourist destination known for its temples. 
But she said she wasn't given any work and spent her days in a dorm room with nothing to do. Luong said she was paid about 30,000 yen ($279.04) in May and was not sure if she had been paid in June. A representative of the hotel where she worked told Reuters they were not in a position to comment because they did not employ Luong directly. 
Many Vietnamese workers arrive in Japan as students or trainees, making them dependent on their employers and therefore vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
Yoshimizu spoke in parliament last month to urge the government to do more to support Vietnamese students who do not have employment insurance.

""The current government's coronavirus policy is focused on helping the Japanese first,"" Yoshimizu said.

1049,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 07, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>","Hong Kong security law is not doom and gloom but is a red line, leader says","By Yanni Chow and Carol Mang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's national security law does not spell ""doom and gloom"", its leader said on Tuesday, as she tried to calm unease over legislation that critics say could quash freedoms that have underpinned the city's success as a financial hub.
In an illustration of worries about the law, the video app TikTok said it was preparing to leave the Hong Kong market, and other tech firms said they have suspended processing Hong Kong government requests for user data.
The sweeping legislation that Beijing imposed on the former British colony punishes what China defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison. 
It came into force at the same time it was made public, just before midnight last Tuesday, with police arresting more than 300 people in protests the next day - about 10 of them, including a 15-year-old, for suspected violations of it.
""Surely, this is not doom and gloom for Hong Kong,"" the city's Beijing-backed leader, Carrie Lam, told a weekly news conference.
""I'm sure, with the passage of time ... confidence will grow in 'one country, two systems' and in Hong Kong's future.""
The legislation has been criticised by democracy activists and Western governments, for undermining freedoms guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula agreed when Hong Kong return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Both Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said the law, which gives mainland security agencies an enforcement presence in the city for the first time, was vital to plug holes in national security defences, exposed by the city’s failure to pass such legislation itself as required under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
Lam said cases involving the new mainland agents would be ""rare"", but nevertheless, national security was a ""red line"" that should not be crossed.
The legislation was not harsh when compared with that of other countries, she said.
""It is a rather mild law. Its scope is not as broad as that in other countries and even China,"" she said.
Critics say the aim of the law is to stamp out a pro-democracy movement that brought months of protests, at times violent, to the city last year.
Late on Monday, Hong Kong released details of how the law would be implemented, outlining police powers over the internet, including the ability to ask publishers to remove information deemed a threat to national security.
Internet firms and their staff face fines and up to one year in jail if they do not comply and police can seize their equipment. The companies are also expected to provide identification records and decryption assistance.
But Lam said she had not noticed widespread fears and the law would restore the city's status as one of the safest in the world after the violent pro-democracy protests last year. 
'TIME AND FACTS' 
Despite her assurances, the law has had a chilling effect.
""If Hong Kong police and the government do not get information from Facebook, they may have other means,"" said 45-year-old playwright Yan Pat-To. 
""The fear has spread over freedom of expression."" 
Shortly after the law came into force, pro-democracy activists such as Joshua Wong disbanded their organisations while others have left.
Many shops have removed protest-related products and decorations and public libraries have removed some books seen as supportive of the democracy movement. Canada has suspended an extradition treaty with Hong Kong.
TikTok, a video app owned by China-based ByteDance said it would exit the Hong Kong market within days. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said late on Monday the United States was ""certainly looking at"" banning Chinese social media apps, including TikTok, amid concern they were not in a position to decline Chinese government requests.
TikTok, which has sought to emphasise its independence from China, has been banned in India.
 Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), which also owns WhatsApp and Instagram,  Google Inc  (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) suspended processing government requests for user data in Hong Kong.
The final power of interpretation of the law lies with authorities in mainland China, where human rights groups have reported arbitrary detentions and disappearances. China has been clamping down on dissent and tightening censorship.
China's official Procuratorial Daily paper said authorities had launched a special taskforce to ramp up political policing to maintain social stability. 
The news came on the day that Xu Zhangrun, a Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of the ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping, was taken away by authorities.
Lam, asked about media freedom, said if reporters could guarantee they would not breach the new law, she could guarantee they would be allowed to report freely.

""Ultimately, time and facts will tell that this law will not undermine human rights and freedoms,"" she said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police on Tuesday said they will summon reporters of news broadcaster Al Jazeera for questioning over a documentary on the country's arrests of undocumented migrants, which authorities have accused of being an attempt to tarnish Malaysia's image. 
""Locked up in Malaysia's Lockdown"", produced by the Qatar-based station's 101 East news programme, focused on the plight of thousands of undocumented migrants detained during raids carried out in areas under tight coronavirus lockdowns. 
The documentary, which aired last week, sparked an immediate backlash online while several officials decried the report as being inaccurate, misleading and unfair.
The backlash comes amid concerns over crackdowns on press freedoms under Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin’s government, which came into power in March, as well as rising anger towards foreigners and refugees, who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and burdening state resources.
Defence minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob this week called on Al Jazeera to apologise to Malaysians, and said allegations of racism and discrimination against undocumented migrants were untrue.
Authorities had previously defended the arrests as necessary to uphold the law and stem the spread of the pandemic. 
Police will call in Al Jazeera staff as part of a probe opened after several complaints filed against the documentary, Inspector-General of Police Abdul Hamid Bador told reporters on Tuesday.
""It is the police's responsibility to investigate to see if there are any elements of sedition or wrongdoing,"" he said, according to a video of his comments posted by news portal Malaysia Gazette.
Spokespeople for Al Jazeera did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
Separately on Tuesday, Malaysia's immigration department issued a search notice for a Bangladeshi national whose name, details and photos match those of a migrant worker interviewed in the documentary. 
The investigation is the latest in a recent series of clampdowns against reporters and activists that rights groups say are aimed at stifling dissent.
In May, a journalist from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post was questioned by police over her reporting on the migrant arrests.

GUATEMALA CITY/PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged two sons of former Panamanian President Ricardo Martinelli in connection with bribery and money laundering linked to Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht, according to a federal complaint unsealed on Monday.
Luis Enrique Martinelli, 38, and Ricardo Alberto Martinelli, 40, were arrested earlier in the day in Guatemala City as they attempted to board a flight to Panama, and face extradition to the United States, Guatemala's police said in a statement.
A Martinelli family spokesman did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the charges.
But the family said in a statement following the arrest that it was working to ensure the sons have legal assistance in Guatemala and are able to transfer the proceedings to Panama.
Odebrecht has been at the center of a far-reaching Latin American corruption scandal uncovered in 2014, in which the company paid more than $700 million in bribes to government officials in various countries.
The U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement the Martinelli sons are accused of having been intermediaries for the payment of about $28 million in bribes from Odebrecht to a high-ranking Panama official between 2009 and 2014, the period in which their father was in office.
The criminal complaint filed in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, on June 27, described the brothers as ""close relatives"" of the official, without providing further detail. 
The complaint also alleges that the pair managed secret bank accounts under shell company names to facilitate payment of the bribes, with many transactions made through U.S. banks. 

Former President Martinelli and his successor, Juan Carlos Varela, were last week banned from leaving Panama while under investigation for money laundering in separate corruption cases.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand police and security services were warned of a threat against another mosque for the same day that a gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch in 2019, an Islamic women's group told an inquiry into the shooting massacre.
The Islamic Women’s Council of New Zealand said it warned police and security services repeatedly about threats from white supremacists, including when they received a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message threatening to burn the Quran outside a mosque in Hamilton on March 15, 2019, the same day as the Christchurch attack. 
Although the threat was not directly connected to the mass shooting, extra security measures could have been taken at all mosques, said the submission to the closed-door inquiry which was made public on Tuesday.
""The police had enough intelligence to warrant a coordinated national strategy,"" the group said in the 130-page submission
""If there had been such a strategy, then the message would have alerted every mosque in the country to a threat to one mosque on Friday 15 March 2019 and for all mosques to take extra security measures. Whether or not the threat was connected to the Christchurch killer is irrelevant."" 
Armed with semi-automatic weapons, Australian Brenton Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, attacked two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019, broadcasting New Zealand's worst mass shooting live on Facebook. 
Tarrant has pleaded guilty and a court will begin his sentencing on Aug 24.
The Islamic Women’s Council submission said police, security services and government representatvies were focused only on combating terrorism by Muslim extremists, leaving the community vulnerable to the rising alt-right movement.
""Evidence indicates that public sector employees were, at best, asleep on the job and, at worst, intentionally
ignoring our pleas and actively undermining our work,"" Aliya Danzeisen, who leads the group's government engagement, said in a statement.
Police said no comment would be made until the Royal Commission had concluded. However, on the specific threat in the report it said the person was identified and formally warned.
A government spokesman said the government will wait for the Commission’s report before making any comment.
The Royal Commission inquiry into the shooting massacre is due report its finding by end of July.
Threats to the Muslim community have continued since the attack, with a threatening social media post appearing earlier this year.
New Zealand, unlike the United States or Britain, has never recorded specific hate crime offences, raising questions about what signs security agencies may have missed. 

Islamic Women’s Council estimates there would not be a Muslim woman in New Zealand who wears the head scarf who has not been abused in public at some time.

(Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell was detained on Monday in a troubled U.S. jail in Brooklyn where she will undergo humiliating searches and be denied nearly all possessions, a far cry from the luxury estate where she was arrested as an accused accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein.
Maxwell, 58, arrived at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn on Monday and is expected to appear in a Manhattan courtroom on Friday when a judge will consider a government request to detain her without bail.
""You go from living a life like Maxwell to all of a sudden being in a situation where you’re being strip-searched and having people look into your body cavities,” said Cameron Lindsay (NYSE:LNN), a former warden at the MDC. ""That is a crushing experience.""
Christian Everdell, a New York lawyer for Maxwell, did not respond to a request for comment.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have accused the socialite of luring underage girls so that Epstein could sexually abuse them at lavish mansions in Palm Beach, Florida; New Mexico and Manhattan.
Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking minors between 2002 and 2005 when he was found hanging by his neck in a different federal jail in New York City in August. Medical examiners concluded his death was a suicide.
Epstein's demise added to the mystery of his rise from a high-school math teacher to a globe-trotting money manager with powerful connections that victims said allowed him to abuse minors with impunity.
Lindsay said MDC officials will have to weigh whether to keep Maxwell in her 10-foot-by-12-foot (about 3-meter-by-3.7-meter) cell alone or housed with another female prisoner.
A cellmate might help prevent her from attempting suicide, a critical issue following Epstein's death, but Lindsay said the nature of her charges and her high profile also makes her a target.
For other prisoners, injuring Maxwell ""would be a badge of honor,"" said Lindsay.
Maxwell's life with Epstein was one of private jets, Caribbean islands and partying with luminaries including Prince Andrew of the United Kingdom.
After Epstein's arrest, she was hiding out on a 156-acre (63-hectare) estate in New Hampshire and had access to 15 bank accounts with combined balances that at times topped $20 million, according to court records.
At the MDC, Maxwell will be issued a T-shirt and other basic clothing, a thin mattress, pillow and blanket. She may be allowed to have an approved religious medallion or book, such as the Bible, according to Lindsay. 
Detainees ""have nothing of their personal property,"" he said.
Her new location, with a capacity of 1,600 men and women, has had its share of famous residents, including singer R. Kelly, accused of sex abuse, and Martin Shkreli, a former chief executive convicted of defrauding investors and dubbed ""pharma bro"" by New York tabloids.
Lindsay said the jail is known among Bureau of Prison staff for its problems over the years.
Last year a lawsuit alleged a ""humanitarian crisis"" was unfolding at the jail after a power failure at the center left prisoners enduring days of frigid temperatures in dark cells.

At the start of the COVID-19 crisis in New York in March, the MDC was among the jails that judges declined to send defendants because of fears about overcrowding and the spread of the novel coronavirus.

The taskforce should ""crack down on all kinds of infiltration, subversion, sabotage, violent terrorist activities, ethnic separatist activities, and extreme religious activities,"" according to the undated notes from a meeting of the taskforce published in the paper on Monday.
The news of the taskforce came on the same day that a Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of China's ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping was taken away by authorities.
The main responsibility of the taskforce is to safeguard China’s political system. ""Political security is related to national safety and people's well-being,"" according to the notes. 
Referencing the fight against coronavirus, the notes said a government can only guarantee its people's safety if it maintains a stable political environment. 
The taskforce is part of the ""Build a Peaceful China"" coordination group set up in April and led by Guo Shengkun, China's top law enforcement official.
It's launch comes after China’s parliament passed national security legislation for Hong Kong at the end of June which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
Hong Kong has been rocked by large, and sometimes violent, pro-democracy protests since mid-2019.
The new security laws have been criticised by pro-democracy activists, lawyers and foreign governments who fear it would be used to stifle dissent and undermine freedoms the former British colony was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

The day after the law came into effect, one man was arrested for carrying a Hong Kong independence flag.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China on Monday joined a global arms trade treaty spurned by the United States, taking a swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's administration by accusing it of bullying, unilateralism and undermining efforts to combat global challenges.
China's U.N. ambassador, Zhang Jun, said he had deposited China's instrument of accession to the treaty, which regulates a $70 billion global cross-border trade in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers.
China, which announced its plans in September, becomes the 107th party to the pact, approved by the U.N. General Assembly in 2013. Then-U.S. President Barack Obama signed it, but it was opposed by the National Rifle Association and never ratified by the U.S. Senate.
Trump said in April last year that he intended to revoke the status of the United States as a signatory. In July 2019, the United States told U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Washington did not intend to become a party to the treaty and that it had no legal obligations from its 2013 signature. 
Without naming the United States, but amid escalating tensions between Beijing and Washington, Zhang said in a statement that a ""certain country ... walked away from international commitments, and launched acts of unilateralism and bullying.""
""This has brought huge uncertainties to the global strategic balance and stability, and seriously undermined the joint efforts of all countries to tackle global challenges,"" he said, adding that ""major powers need to ... set an example by contributing to safeguarding the international order, the rule of law, the role of the U.N. and multilateralism.""
The U.S. mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Zhang's remarks. 

China was the fifth-largest global arms exporter between 2014 and 2018, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, although China itself does not publish figures for how many arms it exports.

Choe said on Saturday that North Korea does not feel the need for a new summit, days after South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who had offered to mediate between Kim and Trump, suggested the two leaders meet again before the U.S. elections in November.
""It is just the time for it to stop meddling in others' affairs but it seems there is no cure or prescription for its bad habit,"" Kwon said in a statement carried by the official KCNA news agency. 
""Explicitly speaking once again, we have no intention to sit face to face with the United States."" 
Trump and Kim met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes for a negotiated end to Pyongyang's nuclear programmes. But their second summit, in 2019 in Vietnam, and subsequent working-level negotiations fell apart. 
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who led the talks with the North Koreans, was due to arrive in Seoul late on Tuesday for talks with Seoul officials over ways to revive the negotiations. 
Biegun said last week there is time for both sides to re-engage and ""make substantial progress,"" but the coronavirus pandemic would make an in-person summit difficult before the U.S. presidential elections on Nov. 3. 

Last month, North Korea abruptly raised tensions with South Korea and blew up a joint liaison office, just on its side of the border, before just as suddenly suspending plans for unspecified military actions.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The January U.S. drone strike in Iraq that killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and nine other people represented a violation of international law, a U.N. human rights investigator said on Monday. 
The United States has failed to provide sufficient evidence of an ongoing or imminent attack against its interests to justify the strike on Soleimani's convoy as it left Baghdad airport, said Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. 
The attack violated the U.N. Charter, Callamard wrote in a report calling for accountability for targeted killings by armed drones and for greater regulation of the weapons.
""The world is at a critical time, and possible tipping point, when it comes to the use of drones. ... The Security Council is missing in action; the international community, willingly or not, stands largely silent,"" Callamard, an independent investigator, told Reuters.
Callamard is due on Thursday to present her findings to the Human Rights Council, giving member states a chance to debate what action to pursue. The United States is not a member of the forum, having quit two years ago.
Soleimani, leader of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, was a pivotal figure in orchestrating Iran's campaign to drive U.S. forces out of Iraq, and built up Iran's network of proxy armies across the Middle East. Washington had accused Soleimani of masterminding attacks by Iranian-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region.
""Major General Soleimani was in charge of Iran military strategy, and actions, in Syria and Iraq. But absent an actual imminent threat to life, the course of action taken by the U.S. was unlawful,"" Callamard wrote in the report.
The Jan. 3 drone strike was the first known incident in which a nation invoked self-defense as a justification for an attack against a state actor in the territory of a third country, Callamard added. 
Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on an Iraqi air base where U.S. forces were stationed. Hours later, Iranian forces on high alert mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner taking off from Tehran.

Iran has issued an arrest warrant for U.S. President Donald Trump and 35 others over Soleimani's killing and has asked Interpol for help, Tehran prosecutor Ali Alqasimehr said on June 29, according to the semi-official Fars news agency.

PARIS (Reuters) - France is creating three beefed-up ministries to spearhead its recovery from coronavirus turmoil as Emmanuel Macron attempts to recast his presidency less than two years before a possible re-election bid.
In a cabinet reshuffle days after voters punished Macron and his party in local elections, the president and his new prime minister, Jean Castex, are putting the focus on tackling the pandemic's social and economic fallout, and the environment.
Macron, 42, swept into power in 2017 promising to cut corporate taxes and ease regulation to drive growth and create jobs, while protecting the most vulnerable. But the worst depression in decades has reversed some hard-fought gains and left Macron with 21 months to persuade voters that his reforms will leave them better off.
On the eve of the reshuffle, Macron said his 2017 campaign promises remained central to his policymaking. But he said they must ""adapt to international upheavals and the crisis we are living through: a new path must be drawn.""
Political rivals denounced the reshuffle as window-dressing that would not deliver the ""new path"" Macron promises. 
Bruno Le Maire, who spent heavily to keep flagship companies afloat and save jobs during the lockdown, will stay at the helm of a finance ministry tasked with steering France out of the downturn, and now has full control of the budget.
Elisabeth Borne will take charge of an enhanced labour and social affairs ministry just as the depression unravels gains on unemployment. Macron wants to reset relations with unions and voters after waves of protests.
Borne, who successfully pushed through changes to French railways in the face of union opposition, will be in charge of seeing sensitive pension reforms over the line.
GREENER POLICIES?
A week after the Green party seized control of some of France's biggest cities, including Lyon and Bordeaux, establishing themselves as a real political force, Macron also named former ecologist Barbara Pompili as environment minister.
Pompili's ministry will oversee energy and housing as Macron seeks more emphasis on green policies to drive the economic rebound and build a sustainable future for companies like Air France and  Renault  (PA:RENA).
In 2018, she chaired a parliamentary committee that delivered a report critical of France's nuclear power industry. A senior source inside state-owned utility EDF (PA:EDF) described her appointment as disastrous for the sector. 
But Greenpeace France said it was sceptical how much influence over environmental policymaking Pompili would have. 
A presidential aide said the theme for the main economic briefs was ""continuity"", in a sign Macron will not veer left and will seek to consolidate his centre-right base ahead of 2022.
Macron's appointment of Castex, a little-known senior civil servant, as prime minister was taken as a sign by rivals he was intent on taking back full control of policy ahead of elections in 20022.
They said the changes fell short of the reinvention Macron had promised.

""It's a game of musical chairs,"" Alexis Corbiere, a lawmaker for the far-left France Unbowed party, told BFM TV. ""Let's be frank, it's a roadmap for more of the same.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York prosecutors have charged a white woman who in May accused a Black man of threatening her life in New York's Central Park with filing a false police report, Manhattan's district attorney said on Monday.
The district attorney Cy Vance said Amy Cooper, 41, faces an Oct. 14 arraignment over the incident, which was captured on a video that went viral and touched off a national conversation about ""white privilege."" 
""We are strongly committed to holding perpetrators of this conduct accountable,"" Vance said in a statement.
Filing a false report is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in jail.
Cooper had been walking her dog on May 25 in an area of Central Park known as the Ramble when she encountered Christian Cooper, an avid bird-watcher not related to her.
Christian Cooper has said he asked her to leash her dog, and when she refused offered the dog treats.
Amy Cooper was shown in the video saying she would tell the police ""there's an African-American man threatening my life,"" which was false, and telling a 911 operator that Christian Cooper was threatening her and her dog, referring to him twice as ""African-American.""
The video has more than 44.7 million views on Twitter.
The incident occurred a few hours before the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, where a police officer pinned his neck to the ground with a knee, touched off nationwide protests over racial injustice.
After video of the Central Park incident went viral, Cooper was fired from her job at the Franklin Templeton asset manager, and she publicly apologized.
In a statement on Monday, Cooper's lawyer Robert Barnes said she would be found not guilty, and faulted a ""rush to judgment"" by some about the case.
""She lost her job, her home, and her public life. Now some demand her freedom?"" Barnes said. ""How many lives are we going to destroy over misunderstood 60-second videos on social media?""

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Gunmen in Baghdad shot dead a well-known former government advisor and political analyst near his home on Monday in a rare high-profile killing in the Iraqi capital, government officials, police sources and medics said.
The government officials described the killing of Hisham al-Hashemi, who had written about politics, Islamic State and the role of Iran-backed militias in Iraq, as a targeted killing but did not point the finger at any particular group.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Hashemi's killing.
It comes at a time of rising tension between the new government of Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi and powerful Iran-backed militias and political parties who oppose him and accuse him of siding with the United States.
Police sources said two gunmen on a motorbike carried out the killing, with one shooting him outside his house in the Zayouna district in eastern Baghdad.
Hashemi, who was well-connected with politicians, activists and paramilitary officials, worked as an advisor to former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi and informally with the government of current Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a government official said.
Kadhimi issued a statement offering his condolences. Iraq's state paramilitary organization, which is dominated by Iran-backed groups, called for an investigation of his death.
The new prime minister has come under increasing pressure from Iran-aligned militias since he took office in May.
An arrest raid that targeted one of the most hardline Iran-backed militias last month angered paramilitary groups, which pressed the government to release those detained. 
Most of the militiamen were released almost immediately.
Kadhimi presides over a government which must balance the competing interest of the United States and Iran, Iraq's two main allies.
The United States wants the Iraqi government to put a stop to regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities, which Washington blames on Iran-backed militias. 
Iran's allies in Iraq demand a withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country, which the United States invaded in 2003, toppling dictator Saddam Hussein and paving the way for Iran to entrench its influence over Baghdad.
Kadhimi took office after being viewed as acceptable to both sides.

Ethnic violence in Ituri, where a conflict between Lendu farmers and Hema herders between 1999 and 2007 resulted in an estimated 50,000 deaths, broke out again in 2017. Hundreds have been killed and hundreds of thousands forced to flee. 
Now, Congo's government is turning to some of the main players from the previous conflict to try to resolve the current one, dispatching a delegation that arrived in Ituri last week. 
Governor Jean Bamanisa said one of the members of the delegation is Germain Katanga. The International Criminal Court (ICC) convicted Katanga in 2014 on one count of crimes against humanity and four of war crimes for leading a Lendu militia in a 2003 attack on a village that killed about 200 civilians.
He was released earlier this year after serving over a decade in prison in The Hague and in Congo. 
Another delegation member is Mathieu Ngudjolo, who was acquitted by the ICC in 2012 of charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the same attack. 
The delegation will begin travelling around the province later this week to meet members of the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo, whose fighters are mostly drawn from the Lendu community, Bamanisa told Reuters. 
""It could take more than 45 days to travel everywhere,"" he said. ""It is a mystical-religious community group, and not structured."" 

Late last year Congo's army launched a large-scale operation against militias in the east of the country, but that sparked a backlash in which armed groups killed several hundred people.

After the shooting, protesters quickly descended on the police station, throwing rocks and setting bonfires, damaging the station and nearby vehicles. 
Fourteen police officers were injured and protesters dispersed after an ""unquantified number of live and blank ammunitions were used"", the report said.
Accusations of police brutality are common in Kenya. Since the coronavirus outbreak, multiple cases of alleged police violence towards lockdown violators have been reported.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the alleged accomplice of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, has been moved to a jail in New York, according to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, where she faces charges of facilitating a sex-trafficking ring.
Maxwell, 58, was arrested on Thursday in New Hampshire and had been held over the weekend at the Merrimack County Jail, a medium-security facility 20 miles (32 km) from the luxurious home where investigators said she had been lying low.
The defendant is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, the prison bureau said on Monday. 
Conditions there sparked public outcry last year after an electrical fire cut power and heat to roughly 1,600 prisoners during one of the coldest weeks of 2019. 
Prosecutors have accused Maxwell, the daughter of the late British media magnate Robert Maxwell, of luring and grooming underage girls so that Epstein could sexually abuse them.
In some cases, Maxwell herself participated in the abuse, according to an indictment unsealed last week.
Maxwell is expected to make her first appearance in federal court in Manhattan on Friday on four criminal counts related to procuring and transporting minors for illegal sex acts and two counts of perjury. https://reut.rs/3dYAVPP
Epstein had been awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking minors between 2002 and 2005 when he was found hanged at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan in August. Medical examiners concluded his death was a suicide. 
Maxwell was a former Epstein girlfriend who became a longtime member of his inner circle.
In a 2003 Vanity Fair article, Epstein was quoted as saying Maxwell was his best friend. 
The indictment said Maxwell lured girls beginning in 1994 through 1997 by asking them about their lives, schools and families and taking them shopping or to movies. 
After Maxwell won the girls' trust, the indictment alleged, she would try to ""normalize sexual abuse"" by discussing sexual topics or by undressing in front of them or being present when they were undressed.
Epstein's alleged abuse included touching their genitals, placing sex toys on their genitals and having the girls touch Epstein while he masturbated.
Maxwell faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted.
Prosecutors have said Maxwell is a flight risk, and have asked that she be detained without bail.
Christian Everdell, a New York-based lawyer for Maxwell, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maxwell's transfer was handled by the U.S. Marshals Service.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong released additional details of China's new national security law for the former British colony on Monday, saying security forces had overriding authority to enter and search properties for evidence and stop people from leaving the city.
Hong Kong returned to China on July 1, 1997, under a ""one country, two systems"" formula guaranteeing wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary.
But under China's new legislation, crimes of secession and sedition will be punishable by up to life in prison, stoking concerns of a much more authoritarian era in a city which has been racked by anti-China protests for the past year.
While Beijing and Hong Kong authorities have insisted the law will only target a minority of what they call ""troublemakers"", diplomats, business groups and rights activists have said it is the latest example of Beijing's tightening grip on the city.
Beijing imposed the legislation on Hong Kong, a major financial and trade hub, despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations.
The details of the new legislation stated that authorities will have the power to enter and search places for evidence. They can also restrict people under investigation from leaving Hong Kong.
It may also allow for confiscation of the proceeds related to any offence endangering national security. It will require foreign and Taiwan political organisations and agents to provide information on activities concerning Hong Kong.
Critics say the law - which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison - is aimed at crushing dissent and a long-running campaign for greater democracy which has drawn huge crowds on to the streets.
Some protests have erupted into violence between police and demonstrators.
In London on Monday, the Chinese ambassador accused Britain of gross interference and making irresponsible remarks over Beijing's imposition of the legislation.
Britain has described the security law as a ""clear and serious"" violation of the 1984 Joint Declaration under which it handed back its colony to China 13 years later.
Ambassador Liu Xiaoming said there might be many consequences if Britain treated Beijing as an enemy or with suspicion.
""We want to be your friend. We want to be your partner. But if you want to make China a hostile country, you will have to bear the consequences,"" he said.

Abinader's landslide triumph marks the end of 16 years of rule by the Dominican Liberation Party (PLD), which achieved one of the strongest economic growth rates in Latin America but faced corruption allegations and grievances over inequality.
The PLD also came to face criticism over its management of the coronavirus outbreak in the country, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with impoverished Haiti.
Dominican health authorities are currently registering record new daily highs, four months after reporting the country's first cases. So far, the relatively small nation of just 10.4 million inhabitants has registered more than 38,000 cases and 804 deaths from the virus.
""Our congratulations to Luis Abinader,"" Castillo told supporters gathered outside his campaign headquarters overnight. ""This is a well-deserved triumph, and we wish God guide him and give him the health to wisely manage our country.""
Leonel Fernandez, a former president who split the PLD vote by forming a splinter party last October, and President Danilo Medina also congratulated Abinader and his Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM) on their win. All leading parties are centrist.
While final results are expected later on Monday, a preliminary count of 46 % of the vote puts Abinader on 52.51 percent, Castillo on 37.68 % and Fernandez trailing in a distant third on 8.72 %.
Abinader said late on Sunday he had been tasked to deal with one of the biggest challenges of the Dominican Republic's history, namely tackling its coronavirus outbreak and economic impact.

Cases are spiking again after the government started to open up the economy last month. This month it opened up to tourism once more, a key sector in all the Caribbean which has been leveled by the pandemic.

In May, Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad (MCCI), an anti-corruption group, said an arm of Mexico's social security institute (IMSS) bought the devices from Cyber Robotic Solutions, a firm owned by Leon Manuel Bartlett, son of Manuel Bartlett, who heads national electricity company CFE.
The sale took place as authorities battled the coronavirus pandemic. After an investigation, the SFP said in the official government gazette it had handed Cyber Robotic Solutions two fines totaling over 2 million pesos ($90,000).
It also issued two orders disqualifying Cyber Robotic Solutions from doing business with federal, state and municipal governments, for 24 months and 27 months respectively.
MCCI said in April the IMSS purchased 20 ventilators from the firm for nearly double the amount the government paid for some other ventilators around that time.
The younger Bartlett denied any wrongdoing.
But in a statement, the SFP said the price was ""outside the market range"" and rejected an argument that emergency conditions had dictated the terms of the deal.
""Not one of the 20 units delivered met with the technical specifications agreed,"" it added. ""The units delivered were old, used and in poor condition: 11 were broken and totally unusable as the IMSS has itself acknowledged.""
CFE chief Bartlett, a close ally of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was last year subject to an ethics probe relating to his wealth and potential conflicts of interest. The SFP-led investigation exonerated him of any wrongdoing. 
Lopez Obrador has made battling graft his top priority.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld and strengthened a law banning the broadly unpopular but ubiquitous telemarketing practice known as robocalls, striking down an exemption to the measure that had allowed automated calls for collection of certain money owed to the government.
The court's 7-2 ruling, written by conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, was a defeat for political and polling organizations seeking to use autodial technology to contact the cellphones of potential voters. They had argued that the robocall ban under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 violated free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Kavanaugh wrote that the exemption for government debt collection, added to the law in 2015, violated the First Amendment because it favored government speech over political speech by private entities without sufficient justification.
With few exceptions, autodialed calls to cellphones are illegal in the United States unless a person has given prior consent.
The groups wanted the ban on robocalls to cellphones struck down entirely, saying the law violated the First Amendment. The U.S. Federal Communications Commission had urged the court to uphold both the autodial ban and the government debt exemption.
""Americans passionately disagree about many things. But they are largely united in their disdain for robocalls. The federal government receives a staggering number of complaints about robocalls - 3.7 million complaints in 2019 alone. The states likewise field a constant barrage of complaints,"" Kavanaugh wrote.
Despite the ban, the volume of automated calls has surged in recent years, with Americans receiving 58.5 billion robocalls last year, an increase of 22% from 2018, according to YouMail, a company that provides a service to block automated calls.
The amendment to the law had allowed robocalls made to collect debts owed to or guaranteed by the federal government, including many student loan and mortgage debts.
During May arguments in the case - conducted by teleconference because of the coronavirus pandemic - Kavanaugh sounded reluctant to rule in a way that would cause Americans to be flooded with even more robocalls.
""If you just take a peek, just a peek, at the real world here,"" Kavanaugh said at the time, ""this is one of the more popular laws on the books because people don't like cellphone robocalls.""

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will respond with its own steps if the European Union imposes further sanctions on Ankara, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday after meeting the EU's top diplomat.
France's foreign minister said last week EU ministers would discuss Turkey on July 13 and said new sanctions on Ankara could be considered in addition to steps taken over Turkey's drilling in the Cyprus economic zone.
""If the EU takes additional decisions against Turkey, we will have to respond to this,"" Cavusoglu told a news conference with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in Turkey's capital.
As relations deteriorated between the bloc and Ankara, the European Union imposed a travel ban and asset freezes on two people in February for their role in Turkey's drilling in Cyprus' maritime economic zone off the divided island. 
Cavusoglu berated the EU for failing to fulfill promises and linking issues such as the Cyprus dispute and a 2016 migrant deal. He said Turkey will not allow itself to be held hostage by Greece and Cyprus and called on the EU to be an ""honest broker"".
Earlier this year, tens of thousands of migrants tried to cross into Greece via land and sea borders after Ankara said it would no longer stop them. The flow has slowed since then, but Cavusoglu said Turkey ""will continue to implement its decision"".
Cavusoglu also repeated a call for France to apologise after an incident between Turkish and French warships in the Mediterranean, which prompted Paris to request a NATO investigation.
Relations between the NATO members have soured over the Libya conflict, where Turkey supports the internationally recognised government and accuses Paris of backing the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar who tried to capture Tripoli.

France denies backing Haftar's offensive on the capital, and accused Turkish warships of aggressive behaviour.

MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - In early June, asylum seeker Jose Munoz decided it was time to flee for his life - by getting deported from a Texas immigration detention center where coronavirus was sweeping through the population and going home to El Salvador.
As the number of COVID-19 cases rose in the Houston Contract Detention Facility - it has had at least 105, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) data - Munoz said he had few ways to protect himself from exposure except for a cloth face mask. On June 1, there were 375 detainees housed in the facility, according ICE data.
Although at 19 he would not normally be at risk from complications from the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, Munoz worried his high cholesterol, a comorbidity found in some patients who died, made him vulnerable.
Months earlier, the Salvadoran student had sought asylum in the United States after he says he was attacked for refusing to transport drugs for a gang, which he declined to name, citing concerns for his safety. His lawyer and an affidavit signed by Munoz and reviewed by Reuters were consistent with his account. But by June, he feared his life was hanging in the balance, knowing that the next ruling in his asylum case would be months away if he chose to keep fighting.
""I felt like it was more dangerous than back in my country,"" he said in a telephone interview last month from El Salvador.
Reuters spoke to more than 30 lawyers, immigration advocates, detainees and their family members who said the risks of contracting COVID-19 inside detention facilities have driven people to seek deportation.
Fifteen immigration lawyers and advocates, who together say they have received hundreds of requests from detainees seeking to leave facilities in eight U.S. states for health reasons, told Reuters they are seeing increases in the number of people considering abandoning their cases. Reuters found 12 cases of detainees who stopped fighting their cases and instead agreed to deportation or voluntary departure due to the pandemic.
An ICE spokeswoman told Reuters the agency respects migrants' rights to make decisions regarding whether to pursue or forego their cases.
Reuters couldn’t determine if the total number of people voluntarily seeking deportation is on the rise.
Samuel Cole, a U.S. immigration judge who spoke to Reuters as communications director for the National Association of Immigration Judges, said he saw an increase in migrants seeking to leave detention in the early months of the pandemic - even if it meant abandoning their cases.
""There were definitely respondents who expressed fear of getting sick in detention and wanted to get out as fear of COVID was sweeping the country,"" Cole said.
ACCESS TO MASKS, HAND SANITIZER
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has dialed back arrests and released some immigrants on parole, but has come under fire for shifting detainees between facilities during the pandemic, which ICE has said is part of its effort to stem the spread of the virus and to promote social distancing. The agency has also been criticized for deporting more than a hundred infected people to their home countries.
ICE data shows 2,742 people in ICE detention centers, and 45 ICE employees, have tested positive for COVID-19. Two migrants with the disease have died. Thousands of others who could be more vulnerable if they get infected remain in custody, according to ICE data included in a June 24 court filing as part of a class-action lawsuit over medical care in ICE facilities.
The ICE spokeswoman said the agency weighs a person's criminal record, potential threat to public safety and flight risk, as well as any national security concerns, when evaluating whether to grant discretionary release.
One migrant interviewed for this story tested positive for COVID-19 while in detention at the Otero County Processing Center in New Mexico, according to ICE. A second migrant tested positive on May 14, according to El Rio Health in Arizona, the same day U.S. documents show he was released from ICE custody.
 Many of the 14 current and former detainees interviewed by Reuters said they did not have access to hygiene products such as hand soap and disinfectants. Six detainees said they were exposed to other detainees who had fevers, persistent coughs, or body aches, which can be symptoms of the virus.
One current detainee said those who voiced health concerns were punished with solitary confinement, a claim echoed by lawyers and advocates working in detention centers in four different states.
""ICE fully respects the rights of detainees to voice their concerns without interference and does not retaliate in any way,"" the ICE spokeswoman told Reuters.
A second ICE spokeswoman said the agency provided soap in washing areas and sanitizer throughout the centers ""whenever possible,"" adding that ICE had taken steps to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and to ""safeguard the health and well-being of detainees, staff, and others at our detention facilities.""
Several lawyers told Reuters they see the agency’s handling of the pandemic inside its detention centers as part of the U.S. government’s broader effort to limit immigration.
""I've come to think it's a strategy to get people to say: 'I'm scared to death, I can't stand it anymore, just deport me,'"" said Margo Cowan, supervisor at the Pima County Public Defender's Office in Arizona, who has practiced immigration law for more than three decades.
The first ICE spokeswoman told Reuters the agency fully respects immigrants' rights to due process. 
""Any alien who has a claim to relief, protection under the law, or basis to remain in the United States is allowed to remain in the U.S. legally,"" she said.
A DHS internal watchdog report based on a survey of 188 ICE detention centers shows that about 90% of ICE detention centers said they had enough masks and liquid soap for detainees. More than a third reported not having enough hand sanitizer for detainees. Twelve percent of facilities said they did not have the capacity to isolate or quarantine a detainee who tested positive for COVID-19. A number of facilities said social distancing was a challenge given space restrictions. 
'JUST SIGN'
Patricia Jimenez, a Mexican asylum seeker who said she fled to the United States after being kidnapped by unknown gunmen, decided to drop her case and seek deportation as the coronavirus swept through the Eloy Federal Contract Facility in Arizona, which has reported 222 COVID-19 cases, the second-largest outbreak in an ICE detention center. Her account was confirmed by her lawyer and her aunt.  
""I'm really scared that I might get sick and never see my son again,"" she told Reuters in a call in late June from the center, where she's awaiting deportation.
Jimenez said she fears returning to Mexico.
""But at this moment, I'm more afraid of being here,"" she said, citing the death of a guard who she says she had contact with in the facility's kitchen, where she had worked. CoreCivic (NYSE:CXW), the company that operates the center, said the death was from ""potential COVID-19-related issues."" 
In a statement, a representative of CoreCivic said the company is committed to the safety of its detainees and employees, adding that Jimenez's claims ""do not reflect the affirmative, proactive measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 our facility has been taking for months.""
Lucas Castro, a Mexican asylum seeker with diabetes, which makes people vulnerable to complications from the virus, said he also requested deportation after fearing for his life more in detention than back home, where he said he was brutally beaten by a drug gang last year. His account was supported by his wife and the transcript of his ""credible-fear"" interview, which is part of the asylum process and was reviewed by Reuters. 
Eight migrants, including Castro, told Reuters that officials tried to use detainees' health concerns to push them into agreeing to their deportation.
At Arizona's La Palma Correctional Facility, where Castro was held, he said detainees frequently requested information about the pandemic and whether they could be granted humanitarian parole or other forms of release.
""Instead, a deportation officer always arrived and told us that if we were genuinely afraid then we should just sign for our deportation,"" Castro said. Two other former detainees in the same facility echoed Castro's account. Castro said his fear of the virus prompted him to ask a judge for deportation, which U.S. records show was ordered in late May.
The second ICE spokeswoman said the agency does not have a policy of encouraging detainees who raise health concerns related to COVID-19 to sign for deportation. She added that La Palma Correctional Facility does not have a record of a complaint lodged by Castro regarding the alleged staff comments.
Pandemic-related logjams within the immigration system have also delayed the repatriation of some migrants.
Guatemalan asylum-seeker Timoteo Vicente said he chose not to appeal a negative ruling in his case in March in part because he deemed the medical care inside the Tacoma ICE Processing Center in Washington State inadequate, leading him to worry about its ability to respond to the pandemic. 
In a statement, a representative for GEO Group, the company that contracts with ICE to run the facility, said: ""We take our responsibility to ensure the health and safety of all those in our care and our employees with the utmost seriousness.""
Three months later, Vicente is still stranded in detention, awaiting his deportation.

""I'm in an abyss,"" Vicente told Reuters in a call from the detention center. ""I don't know what's going to happen.""

Authorities in Bayan Nur, a city in the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, issued a warning on Sunday after a hospital reported a suspected case of the deadly disease.
The Chinese region forbade the hunting and eating of the large rodents and asked the public to report any suspected cases, as well as any sick or dead marmots. 
Neighbouring Mongolia also reported two cases of bubonic plague linked to people eating marmot meat in its western Khovd province last week. 
Authorities in Russia's Altai region, which borders Kazakhstan, China and Mongolia, said officials were patrolling the area to enforce a ban on hunting marmots and to warn people about the dangers, TASS news agency reported.
The local branch of Rospotrebnadzor, the consumer health watchdog, said the cases across the border did not pose a threat to people in Altai, TASS reported. 
The bubonic plague, known as the ""Black Death"" in the Middle Ages, is a highly infectious and often fatal disease that is spread mostly by rodents. Bubonic plague outbreaks have become increasingly rare.

Photos posted on social media on Saturday showed people outside a row of pubs in one part of central Dublin, in apparent violation of social distancing rules imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. 
They were gathered near bars serving food, which were allowed to reopen last week. The rest of the country's pubs were due to follow on July 20.
""It could be delayed. We will get advice from the public health officials. We are worried about it... People do need to behave,"" Micheál Martin, who took over as prime minister just over a week ago, told Cork's 96FM.
""Some of the scenes that we witnessed are very worrying because social distancing was not being complied with at all during a number of the inspections and the opening hours weren't being adhered to either.""

The head of Ireland's police force, Drew Harris, said on Monday the crowds had been seen at one location in Dublin, and that inspections had shown that the vast majority of operators had complied with the regulations.

1076,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","Ahead of run-off vote, Polish president proposes constitutional ban on LGBT adoption","WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's President Andrzej Duda on Monday proposed changing the constitution to ban LGBT couples from adopting children ahead of Sunday's presidential run-off in which the candidates are polling neck-and-neck. 
The opposition centrist Civic Platform (PO) candidate, Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, said this weekend that he is also against the adoption of children by LGBT couples. 
Duda is an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS), which dismisses LGBT rights as an invasive foreign influence undermining Poland's traditional values.
A majority amounting to two-thirds of the lower house of parliament is needed to change the constitution. After an election in October, PiS rules with a slim majority and does not hold enough seats to carry out such changes. 
Duda said he hoped he could garner broader support for his proposal from some members of PO, the agrarian PSL grouping and from the far-right Confederation party. 
""I am convinced that, thanks to this, children's safety and concern for the good of children will be ensured to a much greater extent,"" Duda said at an event in Warsaw.
The constitutional change would specify that only married heterosexual couples would be able to adopt children, he said. Courts would have the right to check on couples to ensure they fit into the definition.
A spokesman for PO said the party was against the constitutional change proposed by Duda. 
Trzaskowski has previously said he is in favour of civil partnerships for gay people and proposed a sexual education programme in Warsaw that would teach children about LGBT issues. 
Duda's comments come after he said LGBT ideology was worse than communism in a campaign stop last month and vowed to ban teaching about LGBT issues in schools in an effort to protect what he sees as the traditional family.

Poland was this year ranked the worst country in the European Union for LGBT rights in a poll by Brussels-based NGO ILGA-Europe.

1077,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 08:41AM ET</span>",Hong Kong court denies bail to first person charged under new law,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court denied bail on Monday to the first person charged with inciting separatism and terrorism under the city's new national security law after he carried a sign saying ""Liberate Hong Kong"" and drove his motorbike into police.
Tong Ying-kit, 23, was arrested after a video posted online showed him knocking over several officers at a demonstration last Wednesday, less than 24 hours after Beijing imposed sweeping national security legislation on its freest city.
The city's government has said the protest slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"", connotes separatism or subversion under the new law, stoking concern over freedom of expression in the former British colony.
Tong, who was unable to appear in court on Friday as he was being treated in hospital for injuries sustained in the incident, appeared in court in a wheelchair. 
In rejecting bail, Chief Magistrate So Wai-tak referred to Article 42 of the new law, which states that bail will not be granted if the judge has sufficient grounds to believe the defendant will continue to endanger national security.
The case was adjourned until Oct. 6 and Tong was remanded in custody.
Critics say the law - which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison - is aimed at crushing dissent and a long-running campaign for greater democracy.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said it is aimed at a few ""troublemakers"" and will not affect the rights and freedoms that underpin the city's role as a financial hub.
Also on Monday, prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong pleaded not guilty to inciting others to participate in an unlawful assembly during anti-government protests last year. 
Fellow activist Agnes Chow pleaded guilty to a similar charge. Their case has been adjourned to Aug. 5.
Wong and Chow, who were both granted bail last year, led a pro-democracy group called Demosisto that they dissolved hours after Beijing passed the national security law.

The United States, Britain and others have denounced the new legislation, which critics say is the biggest step China has taken to tighten its grip over the city, despite a ""one country, two systems"" formula meant to preserve its freedoms.

1078,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Austria investigating political motive in Chechen dissident's killing,"VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria is investigating whether the weekend killing of a Chechen dissident was politically motivated, the prosecutors' office handling the case said on Monday, after two suspects were arrested.
The 43-year-old, whom police have declined to identifiy, was shot dead on Saturday near a shopping centre on the edge of Vienna. The two suspects are both Chechens who like the victim have lived in Austria for years, a spokesman for the prosecutors' office in the nearby town of Korneuburg said.
The victim had been offered police protection but declined it, spokesmen for the police and the prosecutors' office said. Austrian media named him as Mamichan U, also known by the alias Martin B, and said he posted material online critical of Ramzan Kadyrov, the leader of Russia's southern region of Chechnya.
""Whether there was a political motive or not will of course be verified. That has, however, not yet been established,"" the spokesman for the prosecutors' office said.
The police added in a statement that the issue had ""not yet been completely cleared up"".
Kadyrov, a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, became head of Chechnya in 2007 in the aftermath of two brutal wars between Russia's military and separatist and Islamist forces following the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
Moscow credits Kadyrov with reining in a radical Islamist insurgency in the mainly Muslim North Caucasus region, but human rights advocates accuse him of presiding over widespread abuses.
There have been several killings in Europe of Kadyrov opponents in which Russian or Chechen involvement has been suspected, such as that of a Georgian citizen in Berlin last year. Russia has denied any connection with that killing. 
Three Chechens were convicted (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-austria-chechnya/vienna-court-convicts-three-in-chechen-exile-murder-idUSTRE75075220110601) in Austria in 2011 of their role in an exile's murder during a botched kidnapping that the authorities suspected Kadyrov ordered.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Torrential rain hit Japan's southwestern island of Kyushu on Monday, with at least one more river bursting its banks, as the death toll from three days of floods and mudslides rose to 44, including 14 at an old people's home.
Evacuation orders were issued for more than half a million island residents, as well as evacuation advisories for tens of thousands more in western Japan, broadcaster NHK said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the rain was forecast to head east by Wednesday and ordered round-the-clock search and rescue operations. Ten people were missing, NHK said.
TV pictures showed streets turned into rivers rushing by at waist high, a collapsed bridge, upturned cars and a helicopter winching a man to safety from an inundated house.
The old people's home was flooded in the island's central prefecture of Kumamoto. NHK did not give details.
""I urge all citizens to carefully follow the information provided by local authorities and stay alert to take actions to protect their own lives,"" Abe said at the start of a government task force meeting.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said 40,000 members of the Self-Defence Force were involved in rescue missions.
He added that evacuation centres were also working on preventing the spread of the coronavirus by distributing disinfectant and asking evacuees to self-distance. 

The floods are Japan's worst natural disaster since Typhoon Hagibis killed about 90 people in October.

1080,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",Make a vaccine? I'm trying to teach my kids the alphabet,"By Kate Holton, Emma Thomasson and Stephen Jewkes
LONDON/BERLIN/MILAN (Reuters) - It's tough to do any useful work when you're stuck at home, struggling to home-school bickering kids, let alone when you're trying to produce a COVID-19 vaccine. 
British drugmaker AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) had spent years preparing for a pandemic, but when the moment finally came it was caught cold on a crucial front: stressed parents working from home struggled to focus. 
So the company recruited up to 80 teachers to run online lessons and repurposed a car parking app to book virtual classes. It also lined up personal tutoring and helped to locate some childcare spaces for those battling to adapt to the abrupt change to their lives.   
The move by Britain's biggest drugmaker, and similar efforts by companies the world over to host everything from magic classes to yoga for children, shows the lengths businesses are going to to help staff work through the coronavirus crisis. 
""It was quite apparent that it was going to be really challenging for those with small kids and with two parents working,"" AstraZeneca's HR chief Fiona Cicconi told Reuters.
""People were starting to say they were feeling really anxious, I've got so much to do, how am I going to get it done?""
The new corporate attitude towards home-working could help lead to higher productivity and loyalty, according to experts, and ease moves towards more flexible working as companies rethink whether staff need to be in the office, and as schools take time to return to normal. 
'I'M DISTRACTED FOR SURE'
The march of the pandemic has upended normal life, forcing companies to shut offices, schools to close and grandparents and childcare providers to stay away. 
That has left many exhausted parents juggling work demands while helping their children with school work to prevent them from falling behind or spending too much time online, not to mention having to feed, entertain and care for them. 
German business software company SAP provided online lessons on magic, coding, yoga, guitar and break dancing for children of staff. 
It is now working on a more formalised schooling scheme with a partner organisation, which will pair children of staff with students, and also offer activities through the summer holiday.
Thomas Angerstein, EMEA head of the SAP department responsible for providing ""mission critical"" support to customers, said the magic classes had helped his eight-year-old son, and consequently helped him too.
""I could focus on my team,"" he said. ""Usually he is hovering around and looking at my screen and I'm distracted for sure.""
In Italy, tyre maker Pirelli teamed up with local company Radiomamma.it to provide online education and entertainment for children, with classes in English, creativity and technology the most popular.
Rosaria Demma Carà, who works in Pirelli's Financial Statements division, said the classes had helped her 10-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter interact with their peers, relieving the social blackout of lockdown. 
""(It also helped) us get on with some work."" 
'THEY'RE OFFERING - WHY AREN'T YOU?'
Esther Canónico, from the London School of Economics, said companies needed to prioritise supporting their staff in different ways because any return to normality would take time, and flexible, long-distance working was likely here to stay. 
Supportive measures should, however, not be seen as an attempt to persuade staff to work harder, especially when those working from home can struggle to manage boundaries with work life, and end up working for much longer, she added. 
""There is not a clear differentiating line between work and home,"" she said of the new environment. ""The advice is for employees to actively manage their boundaries.""
Companies, for their part, see offering such services as good business sense in terms of operational resilience.
AstraZeneca, for example, knew it had to act when a survey found that 1,100 of its 8,300 staff in the country needed help with childcare. 
A plan to recruit freelance teachers was inspired by a former teacher who worked in the company's HR department and it was backed by CEO Pascal Soriot, with the whole process signed off in a matter of hours. 
Launched in May, it offers four lessons a day to up to 1,300 children who have registered. Separately it has lined up a tutoring company that provides one-on-one sessions. 
The tutoring firm, EB Education, said it had since been asked by another company in the drugmaker's home town of Cambridge if they could provide a similar service. 
""The other company have had a few of their workers saying: AstraZeneca are offering this so why aren't you? So they put something in place,"" EB's Karen McGillicuddy told Reuters.
For now AstraZeneca, which has been licensed to produce a potential vaccine for COVID-19, is expanding its support. It has introduced new classes for different age groups and is looking at a summer school.
HR chief Cicconi said staff had been incredibly grateful, during what is an extraordinary time. 

""They know it's not normal for us to run three primary schools,"" she added.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has proposed restoring the mosque status of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, an ancient building at the heart of both the Christian Byzantine and Muslim Ottoman empires and now one of Turkey's most visited monuments.
The proposal has been criticised by several religious and political leaders, including the Istanbul-based Ecumenical Patriarch, spirtual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, as well as Greece, France and the United States.
""A threat against Hagia Sophia is a threat to all of Christian civilization, meaning (a threat to) our spirituality and history,"" Patriarch Kirill said in a statement. 
""What could happen to Hagia Sophia will cause deep pain among the Russian people.""
The Kremlin said on Monday it hoped Turkish authorities would take into account Hagia Sophia's status as a World Heritage Site.
""This is a beloved world masterpiece for tourists from all countries who visit Turkey, including for tourists from Russia, for whom Hagia Sophia, in additional to its tourism value, has an very deep sacred spiritual value,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. 
Erdogan said last week that criticism over the possible conversion of the monument - known in Turkish as Ayasofya - was an attack on Turkey's sovereignty. Many Turks argue that mosque status would better reflect the identity of Turkey as an overwhelmingly Muslim country, and polls show most Turks support a change
Hagia Sophia was an important place of worship for Orthodox Christians for centuries until Istanbul, then known as Constantinople, fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. They turned the building into a mosque but after the creation of the modern secular Turkish republic under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk it became a museum in 1934.
Many Christians were comfortable with Hagia Sophia's status as a museum because this effectively created a neutral space which respected both the Christian and Muslim heritage of the ancient building, which dates back to the sixth century.
A Turkish court last week heard a case aimed at converting the building back into a mosque and will announce its verdict later this month.

The court case, brought by an NGO for preserving historic monuments, disputes the legality of the 1934 decision.

(Reuters) - Prosecutors have asked a judge to schedule a Friday court appearance in New York for Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Maxwell was arrested on Thursday on U.S. charges of luring underage girls so that Epstein could sexually abuse them.
The FBI arrest of the British socialite was the latest twist in the mystery of Epstein, who went from a high school math teacher to a high-flying lifestyle of private Caribbean islands and powerful connections that his victims say allowed him to abuse minors with impunity.
Maxwell, 58, was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire, where she had been laying low since December, the FBI said last week.
In a letter on Sunday to Judge Alison Nathan at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, acting United States Attorney Audrey Strauss said Maxwell's defense lawyer, Christian Everdell, has requested a Friday, July 10, bail hearing.
Maxwell is charged with four criminal counts related to procuring and transporting minors for illegal sex acts and two of perjury, according to the indictment by federal prosecutors in New York.
Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking minors between 2002 and 2005 when he was found hanged in an apparent suicide while in a New York City jail in August. He was 66.
Previously, he pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor in a 2008 deal with prosecutors that was widely criticized as too lenient.
Maxwell, the daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell, has kept a low profile since Epstein's death.
She was an Epstein ex-girlfriend who became a longtime member of his inner circle. In a 2003 Vanity Fair article, Epstein was quoted as saying Maxwell was his best friend.

NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China began pulling back troops from along its contested border with India on Monday, Indian government sources said, following a clash between the two countries last month in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. 
Troops fought for hours with rods and clubs on the night of June 15, with some falling to their deaths in the freezing waters of the Galwan river in the western Himalayas.
China has yet to confirm whether it suffered casualties. The Indian deaths are the highest along the border in more than five decades, a dramatic escalation that led to weeks of talks between senior military officials on how to ease tensions. 
On Monday the Chinese military was seen dismantling tents and structures at a site in the Galwan valley near to where the latest clash took place, said the Indian government sources, who declined to be identified as they are not authorised to speak to the media.
Vehicles were seen withdrawing from the area, as well as at Hotsprings and Gogra - two other contested border zones - the sources said. 
India's national security advisor Ajit Doval and Wang Yi, one of China's top diplomats, had ""a frank and in-depth exchange of views"" on Sunday regarding the border, according to briefing notes by both countries released on Monday. 
Both sides said they had agreed to a significant disengagement of troops. India's note also said both sides had agreed to respect the existing Line of Actual Control (LAC) reflecting positions along the contested section of border. This reference was not included in Beijing's note on the meeting. 
In response to a question on whether China had moved back equipment in the Galwan valley, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said both sides were ""taking effective measures to disengage and ease the situation on the border"".

""We hope India will meet China halfway and take concrete measures to carry out what both sides agreed to, continue to closely communicate through diplomatic and military channels, and work together to cool down the situation at the border,"" Zhao told a news conference on Monday.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Enforcing a fake news law in the run up to a national election, authorities in Singapore have ordered that online references to some comments made by opposition figures on key issues must carry a warning that the content contains false information.
Rights groups have long-warned that the law, which came into effect last year and has repeatedly been directed at opposition figures, may be used to silence criticism of the government ahead of the July 10 vote. 
Since campaigning began on July 1, opposition candidates have been taken to task under the law over comments made on three issues; government spending for foreign students, plans to grow the city-state's 5.7 million population to 10 million, and government advisories that discouraged COVID-19 testing for foreign workers.
Concerns about immigration and jobs have dominated discussion during the campaigning as the city-state faces its deepest ever recession due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
As yet, no lawmakers from the ruling People's Action Party - which has governed since independence in 1965 - have been served correction orders.
The government has denied suggestions that the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) could be used to stifle opposition, and says the law does not curb legitimate criticism or restrict free speech. The POFMA office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Government ministers usually have the power to exercise the law, but during the election period this responsibility has been handed to senior civil servants.
Under the law, authorities can order political parties, news outlets and social media users to carry warnings that their pages or posts contain false statements, and to include links to a government fact-checking website.
The Social Democratic Party, one of the opposition parties that has fallen foul of the law, said in a post that carried the warning that it disputed the ""correction"" but was bound to comply and would appeal.
Rights groups and opposition parties have criticised the government for calling the election while Singapore was still trying to stamp out COVID-19 infections, though most cases have been in migrant worker dormitories. 
The government says it needs a fresh mandate to tackle the economic and social challenges ahead. (This story has been corrected to rectify name of party in paragraph nine to Singapore Democratic Party)

Britain's exit from the EU gives it the power to impose its own sanctions, rather than acting collectively as part of the bloc's single market.
Foreign minister Dominic Raab has pressed for a tough sanctions regime. The first names to be set out in parliament will be followed by further sanctions under a ""UK-only regime"".
""From today, the UK will have new powers to stop those involved in serious human rights abuses and violations from entering the UK, channelling money through our banks and profiting from our economy,"" Raab said in a statement.
""This is a clear example of how the UK will help to lead the world in standing up for human rights. We will not let those who seek to inflict pain and destroy the lives of innocent victims benefit from what the UK has to offer.""
The United States passed a law known as the Magnitsky Act in 2012 under which it has imposed visa bans and asset freezes on Russian officials linked to the death of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian lawyer arrested in 2008 after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud.
Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.
Bill Browder, a client of Magnitsky's who has led a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials whom he blames for the lawyer's death, expressed hope the act would be used ""robustly and regularly"".
""The UK has an outsized role in the world because this is where everyone from the developed world wants to buy property, keep their families safe and store their money,"" he said.
""By prohibiting dictators, torturers and murderers from coming here and enjoying our rule of law, it will have a very big impact."" 
Described as the Magnitsky amendment, the British sanctions framework is not specifically aimed at Russians, but comes at a time of crisis in relations between London and Moscow following a nerve agent attack in England on a Russian ex-spy.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Two U.S. Navy aircraft carriers are conducting exercises in the contested South China Sea within sight of Chinese naval vessels spotted near the flotilla, the commander of one of the carriers, the USS Nimitz, told Reuters on Monday.
""They have seen us and we have seen them,"" Rear Admiral James Kirk said in a telephone interview from the Nimitz, which has been conducting flight drills in the waterway with the Seventh Fleet carrier, the USS Ronald Reagan, that began on the U.S. Independence Day holiday of July 4.
The U.S. Navy has brought carriers together for such shows of force in the region in the past, but this year's drill comes amid heightened tension as the United States criticises China over its novel coronavirus response and accuses it of taking advantage of the pandemic to push territorial claims in the South China Sea and elsewhere.
China's foreign ministry said the United States had deliberately sent its ships to the South China Sea to flex its muscles and accused it of trying to drive a wedge between countries in the region. 
The Pentagon, when it announced the dual carrier exercise, said it wanted to ""stand up for the right of all nations to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows"", describing its 100,000-ton ships and the 90 or so aircraft they each carry as a ""symbol of resolve"".
About 12,000 sailors are on ships in the combined carrier strike groups.
China's claims nine tenths of in the resource-rich South China Sea, through which some $3 trillion of trade passes a year. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam have competing claims. 
China has built island bases atop atolls in the region but says its intentions are peaceful.
Contacts with Chinese ships had been without incident, Kirk said.

""We have the expectation that we will always have interactions that are professional and safe,"" he said. ""We are operating in some pretty congested waters, lots of maritime traffic of all sorts.""

1087,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 06, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Iran's hardline lawmakers move to summon Rouhani - Tasnim,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's hardline lawmakers plan to summon the president for questioning, a move that could ultimately lead to impeachment, media reported on Monday, amid growing discontent over the government's economic policies. 
Iranians' daily struggle to make ends meet has become harder since the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018, and the economy has been further damaged by rising inflation, growing unemployment, a slump in the rial and the coronavirus crisis.
A motion to question President Hassan Rouhani was signed by 120 lawmakers out of 290 and handed to the presiding board of the assembly, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. To take effect, the motion must be passed to the president by the presiding board.
However, analysts say the board might hold back from issuing the summons, mindful that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's top authority, has called for unity among the branches of authority at a time when Iran faces mounting U.S. pressure. 
A move by parliament to question Rouhani's predecessor was blocked by a rare intervention by Khamenei.
""The lawmakers have various questions for the president, including the reasons behind the foreign exchange market crisis as well as the high prices of basic goods and basic necessities of the people today,"" Tasnim quoted Tehran lawmaker Eqbal Shakeri as saying.
Defying central bank attempts to revive its value, Iran's rial currency has continued to fall against the U.S. dollar on the unofficial market since April. 
First elected in a landslide in 2013 and re-elected in 2017, Rouhani opened the door to nuclear diplomacy with six major powers that led to a 2015 nuclear deal, under which Iran agreed to curb its sensitive nuclear work in return for the easing of sanctions.
But hardliners opposed to the West were always lukewarm about the agreement, and they fiercely criticised Rouhani when U.S. President Donald Trump quit the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have choked Iran's vital oil exports. 
Iran's sanctions-damaged economy forced Khamenei to give tentative backing to the accord but the country's top authority has regularly criticised its implementation. 
According to Tasnim, lawmakers also planned to ask Rouhani about ""the government's strategic mistake that allowed the U.S. withdrawal from the deal at the lowest cost"".
On Sunday, shouts of 'liar' interrupted a speech to parliament about the accord by Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif as some lawmakers vented their displeasure. 
Zarif, also Iran's top nuclear negotiator, hit back by saying that the nuclear talks had been agreed by Khamenei. 
Analysts say the hardline Khamenei may be happy to have a weakened Rouhani, but he does not want to harm the legitimacy of the Islamic Republic by forcing the president out of office with less than one year of his second-term left.
Parliament has no major influence on foreign affairs or nuclear policy, which are set by Khamenei. But it might bolster hardliners in the 2021 election for president and toughen the anti-Western tilt of Tehran's foreign policy.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Beijing law professor who has been an outspoken critic of China's ruling Communist Party and President Xi Jinping was taken away by authorities on Monday, several friends and colleagues told Reuters.
Xu Zhangrun, 57, a professor at the prestigious Tsinghua University, came to prominence in July 2018 for denouncing the removal of the two-term limit for China's leader, which allows Xi to remain in office beyond his current second term.
According to a text message circulated among Xu's friends and seen by Reuters, he was taken from his house in suburban Beijing on Monday morning by more than 20 policemen, who also searched his house and confiscated his computer.
Multiple phone calls to Beijing police and the media department of Tsinghua University went unanswered. Police in Beijing's Changping district declined to comment.
One of Xu's friends, who did not want to be named, told Reuters that he had not been able to contact Xu since hearing news of his detainment.
The friend said that at a gathering in January, Xu said he was mentally prepared for whatever punishment may await him.
He Weifang, a prominent Peking University law professor who has long known Xu, told Reuters that he understood from one of Xu's Tsinghua colleagues that Xu had been detained.
He told Reuters that Xu had been deeply worried and anxious about China's direction in recent years. 
""He felt that the country was going backwards and that as a public intellectual, he has the duty to speak up,"" He said.
He said Xu was last seen by friends on Sunday.
Since the 2018 article, Xu has written other critiques of the party. At the peak of China's coronavirus outbreak in February, he wrote an article calling for freedom of speech. 
Most recently in May, before China's delayed annual parliamentary meeting, he wrote an article accusing Xi of trying to bring the Cultural Revolution back to China.
Under Xi, China has tightened censorship and clamped down on dissent.
In March, an influential former property executive and Communist Party member named Ren Zhiqiang went missing, three of his friends told Reuters at the time.
Ren had called Xi a ""clown"" over a speech the president made about the government's efforts to battle the coronavirus. 
Beijing's municipal anti-corruption watchdog later said Ren was under investigation for ""serious disciplinary violation"".

Roman Putin, son of Putin's cousin Igor, was elected head of the People Against Corruption party at a congress on Sunday after becoming a member last month, it said.
Like President Putin, who via a nationwide vote has just won the right to run for president again twice, Roman Putin is a former employee of Russia's FSB security service. 
The 42-year-old relative said the party he now leads, which was founded in 2014 and has 4,000 active members, will take part in regional elections in September, the RIA news agency reported. 
He also said it would run for seats in the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, at elections next year. The party is currently not represented in the federal legislature. 
The party describes Roman Putin as having broad civil service, political and business experience. The party says it wants to fight corruption but its agenda is not aimed at countering the Kremlin's policies.
In March, the Kommersant daily reported that he was in the process of founding another political movement, the People of Business, a right-wing conservative project aimed at supporting entrepreneurs and small businesses.

At the time, he was quoted as saying he had not discussed his political plans with the Kremlin leader but did not anticipate any problems.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli official flagged a possible security risk on Monday following a U.S. move to allow American providers to sell clearer satellite images of Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Under a 1997 U.S. regulation known as the Kyl-Bingaman Amendment, satellite images of Israel and the Palestinian territories used in services like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Earth could show items no smaller than 2 metres (6.56 ft) across.
The curb, Israel had argued, would help prevent enemies using public-domain information to spy on its sensitive sites.
But the U.S. Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs Office said on June 25 it would allow enhanced resolutions of 0.4 metre. In a statement to Reuters, the agency said ""a number of foreign sources"" are already producing and disseminating sub-2 m. imagery of Israel. 
Amnon Harari, head of space programmes at Israel's Defence Ministry, said he believed the move was designed to ease international competition for U.S. commercial satellites, adding: ""I don't think they (Americans) asked us"" in advance.
""We are in a process of studying what exactly is written there, what exactly the intentions are, what we can respond to, ultimately,"" Harari told Israel's public radio station Kan. 
""We would always prefer to be photographed at the lowest resolution possible. It's always preferable to be seen blurred, rather than precisely.""
Israel worries that Lebanon's Hezbollah and Gaza's Hamas militants could use commercial satellite images to plan rocket strikes on key civilian and military infrastructure.
Higher resolution images could also potentially help track the expansion of Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank which opponents see as obstructing Palestinian statehood hopes.
Hagit Ofran of Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement monitor, welcomed the prospect of sharper images. With lower quality photos, she said, ""it is difficult to know if what you are seeing is a new house or just a chicken coop"".
Google Earth referred Reuters to third-party providers when asked if the U.S. move would affect the satellite images it publishes of Israel and the Palestinian territories.

One such U.S. company, Planet, said in a statement: ""When the policy change goes into effect, we will follow the new provisions for providing high resolution imagery of the region.""

Paris tour guides protest outside Louvre,"PARIS (Reuters) - Several dozen Paris tour guides wearing masks and holding Mona Lisa portraits protested outside the Louvre museum on Monday for more support from the government to help them ride out the coronavirus crisis and a dearth of tourists.
They gathered at the foot of the Louvre's glass pyramid as the museum reopened to visitors for the first time in four months after going into lockdown.
In May, France announced measures worth 18 billion euros ($19 billion) to support its tourism sector from the damage wrought upon it by the global pandemic. 
But protester Margot Schmitz said these funds were not reaching tour guides like her, most of whom were on short-term contracts and were facing imminent financial hardship. 
""The government is turning a deaf ear,"" Schmitz told Reuters ahead of the protest. ""We have no voice.""
It may be months before foreigner flock back to Paris in pre-crisis numbers.

The Louvre said it was expecting 7,000 visitors on Monday but after an initial flurry managers anticipate that numbers will only be a fifth of pre-outbreak levels - likely making for a more serene experience than usual.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Former team mates of a South Korean triathlete found dead last month after alleging she had been abused by her coaching staff said on Monday athletes endured a living ""hell"" and were habitually beaten and verbally abused.
Choi Suk-hyeon, a member of the national triathlon team, died at her team dorm after leaving a message to her mother asking her to ""reveal the sins"" of her abusers. She was 22.
Choi did not reveal names in the message, which was released by a lawmaker last week, but her family and team mates said she had suffered years of physical and verbal abuse from her coach, physiotherapist and captain of her Gyeongju City team. 
Her coach and captain denied any wrongdoing at a parliamentary hearing on Monday. 
A sports ministry official told the hearing that the physiotherapist was a friend of the coach and was working with the team despite not having a license. 
He is no longer with the team and Reuters was unable to contact him.
One of Choi's former team mates, who did not give her name and wore a mask to conceal her identity, told a news conference before the hearing that the team was ""a kingdom built only for the coach and certain members"".
""The coach and the captain habitually beat and verbally abused Suk-hyeon and us,"" she added. 
In one instance, the coach forced them to eat 200,000 won ($167.00) worth of bread and then throw it all back up as a penalty for drinking a cup of cola and gaining weight, she said. 
Another team mate described life in the athletes dorm as the ""abyss of hell"" but said she believed this was the world athletes had to live in.
The lawmaker who arranged the news conference said it took courage from the athletes to come forward as they were afraid of reprisals. 
Choi's death sparked a nationwide uproar, especially after she was found to have filed complaints with the police, national sports bodies and a human rights watchdog. 
The head of the national triathlon association apologised at the parliamentary hearing for ""only believing the coach"". 
South Korea's elite sports community is notorious for its ""win-at-all-costs"" culture, with its brutal training regimes and a strong hierarchical relationship between coaches and older and younger athletes. 
Last year, several female athletes accused their male coaches of sexual and verbal abuse amid the #MeToo movement, including two-time Olympic champion short track speed skater Shim Suk-hee, who said she was repeatedly raped by her coach. 
The sports ministry and Korean Sport and Olympic Committee pledged a thorough investigation on Monday.

The man, Son Jong-woo, the site's operator, completed an 18-month sentence for violating South Korean child protection and information laws in April but has remained in custody after he was also indicted on U.S. federal charges in Washington.
The Seoul High Court said in its ruling that it had refused the extradition request because sending him to the United States could hamper South Korean investigations into sexually exploitive content, Yonhap news agency reported.
The court said the ruling should not be interpreted as exonerating Son, and that he should actively cooperate with investigators and face proper punishment, according to Yonhap.
Reuters was no able to find contact information for Son's lawyer.
Officials said last year they had arrested at least 338 people in 12 countries linked to the network, which they described as one of the largest child pornography operations they had encountered.
Called Welcome To Video, the website relied on the bitcoin cryptocurrency to sell access to 250,000 videos depicting child sexual abuse, authorities said, including footage of extremely young children being raped. Its upload page specifically stated, “Do not upload adult porn”.
Son's 18-month sentence contrasted with several 15-year sentences handed out to other people convicted in the United States in the case, and led to efforts in South Korea to impose stricter laws and tougher penalties for child pornography offences.

""It's an incredible honour. But it was unbelievably, daunting like the trust and responsibility. It's immense,"" Abraham Kunin said.

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",Explainer: Why one party dominates Singapore politics,"By Aradhana Aravindan and John Geddie
SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singaporeans are expected to return the People's Action Party to power in a July 10 general election, extending its unbroken rule since the Southeast Asian island's independence in 1965.
In that time, Singapore has had only three prime ministers: independence leader Lee Kuan Yew, his cabinet colleague Goh Chok Tong and Lee's son, the present prime minister Lee Hsien Loong.
Having overseen rapid economic growth and prosperity, the PAP has become entrenched in power. But there are other factors that have kept rivals at bay.
UNIQUE MODEL
Voting in the former British colony is compulsory, and around 2.65 million will cast their ballots in the coming election.
Singapore's electoral system is broadly based on the Westminster 'first-past-the-post' model where the candidate who wins the most votes in each constituency is elected, and the number of seats is not proportionate to the vote share.
In the last 2015 election, the PAP garnered 69.9% of the vote but secured about 93% of parliamentary seats. 
For a graphic on previous election results, click here: https://tmsnrt.rs/3dFIStm
But there is also a twist in Singapore's electoral system. In some constituencies, candidates run in teams of up to six with at least one member from a minority group - a system designed to ensure better racial representation in the Chinese majority city-state.
Smaller and less well-resourced, some opposition parties struggle to find enough candidates for these so-called group representation constituencies. 
But the ruling party is sensitive to shifts in its overall vote share. After its worst result in 2011, when it secured 60% of the vote, the PAP accelerated foreign labour curbs to allay people's unease about immigration and jobs. Similar issues have dominated this campaign as Singapore braces for its deepest ever recession due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
CONSTRAINTS
Rights groups like ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights have long-flagged various other election processes that they say disadvantage the opposition.
For example, Singapore's electoral divisions are revised regularly to reflect population growth and shifts. But the process is opaque and opposition figures have previously made allegations of gerrymandering.
The prime minister can also call for an election, with presidential approval, at short notice, creating difficulties for the opposition to prepare. The campaigning period for the coming vote is just nine days.
The financial cost of running can also be a deterrent. Candidates must put up election deposits of S$13,500 ($9,675) to stand, compared to 500 pounds ($623) in Britain, and they need to win more than one-eighth of total votes to get their deposit back. 
DISPARATE GROUP
The opposition is fractured.
A record 11 parties will be contesting the 2020 election: the PAP will stand in all 93 seats, followed by the new Progress Singapore Party (24), the Workers' Party (21) and the Singapore Democratic Party (11). The rest will stand in 10 or fewer. 
Political analysts say opposition parties tend to pitch themselves as a check against the PAP's dominance rather than offering a viable alternative government.
The mainstream local media - which has close ties to the government - generally supports the government and state policies even during an election, rights groups say. The PAP did not respond to a request for comment and its leaders have previously said press freedoms must be practised with national interests in mind.
LEGAL PROBLEMS
Opposition figures, including the late J.B. Jeyaretnam and the SDP's Chee Soon Juan, have been sued by PAP members and made bankrupt. PAP leaders have said the libel suits were necessary to protect their reputations.

More recently, some opposition figures fell foul of a controversial fake news law, and were told their online posts must carry a banner stating that they contain false information.

SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - Millions voted in a closely fought presidential election in the Dominican Republic on Sunday, defying a coronavirus outbreak that had delayed the vote and forced the leading candidate to briefly suspend campaigning after falling ill with the disease.
Voters wore face masks and sometimes face shields and coveralls too. Polling stations, which closed at 5 p.m. (2100 GMT), provided antibacterial gel for people to disinfect their hands before casting their ballots. But electoral observers said they saw many lapses in social distancing.
The election will determine who will tackle the COVID-19 outbreak and its impact on the Caribbean's largest economy, heavily dependent on a tourism industry leveled by the pandemic. Preliminary results will be published starting at 8:30 p.m. (0030 GMT Monday), electoral authorities said. 
Polls suggest the ruling Dominican Liberation Party (PLD) is set to lose power after 16 years, as criticism it has mismanaged the outbreak, infighting, corruption allegations and inequality overshadow a strong economic performance.
The PLD's candidate, former Public Works Minister Gonzalo Castillo, 59, has been trailing Luis Abinader, 52, of the opposition Modern Revolutionary Party (PRM). Both parties are centrist. 
President Danilo Medina, 68, was ineligible to seek re-election, having served two consecutive terms. He failed to win sufficient backing for a constitutional change to run again.
With a tight race expected, Abinader may not get the absolute majority needed to win. Results are expected late on Sunday or on Monday and a runoff, if necessary, would be held on July 26.
""Tonight, I will be president of all Dominicans,"" Abinader wrote on Twitter on Sunday shortly after casting his vote.
The country of 10.4 million, which shares the Caribbean island of Hispaniola with Haiti, is also holding parliamentary elections even as coronavirus cases hit record daily highs. Four months after the first reported cases, there are now more than 37,425 cases and 794 deaths.
Critics say the government did not act quickly enough, reopened the economy too soon last month and is too slow with testing. 
ELECTIONS POSTPONED FROM MAY
Abinader had to suspend campaign appearances for a while after testing positive for the coronavirus last month. He says he has recovered.
After postponing the elections from May, the government would have had to amend the constitution to postpone them again.
Some voters were nervous about whether the balloting would go smoothly after municipal elections in February were suspended mid-vote. Officials at the time said there had been a glitch in the electronic voting system, but some Dominicans suspected foul play.
""We hope that it all goes well and that the will of the people is respected during the vote,"" said Luis Tito, a voter in the capital, Santo Domingo.
Some Dominicans abroad could not vote because of coronavirus lockdown restrictions. 
The ruling party was seriously weakened after former President Leonel Fernandez, 66, broke away to form a splinter party in October. As a candidate, he is polling a distant third.
In a twist, however, his wife, Vice President Margarita Cedeño, has remained with the PLD and is running on Castillo's ticket.

Under the PLD's leadership, the Dominican Republic has achieved 7% annual growth over the past decade. But the country has dropped 38 places in Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index during that time to 137th out of 180 countries.

ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia's ruling centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) convincingly won a parliamentary election on Sunday, held at a time of rising coronavirus infections and a sharp economic downturn due to the pandemic.
The official results after around 60% of votes were counted gave the HDZ 68 seats in the 151-seat parliament, while its top opponent, the Social Democrats (SDP) and its small allies, secured 43 seats.
Nationalist and eurosceptic bloc Domovinski Pokret (Homeland Movement), led by popular singer Miroslav Skoro, came third with 15 seats followed by the conservative Most (Bridge) party with eight seats and leftist Mozemo (We can) with six seats.
The HDZ will now seek partners to form yet another ruling coalition which analysts believe should not be too difficult given their strong performance.
""They have a pretty comfortable position now as they may be able to choose their partners and may not need to negotiate with their opponents on the right-wing spectrum of the political scene,"" political analyst Berto Salaj told state television.
The HDZ leader and incumbent Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said the victory brought with it an obligation to work hard. 
""Croatia is facing serious challenges which require from us responsibility, knowledge and experience. That is exactly what we have offered to the Croatian voters,"" he said addressing his party supporters.
The new government will have an uphill task to keep a grip on the coronavirus while trying to restore the economy, which is expected to shrink about 10% this year. Tourism revenues are forecast to slump 70%.

Croatia has reported a relatively small number of COVID-19 infections - a little over 3,000 cases and some 100 deaths so far - but infections have accelerated in the past two weeks, with the daily number of new cases peaking at about 80.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian soldiers who died in close combat with Chinese troops last month were unarmed and surrounded by a larger force on a steep ridge, Indian government sources, two soldiers deployed in the area and families of the fallen men said.
One of the Indian soldiers had his throat slit with metal nails in the darkness, his father told Reuters, saying he had been told by a fellow soldier who was there.
Others fell to their deaths in the freezing waters of the Galwan river in the western Himalayas, relatives have learned from witnesses.
Twenty Indian soldiers died in the June 15 clash on the de facto border separating the two armies. The soldiers all belonged to the 16th Bihar Regiment deployed in the Galwan region.
No shots were fired, but it was the biggest loss of life in combat between the nuclear-armed neighbours since 1967, when the simmering border dispute flared into deadly battles.
Reuters spoke to relatives of 13 of the men who were killed, and in five cases they produced death certificates listing horrific injuries suffered during the six-hour night-time clash at 14,000 ft (4,267 metres) amid remote, barren mountains.
Reuters contacted the military hospital in India's Ladakh region where the bodies were brought. The hospital declined to comment on the cause of death and said that the bodies were sent to the families along with the death certificates.
Reuters also spoke to two soldiers of the Bihar Regiment deployed in the area, who were among those who accompanied the bodies of fallen colleagues to their homes in the area. They were not directly involved in the melee.
The soldiers cannot be named because of military rules and all the families asked for anonymity because they said they were not supposed to speak about military matters.
The Indian defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the fighting on June 15. 
In response to a Reuters query, a China foreign ministry spokesperson repeated previous statements blaming the Indian side for crossing the de facto border and provoking the Chinese.
""When Chinese officers and soldiers went there to negotiate, they were suddenly and violently attacked by the Indian troops,"" the spokesperson said. ""The rights and wrongs of the incident are very clear. The responsibility absolutely does not lie with the Chinese.""
China has not provided evidence of Indian aggression. China's defence ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
'ARTERIES RUPTURED'
Three of the dead men had their ""arteries ruptured in the neck"" and two sustained head injuries caused by ""sharp or pointed objects"", the death certificates seen by Reuters said.
There were visible marks on the neck and forehead, all five documents said.
""It was a free-for-all, they fought with whatever they could lay their hands on - rods, sticks, and even with their bare hands,"" said a government official in Delhi briefed on the clash.
The Indian government has said that the People's Liberation Army (PLA) acted in a premeditated manner, but it has not provided a full account of the clash that stunned the country and stoked popular anger against China.
China has dismissed an Indian government minister's claim that China had lost 40 soldiers from the PLA's western theatre command deployed in Galwan.
Its envoy to Delhi suggested in remarks to local media and posted on the embassy website that there had been losses on both sides.
""The Indian army suddenly and violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went for negotiation, causing fierce physical conflicts and casualties between the two sides,"" Sun Weidong said.
Indian government officials have told Reuters that the conflict began when the commanding officer of the Bihar regiment led a small party to Patrol Point 14 to verify whether the Chinese had made good their promise to withdraw from the disputed site and dismantle structures they had built there.
But instead they came under attack by Chinese soldiers using iron rods and wooden clubs with nails studded in them on a narrow ledge barely four metres wide overlooking the Galwan river.
BODIES FOUND IN RIVER
In recent weeks the world's two most populous countries have mobilised more forces along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), and the renewed hostilities have triggered a diplomatic and commercial spat that threatens to escalate, experts including former Indian military officers say.
The possibility that unarmed Indian soldiers were overrun by a larger force could further fuel resentment against China and raise questions about why Indian soldiers were sent to a tense frontline without being armed.
""How dare China kill our unarmed soldiers. Why were our soldiers sent unarmed to martyrdom?"" Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party wrote in a tweet, demanding the government provide a full account.
A relative of one of the soldiers who accompanied Colonel Santosh Babu, the commanding officer, to the site of two tents erected by the Chinese troops told Reuters that members of the Indian patrol were unarmed.
They were confronted by a small group of Chinese soldiers and an argument ensued over the tents and a small observation tower the relative said, on the basis of conversations with two other soldiers who were present.
Reuters was unable to establish all of the details of what happened, but government officials in New Delhi briefed on the incident said that at some point Indian troops took down the observation post and the tents because they were on India's side of the LAC.
Soon after the Indian side came under attack from a large Chinese force that pelted them with stones and attacked them with sharp-edged weapons, according to the families of three dead Indian soldiers, based on conversations they had with survivors.
Some soldiers retreated to safety on the ridgeline in the darkness, but when they could not find the commanding officer, they re-emerged and came under fresh attack, four family members said.
Babu was among those killed in the fighting, the Indian government said. One of the soldiers deployed in the area that Reuters spoke to said the Indian patrol was outnumbered by the PLA.
""The Chinese side overwhelmed our people by sheer numbers,"" said the soldier, who overheard radio messages seeking reinforcements being sent to regional headquarters in Ladakh.
Three of the Indian families said they had been told by soldiers who were commissioned to bring the bodies back to them that some combatants pushed each other into the fast-flowing Galwan river.

The government official in Delhi also said bodies of some soldiers were fished out of the river the next morning. Some had succumbed to hypothermia, the official added.

The third-quarter date -- as opposed to the official year-end deadline for an agreement -- is crucial because that’s when U.K. derivatives clearinghouses, such as the one run by  London Stock Exchange  Group (LON:LSE) Plc, would need to start closing out European firms’ membership, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe said in a statement.
“In practical terms, three months may not be sufficient time for the larger clearing members to close out their positions and make alternative arrangements,” according to the AFME, one of the region’s biggest lobbying groups for banks, and brokers. “Even if feasible, this would involve significant risks to market and financial stability.”
The most recent round of Brexit talks broke up without much sign of progress. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator also last week blasted the U.K.’s plans for post-Brexit finance, calling them “unacceptable.”

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 05, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Fire at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility caused significant damage: spokesman,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - A fire at Iran's underground Natanz nuclear facility has caused significant damage that could slow the development of advanced centrifuges used to enrich uranium, an Iranian nuclear official said on Sunday.
Iran's top security body said on Friday that the cause of the fire that broke out on Thursday had been determined but would be announced later. Some Iranian officials have said it may have been cyber sabotage and one warned that Tehran would retaliate against any country carrying out such attacks.
On Thursday, an article by Iran's state news agency IRNA addressed what it called the possibility of sabotage by enemies such as Israel and the United States, although it stopped short of accusing either directly.
Israel's defence minister said on Sunday it was not ""necessarily"" behind every mysterious incident in Iran.
Three Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity on Friday said they believed the fire was the result of a cyber attack but did not cite any evidence.
""The incident could slow down the development and production of advanced centrifuges in the medium term ... Iran will replace the damaged building with a bigger one that has more advanced equipment,"" state news agency IRNA quoted the spokesman for Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation, Behrouz Kamalvandi, as saying.
""The incident has caused significant damage but there were no casualties."" 
Separately on Sunday, Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guards Navy chief said Tehran had built underground ""missile cities"" along the Gulf coastline and warned of a ""nightmare for Iran's enemies"".
Iranian authorities have said such sites exist in all provinces of Iran but have unveiled only three bases so far and not disclosed that they have been built along its coast.
'MAXIMUM PRESSURE'
Natanz is the centrepiece of Iran's enrichment programme, which Tehran says is for peaceful purposes. Western intelligence agencies and the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog (IAEA) believe it had a coordinated, clandestine nuclear arms programme that it halted in 2003. Tehran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons.
Iran agreed to curb its nuclear programme in exchange for the removal of most international sanctions in a deal reached between Tehran and six world powers in 2015. 
But Iran has gradually reduced its commitments to the accord since U.S. President Donald Trump's administration withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed and intensified sanctions that have battered Iran's economy.
The deal only allows Iran to enrich uranium at its Natanz facility with just over 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, but Iran has installed new cascades of advanced centrifuges.
Iran, which says it will not negotiate as long as sanctions remain in place, has repeatedly vowed to continue building up what it calls a defensive missile capability run by the Revolutionary Guards, in defiance of Western criticism.
Israel has backed Trump's ""maximum pressure"" policy on Tehran aimed at forcing it to agree a new deal that puts stricter limits on its nuclear work, curbs its ballistic missile programme and ends its regional proxy wars. 
In 2010, the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel, was discovered after it was used to attack Natanz.
The Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant (FEP), Iran's main uranium enrichment site which is mostly underground, is one of several Iranian facilities monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog.

The IAEA said on Friday that the location of the fire did not contain nuclear materials and that none of its inspectors was present at the time.

Ennahda gave no details of what action it would consider taking, but sources close to the party said the withdrawal of its seven ministers from the government was among the possible options.
Fakhfakh has rejected accusations of corruption but is under pressure from the opposition to resign after an independent member of parliament published documents last month indicating that companies the prime minister owns shares in had won deals worth 44 million dinars ($15 million) from the state. 
Fakhfakh has told parliament he is ready to resign if any violation is proved, but said he had sold his shares in the companies.
""The suspicion of a conflict of interest by the prime minister ... has harmed the image of the governing coalition, and requires a reevaluation of the (party's) position about the government,"" Ennahda said in a statement.
Ennahda's comments will increase pressure on the fragile government formed in February following an election last September that produced a fractured parliament.
A judge has opened an investigation into the allegations against Fakhfakh, and the anti-corruption minister has assigned a public watchdog to look into the issue and report back within three weeks.
The state anti-corruption commission has said Fakhfakh did not inform it that companies where he has shares had commercial deals with the state. Its head, Chawki Tbib, told parliament the firms' contracts with the state should be cancelled.
Tunisia is trying to put state finances on a sounder footing after years of deficit spending and mounting public debt - issues complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic.

(Reuters) - Ten people were shot early on Sunday in a Greenville, South Carolina, nightclub in an outburst of suspected gang-related violence that killed two people and critically injured two others, police said.
Police believe more than one shooter fled the chaotic scene at the Lavish Lounge club before deputies arrived. A very large crowd had packed into the establishment for ""some type of Fourth of July concert,"" Greenville County Sheriff Hobart Lewis told an early morning press conference.
Two sheriff's deputies were passing by the club shortly before 2 a.m. and heard shooting and saw a commotion, in a crowd of about 200 people, Lewis said.
They called for backup and emergency services and went into the club, trying to evacuate people and see if it was still an active shooting, but apparently the shooter or shooters fled, Lewis said.
Officials identified the deceased as Mykala Bell, 23, of Greenville and Clarence Johnson, 51, of Duncan. The Greenville News reported that Johnson was a security guard at the club.
There was still no detailed information about the wounded or the suspects from officials in Greenville by midday Sunday. But Lewis told reporters that police were looking for ""known gang members,"" and that the incident was ""probably gang related.""
There is no active threat to the public, police said.
Some of the wounded were taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital by people at the scene, others in ambulances, Lewis said.
The Greenville News reported that there was a previous shooting early Saturday morning at a club next door to Lavish Lounge. Police were investigating a possible connection, the newspaper said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - More than 166 people were killed during anti-government protests in Ethiopia last week, the government said on Sunday, as the capital and other hotspots remained closely guarded by security forces and a blanket Internet shutdown entered its sixth day.
Large protests broke out in Addis Ababa and spread to the surrounding Oromia region on Monday night after popular Oromo musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa was shot dead by unknown gunmen in a killing Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said was ""an evil act"".
Haacaaluu sang in the Oromo language of Ethiopia's biggest ethnic group. His killing tapped into grievances fuelled by decades of government repression and what the Oromo describe as their historic exclusion from political power. 
The government initially said 80 people had been killed during the protests, which lasted for two days. The unrest is the deadliest since Abiy, who is Oromo, took power in 2018 with the promise of wide ranging reforms.
But a senior regional security official told Reuters on Sunday that the death toll was at least double that, with 145 civilians and 11 security personnel killed. 
Jibril Mohammed, head of the Oromia Security and Peace Bureau, said more deaths might be reported due to the number of injuries being treated in hospitals.
Another 10 people were killed in Addis Ababa, a source in the national police service said.
The military, called in to quell the protests Wednesday, were out in the streets of Oromia towns, two residents from the town of Adama and another from the town of Shashemene told Reuters. Authorities shut down the Internet after the protests began, and they are yet to switch it on again, residents said.
""The (Oromia) region is now relatively calm and there is no violence or protests at the moment. Businesses have also re-opened,"" Jibril told Reuters by phone.
International human rights watchdog Amnesty International has called on the government to bring Haacaaluu's killers to justice.

One of the changes approved in the week-long vote that ended on July 1 makes it possible for Putin to seek two more terms as president and, if re-elected, to stay in power until 2036.
Other changes grant former presidents immunity from prosecution, enshrine a reference in the constitution to God, offer pensions protection and define marriage as a union of a man and a woman.
Opponents said the vote was illegal and illegitimate, and an independent monitoring group said the vote was deeply flawed.
But Russian news agencies quoted Putin as saying: ""I am absolutely convinced that we are doing the right thing in adopting amendments to the current constitution."" 
""They will strengthen our nationhood and create conditions for the progressive development of our country for decades to come,"" he said.

The Kremlin has hailed the overwhelming vote in favour of the amendments as a triumph for Putin, who said on Friday that Russian society had shown unity by voting to back the reforms.

In a sermon, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, the top Christian cleric, accused politicians of thinking only of their own vested interests and urged the president to take action. 
""It appears politicians want to hide their responsibility in emptying the treasury and not enact any reforms,"" he said.
Hopes of salvation through an IMF deal have retreated, with the government unwilling or unable to enact reforms, hamstrung by the conflicting agendas of sectarian leaders who don't want to yield power or privileges.
The crisis, which has decimated the local currency and raised fears of mass hunger, is seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since its 1975-1990 civil war. 
""Political officials...do not have the courage nor the freedom to meet and find ways out of the suffering,"" Rai said. He warned this was depriving the country of help it needs from foreign donors. 
Economic woes, rooted in state waste and corruption, came to the fore last year after capital inflows slowed and protests erupted against leaders in power since the war.
Lebanon's sectarian political system parcels out state posts based on religious sect, with the presidency reserved for a Maronite Christian.
The largest Christian bloc, President Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, is close to the Iran-backed Shi'ite Hezbollah movement. Both backed the current cabinet, which took office in January.
In another sermon in a central Beirut church, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Elias Audi also lambasted the political elite on Sunday. 
""Oh respected leaders, I address whatever conscience remains in you,"" he said. ""Do you sleep comfortably at night while those under your care starve, and die of thirst and by suicide?""

Earlier this week, dozens of people mourned a man who killed himself in a busy Beirut district, blaming the country's leaders for the hardship which they said caused his death.

Members of the Shuar Kumay community last week took two police officers, two soldiers, one public official and one civilian hostage to demand the right to give their leader, Alberto Mashutak, a traditional burial.
The group insisted that Mashutak, who died in a hospital in late May, did not die of the novel coronavirus.
“The body of the indigenous leader was delivered to his community,” the police said in a statement, adding that authorities took special health protocols during the exhumation process to prevent possible COVID-19 spread.
The freed hostages will undergo medical examinations, the statement added.
Ecuador suffered a brutal outbreak of coronavirus in March and April that left bodies accumulating in the streets of its biggest city, Guayaquil. But since then, infection and death rates have declined amid social distancing measures.
Amazonian indigenous groups on Wednesday reported having 1,215 coronavirus cases and 37 deaths, according to data published by the Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of the Ecuadorian Amazon.

LONDON (Reuters) - People in England appear to have broadly behaved themselves as pubs reopened this weekend, Britain's health minister Matt Hancock said on Sunday after the latest step towards a return to normality from the coronavirus lockdown.
Thousands of people flocked to pubs, restaurants and bars around England on Saturday as large parts of the hospitality sector reopened for the first time since March.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to ""enjoy summer safely"" as he bids to tread a narrow path of restoring consumer spending to help battered businesses recover, while avoiding a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
""From what I've seen, although there's some pictures to the contrary, very very largely people have acted responsibly,"" health minister Matt Hancock told Sky News. 
""Overall, I'm pleased with what happened yesterday. It was really good to see people out and about, and largely socially distancing.""
Britain has been the European country worst hit by the coronavirus and has an official death toll of 44,198.
Johnson and Prince Charles each paid treatment to Britain's National Health Service, 72 years after it was founded, for its sacrifices in tackling the pandemic.
Simon Stevens, chief executive of NHS England, thanked the public for their support, as well as their restraint on Saturday night.
""Pleasingly, we did not see last night the kind of scenes people feared (there) might be"" he told BBC's Andrew Marr Show.
""The foolish few, but the sensible majority, I think is the story across the country, and long may that continue."" 
Police Federation National Chair John Apter however said it was ""crystal clear"" that drunk people were unable to practice social distancing. 
The rule changes apply only to England as the devolved nations in the United Kingdom have been setting their own timetables for easing restrictions, with Wales and Scotland easing restrictions more slowly.
The government has said that it is aiming for local lockdowns rather than national restrictions if needed, such as the one introduced in the city of Leicester last week.
Hancock said he was worried about factory conditions in the city.  Boohoo  (L:BOOH) last week defended its supply chain practices after criticism from a garment workers' rights group.
""There are some quite significant concerns about some of the employment practices in some of the clothing factories in Leicester,"" he said, adding there was significant enforcement powers available including shutting down businesses.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Antonio Chenarce, a 49-year-old baker and father of three in Buenos Aires, has struggled to make ends meet since losing his job due to the coronavirus lockdown imposed in the Argentine capital since mid-March.
The health crisis has hammered Argentina's economy, which is now expected to shrink around 12% this year, driving millions into poverty and leaving almost six out of every 10 children and adolescents below the poverty line, United Nations data show.
""If I don't work, it's all screwed up. Food is expensive. Hunger doesn't wait for you,"" Chenarce, who lives with his wife and children in a poor neighborhood of the capital, said in an interview.
Argentina's center-left government has extended a lockdown in and around Buenos Aires until July 17 after a recent sharp spike in COVID-19 cases. It has rolled out measures to support those worst affected, while grappling with a public debt crisis after a ninth sovereign default in May.
The South American country has reported over 75,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with around 1,500 deaths. Cases have jumped recently, but remain fewer than in neighboring Chile, Peru and Brazil.
Roberto Valent, U.N. coordinator in Argentina, said the pandemic was leading to a spike in poverty and predicted that 58.6% of children and adolescents would be in poverty by year's end. That is up from 53% in late 2019.
""We already have a level of growth in poverty that goes far beyond what Argentina could have foreseen even in its worst nightmares,"" said Valent. Up to 850,000 jobs could be lost this year due to the coronavirus, he estimated.
Chenarce's wife Benita Ortencia Rivero Rodriguez, 44, said the lack of work and money was tough with the children.

""We try to take more care of each other because sometimes the kids lack things. They ask you (for something) and you don't have it and sometimes it costs a lot,"" she said. ""Since this all started, there is just less work.""

Both have recovered after contracting the coronavirus, with Johnson having said the NHS saved his life, ""no question"", after he was admitted to intensive care with severe COVID-19 symptoms.
Johnson was expected to join in a ""Clap for Carers"" at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT), a reprise of what had been a weekly tribute to doctors, nurses, and other frontline workers during the height of lockdown.
""This year, we've seen not only the greatest challenge the NHS has ever faced, but also an unprecedented outpouring of affection and support for that institution,"" Johnson said in a video tribute.
The NHS was founded on July 5, 1948 by Aneurin Bevan, who was health minister in the Labour government at the time. He said the taxpayer-funded service should be free at the point of delivery, with treatment based on clinical needs and not a person's ability to pay.
Prince Charles, Queen Elizabeth's son and heir to the throne, said this founding principle was a ""profoundly moving statement of our values"" which was never more relevant than now.
He paid tribute to the sacrifices made by the staff of the NHS to provide treatment to more than 100,000 patients who have been treated in hospital for COVID-19. He has said he was lucky to get away with only mild symptoms from his diagnosis, and was not admitted to hospital. 
""To all who have given so much during this present danger, I just want to say that it is you who have been our shield. It is your hands that have held us up,"" he said in a video message.

""Despite all that has been endured, there is deep cause for gratitude, and a true reason for pride.""

The government had said in June that the restrictions would be eased from July 9, but Ryan said this had been delayed due to concern about travel-related infections. 
""A so-called green list... will be published on July 20, or prior to that,"" Ryan said in an interview with Newstalk radio station on Sunday. ""The green list will be operating after that"" date, he said. 
Neighbouring Britain on Friday ended coronavirus quarantines for people arriving in England from more than 50 countries.
Ryan said Ireland would drop the quarantine for countries whose infection rates ""are similar if not better than our own."" 
Ireland now has one of the lowest infection rates in Europe, with just three infections per 100,000 people during the past two weeks, so the list of exempted countries is likely to be much shorter than England's, government ministers have indicated.
Ryan said that the government was considering ""a certain element of testing"" for COVID-19 at airports, but that every visitor would not be tested. 
Ireland did not want an ""avalanche"" of Irish people traveling abroad and said the government would continue to encourage people to take holidays at home, he said.

The sweeping legislation, which came into force on Tuesday night at the same time its contents were published, punishes crimes related to secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with punishments of up to life in prison.
Hong Kong public libraries ""will review whether certain books violate the stipulations of the National Security Law,"" the Leisure and Cultural Services Department, which runs the libraries, said in a statement.
""While legal advice will be sought in the process of the review, the books will not be available for borrowing and reference in libraries.”

""The national security law ... imposes a mainland-style censorship regime upon this international financial city,"" Wong tweeted on Saturday, adding his titles ""are now prone to book censorship.""
The national-security legislation has been criticised by pro-democracy activists, lawyers and foreign governments who fear it would be used to stifle dissent and undermine freedoms the former British colony was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The day after the law came into effect, one man was arrested for carrying a Hong Kong independence flag.
On Friday, the local government declared the slogan ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" illegal. And a man who had driven a motorcycle into police officers during a protest and carried a flag with that message was charged with terrorism and inciting secessionism.
Local and Beijing officials have repeatedly said the legislation would not curb freedom of speech or the media, nor any other rights in the city. The new law, they said, only targets a few ""troublemakers.""

It is unclear how many books are under review. Two titles by Chinese Nobel Peace Prize-winning political dissident Liu Xiaobo were still available, according to the online search.

The strikes were carried out by ""unknown aircraft"", the military source with the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar said. 
A resident at the nearby town of Zintan said explosions were heard from the direction of the base. 
Watiya's recapture in May by the Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli marked the start of a sudden collapse of the LNA's 14-month assault to seize the capital and its retreat along the coast to the new frontlines. 
Turkish support was vital to the GNA in turning back the LNA offensive with advanced air defences and drone strikes that targeted Khalifa's supply lines and troop build-ups. 
A Turkish source said last month that Turkey was in talks with the GNA to establish two bases in Libya, one of them at Watiya, the most important airbase in western Libya. 
Turkey's Defence Minister Hulusi Akar was in Tripoli for meetings with the GNA on Friday and Saturday and Akar swore to do all that was necessary to help it, a Turkish defence ministry statement said. 
The LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. During its advance towards Tripoli last year, the LNA was assisted by Egyptian and UAE airstrikes. 
Last month, the United States said Russia had sent at least 14 MiG29 and Su-24 warplanes to an LNA base via Syria, where their Russian airforce markings were removed. 
Turkish involvement in Libya has also angered France and Greece and French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has warned of new sanctions on Ankara. 
The GNA and LNA are now mobilising forces at the new frontlines between the cities of Misrata and Sirte. Egypt has warned that any Turkish-backed effort to take Sirte, which the LNA captured in January, could lead its army to directly intervene.

A month since Australia's first such rallies, the crowds were smaller amid health warnings about the spread of the coronavirus, as infections grow in the state of Victoria, home to Melbourne, the second-largest city.
At the Sydney protest, masks and hand sanitiser were given out and organisers pleaded with people to maintain social distance. An ancient Aboriginal smoking ceremony took place, as the families of those who died in police custody circled it.
Protests in Adelaide, Brisbane, Cairns, Darwin, Perth and other cities the previous day drew smaller crowds.
The greater global awareness over the treatment of minorities as a result of Black Lives Matter comes as Australia holds an inquiry into mining giant Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO)'s destruction of two ancient and sacred Aboriginal caves.

The latest government data shows Australia's indigenous people make up just over 3% of a population of about 25 million.

Israel, widely believed to be the region's only nuclear power, has pledged never to allow Iran to obtain atomic weapons, saying Tehran advocates its destruction. Iran denies ever seeking nuclear arms and says its atomic programme is peaceful.
The underground Natanz site, where a one-storey building was partly burned on Thursday, is the centrepiece of Iran's uranium enrichment programme and monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Asked whether Israel had anything to do with ""mysterious explosions"" at Iranian nuclear sites, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said: ""Not every incident that transpires in Iran necessarily has something to do with us.""
""All those systems are complex, they have very high safety constraints and I'm not sure they always know how to maintain them,"" Gantz told Israel Radio.
Three Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters said they thought cyber sabotage had been involved at Natanz, but offered no evidence. Two said Israel could have been behind it.
An article by Iran's state news agency IRNA addressed what it called the possibility of sabotage by enemies such as Israel and the United States, although it stopped short of accusing either directly.
In 2010, the Stuxnet computer virus, widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel, was discovered after it was used to attack Natanz.
Last month, Israeli security cabinet minister Zeev Elkin said Iran had attempted to mount a cyber attack on Israel's water system in April. 

Iran curbed its nuclear work in exchange for removal of most global sanctions under a 2015 accord with six world powers. It has reduced compliance since the United States withdrew in 2018.

Security forces at the same time stopped another Katyusha rocket from being launched at Taji military air base north of Baghdad which hosts U.S. troops, a military statement added.
The military gave no further details. U.S. officials blame Iran-backed militia for regular rocket attacks on U.S. facilities in Iraq, including near the embassy in Baghdad. No known Iran-backed groups have claimed responsibility.
A police and a medical source confirmed a child was lightly injured and said it was caused by rocket fragments that landed on a home.
The police source said an anti-rocket system set up to defend the U.S. embassy, and which had been tested on Saturday, had shot down a rocket which exploded in mid-air before it could hit the Green Zone. 
Iraqi security forces raided a headquarters of the Kataib Hezbollah Iran-backed militia in southern Baghdad last week arresting more than a dozen members of the group on charges of involvement in rocket attacks. 
Most of whom were released shortly afterwards.
Paramilitary groups backed by Iran have come to dominate parts of Iraq's security institutions, economy and political life.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi's government is favoured by the United States and has indicated it will back up tough talk against the militias with action, but last week's confusing episode over the arrest of militiamen showed it will come up against tough resistance.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Visitors to the Taj Mahal will have to wear masks at all times, keep their distance and not touch its glistening marble surfaces when India's 17th-century monument to love reopens on Monday after a three-month COVID-19 shutdown. 
Only 5,000 tourists will be allowed in a day, split into two groups, a far cry from peak levels of 80,000 a day who would swarm the mausoleum built in the northern city of Agra by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his wife, in a 22-year effort.
""All centrally protected monuments & sites shall be bound by the protocols like sanitization, social distancing & other health protocols,"" the federal tourism ministry said in a tweet. 
Authorities are reopening the Taj and other monuments, such as New Delhi's historic Red Fort, just as India's coronavirus infections are rising at the fastest pace in three months.
On Sunday, the health ministry reported a record single-day spike of 24,850 new cases and more than 600 deaths, pushing the overall case tally to 673,165, closing in on Russia, the third-most affected country globally.
But the government has been lifting a vast lockdown of India's 1.3 billion people that has left tens of thousands without work and shuttered businesses. 
While international flights remain suspended, domestic travel has been opened up, and the government is hoping visitors will start to trickle back to some popular destinations. 
Agra, one of India's first big clusters of the virus, remains the worst-affected city in Uttar Pradesh, the country's most populous state. 
""All around the Taj are containment zones,"" said a local district administration official, requesting anonymity, ahead of the monument's planned reopening.
Containment zones, areas identified as most affected by the virus, remain under strict lockdown, with restricted access and movement of only essential goods and services.

""We don't expect visitors here because clusters around the Taj, including shops and hotels are closed,"" the official said.

Kristy McBain of the centre-left Labor Party claimed a narrow win over Fiona Kotvojs of Morrison's conservative party in electorate of Eden-Monaro.
""I'm very pleased and honoured to be the next member for Eden-Moreno,"" McBain said in televised remarks. 
McBain received 50.58% of the votes, while Kotvojs got 49.42%, according to the Australian Electoral Commission's website.
Although not a major blow to Morrison - the results will not affect the balance of power in parliament - McBain's apparent victory shows that a recent rebound in the prime minister's approval ratings has not decisively translated into votes.
Morrison's uniting management style in the COVID-19 pandemic and his decisive measures have made him the country's most popular leader in a decade.
That followed a steep decline in his popularity at the start of the year over his handling of the devastating bushfires that killed dozens of people and millions of animals, charring vast swaths of land.

""It has been an election that had been fought on local issues first and foremost,"" said McBain, whose electorate on the south coast of New South Wales state has suffered severely from the bushfires.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Voters in Tokyo went to the polls on Sunday to elect their governor, with incumbent Yuriko Koike forecast to clinch a victory, as Japan's capital struggles with rebounding coronavirus infections and prepares for next year's Olympics.
Cases of the virus that causes COVID-19 rose for a fourth straight day to a two-month high of 131 on Saturday, the third day in a row over 100. The metropolis accounts for 11% of Japan's population, but has represented half of the country's daily infections in recent weeks. 
Koike, who became Tokyo's first woman governor in 2016, saw her popularity surge this year as her straight-talking approach to the outbreak won the public's support.
""I think she has been working hard on the coronavirus. As a woman, I want her to keep on doing a good job,"" Tomiko Kawano, 80, told Reuters after voting for her. 
Recent media polls showed Koike, often floated as a potential prime minister, commanding a comfortable lead over other contenders including Kenji Utsunomiya, former president of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations. 
The winner of Sunday's election will face a difficult task of trying to curb the virus without overly stifling business in the capital, which accounts for about 20% of Japan's economy.
Preventive measures pushed Japan, the world's third-biggest economy, into a recession in the first quarter, with a deeper contraction expected in the April-June period.
The next governor will also be the face of the host city of the next Olympic Games, originally scheduled to start this month, but postponed by one year because of the coronavirus.
Koike, 67, has said she aims for a safe, secure and simplified event, while a survey by the Asahi newspaper showed last month that 59% of those polled believe the Tokyo Olympics should be cancelled or postponed again. 

Voting ends at 8 p.m. (1100 GMT), with media likely to call the outcome soon after.

""He was placed in custody when troopers arrived on scene,"" Van Cleave said by phone. ""The investigation is still ongoing. At this time we're not suspecting drugs or alcohol as a factor in the crash.""

Investigators do not know whether the driver intended to hit the demonstrators, he said. Seattle has been the scene of numerous demonstrations, some of them on interstate highways, since the May 25 killing of George Floyd on a Minneapolis street while he was in police custody, which was captured on video.
A video of the Seattle incident shared on social media shows a lone white car speeding up Interstate-5, swerving to avoid a van that was parked to block the roadway and heading toward a small group of panicked protesters who tried to scurry away.

The car can be seen striking two individuals near the side of the roadway, both of whom were flipped over the car's roof before landing on the pavement.

The French capital's official Pride parade was postponed to November because of the coronavirus epidemic, but organisers decided to hold a march they said should be more politically driven and support the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement.
""Because of COVID, the normal Pride parade had to be cancelled, but we managed to organise a Pride that is more political,"" a drag king and illustrator who gave her name as Saint Eugene told Reuters TV.
Marchers, who chanted slogans such as ""Everyone hates the police"", made their way peacefully from the Moulin Rouge cabaret in the Pigalle neighbourhood to Place de la Republique on the city's Right Bank, many of them wearing face masks.
Some waved ""Black Lives Matter"" placards in support of protests ignited by the death of George Floyd, a Black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis in the United States triggered worldwide protests.
More than 200 LGBT rights marches have been postponed or cancelled due to the spread of the coronavirus, according to the European Pride Organisers Association, which estimates that up to 22 million people attend at least one Pride in Europe every year.

Activists climbed the roof of the slaughterhouse and processing plant in Toennies and unfurled a banner saying ""Shut down Tierindustrie [animal industry]"". Protesters also blocked a major access road and demanded changes to current meat industry practices.
Some 600,000 people in nearby Guetersloh were forced back into lockdown on June 23 after more than 1,500 workers at the plant tested positive for COVID-19.
Members of the group -- Gemeinsam gegen die Tierindustrie -- displayed placards saying ""Stop exploiting humans, animals, nature,"" on the road outside Toennies, alluding to the high prevalence of infections among staff as well as to the slaughtering of animals under inhumane conditions.
Three protesters were detained and hand-cuffed and taken to a police station in Guetersloh, the group said on Twitter. More than 100 people took part in the demonstration, it said.
While Germany's management of the coronavirus crisis has been among the most successful in Europe, it has seen repeated outbreaks in slaughterhouses, whose employees are often migrants living in crowded company-provided accommodation.

Her election marked the end of a quarter century of conservative rule in Marseille, which joins Lyon, Bordeaux, Strasbourg and others in sending environmentalists to power.
Rubirola pledged to clean up the Mediterranean port city, which has suffered from pollution, municipal strikes and traffic congestion, but has also been ridden by gang violence, corruption and poverty.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - China fired back at Canada on Saturday for criticising Beijing's national security law for Hong Kong, the second rebuke in a week that has added to strains of their bilateral ties.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that Canada was suspending its extradition treaty with Hong Kong due to the law and Canada's foreign minister called the legislation ""a significant step back"" for liberty.
China's embassy in Ottawa said in a statement on its website that Canada had ""grossly interfered"" in Chinese affairs, adding that the new legislation would safeguard security in Hong Kong.
""Some western countries including Canada have been meddling in Hong Kong affairs under the pretext of human rights, which seriously violates international law and basic norms of international relations,"" a spokesperson said in the statement.
China imposed the legislation this week despite protests by Hong Kongers and criticism from Western nations, which said the legislation was setting the financial hub on an authoritarian track.
Hong Kong officials said on Saturday they were ""very disappointed"" in Canada's suspension of the extradition treaty.
A spokesman in the prime minister's office referred to a Friday statement by the foreign minister that reiterated Canada's ""serious concern"" with the law. The government had no further comment, he said.
Relations between Beijing and Ottawa have been tense since 2018 when Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co [HWT.UL], on a U.S. warrant.
After Meng was detained, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, on charges of espionage.

China also rebuked Canada a week ago over Ottawa's criticism about the prosecution of the Canadians.

It will be renamed after another nearby street, Glinkastrasse, named after 19th century Russian composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka.
BVG said on Friday it would change the station name, amid a worldwide reckoning with buried legacies of racism and colonial crimes underpinning many western societies, sparked by the death in the United States of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a police officer.

LONDON (Reuters) - People relished their first pub drinks in more than three months, went to restaurants and finally got haircuts on Saturday as England took its biggest steps yet towards resumption of normal life after the coronavirus lockdown.
Some pubs started serving from 6 a.m., sparking worries of over-indulgence on what the media dubbed a ""Super Saturday"" of restrictions being eased. Some hairdressers were reported to have opened at the stroke of midnight.
""It's beautiful just to get back and have a pint,"" said Jim Martin, a 56-year old carpenter enjoying a drink at The Holland Tringham pub in south London, part of the JD (NASDAQ:JD)  Wetherspoon  (L:JDW) chain. It opened at 8 a.m. and was about three quarters full by 11.20 a.m.
Julie Scott, a 43-year-old teacher, was there with her family for drinks and food.
""I think it's just where everyone gets to socialise and catch up with people that they haven't seen...it's nice to just get together,"" she said.
Others complained that the lockdown, which began in late March and has been gradually eased in recent weeks, had lasted too long.
""It's about time they opened them up,"" said pensioner Ron Lock.
Police chiefs worried the reopening of pubs could fuel drunken and irresponsible behaviour, while hospitals have been warned to prepare for a New Year's Eve-style weekend.
""There's an element of decompression going on, particularly with younger people who've had some very responsible parents keeping them in over recent weeks,"" Marc Jones, Police and Crime Commissioner for Lincolnshire, told BBC radio. 
Britain has been the European country worst hit by the coronavirus, with more than 300,000 infections and an official death toll of 44,131. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has faced criticism from the opposition over its handling of the pandemic - including locking down later than some other parts of Europe - and is now anxious to get the battered economy moving again.
THE JOY OF A HAIRCUT
Men queuing for haircuts and busy hairdressing salons were a common sight across the country.
At Savvas Barbers in Streatham, south London, healthcare assistant Benjamin Prior, 31, said he normally gets a cut every month but has had to wait four months.
""It’s just brilliant to finally get a new haircut now, it’s the length I want, short as possible,"" he said.
Mark Lewis a 52-year old translator, welcomed the lockdown's easing.
""It’s enjoyable to have a haircut but it’s also nice to feel smart again,"" he said.
In another relaxation of lockdown rules, two households can now meet indoors as long as social distancing is maintained, and overnight stays are allowed.
The rule changes apply only to England as the devolved nations in the United Kingdom - Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland - have been setting their own timetables for easing restrictions.
The Sun newspaper predicted that 15 million pints (8.5 million litres) of beer would be sunk in England on Saturday, though some pub-goers may be deterred by rainy, windy weather.
Johnson called on people to behave responsibly and respect social distancing regulations as the risk of a resurgence of the coronavirus remains. He also stressed the importance of supporting businesses.
""We must not let them down,"" he said at a news conference on Friday.
Pub-goers will find the atmosphere rather different from the usual Saturday-night scrum.

Numbers are limited, no one can stand at the bar and there will be no live music. Patrons will also have to give their details to allow tracers to identify them if anyone later tests positive.

Instead, they offered funeral prayers for him there on Saturday, lighting candles on a plywood coffin and chanting Buddhist sutras for the 21-year-old, one of more than 170 people killed in a landslide on Thursday. 
The miners were hunting for precious stones in Hpakant - the centre of Myanmar’s secretive billion-dollar jade industry - when a wave of mud and water crashed onto them, entombing them under a layer of mud.
More than a dozen miners were cremated in Hpakant on Saturday, while 41 were buried in a mass grave. Seventy-seven were buried on Friday.
Thursday’s disaster, the worst in memory, highlights the perils of the trade, which draws impoverished migrants from across the country seeking to make their fortune.
It is not uncommon for university students to work in the mines gathering pocket money for the next semester. Officials said the victims were freelance jade pickers who scoured tailings, the residue from mining, for stones missed by larger operators. 
Myanmar supplies 90% of the world’s jade, the vast majority exported to neighbouring China. Rights groups say the industry is riddled with abuses. Scores are killed every year.
Like many others who died, Saw Myint Tun was from Rakhine state, his brother-in-law, Hla Shwe Win, told Reuters.
Rakhine, one of Myanmar's poorest regions, is the state from which more than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee for neighbouring Bangladesh after a military crackdown in 2017 that the U.N. has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies committing genocide.
Now it is the site of an escalating war between Arakan Army rebels, who seek greater autonomy for the region, and government troops.
Hla Shwe Win said one of his brothers had died in the disaster, while another was wounded.
They had followed him to Hpakant to work in the mines, he said, as women wept over the coffin before it was burned in line with Buddhist traditions.

“They came here, counting on me,” he told Reuters, saying there were no words to describe how he felt.

Amendments made to Egypt's constitution last year provided for the creation of the Council of Senators, a 180-member secondary chamber that will be two-thirds elected by the public and the remainder appointed by the president.
""Holding elections during the pandemic that has swept the world necessitates that we take several precautionary measures to protect ourselves and society,"" Ibrahim said during a televised press conference.
He said all polling stations will observe health guidelines, with all voters and polling staff required to wear masks, and social distancing measures will be enforced.
Egypt reported 1,485 new cases of coronavirus on Friday bringing the total number of infections to 72,711, including 3,201 deaths.
The poll results will be announced on Aug. 19 in the official state gazette, Ibrahim said.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan has proposed restoring the mosque status of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, a sixth century building at the heart of both the Christian Byzantine and Muslim Ottoman empires and now one of Turkey's most visited monuments. 
""We can't go back to the Middle Ages now,"" Metropolitan Hilarion, chairman of the Moscow Patriarchate's department for external church relations, said on state television, the Interfax news agency reported. 
""We live in a multipolar world, we live in a multi-confessional world and we need to respect the feelings of believers.""
He said the Russian Orthodox Church did not understand the motive for Hagia Sophia's conversion and that it believed domestic politics was behind the move. 
""We believe that in the current conditions this act is an unacceptable violation of religious freedom,"" he was quoted as saying. 
A Turkish court earlier this week heard a case aimed at converting the building back into a mosque and will announce its verdict later this month.
The court case, brought by an NGO for preserving historic monuments, disputes the legality of a decision in 1934, in the early days of the modern secular Turkish state under Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, to convert Hagia Sophia - known in Turkish as Ayasofya - from a mosque into a museum.
The proposal has been criticised by other religious and political leaders.
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and based in Istanbul, said converting it into a mosque would disappoint Christians and would ""fracture"" East and West.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Greek government have also urged Turkey to keep the building as a museum.

Erdogan has described foreign criticism over the proposal as an attack on Turkey's sovereignty.

People took photos and listened to audio guides after Archbishop of Barcelona Juan Jose Omella led representatives of healthcare workers into the church. 
The basilica, designed by architect Antoni Gaudi, closed almost four months ago. But for the next two weekends it will be open to essential workers, including those in healthcare, the police and NGOs, who will be able to explore without the usual crowds. 
The goal is to recognise and pay tribute to Barcelona residents, ""especially those who have been on the front lines fighting and working to prevent Covid-19"", according to a statement on the basilica’s website. 
""It's the first time I've been and for me it represents a gift, a gift for the effort and the hours we've put in during the past few months, so I'm grateful,"" said Virginia Martinez, a hospital doctor from the nearby city of Terrassa. ""It's recognition of our work and what's better than visiting a monument like this?"" 
A second phase of reopening will see the lofty and famously unfinished church welcome Barcelona's residents for free, while a third phase will allow domestic and international tourists to visit.
Started in 1882, the Sagrada Familia is the sixth most visited tourist attraction in the world, according to TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). 
The reopening came as Catalonia on Saturday enforced a new lockdown on more than 200,000 people after several new outbreaks of coronavirus were detected. 
Residents in Segria, which includes the city of Lleida, around 150 km (90 miles) away from Barcelona, are not permitted to leave the area, but will not be confined to their homes as was the case during Spain's strict lockdown at the start of the outbreak.

Spain has registered 205,545 coronavirus cases and 28,385 deaths, according to health ministry data, making it one of the worst affected countries in Europe.

His comments to TASS news agency countered those of John Sullivan, U.S. ambassador to Russia, who told RBC TV on Friday that Washington was ""engaged with the Russian Foreign Ministry and with the other G7 governments about whether there is an appropriate role for Russia at the G7.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has raised the prospect of Russia's return to the group, which includes the world's most advanced economies, after it was expelled in the wake of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. 
Trump said last month it was ""common sense"" to invite President Vladimir Putin to rejoin the group.
Russia had been part the group, then known as the G8, since 1997. 
Other G7 nations, including Canada and France, have objected to Russia's return, however.
Ryabkov said that the absence of China from an expanded G7 summit would make it impossible to discuss international issues.
""The idea of this so-called extended G7 is flawed because it's not clear how the authors of this initiative plan to address the Chinese factor,"" he was quoted as saying.
""Without China it's simply impossible to discuss any issues in the modern world.""
Trump in May announced he was postponing a G7 summit until September or later and expanding the list of invitees to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India.

Australia has accepted the U.S. invitation to take part.

Speaking at a conference organised by the UIL trade union, Conte said the government needed to ""redefine"" tax incentives in favour of green, digital investments of the future, adding ""we must support the worst affected industries such as automotive and tourism"".
The government would start working on a comprehensive tax reform from next week, he said, but did not elaborate.
The automotive industry accounts for 6.2% of Italy's gross domestic product, according to data provided by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA).
On Friday the Italian Parliament gave the green light to a package of incentives to encourage sales of state-of-the-art combustion engine cars as well as electric and hybrid vehicles, two lawmakers told Reuters.
Italy is the world's fifth most visited country, according to United Nations data, and tourism contributes about 13% to GDP, according to the World Trade and Tourism Council.

If all goes ""very, very, very well"", the extra debt the state is taking on to help fund short-hour work schemes and aid to businesses could hit 20 billion Swiss francs ($21.15 billion), he told broadcaster SRF in the interview aired on Saturday. 
Otherwise the debt pile could hit 35 billion, he said. This is still less than the 40 billion francs the government originally projected for extra debt, but Maurer cautioned there was still lots of uncertainty about the numbers. 
The government said this week it anticipates a budget deficit of around 1 billion francs next year, and said it would decide at year's end how to pay back the billions of debt it has accumulated to provide relief for struggling business.
Maurer reiterated the state would not raise taxes to do so. He said a likely option for debt reduction was to earmark yearly profit distributions it gets from the Swiss National Bank, and dismissed calls for a special one-off SNB payout.
The central bank has to be independent, and politicians should not touch the assets it needs to intervene on currency markets to rein in the safe-haven Swiss franc's strength, he said, calling this an important contribution to the export-led economy.
""It cannot be that we print money to pay state debt,"" he said, calling for spending discipline.
The government last month phased out most restrictive measures as coronavirus cases waned, declaring the country better equipped to handle any fresh flare-ups.

More than 170 people, many of them migrants seeking their fortune in the jade-rich Hpakant area of Kachin state, died on Thursday after mining waste collapsed into a lake, triggering a surge of mud and water. 
The miners were collecting stones in Hpakant - the centre of Myanmar’s secretive billion-dollar jade industry - when the wave crashed onto them, entombing them under a layer of mud.
Thar Lin Maung, a local official from the information ministry, told Reuters by phone on Saturday 171 bodies had been pulled out but more were continuing to float to the surface.
He said the 77 buried on Friday had been identified and 39 would be interred on Saturday. Volunteers carried plywood coffins and placed them into a mass grave carved out by diggers close to the mine site.
Many other bodies, battered and stripped of their clothing by the force of the wave that hit them, still have not been identified.
Myanmar supplies 90% of the world’s jade, the vast majority of which is exported to neighbouring China, which borders Kachin state. Deadly landslides and other accidents are common in the mines, which draw impoverished workers from across Myanmar.
About 100 people were killed in a 2015 collapse that led to calls to regulate the industry. Another 50 died in 2019. But Thursday's landslide was the worst in memory.
The country’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, on Friday blamed the disaster on joblessness in the country, lamenting in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live broadcast that informal workers had to go to the mines for lack of other employment.
The government announced the formation of a committee to investigate the disaster.
However, activists say little has changed in the industry despite a pledge from Suu Kyi's government to clean it up when she took power in 2016.
Rights group Global Witness said in a statement the landslide was a “damning indictment of the government’s failure to curb reckless and irresponsible mining practices.”
“Neither a promised new Gemstone law, passed by parliament in 2019, nor a Gemstone policy that has been in production for several years have yet been implemented,” the statement said.

The rights group says the trade is worth billions of dollars a year, funds it says fuel armed conflict between government troops and ethnic Kachin rebels fighting for greater autonomy for the region.

Rallies in the cities of Brisbane, Darwin and Perth drew a smaller turnout than a month ago, however, amid calls for a halt from authorities concerned about the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
Bogaine Spearim, one of the organisers, said the protests were a continuation of global protests unleashed by the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in the U.S. city of Minneapolis in late May. 
""No police officer or prison guard has ever been criminally charged with murder and sent to prison, so that's why we are here for justice,"" added Spearim, an organiser of the Brisbane demonstration.

The result in the bushfire-hit electorate of Eden-Monaro will not affect the balance of power in Australia's parliament, but it may be a barometer of opinion on Morrison, whose popularity fell over his handling of the devastating fires but seems to have improved with his response to the new coronavirus.
""It will be a close call,"" Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack told reporters at a polling booth in Tumut in the sprawling Eden-Monaro electorate on the south coast of New South Wales state. ""I'm not quite sure whether the actual result will be known tonight."" 
Kristy McBain of the centre-left Labor Party and Fiona Kotvojs of Morrison's conservative party are vying for the seat of an opposition lawmaker who retired due to ill-health. 
Morrison's popularity slumped earlier this year, particularly in Eden-Monaro which was badly damaged by bushfires, after he took his family on holiday to Hawaii as blazes raged across the country. 
He later won plaudits, however, for the government's aggressive action to limit the spread of the pandemic. The policies are credited with helping Australia record about 8,300 infections and 104 deaths - well below many other countries.

The next federal election is due by mid-2022.

Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui said negotiations would not work out between Washington and Pyongyang and there will be no change in North Korea's policy.
""We do not feel any need to sit face to face with the U.S., as it does not consider the DPRK-U.S. dialogue as nothing more than a tool for grappling its political crisis,"" Choe said in a statement carried by state-run KCNA news agency. 
DPRK stands for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, North Korea's formal name.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is due to visit South Korea next week to discuss stalled talks with North Korea.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Wednesday that U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should meet again before the U.S. elections in November, which would help resume the stalled nuclear negotiations. 
Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, told reporters in New York on Thursday that the president might seek another summit with Kim as an ""October Surprise"" ahead of the election.
Trump and Kim Jong Un met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore.
They met again in Vietnam in 2019, but the talks fell apart when Trump said Kim had failed to offer enough nuclear weapons or ballistic missiles in exchange for lifting international sanctions. 

At their third meeting, in June 2019 at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas, the two agreed to restart negotiations. Working-level talks between the two sides in Sweden in October were broken off.

(Reuters) - Two U.S. aircraft carriers were conducting exercises in the disputed South China Sea on Saturday, the U.S. navy said, as China also carried out military drills that have been criticised by the Pentagon and neighbouring states.
China and the United States have accused each other of stoking tension in the strategic waterway at a time of strained relations over everything from the new coronavirus to trade to Hong Kong.
The USS Nimitz and USS Ronald Reagan were carrying out operations and exercises in the South China Sea ""to support a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" the navy said in a statement.
It did not say exactly where the exercises were being conducted in the South China Sea, which extends for some 1,500 km (900 miles) and 90% of which is claimed by China despite the protests of its neighbours.
""The purpose is to show an unambiguous signal to our partners and allies that we are committed to regional security and stability,"" Rear Admiral George M. Wikoff was quoted as saying by the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the exercises.
Wikoff, commander of the strike group led by the Ronald Reagan, said the exercises were not a response to those being conducted by China, which the Pentagon criticised this week as ""counter-productive to efforts at easing tensions and maintaining stability"".
China dismissed the U.S. criticism of its drills on Friday and suggested the United States was to blame for increasing tensions.
U.S. carriers have long carried out exercises in the Western Pacific, including in the South China Sea, according to the U.S. navy. At one point recently, the United States had three carriers in the region.
China announced last week it had scheduled five days of drills starting July 1 near the Paracel Islands, which are claimed by both Vietnam and China.
Vietnam and the Philippines have also criticised the planned Chinese drills, warning they could create tension in the region and impact Beijing's relationship with its neighbours.
The United States accuses China of trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also lay claim to parts of the South China Sea, through which about $3 trillion of trade passes each year.

The U.S. statement said the naval exercises gave commanders the flexibility and capabilities ""that only the U.S. Navy can command"".

Beijing imposed a new national security law this week on the former British colony, despite protests from Hong Kong residents and Western nations, setting China's freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track.
""The Canadian government needs to explain to the rule of law, and explain to the world, why it allows fugitives not to bear their legal responsibilities,"" Hong Kong's security chief, John Lee, told a radio programme on Saturday.
Lee was very disappointed and strongly opposed Canada's move, he added, as it let politics override the rule of law.
The comments followed Canada's statement on Friday that it was suspending the treaty with Hong Kong in the wake of the new law and could boost immigration from the city.
Canada would also bar the export of sensitive military items to Hong Kong, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters.
On Saturday's programme, Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng said she was disappointed and expressed extreme regret over Canada's move, adding that she thought it could probably violate international law. 
On Friday, a Hong Kong government spokesman described as ""totally unacceptable"" a bill passed by the U.S. Senate to penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the new law.

(Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the alleged accomplice of Jeffrey Epstein, is being detained at a New Hampshire jail where she is likely separated from other inmates and under constant surveillance, local lawyers said.
A source familiar with Maxwell's case said she is being held at the Merrimack County Jail, a medium-security facility 20 miles from the luxurious home where she was arrested Thursday. 
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have accused Maxwell, 58, of luring underage girls so that Epstein could sexually abuse them. She is expected to be transferred to New York for a court appearance next week, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan said.
Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking minors between 2002 and 2005 when he was found hanged in a New York City jail in August. Medical examiners concluded his death was a suicide.
""Given what happened to Epstein and the special attention to this case, I would imagine there are orders from pretty high up to keep a close eye on her,"" said Andrew Winters, a New Hampshire defense lawyer not involved in Maxwell's defense who is familiar with the jail.
Maxwell is likely in her own holding cell where she can be observed at all times, said Ted Lothstein, another New Hampshire criminal defense lawyer.
""They are going to have her on the tightest security imaginable,"" said Lothstein, who frequently visits the jail but is not representing the British socialite.
A jail attendant directed requests for comment to a spokeswoman for the U.S. Marshals Service, who declined to comment on Maxwell's conditions. Maxwell's lawyer, Larry Vogelman, also declined to comment on her conditions.
The jail is a ""well-run"" and ""low-key"" facility, Lothstein said, and ""a vastly better jail than where she will be sent to in New York City."" 
Lothstein said new inmates at the Merrimack County Jail are generally held in a booking area for their first days there, where jail staff are able to keep a close eye on a few surrounding cells.
""There's nothing there,"" Lothstein said of the booking area. ""You can't interact with anyone in any other cell.""
After a psychological examination and risk assessment, inmates are moved into the general population. Women are held in a unit separated from the men.
Given Maxwell's profile and imminent transfer to New York, she would likely never be moved to the New Hampshire jail's general population, Lothstein said.
Despite the lack of company and television access in the central booking area, Maxwell is ""probably happy to be there"" and not in the women's unit, where she would likely be threatened and insulted, Lothstein said.
""Anybody charged with child sex abuse is public enemy number one in terms of how other inmates perceive them,"" Lothstein said. ""I would expect she would fall squarely into that category.""
Winters said Maxwell also would be less likely to contract the coronavirus in the central booking area, away from the jail's general population.
In March, a county official told the Concord Monitor that the jail was taking steps to mitigate spread of the virus, which at the time had about 170 inmates and 115 staff.
That month, a correctional officer at the jail tested positive for the virus, the official told the newspaper.
In general, the facility has a ""good reputation"" for safety and professionalism on the part of staff and administrators, Winters said.

""If I had to do time, that's where I would want to do time,"" Winters said.

Officials said armed gunmen clad in military-style uniforms attacked soldiers from the 16th Regiment in a neighborhood near the airport around dawn. The military seized eight AR-15 type weapons, one AK47, and two .50 caliber Barrett sniper rifles at the scene, officials said in a statement.
Images published by local news outlets appeared to show corpses piled in the back of a pickup truck and lying on a roadside in pools of blood.
A thirteenth man was found dead later in the day, according to officials, who said his death was related to the early-morning confrontation in Nuevo Laredo, opposite the city of Laredo in Texas.
Local news outlets reported the victims were likely members of the Cartel of the Northeast, a regional gang that is a remnant of the once-powerful Zetas cartel.
The military has not said whether any of its soldiers were injured or killed in the clash.
Homicides in Mexico hit a new record last year and are trending higher still in 2020. 
Also on Friday, five police officers were killed in the central state of Guanajuato, the state's security secretary said.

At least 118 members of the army have been investigated since 2016 for sex crimes against minors, the head of the army said earlier this week.
""Thirty-one members were removed from the institution: 12 sub-officials and 19 soldiers. This administrative measure was taken in accordance with legal norms that regulate personnel and by decision of the head of the national army,"" the army said in a statement.
The fired soldiers and officials will still face disciplinary and criminal investigations which could result in jail time.
Those who lost their jobs on Friday are among the 118 investigated since 2016, the army said.
Seven soldiers were arrested last week for alleged sexual abuse of an indigenous girl in Risaralda province. All seven men and three of their superiors have been fired, while two higher-up officials have been re-assigned.
Another case - that of a young girl allegedly sexually abused by various soldiers while being held at an army site in Guaviare province for several days without food or water - emerged last weekend.
The army has denied a systematic effort to protect army members implicated in acts of sexual violence against minors.
The Colombian army has 240,000 members and leads the country's fight against leftist guerrillas and crime gangs founded by former members of right-wing paramilitary groups.
The army has long been accused by victims and human rights groups of rights violations during Colombia's more than five decades of internal conflict.

PARIS (Reuters) - A Frenchman who converted to Islam and went abroad to fight for Islamic State was sentenced by a Paris court on Friday to 30 years in prison in France's first successful prosecution of an Islamist militant for crimes committed in Syria.
Tyler Vilus, 30, was arrested in Turkey five years ago as he prepared to catch a flight to Prague. Prosecutors told the court he wanted to lead the squad of gunmen and suicide bombers which attacked Paris in November 2015, but were unable to prove this.
The judges ruled the sentence carried a minimum 20 years in jail.
""By not choosing a life sentence, the court decided to leave you a glimmer of hope for you to evolve,"" chief judge Laurent Raviot said.
Vilus, who turned to Islam aged 21, denied any link to the Nov. 13, 2015 attacks but acknowledged for the first time that he left the Syrian battlefield to ""die with weapons in his hands.""
""Deep down, I know that when I leave I am going to die. It's a path with no return,"" he told the court, describing his emotions as he departed the caliphate. 
The chief prosecutor told the court Vilus trained to kill in Syria so that he could slaughter those he saw as infidels in France.
""Spilling the blood of non-believers for him brings jubilation,"" the prosecutor said, adding that Vilus' connections read like a ""Who's who"" of French jihadists abroad. 
Vilus fought under the nom-de-guerre Abou Hafs. With few witnesses to call on, the prosecution leaned heavily on videos that Islamic State had disseminated online to attract new recruits.
Although the prosecutors could not prove Vilus had killed people himself, they convinced the court he was part of an organised group which did. Under French law, the punishment is the same.
Among the prosecution's evidence, one video in which Vilus is clearly identifiable showed two men forced to kneel in a street in eastern Syria before they are executed. Vilus said he stumbled across the scene as he exited a mosque.

A retaining wall collapsed at the Armijos tailings station, located in the Camilo Ponce Enriquez area in southern Ecuador, the energy and mines ministry said. Nobody was injured.
""One of the immediate measures in the area will be ... to prohibit mining activities at that plant,"" the ministry said in a statement, without providing details on the incident.
The ministry said it opened an investigation to determine how the company could be sanctioned.
Ecuador this month is expected to release guidelines for the management of tailings dams, partly in response to high profile accidents including a 2019 dam collapse in Brazil that killed more than 250 people.
Reuters was not immediately able to contact Austro Gold.
Local authorities in Camilo Ponce Enriquez, a traditional mining zone, said the company had not complied with the protocols and the collapse caused sediment pollution in the river.
""There was a collapse ... and all this material, about 50 tons, went down the mountain until it reached the Tenguel river,"" city commissioner Cristian Tomala told reporters.
Ecuador has been developing large-scale mining since last year and has been exporting gold and copper from its two largest mines.

Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said the man died of COVID-19 and was subsequently buried in accordance with international protocols for handling corpses amid the pandemic.
""Police officers cannot be considered a bargaining chip in this or any circumstance,"" tweeted Romo, publishing photos of the officials sitting in a wooden building surrounded by community members, some carrying traditional spears. 
Members of the Shuar Kumay community insist that Alberto Mashutak did not die of COVID-19 and that they should be allowed to give him a traditional burial, said lawyer Marcos Espinoza, who represents the community.
As the dispute escalated on Thursday afternoon, community members took the two officers and an official with government of the state of Pastaza hostage, Espinoza said in a telephone interview.

The judge gave President Jair Bolsonaro's administration five days to come up with an emergency plan to protect the Yanomami by deploying agents from the indigenous affairs and environmental agencies and military personnel.
Some 27,000 Yanomami live in relative isolation on a vast reservation twice the size of Switzerland and have been invaded for decades by gold miners who have brought diseases fatal to their people.
To date, there have been more than 160 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the Yanomami people and five deaths. 
The tribe had appealed to authorities to expel the gold miners who have destroyed forests and poisoned rivers with mercury used to separate the gold from river-bed sediment.
A Reuters review of satellite images showed that illegal gold mining has risen sharply over the last five years on the reservation. 
Yanomami leaders say the number of prospectors on their land has surged since Bolsonaro was elected president in 2018 vowing to develop the Amazon and to tap its mineral riches even by allowing miners onto protected indigenous reservations.
In a Twitter post commenting on the court decision, Vice President Hamilton Mourão, a retired army general heading the government's Amazon policies, disputed the number of illegal miners on the reservation, estimating there were 3,500 and not 20,000 cited by the judge. 
Gold has become a significant export from Brazil's northernmost state of Roraima even though there are no legally registered gold mining operations there.
According to official statistics, 486 kilos were exported to India from Roraima in 2019, up from 38 kilos in 2018.

His comments followed a nationwide vote on constitutional reforms that included an amendment enshrining the definition of marriage specifically as a union between a man and a woman.
Putin said the U.S. embassy's move to raise the LGBT pride flag ""revealed something about the people that work there"".
""It's no big deal though. We have spoken about this many times, and our position is clear,"" said Putin, who has sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values and aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church.
""Yes, we passed a law banning the propaganda of homosexuality among minors. So what? Let people grow up, become adults and then decide their own destinies.""
The legislation has been used to stop gay pride marches and detain gay rights activists.
Putin said during the campaign to change the constitution that he would not let the traditional notion of a mother and father be subverted by what he called ""parent number 1"" and ""parent number 2"".
On Friday, the head of the Women's Union of Russia, Ekaterina Lakhova, told Putin that she feared an ice cream with the brand name 'Rainbow', as well as other multi-coloured advertising, could constitute propaganda for non-traditional values and have a harmful effect on children, the RIA news agency reported. 
""Even indirectly, such things make our children accustomed to that ... flag, the one that was hung up by the embassy,"" Lakhova was cited as saying. 
""It would be very good to have a commission to make sure that those values that we enshrined in our constitution are upheld,"" she said.

Other countries have also flown rainbow flags outside their embassies in Moscow, including Britain.

Julius Ayuk Tabe, the most prominent separatist leader who is currently serving a life sentence in prison for charges including terrorism, said the meeting took place on Thursday to discuss the possibility of a ceasefire.
Violence broke out in 2017 following a government crackdown on peaceful protests by Anglophone lawyers and teachers who complained of being marginalised by the French-speaking majority.
The fighting has caused more than 3,000 deaths and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes.
Last year, Switzerland mediated talks between the government and exiled separatist leaders, but those leaders are considered less influential than Tabe and the discussions did not produce any significant results. 
Tabe, the self-declared president of an independent English-speaking state the separatists call Ambazonia, said nine separatist leaders participated in the meeting, which followed calls by the United Nations for a ceasefire.
""Be reassured that we remain committed to the restoration of the independence of the homeland,"" he said in a statement, without providing further details about the substance of the talks. 
Government officials were not immediately available for comment.
One of the security sources who confirmed the meeting said the authorities' openness to talks reflected the fatigue of the population after three years of conflict that have failed to produce a clear victor. 
""This war has made us see the resilience of the Anglophones from an ideological point of view,"" he said, adding that international pressure to end the conflict had also forced the government's hand. 
Cameroon’s linguistic divide harks back to the end of World War One, when the League of Nations divided the former German colony of Kamerun between the allied French and British victors.

The announcement comes amid a worldwide reckoning with buried legacies of racism and colonial crimes underpinning many western societies that was sparked by the death in the United States of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a police officer.
Berlin's BVG said that the ""Mohrenstrasse"" metro station - literally Moor Street, using the medieval term for people from North Africa, would be renamed after another nearby street, the Glinkastrasse, named after 19th century Russian composer Mikhail Ivanovich Glinka.
The station, a few hundred metres from the Brandenburg Gate at the very centre of Berlin, has born a string of names since it was opened in 1908. It acquired its present name in 1991.
Though the word ""mohr"" is no longer used in modern German, its history - linguists say it had acquired a derogatory flavour by the 18th century - have caused complaints over its use in some street names.
Last month, unidentified activists taped over the station's entrance, temporarily naming it ""George Floyd Street"".

""Out of respect for the sometimes controversial debate about the street name, BVG has decided not to use it to name the metro station any longer,"" it said. ""BVG rejects all forms of racism and discrimination.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's tourism sector reacted with fury and disbelief at Britain's decision to maintain a quarantine regime for travellers coming from Portugal despite having a higher number of coronavirus cases and deaths.
Portugal was left off a list of more than 50 countries that Britain considers safe enough for travel without coronavirus-related restrictions, meaning holidaymakers returning from Portugal would have to quarantine for 14 days.
That will be a major deterrent for British tourists, who accounted for 2.1 million of Portugal's foreign visitors last year, the second biggest market after Spain. 
""Restaurants have adapted, all areas are sanitized, masks are mandatory, hospitals are prepared, doctors were trained. The region has adapted,"" said Antonio Pira, a mayor from the tourism-dependent southern Algarve.
Over a dozen countries have imposed restrictions on travel from Portugal as a doggedly high toll of several hundred new cases per day concentrated on the outskirts of Lisbon in the past month has worried authorities.
""The outbreak is in peripheral Lisbon where there are no hotels, no tourist restaurants,"" noted Raul Martins, head of Portugal's Hotel Association. 
""It has been poorly explained to the British.""
Portugal's number of new cases per 100,000 inhabitants is currently the second highest in Europe after Sweden, according to data from the European Union's (EU) disease control centre.
Portugal attributes this to its high testing rate, though Britain has surpassed Portugal in terms of tests per million people, according to the worldometer.info website.
""We were penalized for speaking the truth at a time when it is important to be transparent,"" said Joao Fernandes, head of the Algarve's tourism authority.
In a tweet, the foreign ministry said ""it is absurd that a country, the UK, with 28 times more deaths than Portugal due to #covid-19, imposes quarantine on passengers from Portugal"". 
Britain has confirmed 44,131 deaths and 284,276 positive tests, while Portugal has reported 1,587 fatalities and 42,782 cases. 
""We hope that this decision, which seems to us profoundly unfair and wrong from the British authorities, is corrected as soon as possible,"" Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva told reporters.

""Countries that are friends treat each other differently.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish President Andrzej Duda suggested on Friday that Germany was trying to meddle in the presidential election after a German-owned tabloid newspaper reported on a pardon that he granted to a man who had served his sentence in a paedophilia case.
Duda, a conservative who faces a neck-and-neck race against a centrist opponent in a presidential runoff election on July 12, was angered by reporting by the Polish tabloid Fakt.
""Does Axel Springer, a company of German descent that owns the Fakt newspaper, want to influence the Polish presidential election?"" Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), said during a campaign rally in the western town of Boleslawiec.
""Do the Germans want to choose the president in Poland?"" he said.
The case, in which the pardon was granted in March, was initially reported by the Rzeczpospolita daily, but Fakt followed up with more details on Thursday.
Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who also serves as prosecutor general, confirmed the pardon was related to a paedophilia case but said it consisted only of lifting a restraining order and the man had served out his entire sentence.
Duda had applied the law of pardon following a request of a victim who was now an adult, added Ziobro, who was shown speaking by Polish state TVP.
According to Fakt the man finished serving his sentence five years ago.
Earlier on Friday, Duda's re-election campaign spokesman, called on the German ambassador to Berlin to talk to the owners of Fakt.
""We do not want this kind of foreign interference in the electoral process,"" spokesman Adam Bielan told public radio PR1.
The German embassy referred questions to the German ministry of foreign affairs, which declined to comment.
Fakt denied meddling in the election, saying in a statement published on its website that it is run by Polish journalists and editors.
PiS has long accused foreign-owned media outlets of meddling in Poland's affairs.

Duda's spokespeople could not be reached for comment.

GABORONE (Reuters) - Botswana's top wildlife vet on Friday dismissed accusations from some conservationists that the government had not moved quickly enough to investigate the unexplained deaths of least 275 elephants.
Authorities said on Thursday they were still trying to find out what killed the elephants around two months after the first carcasses were spotted in the Okavango Panhandle region.
Widely-published pictures of the bodies triggered an international outcry, and some campaign groups raised questions about why tests results had not come through.
""A government investigating team has been on the ground since the first cases were reported,"" Mmadi Reuben, principal veterinary officer in the Department of Wildlife and National Parks, told Reuters. ""Botswana responded swiftly.""
He said local teams had carried out tests and ruled out anthrax as a cause. ""We then sent samples to Zimbabwe and South Africa to test for other known pathogens or a novel pathogen,"" he said.
The coronavirus crisis had delayed some samples leaving the country, he said.
Poaching has been ruled out, as the carcasses were found intact.
Botswana is home to around 130,000 elephants, a third of Africa's total, making it a magnet for wildlife lovers. 
""Elephants began dying in huge numbers in early May and the government would normally respond within days to an event of this scale,"" Mark Hiley, co-founder of National Park Rescue, said on Thursday. 
""Yet here we are, months later, with no testing completed and with no more information than we had at the start.""
Chris Thouless, head of research at Save the Elephants, said mass elephant deaths on this scale were almost unprecedented, save during droughts. But he said it was wrong to assume the government had been dragging its feet. 
""This is pretty remote country, hearing about the carcasses, getting in there, taking a whole range of samples, knowing how and where to get them from, ... that is a pretty difficult task.""
If a virus was to blame, he said the government had a limited range of options. ""You're not going to be able to get the elephants to do social-distancing, and you're not going to be able to inoculate them.""

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would set out how sectors of the economy which remain in a coronavirus lockdown - such as indoor gyms, swimming pools and nail bars - would be allowed to reopen.
""Next week we will set out a timetable for their reopening, though of course I can only lift those remaining national restrictions as and when it is safe to do so,"" he told reporters on Friday.
The government allowed non-essential retailers in England to reopen last month and pubs, restaurants and cinemas are due to open their doors again on Saturday, under social distancing rules.
Johnson said his government would also set out how amateur cricket matches - a traditional feature of the English summertime - can start up again.
""We will be publishing guidelines in the next few days so that cricket can resume in time for next weekend,"" he said.
While professional cricket has already been given the green light to restart, government advisors have been worried that the balls used in the sport could act as a vector for spreading the coronavirus.
England's Chief Medical Officer, Chris Whitty, provided a glimpse of what the new guidelines would look like.""Providing people don't do things that are clearly not sensible, ranging from hugging the bowler if they've just bowled someone for a duck through to spitting on the ball, it should be possible,"" he said.
Johnson repeated his call for people to act responsibly on Saturday when pubs reopen and said he would not hesitate to act if needed to slow the spread of the virus.
He said the fall in the prevalence of the disease to one person in every 2,200 meant it was the right time for the reopening of the hospitality sector.
""It is incredibly important to get the balance right, and our priority is health,"" he said.

In Scotland and Wales, pubs are not due to reopen until mid-July.

1170,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",The world's largest Confederate monument faces renewed calls for removal,"By Rich McKay
ATLANTA (Reuters) - Stone Mountain Confederate Memorial, a nine-story-high bas-relief sculpture carved into a sprawling rock face northeast of Atlanta, is perhaps the South's most audacious monument to its pro-slavery legacy still intact. 
Despite long-standing demands for the removal of what many consider a shrine to racism, the giant depiction of three Confederate heroes on horseback still towers ominously over the Georgia countryside, protected by state law. 
The monument - which reopens on Independence Day weekend after the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to close for weeks - has faced renewed calls for removal since the May 25 killing of George Floyd, a Black man who died during an arrest by a white police officer who pinned his neck to the ground with a knee. 
The brutality of Floyd's death, captured on cellphone video, triggered a national outcry against racial injustice, and revived a long-simmering battle between those demanding the removal of racist symbols from the public sphere, and those who believe monuments honor the tradition and history of the South. 
""Here we are in Atlanta, the birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement and still we have the largest Confederate monument in the world,"" said Gerald Griggs, a vice president of the Atlanta chapter of the NAACP civil rights group, which staged a march last week calling for the carving to be scraped from the mountainside. ""It's time for our state to get on the right side of history.""
The sheer scale of the monument makes its removal a daunting task to contemplate. Longer than a 100-yard American football field, it features the likenesses of Jefferson Davis, the president of the 11-state Confederacy, and two of its legendary military leaders, Robert E. Lee and Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, notched in a relief 400 feet above ground. 
The Sons of Confederate Veterans is an organization that staunchly defends Stone Mountain and other Confederate statues and emblems. Dedicated to teaching the ""Southern Cause,"" according to its website, it believes their removal is akin to purging American history.
The Southern or ""Lost Cause of the Confederacy"" holds that the war was fought over a heroic, but lost, effort to defend states' rights to secede from the Union in the face of Northern aggression, rather than the preservation of slavery.
Martin O'Toole, an official of the Georgia chapter, said the monument is not a totem of racism at all. It's history, plain and simple, he says.
""It's three men on horses,"" O'Toole said. ""What's racist about that?""
Maurice J. Hobson, an associate professor of African American Studies at Georgia State University, counters this, describing the Southern Cause as ""a false history"" that downplays slavery's role in the Civil War. 
He said the Confederate leaders were traitors to the United States who fought to hold onto a Southern economy that depended on slavery.
All three men featured on the monument, Davis, Lee and Jackson, were slave owners.
""The whole of Stone Mountain was erected to show what some white Georgians revered,"" he said. 
Stone Mountain has long held symbolism for white supremacists. The Ku Klux Klan, a hate group that was formed by Confederate Army veterans and has a history of lynchings and terror against Black people, held its rebirth ceremony atop mountain in 1915 with flaming crosses. Klansmen still hold occasional gatherings in the shadows of the edifice, albeit now met with protesters behind police tape. Many of those cross-burnings took place on or around July 4.
The monolithic monument was proposed more than a century ago and had numerous false starts over the years.
But with the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, segregationist officials in the state pushed for the creation the Stone Mountain Memorial Association in 1958 and purchased the park. The carving was completed in 1972.
""This debate has been going on for years, and we're sensitive to it,"" John Bankhead, a spokesman for the group, said. ""We want to tell history as it is, not as some say it is.""
In the past, others have suggested putting more balance into the monument. There was a proposal to build a memorial to Martin Luther King Jr, the Atlanta-based civil rights icon, but the Sons of Confederate Veterans, as well the King family, rejected the idea.
Even though that idea floundered, Hobson advocates adding more carvings to the rock face, including African American historical figures and civil rights leaders.
""It needs to be put in a context that forces a conversation, a serious conversation,"" he said. ""The easiest way to rectify it, is surround it."" 
Griggs of the NAACP said that the civil rights group has consulted with stone masons who said it would cost about $300,000 to $400,000 to remove the towering images.
""Take it down,"" he said. ""Restore the mountain to its original condition.""

HAVANA (Reuters) - The Cuban capital stirred to life on Friday after more than three months of lockdown but there were no signs of tourists on Havana's quiet streets while residents fretted over shortages of food and other basic goods.
The city of 2.2 million people on the Caribbean coast is the last of Cuba's provinces to enter phase one of a three phase process to a new normal. All but one other province began phase two on Friday.
Havana's residents were able once again to use public transportation and private taxis, go to the beach and other outdoor recreation centers, and enjoy the city's famed Malecon seafront drive. 
Cuba closed its airports in March and, while some hotels are open at resorts on isolated islets, there is no indication when Havana and other cities might allow foreign visitors to return.
""It is like breathing little by little the clean air we have missed,"" said veterinarian Norma Hernandez, who rents a room to tourists to make ends meet. ""From the economic point of view the pandemic has been terrible for me, but I hope everything will return to normal.""
For months, the once bustling capital seemed haunted with little traffic and no night life. Gloomy residents trudged in search of supplies, often waiting for hours to purchase them.
Now they can dine out and have drinks, although social distancing and wearing masks remain mandatory. Optional medical and other services resumed.
Food service worker Yajaira Pulido said she was thrilled to be jogging along the Malecon.
""I am very happy because now you can go to the beach, and take the kids out, with caution,"" she said. 
Only a handful of COVID-19 cases have been reported this month, all but a few contacts of previously confirmed cases in Havana. Most of the island, home to 11.2 million inhabitants, has been free of the disease for more than a month.
Each phase of the reopening allows capacity at venues to increase from an initial 50%. Interprovincial transport begins during phase two, while schools open in September.
""There is no contradiction between public health and opening the economy. You can't accomplish the second without the first,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel said recently.
ECONOMIC CRISIS
Moraima Cabrera Delgado, owner of the Bom Apetíte Restaurant, which caters to tourists and locals, said she was preparing to open. Safety measures included a quick test for staff and an electronic menu.
""Now we will have problems with supplies. Almost all of us with businesses agree. We will adapt what we have to offer with what there is and hope things improve,"" she said.
That may take time. Communist authorities have warned the Caribbean faces a near 10% drop in economic activity and years of crisis. More so Cuba, they say, due to U.S. sanctions. 
Cuba was failing to pay restructured debts and suppliers before the pandemic slashed tourism and other foreign exchange earners, due to harsher U.S. sanctions and the economic woes of socialist ally Venezuela.
Cuba's inefficient Soviet-style economy imports two-thirds of its food, half its fuel, and raw materials for just about everything else. Shortages ranging from food and fuel to personal hygiene products, medicine and agriculture inputs appeared a year ago and have become chronic.

""It is going to get worse. It is already really difficult with food,"" said one senior manager of Havana's state-run restaurants, requesting anonymity.

The Natanz uranium-enrichment site, much of which is underground, is one of several Iranian facilities monitored by inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
Iran's top security body said on Friday that the cause of the ""incident"" at the nuclear site had been determined, but ""due to security considerations"" it would be announced at a convenient time.
Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation initially reported an ""incident"" had occurred early on Thursday at Natanz, located in the desert in the central province of Isfahan. 
It later published a photo of a one-storey brick building with its roof and walls partly burned. A door hanging off its hinges suggested that there had been an explosion inside the building.
""Responding to cyber attacks is part of the country's defence might. If it is proven that our country has been targeted by a cyber attack, we will respond,"" civil defence chief Gholamreza Jalali told state TV late on Thursday.
An article issued on Thursday by state news agency IRNA addressed what it called the possibility of sabotage by enemies such as Israel and the United States, although it stopped short of accusing either directly.
""So far Iran has tried to prevent intensifying crises and the formation of unpredictable conditions and situations,"" IRNA said. ""But the crossing of red lines of the Islamic Republic of Iran by hostile countries, especially the Zionist regime and the U.S., means that strategy...should be revised.""
SUSPICIONS
Three Iranian officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said they believed the fire was the result of a cyber attack, but did not cite any evidence.
One of the officials said the attack had targeted a centrifuge assembly building, referring to the delicate cylindrical machines that enrich uranium, and said Iran's enemies had carried out similar acts in the past.
Two of the officials said Israel could have been behind the Natanz incident, but offered no evidence.
Asked on Thursday evening about recent incidents reported at strategic Iranian sites, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters: ""Clearly we can't get into that."" 
The Israeli military and Netanyahu's office, which oversees Israel's foreign intelligence service Mossad, did not immediately respond to Reuters queries on Friday.
In 2010, the Stuxnet computer virus, which is widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel, was discovered after it was used to attack the Natanz facility. 
The IAEA said on Friday the location of the fire did not contain nuclear materials, and that none of its inspectors was present at the time. 
""The Agency has been in contact with relevant Iranian authorities to confirm there will be no impact on its safeguards verification activities, which are expected to continue as before,"" an IAEA statement said, adding that Iran had told it the cause of the fire was not yet known.
Natanz is the centrepiece of Iran's enrichment programme, which Tehran says is only for peaceful purposes. Western intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe it had a coordinated, clandestine nuclear arms programme that it halted in 2003.
Tehran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons, saying its atomic programme is only for peaceful purposes.

Iran curbed its nuclear work in exchange for the removal of most global sanctions under an accord reached with six world powers in 2015, but has reduced compliance with the deal's restrictions since the United States withdrew in 2018.

Trudeau announced on July 25 that WE Charity Canada would administer the program, which will provide up to C$5,000 to post-secondary students who do volunteer work. The program was introduced because the coronavirus pandemic has made it difficult or impossible for many students to get summer jobs.
""The WE charity decided to withdraw from working with the government on this. We support this decision. It's clear that the way all this evolved is disappointing,"" Trudeau told reporters.
After last week's announcement, critics noted Trudeau had regularly participated in WE Charity events, as had his wife Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, who currently hosts a podcast on the charity's Web site.
The main opposition Conservative Party had called for an official investigation into the matter. 
The government responded by saying the charity would not profit from its involvement. Trudeau said on Monday that WE Charity was the only group in Canada with the ""capacity to deliver the ambitious program"".
On Friday, Diversity, Inclusion and Youth Minister Bardish Chagger said there had been more than 35,000 applications within the first week. 
""It's clear there are lessons to be learned about how we can deliver the best programs for young people without attracting controversies like this,"" Trudeau said.

Trudeau has twice been sanctioned by the country's ethics commissioner for breaking conflict of interest rules. The first time was in 2017 for accepting a vacation on Aga Khan's private island a year earlier, and the second was last year for seeking to influence a corporate legal case.

Zeki Demir, a local technician who worked for the consulate, was giving evidence on the first day of the trial in absentia of 20 Saudi officials over Khashoggi's killing, which sparked global outrage and tarnished the image of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler.
Demir said he had been called to the consul's residence after Khashoggi entered the nearby consulate to seek his papers.
""There were five to six people there... They asked me to light up the tandoor (oven). There was an air of panic,"" he said. 
Khashoggi disappeared after going to the consulate to get papers for his marriage in October 2018. Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered the hit - an accusation Saudi officials denied.
Turkish officials have said one theory police pursued was that Khashoggi's killers may have tried to dispose of his body by burning it after suffocating him and cutting up his corpse.
The indictment accuses two top Saudi officials, former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence Ahmed al-Asiri and former royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani, of instigating ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"". 
It says 18 other defendants were flown to Turkey to kill Khashoggi, a prominent and well-connected journalist who had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince.
The defendants are being tried in absentia and are unlikely ever to be handed over by Saudi Arabia, which has accused Turkey of failing to cooperate with a separate, largely secretive, trial in Riyadh last year.
In December a Saudi court sentenced five people to death and three to jail for the killing, but Khashoggi's family later said they forgave his murderers, effectively granting them a formal reprieve under Saudi law.
A Saudi prosecutor said at the time there was no evidence connecting Qahtani to the killing and dismissed charges against Asiri.
BASIS FOR FURTHER TRIALS?
According to his testimony in the indictment, Demir reported seeing many skewers of meat and a small barbecue in addition to the oven in the consul's garden. Marble slabs around the oven appeared to have changed colour as if they had been cleaned with a chemical, the indictment reported him as saying. 
Separate witness testimony in the indictment, from the consul's driver, said the consul had ordered raw kebabs to be bought from a local restaurant.
Demir offered to help with the garage door when a car with darkened windows arrived, but he was told to leave the garden quickly, the indictment said.
Rights campaigners hope that the Istanbul trial will throw a fresh spotlight on the case and reinforce the argument for sanctions against Riyadh or for legal action against the suspects when they travel abroad.
""If the process works, what this trial ...will strengthen is the possibility of universal jurisdiction,"" Agnes Callamard, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial executions, told Reuters on the eve of the trial.
That could give European countries, for example, the basis to launch a trial if any Saudis linked to the case travelled into their territories, she said.
""Justice in these complex environments is not delivered overnight...but a good process here can build up (evidence for) what can happen in five years, in 10 years, whenever the circumstances are stronger,"" Callamard said.

Khashoggi's fiancee Hatice Cengiz, who had waited unknowing outside the consulate while he was killed, said she would continue to seek justice ""not only in Turkey but everywhere possible"".

GENEVA/LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) should soon get results from clinical trials it is conducting of drugs that might be effective in treating COVID-19 patients, its Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday.
""Nearly 5,500 patients in 39 countries have so far been recruited into the Solidarity trial,"" he told a news briefing, referring to clinical studies the U.N. agency is conducting. 
""We expect interim results within the next two weeks.""
The Solidarity Trial started out in five parts looking at possible treatment approaches to COVID-19: standard care; remdesivir; the anti-malaria drug touted by U.S. President Donald Trump, hydroxychloroquine; the HIV drugs lopinavir/ritonavir; and lopanivir/ritonavir combined with interferon.
Earlier this month, it stopped the arm testing hydroxychloroquine, after studies indicated it showed no benefit in those who have the disease, but more work is still needed to see whether it may be effective as a preventative medicine.
Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies programme, said it would be unwise to predict when a vaccine could be ready against COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus that has killed more than half a million people.
While a vaccine candidate might show its effectiveness by year's end, the question was how soon it could be mass produced, he told the U.N. journalists' association ACANU in Geneva.
There is no proven vaccine against the disease now, while 18 potential candidates are being tested on humans.
WHO officials defended their response to the virus that emerged in China last year, saying they had been driven by the science as it developed. Ryan said what he regretted was that global supply chains had broken, depriving medical staff of protective equipment.
""I regret that there wasn't fair, accessible access to COVID tools. I regret that some countries had more than others, and I regret that front-line workers died because of (that),"" he said.
He urged countries to get on with identifying new clusters of cases, tracking down infected people and isolating them to help break the transmission chain.

""People who sit around coffee tables and speculate and talk (about transmission) don't achieve anything. People who go after the virus achieve things,"" he said.

Reuters could not establish the motive for the apparent suicide.
The 61-year-old man shot himself in the head in front of a Dunkin' Donuts store in the capital's busy Hamra district, witnesses said.
Near his body was a Lebanese flag, a copy of his clean judicial record and a note in Arabic that read: ""I'm not a heretic"". It was a quote from a popular song that continues with the words ""but hunger is heresy"".
A relative of the man, who asked not to be named, accused the country's rulers for the hardship that led to his death. ""God damn them. People are suffocating.""
As he spoke, rescue workers carried the body away in a white coffin and a man mopped up a pool of blood.
Soaring prices and job losses have fuelled despair, and some aid groups have warned of the risk of mass hunger.
The country's economic woes came to a head last year after capital inflows dried up and protests erupted against sectarian leaders in power since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
""The people are hungry, broke, miserable,"" said Lina Boubes in Hamra, where people chanted against the government and banks that have frozen people out of their savings.
""They took our dreams, our money, our bread,"" she said. ""And they sit in their castles and they still oppress us.""

The cabinet, which took office in January, has said it is doing all it can to tackle the crisis.

SYDNEY/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Many Hong Kong residents are scouring for new jobs and homes overseas, fearful that a new national security law imposed by Beijing will crush coveted rights not enjoyed on the mainland and herald a new authoritarian era for China's freeest city.
Beijing bypassed the city's legislature to approve the law directly this week, heightening anxiety over its impact on the former British colony of 7.4 million people that is a global financial hub and gateway for capital flows in-and-out of China. 
Immigration lawyers and consultants, property agents and recruitment groups from Australia to Canada all told Reuters they were inundated with enquiries from Hong Kong residents.
""Hong Kong demand for international real estate and residency programmes has rocketed over the past few weeks,"" said Georg Chmiel, executive chairman of international property portal Juwai IQI, in a statement to Reuters.
""We see it in Malaysia, Australia, the UK, Thailand, Canada, Vietnam and the Philippines.""
Juwai does not disclose numbers of enquiries, but did say Australia was the top foreign real estate investment location for Hong Kong buyers in the first half of 2020.
While leaving Hong Kong has traditionally been an alternative for the wealthy and foreign passport-holders, more middle- and working-class people are now also seeking options, especially where visas come cheaper. 
Lily Chong, a real estate agent in Western Australia who markets developments to investors in Asia, said enquiries from Hong Kong shot up more than 40% since mid-June and more than 140 potential buyers took part in an online forum last weekend.
""After just a few days we have already closed one sale sight-unseen,"" added Chong, managing director of IQI Western Australia.
After weathering often violent, mass anti-Beijing protests since last year, China says the new law is aimed at a small minority of troublemakers and will not erode the legal rights making Hong Kong such a popular financial centre. 
ECHOES OF 1997 EXODUS
But critics believe it is aimed at quashing dissent and will inevitably erode freedoms under the ""one country, two systems"" formula agreed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997, an event that also sparked an exodus.
The law punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, and already within hours of its implementation, 10 people were arrested on Wednesday during disturbances.
After a first rush of enquiries about overseas possibilities when China proposed the law on May 21, the volume has surged again over the past 10 days as its implementation happened. 
As well as Australia and former colonial ruler Britain, residents are seeking a new life in cheaper countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines. Hong Kong's financial rival Singapore is generating high interest too. 
Andrew McNeilis, managing director for Asia at recruitment firm Phaidon International, said his firm had seen strong demand from Hong Kongers for Singapore, while it was becoming harder to convince people to go the Chinese city.
""The new security law may result in an exodus of local talent,"" agreed Victor Filamor, partner at executive search firm Stones International in Hong Kong, though he stressed it was too early to know the law's effects.
Fuelling the scramble, Britain, Australia, the United States and Taiwan have all proposed measures to help accommodate Hong Kongers looking to resettle.
The day the law came into force, Taiwan opened an office to help Hong Kongers who may wish to go there. 
Those looking to relocate to Canada are finding that Ottawa's strict coronavirus controls are making it particularly hard to get in, immigration lawyers told Reuters.
Refugee claims from Hong Kong in the first three months of 2020 did, however, nearly triple to 25 compared to all of 2019, Canadian government data shows.
Stung by the offers of help for Hong Kong's people, China has warned foreign governments against meddling.

The decision by the administrative tribunal of Cundinamarca province, released late on Thursday, came after opposition lawmakers alleged the Senate should have authorized the presence of the Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB), which arrived in June for a four-month stay.
Opposition lawmakers involved in the suit argue the constitution requires any movement of foreign troops within Colombia be approved by the Senate. They had hailed the ruling late on Thursday.
Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said the SFAB's presence does not require authorization by lawmakers, and that the 53 members of the unit are assisting and advising four Colombian units. 
""There aren't troop movements here, it is important to point out it's about issues related to military international cooperation,"" Trujillo said in a virtual press conference.
""The government will contest this ruling and continue carrying out, for reasons of national security, all of the work of bi-national cooperation with the United States, which includes the betterment of our capacities through training and technical advice,"" Trujillo added.
While the nation's highest administrative tribunal, the Council of State, hears the challenge, the government will analyze with the United States Embassy how to comply with the lower tribunal's ruling, Trujillo said. 
He would not clarify whether the SFAB would leave the country in the meantime. The embassy directed all questions to the Colombian government.
Despite decades of anti-narcotics efforts, Colombia is one of the world's top cocaine producers and faces constant U.S. pressure to reduce cultivation.
Its potential production of cocaine was up by 1.5% last year to 1,137 metric tonnes, the United Nations said last month, even as areas planted with primary ingredient coca decreased.

Washington last year withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), accusing Moscow of deploying cruise missiles throughout Russia in violation of the pact. Russia has denied violating the agreement. 
In his book entitled ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir"", Bolton wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin had acknowledged the American position on the need to withdraw from the agreement. 
The pact had prevented Washington from deploying new weapons to counter a Chinese arms buildup in the Pacific.
""Putin seemed to have lost interest in the INF, saying to me (through an interpreter) that he understood our arguments and logic on the decision to withdraw from the INF, which I took to be an acknowledgement of our shared view on China,"" Bolton wrote. 
Speaking to Russian media on Friday, Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin said Bolton's recollection ""substantially distorts real events"".
""He said Russia allegedly supported the American reasoning about the loss of relevance of the INF treaty, including in light of the significant development of China's nuclear missile programme,"" TASS news agency quoted Fomin as saying. 
""We in fact consider that the United States' withdrawal from the agreement had been planned in advance, and that accusations that Russia was violating it are baseless.""

The demise of the INF treaty has strained the global arms control architecture erected during the Cold War to prevent an arms race between Washington and Moscow.

TRIPOLI, Lebanon (Reuters) - For Amer al Dahn, the idea of eating meat is now a dream. Today, he can't even afford bread and depends on credit from the local grocer to feed his wife and four children in the Lebanese city of Tripoli.
""We can no longer buy meat or chicken. The closest we get to them is in magazines and newspapers,"" said Dahn, 55, leafing through a supermarket brochure in his cramped apartment.
Living in one of the poorest streets of Lebanon's poorest city, Dahn and his family are feeling the full force of a financial meltdown that is fuelling extreme poverty and shattering lives across the country.
In the capital Beirut, a 61-year-old man shot himself in the head on the busy Hamra street on Friday. Reuters could not establish his motives, but local media attributed the suicide to hunger.
Struggling to walk because of diabetes, Dahn already faced a difficult life before the crisis which has sunk the Lebanese pound by 80% since October, driving up prices in the import-dependent economy.
""Life has become very difficult. The dollar is still climbing and the state is incapable of providing a solution.""
Even chickpeas, beans and lentils - a traditional part of the Lebanese diet - are out of reach for some.
The crisis is seen as the biggest threat to stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people who have fallen off the cliff,"" said Bojar Hoxja, country director at CARE International, an aid agency. Lebanon faces a humanitarian crisis that requires urgent international intervention, he said.
BREAD PRICE HIKE
Lebanon is already a big recipient of international aid, the bulk of it directed at the 1 million Syrians who fled from the war next door.
Tripoli, a predominantly Sunni Muslim city on the Mediterranean, is home to some of Lebanon's wealthiest politicians, who critics say only remember their constituents at election time.
""If it was not for the neighbours here sending food to each other, people would be dying of hunger,"" said Omar al-Hakim, who lives with his six children and wife in a one-room apartment.
The salary of 600,000 pounds a month he makes as a security guard now lasts just six days. Before the pound's collapse, it was the equivalent of $400 a month. Today, it is around $60.
Basics such as sugar, rice and lentils become harder to buy, he says. This week, Hakim was hit by a one third increase in the price of state-subsidised bread. 
""We used to eat meat on Sunday, or fish, or chicken ... none of that now. We can't afford an ounce of meat,"" Hakim said.
The World Bank warned last November that the proportion of Lebanese living in poverty could rise to 50% if conditions worsened. Since then the crisis has only deepened and the economy has been further hit by a COVID-19 lockdown. 
Many people depend on charity. Some are using social media to barter furniture or clothes for baby formula or diapers.
Shopkeeper Kawkab Abdelrahim, 30, is struggling to keep her store open as she extends more and more credit.
""Do you have the heart to turn them away if they want a bag of bread? Sometimes they ask for a tub of yoghurt or 1,000 pounds of labneh,"" she said, referring to a type of strained yoghurt that is a Lebanese staple.

""That is one spoonful that a mother spreads on bread to feed three children.""

LONDON (Reuters) - A previously HIV-positive man who is only the second known adult worldwide to be ""functionally cured"" of HIV called on Friday for people living with the AIDS-causing virus, as well as those battling COVID-19, not to give up hope of a cure.
Adam Castillejo, known as ""the London patient"", has been off AIDS treatment and free of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 34 months after getting a bone marrow transplant from an HIV-resistant donor to treat his cancer. The transplant also cleared his HIV, leading his doctors to describe https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-aids-cure/london-hiv-patient-becomes-worlds-second-aids-cure-hope-idUKKCN1QL2C0 him in March 2019 as ""functionally cured"".
""Don't give up on hope,"" Castillejo told a briefing at an online international AIDS conference when asked for his message to other HIV positive people and to those fighting the new coronavirus. ""Have faith. Have hope. Things can change.""
Castillejo was called “the London patient”, in part because his case is similar to the first known case of a functional cure of HIV - in an American man, Timothy Brown. 
Brown was known as ""the Berlin patient"" when he underwent similar treatment in Germany in 2007 which also cleared his HIV. He has since moved to the United States and, according to HIV doctors, is still HIV-free.
Castillejo's doctor - a professor and HIV biologist at Britain's Cambridge University, Ravindra Gupta - told Friday's briefing that while this case was ""remarkable"" and ""very exciting"", it should not be seen as a nurture AIDS cure.
The bone marrow donors in Castillejo's and Brown's cases had a genetic mutation known as ‘CCR5 delta 32’, which confers resistance to HIV. 
Such transplants are also highly complex, risky and expensive, and were only carried out in these cases as a last resort when the men were terminally sick with blood cancer and HIV.
More than 37 million people worldwide are currently infected with HIV, and the AIDS pandemic has killed about 35 million people since it began in the 1980s. 

Scientific research into the virus over three decades has led to the development of drug combinations that can keep it at bay for many years in most patients.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Friday Russian society had shown unity by voting to back reforms allowing him to stay in power until 2036 and that Russians had felt the need for the changes in their hearts. 
Putin, 67, also decreed the constitutional amendments would enter force on July 4 after they were backed by almost 78% of Russians, according to official results, in a week-long vote that ended on Wednesday.
The Kremlin has hailed the landslide victory as a triumph for Putin, but critics said the vote was illegal and illegitimate. An independent monitoring group said the vote was deeply flawed. 
""People felt with their hearts that what was on offer (the amendments) ... was in demand and what the country needed,"" Putin said in his first public comments on the vote. 
""In general, the results of the vote showed a high level of unity in society on key questions that are of national significance,"" Putin said. 
Other changes in the reform package grant former presidents immunity from prosecution, enshrine a reference in the constitution to God and define marriage as a union of a man and a woman.
Putin also used a meeting with officials broadcast on state television to try to poke fun at the U.S. embassy in Moscow for flying the rainbow flag as part of LGBT pride celebrations. 
""They have shown something about who is working there. But never mind ... Our position is understood,"" said Putin, who has sought to distance Russia from liberal Western values and aligned himself with the Russian Orthodox Church. 

Putin said during the campaign to change the constitution that he would not let the traditional notion of a mother and father be subverted by what he called ""parent number 1"" and ""parent number 2"".

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia's centre-right ruling coalition sought on Friday to strengthen its tiny majority as it steers a recovery from economic woes caused by coronavirus, signing a cooperation agreement with an opposition party and two independent parliamentary members.
The coalition led by Prime Minister Janez Jansa is composed of four parties and holds only 46 out of 90 seats in parliament after two members of a junior coalition party joined two centre-left opposition parties in May, citing dissatisfaction with the government.
The cooperation agreement was signed with the opposition Slovenian Nationalist Party, which holds three seats and has supported the government in most parliamentary decisions over the past months.
""Ahead of us there is an important period of economic recovery and we want to assure the best possible conditions for overcoming the expected recession,"" the agreement said, adding the government will present a detailed programme of its plans within 30 days.
Slovenia expects its economy to shrink by 7.6% this year, hit by the fall of foreign demand for its exports due to the coronavirus epidemic. The country, which in May became the first European state to declare an end to its epidemic, has reported 1,649 coronavirus cases and 111 deaths.
""The government has a good chance to stay in power till the next regular election in 2022, partly due to the fact that none of the coalition parties wants early election,"" Meta Roglic, a political analyst of daily Dnevnik, told Reuters following the agreement.
Civil society groups are organising street protests against the government every Friday, saying it is harming civil rights by putting pressure on the media and the judiciary and limiting the rights of environmental organisations.

He declined to give any further details on casualties but a Malian military source told Reuters that seven soldiers were killed.
Suspected Islamist militants raided the villages of Gouari, Djindo and Fangadougou on Wednesday, killing 32 people. 
The mayor of a town close to Gouari told Reuters the jihadists returned on Thursday afternoon and attacked troops that had arrived after their raid.

According to Dutch prosecutors, flight MH17 from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was deliberately shot down by a BUK missile fired by pro-Russian forces in Ukraine, who obtained the missile launcher from a Russian army base just across the border.
After nearly six years of research by international investigators, four defendants went on trial in March over the downing of flight MH17, which killed all 298 aboard.
The four - Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko - remain at large. Pulatov has instructed lawyers to defend him, while the other three are being tried in absentia without representation.
Moscow has always denied blame for the crash and proposed a range of alternative explanations which the Dutch-led team of international investigators rejected.
On Friday the court accepted a request from Pulatov's lawyers that investigating judges obtain testimony from more witnesses, to examine other possible scenarios. Those include a theory that the civilian aircraft was shot by mistake or that it was being used as a shield for a military aircraft.
The trial was adjourned until August 31 to give the investigative judges the time to hear the additional witnesses, and to give the defence time to meet with Pulatov.
So far, his lawyers say they have been unable to meet with him in person and share details of the investigation, because COVID-19 restrictions make it impossible to travel to Russia, where he resides.

1188,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",A polling station that was observed records low turnout in Russian vote,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Some voters who took part in a referendum that paves the way for President Vladimir Putin to extend his rule over Russia said they had been asked by their employers to do so, and to provide evidence to bosses to show they did.
Their accounts, to Reuters reporters who monitored polling station #2668 near Moscow throughout the seven days of voting, tally with Kremlin instructions to employers, seen by Reuters, asking them last month to ensure workers took part.
Despite that campaign, only 43% percent of eligible voters took part in the referendum at the polling station, below the national average of 68% and roughly half the percentage in the area where the station was located.
In fact turnout, an important measure for the Kremlin of support for Putin and the constitutional changes, was the lowest of all the 46 voting sites in the leafy town of Reutov, separated by an eight-lane highway from Moscow's urban sprawl.
The average turnout in Reutov was 83%. At two polling stations in the same school building which Reuters did not observe, turnout was 85% and 87%.
Local election commission chief Olga Ukropova said the discrepancy may be because many of the residents in the four apartment blocks the polling station serves were not registered to vote there because they were migrants.
Historical data did not show distinct electoral results from the polling station in previous recent elections.
The Central Election Commission was not immediately available to comment. Kremlin officials did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
SHOW OF FORCE?
A woman who works in a nursery in the area said that she had voted in favour of the reforms.
""After this I will call my boss and tell her I voted, of course. That's required,"" she told Reuters, declining to give her name.
Another voter, who said she works for the tax service, said she had been advised by her employer to vote as early as possible. ""They don't tell you whether to vote 'for' or 'against'. But they do ask you to report that you voted.""
The tax service did not respond to a request for comment.
Encouraging voting is not illegal, but the practice, which the Kremlin instructions called Project 'Mobilisation in companies 2020', suggests authorities wanted a strong turnout.
The Central Election Commission said 68% of the electorate took part nationwide and 78% voted for the reforms, which means an absolute majority - 58 million of Russia's 109 million voters - supported the constitutional changes.
A woman at polling station #2668 said she needed to be photographed voting as proof for her boss and a man asked election officials for documented proof.
They declined to give their names and the polling station's chairman, Rena Turayeva, declined to comment.
The Kremlin says the package of constitutional changes will strengthen the role of parliament and improve social policy and public administration.
Opposition activists have called the vote illegitimate and said it was designed to allow Putin to rule for life.
Golos, a non-governmental organisation that monitors elections, said it had recorded numerous irregularities during the vote, including ballot stuffing and widespread cases of employers forcing staff to cast a ballot.
Ella Pamfilova, head of the Central Election Commission, said on Friday the vote was ""free, open, democratic to the maximum and fair.
""Its results are legitimate and indisputable.""

Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the emphatic nature of the result was a measure of how deeply Russians trusted Putin to run the country.

Today, she is one of thousands of migrant health workers recruited to the frontlines of its fight against the new coronavirus.
Portal, 52, and her team visit COVID-19 sufferers at home and in state isolation units in some of Santiago's most crowded, poor and infected areas to conduct tests and assess symptoms, keeping the burden off near-saturated hospitals. 
""The last 20 years in Venezuela taught my generation how to handle crises,"" Portal told Reuters. 
Portal migrated to Chile in 2017 with experience in emergency and respiratory care. Her transformation from outsider to the frontlines of Chile's battle against coronavirus holds up a mirror to the country's uneasy response to wave of migration, largely from crisis-hit Venezuela, that has grown fivefold in 30 years.
Center-right President Sebastian Pinera made migration a key issue of his 2017 election campaign, pledging to tighten laws and crack down on foreigner-driven crime. Today, his government is appealing for migrant professionals' help. 
Chile is nearing the peak of its coronavirus outbreak, with a caseload among the worst per capita in the world and deaths predicted to follow in the coming months. There are a total 284,541 cases and 5,920 fatalities.
Medical workers are exhausted and falling victim to the virus, and specialists are in short supply. So Chile has turned to retired doctors, student nurses and imported talent.
Unpublished figures obtained by Reuters show almost 3,000 public health service workers are off sick with coronavirus, but 13,849 more have been signed up, including more than 600 doctors, more than half of them foreign nationals.
Many countries have a large migrant health workforce, but in Chile many struggle to gain work certification because of rigorous and expensive local checks. Health workers from Venezuela, Colombia and Cuba often end up as Uber drivers, petrol pump attendants or waiters.
GRATEFUL 
Many migrant health workers are specialists in areas which Chile's public sector has historically lacked and now desperately needs to keep patients alive, the director of the country's civil service said in an interview.
    Alejandro Weber said foreign doctors brought ""knowledge, experience but also the desire to lend their skills to the state,"" pointing to a new ""social pact"" for the multicultural nation.
    An emergency law last deployed by Chile's government after the 2010 earthquake allows it to recruit thousands more health workers. 
    Many have been drafted from the private sector but a large number are foreign medics for whom the usual stringent checks have been suspended.
Juan Carlos Riera, president of the Chilean Association of Foreign Medics, said the move came as a huge relief for medics to be able to use skills honed over years. 
""Many doctors have told me they would prefer to expose themselves to the virus than to continue having no income or a minimal one that's impossible to live on,"" he said. 
Dr. Jesus Valera Macho, 36, a Venezuelan trauma surgeon who was working as a cleaner before joining Portal's team in March, said taking on the coronavirus was the least he could do. 
""We're not Chilean but this country gave us the chance to restart our lives,"" he said. ""It's we who are grateful.""
I SERVE MY COUNTRY 
The campaign led by the civil service, I Serve My Country in an Emergency, drew 13,000 applicants, with 99% indicating immediate availability and 70% willing to be transferred anywhere in the country. They included 1,000 foreign medics, many of them experienced specialists.    
Medical workers say the help cannot come soon enough. Carlos Romero, head of intensive care at the University of Chile's clinical hospital, said he sometimes debated if he had time to sleep or eat.
""There are six of us overseeing 100 critical care beds, that will soon rise to 140,"" he said. 
Unions have cautioned against relying on unchecked resources. Dr. Patricio Meza, of Chile's College of Doctors, said not fully certified should not work unsupervised.
""The most important thing is to safeguard patients' safety,"" he said.
A nurse at a central Santiago hospital, who withheld her name because she was not authorized to speak to the media, said the gains outweighed the risks.
""It's better to have more people, someone who can alert you to a problem with a patient, than that they are left alone and something happens before you realize it,"" she said.
Portal said her generation was accustomed to facing crises head on. Her father locked her indoors during a violent uprising when she was 22, but she escaped through the window to help treat the injured in her local hospital. 
""I feel trepidation but no fear anymore,"" she said. ""As a doctor you can't do anything but act. This is a moment. It will be tough but it is temporary. It will end.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Three of Europe's biggest airlines are to end a legal challenge against the British government after it scrapped its quarantine rule for travellers coming from some of the most popular tourist destinations.
The government said the policy would be ended for English holidaymakers to countries such as France, Spain and Italy, although it would be maintained for the United States. 
Initially, the legal action by British Airways (L:ICAG), easyJet (L:EZJ) and Ryanair (I:RYA) proceeded, as the full list of countries impacted by the change had not been published. 
However, lawyer for the airlines Tom Hickman later said he had no reason to doubt that the list would be published later on Friday, and had agreed to withdraw the legal challenge on that assumption.
""On the premise it materialises, we have agreed everything else which needs to be agreed,"" he said.
The government introduced a blanket rule that all travellers arriving from abroad must self-isolate for 14 days on June 8, arguing it was a crucial step to avoid a second wave of COVID-19.
The airlines, which grounded planes due to the pandemic, criticised the quarantine policy, saying it dealt a catastrophic blow to the industry's hopes of recovery in the summer, and that they had not been consulted on the move. They also queried the scientific basis of the measures, and had sought a judicial review of the rules.

Government lawyers said that the measures had been justified and proportionate.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Hong Kong's new security law has prompted a sharp uptick in inquiries from families looking to relocate to Canada, but Ottawa's strict COVID-19 border control measures are making it nearly impossible to get in, immigration lawyers said.
Even before the law took effect this week, refugee claims from Hong Kong in the first three months of 2020 nearly tripled to 25 compared with nine in all of 2019 and just two in all of 2018, Canadian government data shows.
Admissions of new permanent residents from Hong Kong jumped 75.7% in January and February 2020 compared to the previous year, as Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters escalated.
Claims from all countries have plunged since March amid COVID-19 closures. 
Beijing imposed the legislation on Hong Kong this week despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations, setting China's freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track.
Canada was a preferred destination for Hong Kongers who fled the island city ahead of the British handover to China in 1997, and some 300,000 people in Hong Kong hold Canadian passports. 
Most who came in the 1990s have left and interest in relocating from Hong Kong to Canada has been tepid in recent years.
But in the days since China imposed the security law, Vancouver immigration lawyer Richard Kurland has found himself consulting with people by phone, email and Zoom on how to get from Hong Kong into Canada.
""This week is the game-changing week with the new security law,"" said Kurland. ""Now families are taking things seriously.""
Moving to Canada will not be as easy as it was in the '90s. A program that allowed wealthy foreigners to buy admission to Canada was scrapped in 2014. And the border is currently closed until at least end July due to the coronavirus pandemic, with only citizens, permanent residents and others deemed essential allowed in.
""Until the travel restrictions are lifted from COVID, I can't imagine how someone would manage to even board a flight at this point,"" said Toronto immigration lawyer Chantal Desloges. 
Desloges said that once the border reopens, Hong Kong residents could come to Canada and claim refugee status, but they would need to show that there's a serious chance of them personally being persecuted.
""So if you're a political dissident… somebody who has participated in public protests against China, that could be a very legitimate claim,"" she said.
Desloges said that Hong Kong passport holders granted Canadian permanent resident status in the 1990s could petition to have their status reinstated - and they'd be able to live in Canada while the case was considered.
Meanwhile, Kurland said many families he is speaking with plan to sell assets in Hong Kong to fund sending adult children to Canada on study visas, a multi-year path to citizenship.

""Hong Kong's not closed off yet ... but I liken to Berlin, where you suddenly see soldiers building a wall. It's going to take time, but you know it's coming,"" Kurland said.

Erdogan has proposed restoring the mosque status of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, a building at the heart of both the Christian Byzantine and Muslim Ottoman empires and today one of Turkey's most visited monuments.
""Accusations against our country about Hagia Sophia directly target our sovereign rights,"" said Erdogan, responding to concern over the proposal from the West, particularly Greece, France and the United States.
""We are determined to continue to protect the rights of Muslims, our country's majority faith, as well as members of all other faiths and religions,"" he added at the formal opening of another mosque in Istanbul.
A Turkish court on Thursday heard a case aimed at converting the Hagia Sophia back into a mosque. It will announce its verdict within 15 days.
Earlier this week Turkey said it was ""shocked"" at a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging Erdogan not to go ahead with the plan.

France's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that the sixth-century structure, which served for nine centuries as a Christian cathedral before the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453, must remain open to all.

The survey by the consulting firm Trespuntozero, to which Reuters had exclusive access, shows that in eight of the 10 countries in which the study was conducted, the respondents considered Uruguay one of the best controllers of the pandemic. 
According to the poll, the performance of Uruguayan President Luis Lacalle Pou against the pandemic had 77.8% approval in his own country; that of Paraguayan Mario Abdo, 76.7%; and that of Argentina's Alberto Fernandez, 68%. 
As of Thursday, Uruguay registered 947 cases with 28 deaths, according to the Reuters count, Argentina 69,941 cases with 1,385 deaths and Brazil 1,495,628 with 61,862 deaths.
(https://reut.rs/2UpTAh3)
The survey was carried out among 10,000 people distributed equally in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Mexico, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic.
Asked about which countries in the region had done the worst against the pandemic, respondents put Brazil at the bottom.
""The countries surveyed were clear on which model not to follow: Brazil,"" Shila Vilker, director of the Buenos Aires-based consultancy Trespuntozero, told Reuters.
Brazil has more confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths than anywhere outside the United States. President Jair Bolsonaro has criticized lockdown and social-distancing orders issued by governors and mayors. Echoing U.S. President Donald Trump, he has recommended unproven anti-malarial drugs to treat the virus.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A man carrying a ""Liberate Hong Kong"" sign as he drove a motorcycle into police at a protest against the territory's Chinese rulers became on Friday the first person charged with inciting separatism and terrorism under a new security law.
Beijing imposed the legislation on the former British colony earlier this week despite protests from Hong Kongers and Western nations, setting China's freest city and a major financial hub on a more authoritarian track. 
Critics say the law - which punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison - is aimed at crushing dissent and a long-running campaign for greater democracy.
Police say 23-year-old Tong Ying-kit rammed and injured some officers at an illegal protest on Wednesday. A video online showed a motorbike knocking over several officers on a narrow street before the driver falls over and is arrested.
Tong, who was hospitalised after the incident, was charged less than 24 hours after the city government said the slogan he was carrying - ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" - connotes separatism or subversion under the new law.
The rallying cry appears on placards, T-shirts, and post-it notes stuck to walls around Hong Kong. 
China's parliament adopted the security law after sometimes violent protests last year triggered by fears Beijing was stifling freedoms, guaranteed by a ""one country, two systems"" formula agreed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the law aims at a few ""troublemakers"" and not wider rights that underpin the city's role as a gateway for capital flows in and out of China.
But international anxiety is growing after authorities arrested 10 people under the new law within 24 hours of it taking effect. The European Union (EU) has put Hong Kong high on its agenda while the United Nations' rights office expressed alarm over arrests.
""I'M NOT SCARED""
At another court, dozens gathered in solidarity with a man charged for stabbing a policeman in the arm during Wednesday's disturbances. They held up blank pieces of paper to show fears for free speech.
""I'm not scared. Come what may,"" said a 25-year-old protester who gave his name only as Wilson. 
On Wednesday's 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, police arrested about 370 people, with 10 cases involving violations of the new law.
In a further ominous sign for activists, a Communist Party cadre prominent during a 2011 clampdown on land rights protesters in a south China village is to head a newly-empowered national security office in Hong Kong, official news agency Xinhua said.
Zheng Yanxiong, 57, most recently served as secretary general of the Communist Party committee of Guangdong province, bordering Hong Kong.
Leaked footage during the 2011 dispute showed him berating villagers and calling foreign media ""rotten"".
The new legislation gives the security office greater enforcement action and powers to take suspects onto the mainland, as well as granting privileges for agents, including that Hong Kong authorities cannot inspect their vehicles. 
Some activists have been keeping a low profile or leaving.
Demosisto, a pro-democracy group led by Joshua Wong, disbanded hours after the legislation was passed, while prominent group member Nathan Law left the city.
""The protests in Hong Kong have been a window for the world to recognise that China is getting more and more authoritarian,"" Law told Reuters.

Hong Kong's publicly-funded public broadcaster RTHK, which has felt the pressure of government scrutiny, appeared to take heed of the law, reproducing the slogan as ""L*******#HongKong"" in a comment on Twitter, to the scorn of some social media users.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - At least 19 pilgrims of Pakistan's minority Sikh community were killed when a train collided with a passenger van in eastern Pakistan on Friday, officials said.
According to police, the dead, which include two children, were all residents of the western Pakistani city of Peshawar, home to most of Pakistan's nearly 40,000 Sikhs.
The accident occurred at an unmanned Railway crossing close to the city of Sheikhupura in Pakistan's largest province, Punjab, Pakistan Railways public relations official Quratulain told Reuters.
The 19 killed were all passengers seated in the van, travelling from the town of Nankana Sahib to Farooqabad - both sites revered by followers of Sikhism. 
Sikhs revere Nankana Sahib, located near the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore, which borders India, as the place their religion began and where the founder of Sikhism, Guru Nanak, was born in 1469.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan expressed dismay at the accident in a message on Twitter.
As prime minister, Khan has overseen the construction of a special border crossing, called the ""Kartarpur corridor"", allowing Sikhs from India to visit holy sites in Pakistan, despite continued hostile relations between the two countries. 
Khan also said Pakistan's railway safety would be reviewed. Pakistan's railways have witnessed a number of accidents over the last few years, including frequent collisions between vehicles and trains.
Last year, a fire in a train compartment killed more than 70 passengers. 
""Investigations are underway to figure out negligence behind it,"" a district police officer Ghazi Salahuddin told Reuters.
Pakistan Railways also said an inquiry had been ordered.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 03, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>","Crowd control, police patrols for Spain's cancelled bull-running fiesta","MADRID (Reuters) - Authorities in the Spanish city of Pamplona, which would usually be gearing up for the San Fermin bull-running festival at this time of year, are readying stringent security measures amid fears of crowds gathering despite the fiesta being cancelled.
""Of course there are some concerns. It would be naive not to be worried,"" Mayor Enrique Maya said at an event run by local newspaper Diario de Navarra this week. ""But I have great faith in our citizens.""
Propelled to international fame by Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel ""The Sun Also Rises"", the eight-day festival draws hundreds of thousands of revellers from across the globe to drink, dance and race through the streets pursued by six fighting bulls. 
But in April, with Spain's coronavirus outbreak spiralling out of control, the city called off the festivities for the first time in four decades.
The fiesta traditionally kicks off with the ""Chupinazo"" at noon on July 6, when a rocket is fired from the city hall to the cheers of people crammed into the square clad in white clothes and red neck-scarves. 
This year, police will set up 14 checkpoints around the Old Town's narrow streets, enforcing compliance with strict capacity limits. Electronic panels will alert passers by when the main squares have filled up.
Bars and restaurants, some of which rely on San Fermines for a fifth of their annual revenue, must adhere to distancing guidelines and are banned from setting up extra tables on the streets.
And, in the absence of any livestock, state broadcaster TVE will play reruns of old bull-runs, or ""encierros"" every morning.
The encierros would normally take place every morning at 8 a.m. with six bulls running from a corral on the edge of the Old Town to the arena where they will be fought by top matadors in the afternoon. 
""We have this great opportunity to show the whole world that we are a city that knows how to follow the rules,"" Maya told the Diario de Navarra event. ""Because often the image of San Fermin is not so good.""
The festival gained notoriety in 2016 after a group of five men known as the ""Wolf Pack"" gang-raped a teenager, sparking nationwide protests and eventually prompting an overhaul of Spain's sexual-assault laws.

""We should think about the 2021 San Fermines as the best in history and accept that there is no fiesta in 2020,"" Maya said.

Safiyya Shaikh, 37, had planned to set off a bomb at the popular tourist attraction, to kill herself and visitors to the famous cathedral and another bomb at the hotel where they would have stayed before the attack, prosecutors said.
However, the husband and wife extremists she had contacted online to obtain the bombs and whom she believed shared her view of violent jihad were actually undercover officers.
She pleaded guilty to terrorism offences in February and was jailed on Friday at the Old Bailey court.
""Safiyya Shaikh chose to live her life as a violent extremist with a murderous hatred of those who did not share her twisted version of Islam,"" said Jenny Hopkins from Britain's Crown Prosecution Service.
""The damning evidence presented by the CPS of her planned suicide mission to St. Paul’s Cathedral left her with no room to talk her way out the charges.""
Shaikh, a Muslim convert from west London, had scoped out security at the church and was then secretly filmed handing two bags to the ""wife"" in a park which were to be returned to her at a later date with two working bombs.

She told the couple in a secure message: ""I really would love to destroy that place and the kaffir [unbelievers] there"" and also praised Islamic State and encouraged the killing of civilians across the world, prosecutors said.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, once dubbed the last dictator in Europe by Washington, has seen protests come and go in his 26 years in power, but none quite like the one that is rippling through his usually loyal support base now.
The police have arrested hundreds in an effort to quell anti-government protests before an Aug. 9 presidential election, according to the government and human rights groups. But several police officers are among those who have taken to social media to challenge him, posting selfies with their faces covered by signs such as ""Lukashenko is not my president"".
And even one of the country's prominent athletes, usually loyal to the sports-loving president, has publicly criticised Lukashenko on Instagram for running the country like a ""game without rules"".
""Candidates are put in jail, people are gagged. This is not the future of Belarus. Alexander Grigoryevich - you are not my president,"" wrote basketball player Nikita Meshcheryakov, in a post that was later deleted. 
The 65-year-old former boss of a Soviet collective farm is still widely expected to win a sixth term in office. Western monitoring agencies have not judged an election in the country to be free and fair since 1995. 
But Lukashenko's crackdown could derail his efforts to improve ties with the West at a time when relations with traditional ally Russia are strained.
According to political analyst Artem Shreibman, Lukashenko is running out of options to shore up his rule. 
""I don't see the protest mood declining. The actions of the authorities lead to even greater indignation. The baseline scenario is a large escalation in violence.""
Lukashenko has compared the protesters to criminal gangs, accusing them of fomenting unrest akin to the 2014 Maidan protests that toppled Ukraine's Moscow-backed president, and of being supported from Russia and Poland. The police said the peaceful protests were cover for attempts to destabilise the country. 
'NOT AFRAID'
Anger over Lukashenko's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has added to grievances over the economy and human rights.
Lukashenko laughed off fears about COVID-19 as a ""psychosis"" and suggested remedies such as drinking vodka instead of a lockdown.
That attitude frustrated voters such as Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Bogdanovich, a 19-year-old Harvard student who says the authorities have not done enough to protect doctors, including his father who works in a hospital. 
Civil society stepped in to fill the breach, raising funds to buy personal protective equipment for hospitals or acting as volunteers.
Bogdanovich says people have become less afraid to speak out and he is now comfortable publicly calling Lukashenko a cockroach, a nickname dreamt up by protesters. 
""I'm not afraid to say it on camera. Nothing made my heart skip a beat when I said that,"" he said. ""And a lack of this feeling in the heart is already something that has changed dramatically.""
Willingness to speak out was also in evidence last week, when police began arresting customers outside a gift shop in the capital Minsk that was selling T-shirts with a coded jibe at Lukashenko's low popularity.
The next day, hundreds more queued up in solidarity. 
The crackdown prompted a TV host from state-run media, Dmitry Kokhno, to criticise the police: ""There are no criminals in this queue. What are you doing? I am disgusted and revolted to see what is happening."" 
Another state TV journalist, Artemis Ahpash, turned on his colleagues in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post about their coverage: ""Whenever from TV / Radio screens you utter a blatant lie about current events, what do you feel when you get home?""
Andrei Tkachev, who became a medical volunteer to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, was in the queue outside the giftshop. He said the authorities had yet to realise that Belarus had changed and that people had lost their fear. 

""I'm not afraid that they will detain me,"" he said. ""I'm afraid of living under a dictatorship for another five years in fear and humiliation.""

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron named Jean Castex, a top civil servant and local mayor who orchestrated France's coronavirus lockdown exit strategy, as his new prime minister on Friday as he acted to reinvent his administration and win back voters.
Castex, 55, hails from the centre-right of French politics and served for two years as the second-highest ranking official in the Elysee Palace during Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency.
An Elysee official described Castex as a senior civil servant whose experience in local politics would help Macron connect with provincial France. Castex was a ""social Gaullist"", the official said in reference to the more interventionist, socially minded wing of France's centre-right.
The announcement followed the resignation of Edouard Philippe ahead of a widely anticipated overhaul of the government by Macron. 
Macron is reshaping his government as France grapples with the deepest economic depression since World War Two, a sharp downturn that will shrink the economy by about 11% in 2020 and reverse hard-fought gains on unemployment.
Investors will be watching to see if Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who has overseen reforms to liberalise the economy and spent big to keep companies like Air France (PA:AIRF) and  Renault  (PA:RENA) afloat during the crisis, keeps his job. 
""The return from summer holidays will be difficult, we must get ready,"" Macron told regional newspapers in an interview published late on Thursday.
Macron and Philippe dined together on Wednesday and met on Thursday. The Elysee source described Thursday's discussions as warm and friendly. Both men agreed on ""the need for a new government to embody the next phase, a new path,"" the aide said. 
FRESH START
Macron said last month he wanted to start afresh as France embarks on a delicate and costly recovery from its coronavirus slump. Then came his party's dire showing in nationwide municipal elections on June 28.
The local elections revealed surging support for the Green party and underlined Macron's troubles connecting with ordinary people. His La Republique en Marche party failed to win a single major city, depriving the president of a local power base ahead of 2022.
The most notable win was Philippe's success in his old redoubt of Le Havre and his resignation clears the way for him to become mayor of the northern port, from where he could emerge as a rival to Macron in two years time.
Cardboard boxes were delivered to the prime minister's offices minutes after the government stepped down. 
Macron is taking a gamble by replacing Philippe, who is more popular then the president, political analysts say. 

But keeping Philippe would have suggested that Macron was too weak to let go of his prime minister and that his party lacked the depth for a full cabinet overhaul.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Doctors and nurses have won praise for their efforts to contain Moscow's coronavirus crisis, but a monument unveiled on Friday celebrates different frontline workers: delivery men and women.
Designed by artist Alexei Garikovich, it is around three metres tall and features the form of a standing man hollowed out from a thick sheet of rusting metal. Its inscription reads: ""Dedicated to those who made self-isolation possible."" 
""The monument makes me proud of course,"" said 27-year-old courier Sergei Gorekov, who works for the Azbuka Vkusa supermarket chain.
""I have never in my life seen or heard of the opening of a monument to couriers. It's quite cool."" 
A strict self-isolation regime in the Russian capital saw Muscovites confined to their homes, with many using supermarket and restaurant deliveries to reduce their exposure to the virus.
They relied on couriers, who delivered food, parcels and takeaway meals despite the risks. 
Moscow was the epicentre of Russia's coronavirus outbreak, in a country where almost 670,000 people have been infected and close to 10,000 have died.
At the peak of the lockdown, most residents were only allowed out of their homes to buy food, seek emergency medical attention, walk the dog or take out the garbage. 
Commissioned by five retailers - Ozon, Perekrestok.ru, Azbuka Vkusa, Dodo Pizza and Delivery Club - the statue honours the more than 60,000 couriers who worked during lockdown as demand for delivery services skyrocketed.
Perekrestok.ru, part of the X5 retail group, said it received four times as many orders in May than the same period a year earlier, while online retailer Ozon said its purchases volume grew by 200% in April. 

""Every day they go to work, they don't just deliver goods. They deliver comfort and peace of mind,"" the companies said in a joint statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will begin holding daily televised briefings with journalists later this year, throwing open a decades-old behind-closed-doors relationship between reporters and politicians.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was to meet public demand for information direct from ministers, building on the perceived success of the government's daily news conferences during the coronavirus pandemic.
""People have liked more direct detailed information from the government about what's going on,"" Johnson told LBC radio. ""We do think that people want direct engagement and want stuff from us.""
The new format resembles that used by the White House in Washington to televise what have been - particularly during President Donald Trump's administration - sometimes awkward and hostile tussles between reporters and government officials.
It will begin in October, according to the Times of London and Financial Times newspapers.
Marking a major shift that has been resisted by successive british administrations and some sections of the printed press, it will partially replace a much more closed system of interaction between the government and the reporters.
These so-called ""lobby"" arrangements have evolved from secret briefings for select journalists in the 1920s to on-the-record, though untelevised, meetings with the prime minister's spokesman.
Held either in a draughty turret room inside the Palace of Westminster or a former court chamber attached to the prime minister's residence, the briefings are now open to accredited members of the media working in parliament.
Johnson's move to televise one of these twice-daily meetings will put on show a relationship between the government and the media that has been long been criticised by some as too comfortable - particularly in recent years as Brexit captured the wider public's attention and polarised opinions.

From March the government held a daily news conference, allowing reporters to ask ministers and public health officials questions by video link. At times they attracted millions of viewers, but have now been cancelled in favour of briefings only when the government has a significant announcement to make.

RHODES, Greece (Reuters) - Shops shuttered and streets abandoned, the island of Rhodes is pinning its hopes on a trickle of tourists to salvage what is left of a holiday season decimated by the coronavirus pandemic.
One of Greece's busiest resort islands, the cobbled streets of the imposing medieval city of Rhodes town were empty this week. At this rate, only a few hotels will open this year, locals say.
""We have never experienced anything like this, not at least for the past 50 to 60 years,"" said Manolis Markopoulos, head of the hoteliers association in Rhodes.
Greece opened its regional airports, including in Rhodes, to travellers this week.
At present, only about 20 percent of hotels are open, and the next two weeks will be an important gauge of how the season will perform, Markopoulos said.
""If we show 20-25% compared to performance last year that would be a happy outcome,"" he said.
The picture on nearby Kos island was similar with rows of empty sunloungers, placed apart to meet distancing rules. 
Greeks are optimistic something can be recovered from the season, banking on the record of Greek authorities in keeping a lid on the outbreak by locking down early. It has recorded fewer than 3,500 cases of COVID-19 and 192 deaths. 
""It might just be time for Greece to reap returns from its excellent performance in managing the pandemic,"" said Konstantina Svinou, head of the Kos hotels association.
Others just want to keep their heads above water. Greece's tourism sector accounts for a fifth of its economic output and employs 700,000 people.

""We want to believe that even with 30-40% occupancy that we will meet some fixed expenses, that staff can get their salaries and pay social insurance to be able to get the unemployment benefit in the winter,"" said Hasan Hadji Suleyman, who runs a beach bar and restaurant on Kos.

Merkel entered the Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament, wearing a black mask marked with EU2020.de, a website dedicated to Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union which started on July 1.
Merkel, whose government has made wearing a mask compulsory in some public places, was asked by a journalist at a news conference on Monday why she had never been seen wearing a mask in public.
The chancellor, who is known to keep a close eye on opinion polls, responded that she did not need to wear a mask when she was observing social distancing rules, but did so when she could not, for example during private shopping trips when she was not in the public eye.
""But I won't tell you where I go shopping,"" she said with a smile.
Merkel has been lauded for her response to the coronavirus crisis and her approval ratings have surged. Europe's largest economy has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic better than most of its neighbours, helped by relatively soft lockdown measures that allowed some social and industrial activity to continue throughout the peak months of the epidemic, as well as hefty rescue and stimulus packages.

The law grants police and military sweeping powers to tackle security threats, but legal experts had warned its overly broad articles could open the door to discriminatory enforcement, privacy infringements and suppression of peaceful dissent.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque confirmed the bill has been signed when asked by reporters on Friday.

The anti-terrorism act, which Duterte, 75, fast-tracked through both houses of Congress during the coronavirus outbreak, has been widely condemned by human rights groups. The United Nations' human rights chief earlier this week urged Duterte not to pass it in its current form.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican's new financial regulator says he is confident that the days when the Holy See would ""wash dirty laundry"" in private are over and that Pope Francis' recent spending rules are a sea change in transparency.
In an interview with Reuters, Carmelo Barbagallo, the head of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF), cited two recent scandals that were revealed by the Vatican and not by the media.
The first was a shady deal to buy a London property as an investment - a still-evolving case that exploded last year - followed by a Vatican police raid this week on a department suspected of irregular contract bidding.
""(In the past, people thought) that it was better to wash dirty laundry in the family, and therefore not say anything,"" he said.
""I think not. I think you have to be strong to manage the consequences of revealing the problem and just as strong in avoiding that it repeats itself,"" he said. 
Barbagallo, a former top official at the Bank of Italy, was appointed following the scandal surrounding the London property deal, which led to the suspension last year of five Vatican employees, the resignation of the Vatican's police chief, and the arrest of an Italian middleman.
The previous top two AIF officials lost their jobs. Both deny any wrongdoing. Barbagallo acknowledged that his predecessors had done much good work but declined to discuss details of the London property deal, citing ongoing investigations.
After Vatican police raided the AIF offices, seizing documents and computers, the Egmont Group of world financial intelligence units suspended the Holy See because of fears that intelligence regarding other countries had been breached. 
Egmont fully readmitted the Vatican after Barbagallo signed a protocol with Vatican prosecutors on protecting sensitive information.
Barbagallo, who spoke as the AIF released its annual report, described as a ""truly epochal change"" the pope's sweeping new rules, issued on June 1, for procurement, spending, and awarding contracts.
They aim to ensure transparent competition and reduce the risk of corruption and nepotism.
The personnel changes at the AIF come as the Vatican is preparing for a new evaluation this year by Moneyval, a monitoring body of the Council of Europe.
Moneyval has given Vatican financial reforms mostly positive reviews in recent evaluations.

""We will have no difficulty adopting good suggestions Moneyval may make,"" Barbagallo said.

MANILA (Reuters) - Thousands of jeepneys, flamboyantly decorated jeeps that serve as cheap public transport across the Philippines, were back on the streets of Manila on Friday, bringing relief to companies and commuters who have struggled with coronavirus curbs.
Dubbed ""the king of the road"", an estimated 55,000 of these large, multi-coloured trucks, used to crawl through Manila's gridlocked roads on a typical day before being forced to a halt 15 weeks ago when the government imposed a coronavirus lockdown. 
Just 6,000 were back in business on Friday, operating at half capacity under strict social distancing rules. In pre-pandemic times, jeepneys routinely carried up to 15 passengers who sat knee-to-knee on twin benches in the windowless vehicles, choked by exhaust fumes.
""I'm very happy we are now back on the road. This is our only source of income,"" said driver Celo Cabangon, whose truck is decorated with Japanese and Philippine flags, Bible verses and the logo of U.S. sci-fi film ""Transformers"".
Under the new rules, passengers must also undergo temperature checks before boarding and shield themselves from one another with face masks and plastic sheets. The Philippines has recorded 40,000 coronavirus cases, and 1,280 deaths.
Commuter Alejandra Carable welcomed the jeepney's return. ""Our expenses are too much without jeepneys. We can save much more now that the jeepneys are back."" 
A jeepney fare is typically about 9 pesos ($0.18), cheaper than trains, taxis or motorised tricycles, which were allowed back on the road a month ago when authorities started easing one of the world's longest and strictest lockdowns.
A phased return to work has been chaotic without jeepneys, with commuters stranded and some companies unable to provide sufficient private transport.

The first jeepneys were surplus army jeeps left behind by the U.S. military after World War Two. Most are festooned with religious slogans or horoscope signs and are in poor shape.

LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities have not made an official approach to the British government for permission to speak to Prince Andrew about his contacts with the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday.
U.S. prosecutors want to question the British prince over his contacts with Epstein, who was awaiting trial on charges of trafficking minors when he died last August in a New York City federal prison.
However, they have said Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, had repeatedly evaded their requests for an interview and reiterated their desire to speak to him on Thursday after they arrested British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Epstein.
Lawyers for Andrew, who met Epstein through his friendship with Maxwell, say he has offered his help three times this year.
Asked what the response would be if U.S. officials sought formal access to the prince, whose official title is the Duke of York, Johnson said: ""No such approach has been made. It's a matter for the royal family.""
He added: ""Everybody's sympathies are very much with the victims of Jeffrey Epstein but you wouldn't expect me to comment on matters affecting the royal family."" 
""The law must carried out and the law must be observed,"" he told LBC radio. 
In June, then-U.S. Attorney for Manhattan Geoffrey Berman said Andrew had ""sought to falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate"" with their inquiry.
At the same time, a U.S. law enforcement official confirmed to Reuters that U.S. authorities investigating Epstein had sent the British government a formal request, known as a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) submission, asking for access to the prince.
After Maxwell was arrested and charged on Thursday with luring underage girls for Epstein to sexually abuse, acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss said: ""We would welcome Prince Andrew coming in to talk with us.""
Andrew's legal team have accused the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) of seeking publicity rather than his help, rejecting accusations he had offered ""zero cooperation.""

""The Duke’s team remains bewildered given that we have twice communicated with the DOJ in the last month, and to-date, we have had no response,"" a source close to Andrew's team said in response to Strauss's remarks.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s President Moon Jae-in on Friday tapped officials known for advocating inter-Korean engagement as chiefs of national security, intelligence and unification policy in a bid to revive relations and stalled projects with North Korea. 
Moon appointed Suh Hoon, director of the National Intelligence Service (NIS), as his national security adviser, and nominated Park Jie-won, a former lawmaker and special envoy to Pyongyang, to succeed Suh as NIS head.
Lee In-young, a four-term lawmaker, was nominated to oversee inter-Korean ties as unification minister, after the current minister resigned over worsening relations with the North. 
Moon also named his national security adviser Chung Eui-yong and former chief of staff Im Jong-seok as special advisers on foreign policy and security. 
The nominees for NIS director and unification minister are subject to parliamentary questioning and approval. 
The shake-up of top security officials came as Moon seeks to cement progress in inter-Korean relations as his major legacy in his final two years in office by restarting diplomatic exchanges and economic initiatives dogged by international sanctions imposed over the North’s nuclear and missile programmes.
""Reviving inter-Korean dialogue is a top priority, and I’d look at the issue of restarting humanitarian exchanges and cooperation which can be done immediately,"" Lee told a news conference. 
Moon held three summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and signed an agreement aimed at easing tensions, but relations have soured since a second summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump collapsed last year in which Moon had offered to be a mediator. 
North Korea has rejected the idea that South Korea can play mediator, but Moon has vowed to continue playing a bridging role between Kim and Trump, and this week called for the two leaders to meet again before the U.S. presidential election in November.
All of the nominees are known as strong supporters of inter-Korean détente, with Suh, Chung and Im being instrumental in facilitating the summits between Moon and Kim.

The U.S. point man for North Korea, Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, is due to visit South Korea next week for meetings with his South Korean counterparts.

Water levels in some sections of the Yangtze were already more than 2 metres higher than normal on Thursday, the Ministry of Water Resources said.
The ministry said it will regulate water levels at the Three Gorges and other reservoirs further upstream in order to ease flood pressures on the lower reaches of the Yangtze, which flows all the way to Shanghai on the eastern coast. 
China regularly faces a summer flood season, but environmental groups say climate change is causing heavier and more frequent rainfall.
""The devastating floods that we have seen are consistent with an increase in extreme weather events due to climate change,"" said Liu Junyan, a campaigner with Greenpeace East Asia.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece started work clearing ground on Friday for a real estate project that plans to turn a disused airport on the Athens coast into one of Europe's biggest tourist resorts, three times the size of Monaco. 
The former Hellenikon airport, a sprawling site of disused runways, terminals and venues used for the Athens 2004 Olympics, has been abandoned for almost two decades.
After years of delays due to bureaucratic red tape, political resistance and local opposition, demolition crews began tearing down the first block of buildings out of hundreds that need to be removed from the 1,500-acre plot.
Lamda Development, which secured the long-term lease on the site in 2014, plans to build a complex of luxury homes, hotels, offices, a yachting marina and a casino at a total cost of 8 billion euros ($9 billion). 
""This is a project which symbolises a new Greece,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose Conservative government has promised to speed up the project, told a launch ceremony.
Development of the site was a requirement under international bailouts Greece reached with creditors.
Lamda, which first outlined its plan in 2013, has said it will spend about 2 billion euros in the first five years of an estimated 25-year construction phase, building two skyscrapers for offices and a hotel, and about 800 residences and a park.
It plans to demolish about a third of about 900 buildings on the site in the coming months and aims to start building infrastructure in the first half of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Odisseas Athanasiou said during the ceremony.
Before construction starts, Greece needs to resolve a dispute between two U.S. firms over the award of a tender to operate the property's casino.
The Hellenikon project is expected to create about 10,000 jobs during construction and attract thousands of tourists and investors to the Greek capital.

A heap of mining waste collapsed into a lake on Thursday and buried many workers under mud and water. 
By late evening on Thursday, rescue workers had recovered 162 bodies, the fire service department said.
But Thar Lin Maung, a local official from the information ministry, said on Friday the number dead was 161, with 43 hospitalized. The search was ongoing, he said.
Half of the victims are yet to be identified, he said, adding that many were migrants who were living in a small tent beside the mine.
A ceremony to give financial aid for the families of the victims would be held on Friday, he said. About US$80,000 had been donated by the regional government, industry body Myanmar Gems and Jewelry Entrepreneurs Association, and one mining company.
The miners were collecting stones in the jade-rich Hpakant area of Kachin state - the centre of Myanmar’s secretive jade industry - when the ""muddy wave"" crashed onto them after heavy rain, the fire service department said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Deadly landslides and other accidents are common in the poorly regulated mines of Hpakant, which draw impoverished workers from across Myanmar in search of gems mostly for export to China. But Thursday’s accident was the worst in over five years.

About 100 people were killed in a 2015 collapse which strengthened calls to regulate the industry. Another 50 died in 2019.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's aviation regulator has temporarily suspended pilots employed by domestic airlines who hold Pakistani licences, after the government of the South Asian nation revealed that many pilots had dubious qualifications.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Malaysia (CAAM) said in a statement on Thursday that the decision came after an evaluation of all foreign pilots in Malaysia. The regulator told Reuters that there are less than 20 Pakistani pilots in the country.
National carrier Malaysia Airlines said it does not have any Pakistani pilot, Malindo Air, the Malaysian arm of Indonesia's Lion Air, said it does not have any foreign pilots, and AirAsia said it does not have any Pakistani pilot.
CAAM said the pilots were employed with “local operators”, such as flying schools, flying clubs and training organisations.
Pakistan last week grounded almost a third of its pilots after discovering they may have falsified their qualifications. Pakistan has a total of 860 pilots, 107 of whom work for foreign airlines.
Global concern has mounted since the announcement, with countries grounding Pakistan pilots and seeking to verify their credentials.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency has also suspended Pakistan International Airlines' authorisation to fly to the bloc for six months.
CAAM said it is making efforts with its Pakistani counterpart to verify the authenticity of the licence holders.
""Licence holders that are verified as valid by (the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority) will be reinstated immediately,"" it said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's decision to scrap two Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defence systems means it must find other ways to defend a 3,000-kilometre archipelago along Asia's eastern edge.
Some policy makers want Japan to acquire the capability to attack enemy missiles before they are launched.
'IMPOSSIBLE' PROBLEM
In a surprise decision, defence minister Taro Kono recently halted the 2025 deployment of Aegis Ashore because booster rockets used to accelerate SM-3 Block IIA interceptor missiles might fall on communities in northern Akita and southern Yamaguchi prefectures. 
That problem, according to military experts, has been known since Japan picked Aegis Ashore in 2018. The interceptor was developed for use at sea, where debris would fall harmlessly. 
""From the beginning, the Japanese government's story was impossible. I was a missile shooter, I knew how difficult it would be to control the fall of burned-out boosters,"" former Maritime Self Defense Force admiral Yoji Koda, who commanded Japan's naval fleet from 2007 to 2008, told Reuters. 
The expense of Aegis Ashore project also affected Kono's decision. 
Japan's Aegis Ashore contracts are worth around $1.7 billion, with more than $100 million already spent. Over 30 years the defence ministry estimated the budget at around $4 billion, not including missile tests that sources last year said could cost at least $500 million. 
ALTERNATIVES
For now, Japan will rely on destroyers with older Aegis radars that guide less-powerful SM-3 interceptors, which can hit enemy missiles in space and can be upgraded to tackle other threats. Japan also has PAC-3 Patriot missile batteries, which can shoot at plunging warheads in their last seconds before impact.
Japan is increasing the range and accuracy of its Patriots and by next year will have eight Aegis destroyers. Crewing ships with about 300 sailors each, however, strains naval resources as the country struggles to find recruits.
""Having two or three Aegis ships in the Sea of Japan is a waste of assets. I think Aegis Ashore is a good option,"" said Noboru Yamaguchi, a Sasakawa Peace Foundation adviser and former Ground Self Defense Force general.
Japan could add another layer of defence, such as the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missiles, which aims at warheads between the capabilities of SM-3s and Patriots. Their mobile launchers are easier to deploy than fixed Aegis sites, but could still face opposition from residents because several missile batteries, which use powerful radars, would be needed to cover Japan's big cities.
STRIKE OPTION
Japan's National Security Council, led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, will this summer consider whether to buy weapons for attacking missile sites before a launch. 
A council made up senior ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers, including four former defence ministers, will also weigh the idea. Itsunori Onodera, who approved the Aegis Ashore purchase when he was defence chief, is leading the discussion.
Such an option is attractive because it is easier to hit missiles sitting on launch pads than to attack them in flight. 
Onodera argues that attacking missile sites is the modern equivalent of downing enemy bombers, putting it in line with Japan's war-renouncing constitution, which allows for self defence. 
In 2017 Onodera approved the purchase of air-launched cruise missiles with a range of up to 1,000 kilometres that can be fired from F-35 stealth fighters or F-15 attack jets, making them able to strike targets in North Korea from the Sea of Japan. 
SNAGS
Those cruise missiles are not effective without satellites or other means of providing precise targeting information, and of telling whether an attack is imminent. Japan has launched surveillance satellites on its H-2A rocket, most recently in one in February, but those are not designed for strike-targeting. 
If Japan musters a first-strike capability, it could face opposition from China, Russia and even South Korea.
That may not stop Japan, but resistance from the United States could. Under their military alliance, Japan provides a defensive shield that protects U.S. forces. Past U.S. administrations have opposed an independent Japanese strike capability.
Constitutional considerations could also curtail the scope of strikes. Japan's U.S.-authored constitution renounces its right to wage war.
Any first-strike doctrine would have to be carefully defined before it is even considered by the NCS, Kono said in Tokyo last month.

China is challenging U.S. influence in the Pacific, a region that the United States has considered its back yard since World War Two. Last year, China whittled away at Taiwan's allies in the Pacific by winning over Kiribati and the Solomon Islands.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said the re-opening of its Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Guam, after its closure in 2017 for budget reasons, was a response to closer Taiwan-U.S. relations and the strategic importance of the Pacific region.
""Reestablishing TECO in Guam will facilitate economic and trade cooperation and exchanges between Taiwan and the greater western Pacific region, deepen Taiwan's relations with its Pacific allies, and increase multilateral exchanges,"" the ministry said.
China considers Taiwan its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties. Four of Taiwan's remaining 15 diplomatic allies are in the Pacific - Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands.
The small developing nations lie in highly strategic waters, and the United States and its friends like Australia have become increasingly concerned by China's moves to expand its footprint there.
Taipei and Washington have no formal diplomatic relations, but the United States is Taiwan's strongest supporter on the international stage, which is another source of tension between Washington and Beijing. 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen went to Guam in 2017 on her way back from visiting the island's Pacific allies.

(Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, was arrested on Thursday on U.S. charges of luring underage girls so that Epstein could sexually abuse them.
The FBI arrest of the British socialite is the latest twist in the mystery of Epstein, who went from a high school math teacher to high-flying lifestyle of private Caribbean islands and powerful connections that his victims say allowed him to abuse minors with impunity.
Maxwell, 58, was arrested in Bradford, New Hampshire, where she had been laying low since December, the FBI said. 
Maxwell appeared briefly by video from jail at a hearing in New Hampshire federal court, where a judge ordered her to face the criminal charges in New York. She did not enter a plea, and bail was not determined.
She spoke briefly, answering ""yes"" when asked if she knew her rights. Her lawyer, Larry Vogelman, declined further comment on her behalf.
Prosecutors said she was a flight risk and asked that she be detained without bail. They said she faces up to 35 years in prison.
She is charged with four criminal counts related to procuring and transporting minors for illegal sex acts and two of perjury, according to the indictment by federal prosecutors in New York.
""Maxwell was among Epstein's closest associates and helped him exploit girls who were as young as 14 years old,"" said acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss. ""Maxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend and groom minor victims for abuse. In some cases, Maxwell participated in the abuse herself.""
Epstein was awaiting trial on federal charges of trafficking minors between 2002 and 2005 when he was found hanged in an apparent suicide while in a New York City jail in August. He was 66. 
Previously, he pleaded guilty in Florida to state charges of solicitation of prostitution from a minor in a 2008 deal with prosecutors that was widely criticized as too lenient.
The indictment accuses Maxwell of luring the girls beginning in 1994 through 1997 by asking them about their lives, schools and families and taking them shopping or to movies. 
Strauss called Maxwell's alleged acts ""the prequel"" to Epstein's abuse.
After Maxwell won the girls' trust, the indictment alleges, she would try to ""normalize sexual abuse"" by discussing sexual topics or by undressing in front of them or being present when they were undressed.
Epstein's alleged abuse included touching their genitals, placing sex toys on their genitals and having the girls touch Epstein while he masturbated.
Strauss said the abuse took place at Epstein's homes in New York, Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Palm Beach, Florida, as well as Maxwell's residence in London.
PROSECUTORS SEEK ANSWERS
Epstein has been linked socially to several powerful figures, from President Donald Trump to former President Bill Clinton and Britain's Prince Andrew. 
In June, then-U.S. Attorney for Manhattan Geoffrey Berman said Prince Andrew was evading their efforts to question him about his contacts with Epstein. Berman was fired later the same month.
""We would welcome Prince Andrew coming in to talk with us,"" Strauss said.
A source close to Andrew said his team was ""bewildered"" by Strauss's comments because they have twice communicated with the Department of Justice in the past month without a response.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in June there were no plans to extradite Andrew. 
Investigators identified more than 15 bank accounts associated with Maxwell since 2016 with balances during that period that topped $20 million, according to court documents.
""For years, I feared Epstein and his ring,"" Jennifer Araoz, who has accused Maxwell of trafficking her for Epstein, said in a statement. ""Today, my fellow Epstein survivors and I are able to take a breath of relief, as Maxwell’s arrest means some justice for survivors can exist.""
Maxwell, the daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell, has kept a low profile since Epstein's death.
She was an Epstein ex-girlfriend who became a longtime member of his inner circle. In a 2003 Vanity Fair article, Epstein was quoted as saying Maxwell was his best friend. 
Since Epstein's arrest and death last year, questions have arisen over how he built his vast wealth, which exceeded $600 million before the recent stock market slump and included two privately owned Caribbean islands, multiple homes and one of the largest mansions in Manhattan.

The case is being handled by prosecutors in the public corruption unit. A spokesman declined to comment on why that unit would handle the case.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. point man for North Korea is due to visit South Korea next week as it pushes for a resumption of talks with the North ahead of the U.S. election and despite few signs of any progress.
U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who led working-level negotiations with the North Koreans, will be among several State Department officials holding talks with South Korean counterparts on Tuesday, a government official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity as the trip has not been announced.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should meet again before the U.S. election in November, and on Thursday, South Korea's foreign minister said Seoul is pushing for a resumption of U.S.-North Korea talks.
Biegun has said there is time for both sides to re-engage and ""make substantial progress"", but the coronavirus pandemic would make an in-person summit difficult before the November election.
Last month, North Korea abruptly raised tension with South Korea and blew up an inter-Korean liaison office, just on its side of the border, before just as suddenly announcing it would suspend plans for unspecified military actions against the South.
North Korea has repeatedly said it will not return to talks until the United States drops its ""hostile policies"", including strict sanctions, and vowed not to provide Trump with another photo opportunity before the election without significant concessions.
""It’s hard to imagine a scenario where the North Koreans would be compelled to come back to the table unless the U.S. 'offer' was drastically different than it’s been in the past,"" said Jenny Town, of 38 North, a think-tank focusing on North Korea. 
""And even then, how credible would that be that it would survive a potential change in administration in the U.S.?
Trump and Kim met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes of an agreement to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme. 
But their second summit, in early 2019 in Vietnam, fell apart.
Trump and Kim met again at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in June 2019 and agreed to restart negotiations but working-level talks between the two sides in Sweden in October were broken off.

Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, told reporters in New York on Thursday that the president might seek another summit with Kim as an ""October Surprise"" ahead of the election.

Martinelli, who served from 2009 to 2014, is suspected to have improperly diverted public funds in the purchase of a media outlet while president as part of the so-called ""New Business"" case, local media and officials said. 
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Martinelli called the charges ""political persecution"" and accused Panama's judicial system of not following due process. 
""They want to involve me because they want to destroy me,"" he said. 
Martinelli was extradited to Panama in 2018 from the United States and faced charges of spying on politicians, journalists and others during his presidential tenure. He was found not guilty. 
Varela, Martinelli's successor from 2014 to 2019, is suspected of accepting donations from Brazilian construction firm Odebrecht through his political party.
Varela has denied the allegations, and said all his campaigns were financed properly with private funds. 
Odebrecht has been at the center of a far-reaching Latin American bribery scandal uncovered in 2014 that led the company to pay at least $3.5 billion in settlements. 

Both former presidents must report to authorities once a month, the attorney general's office said.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia reported a drop in new coronavirus cases on Friday, with a surge in the second most populated state Victoria appearing to have eased, although more than 10,000 people have refused to be tested in hotspot suburbs of Melbourne.
There were 66 new cases in Victoria on the second day of reimposed lockdowns in more than 30 suburbs mostly north of Melbourne. That was down from more than 70 new cases in each of the previous four days.
""We do need more time in order to get a firmer hold on whether there is a positive trend there. But certainly, to see these numbers relatively consistent is very pleasing,"" Victoria state premier Daniel Andrews said in a media conference.
The spike in Victoria is being closely watched as the rest of the country has reined in the infection. The country's most populated state, New South Wales, reported zero new cases on Friday.
Overall, Australia has weathered the coronavirus pandemic much better than most other nations, with just over 8,000 cases and only 104 deaths so far.
Victoria has tested more than 24,000 people each day over the past two days in the hotspot suburbs, however more than 10,000 people have refused to be tested, which the state's health minister said was alarming.
""It is concerning that some people believe that coronavirus is a conspiracy or that it won't impact on them, so what I want to stress here is that coronavirus is a very contagious virus,"" Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos told reporters.
Many of the new cases in Victoria, which had reined in the virus in May, have been traced back to one security worker at a hotel where returning travellers were held in quarantine, Mikakos said, pointing to how contagious the virus is.
Police are patrolling the streets in hotspot suburbs to ensure people leave home only to go to work, buy groceries or for health care.
Andrews warned that if the flare-up spreads to other suburbs, and case numbers top 20 per 100,000 residents, those areas would face new lockdowns.
""I can't rule out further restrictions,"" Andrews said.

The reimposed lockdowns in Victoria are not expected to stall Australia's economic recovery, although firms might be cautious with employment and investment decisions, economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said.

Brenton Tarrant pleaded guilty earlier this year to 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act. 
Justice Cameron Mander said the hearing is estimated to last three days, but it will take as long as is necessary.
Tarrant has been in police custody since March 15, 2019, when he was arrested and accused of using semi-automatic weapons to target Muslims attending Friday prayers at two mosques in the South Island city of Christchurch. The attack was streamed live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and cited as providing inspiration for several other attacks targeting religious groups around the world.
Tarrant had planned to fight the charges but changed his plea to guilty in March this year.
Justice Mander said arrangements will be made to allow victims and family members currently based overseas, and unable to travel to New Zealand, to view the sentencing remotely.
New Zealand borders remain shut for foreigners, and New Zealanders returning will have to stay in quarantine for 14 days, as the government looks to limit the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Tarrant's remand was extended to find a suitable date after all COVID-19 restrictions were lifted.
However, waiting for changes to border controls will likely result in a very extended period of delay, Justice Mander said.

""Finality and closure is considered by some as the best means of bringing relief to the Muslim community,"" he said.

A full list of countries covered by the relaxation would be announced on Friday, the country’s transport ministry said.
Under the existing rules, travellers must self-isolate for 14 days on entering the country, something airlines and the travel industry have said will cost thousands of jobs and inflict further damage on the economy. 
The government said it expected countries included on the quarantine-free list for England would reciprocate by relaxing their own travel restrictions.
Britain's foreign ministry would set out exemptions from its global advisory against ""all but essential"" international travel from July 4. 
""Today marks the next step in carefully reopening our great nation,"" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. 
The devolved governments of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own powers over public health issues.
Britain said it would require all travellers, except those from the exempted countries, to provide their contact information including their travel history on arrival. People who have been in or transited through non-exempt countries will still have to self isolate for 14 days.
The Telegraph newspaper reported on Thursday the government would end coronavirus quarantine rules for those arriving from 75 countries so that people can go on holiday.
The UK would also lift a ban on non-essential travel to nearly all EU destinations, the British territories including Bermuda and Gibraltar, and Turkey, Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, the Telegraph added.
Britain is moving to reopen its pubs, restaurants and other businesses this weekend, signalling a gradual reopening of its economy.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people to maintain social distancing rules and is expected to repeat that caution at a news conference on Friday.

""Anyone who flouts social distancing and COVID-Secure rules is not only putting us all at risk but letting down those businesses and workers who have done so much to prepare for this new normal,"" he will say.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said he would veto a bill regulating fake news, which has also been criticized by social media companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter, if it comes to his desk from Congress in its present shape.
A network of Bolsonaro's right-wing supporters is being investigated for propagating fake news to denigrate opponents and attack the country's democratic institutions.
Speaking on a Facebook live broadcast, his favorite channel of communication with his backers, Bolsonaro said he was for ""total freedom of the media"" as he criticized the bill passed by the Senate on Tuesday. 
The proposal has returned to the lower chamber to approve changes.
Facebook, Twitter and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have jointly criticized the bill as a serious threat to privacy by requiring social media account holders to provide an identity document and a cellphone number for verification purposes when registering.
The companies called it a ""massive gathering of data on people"" that undermined the right to protect data.
They also said the requirement to keep databases on servers in Brazil would endanger privacy and hurt the economy because it would create barriers to commerce that were contrary to the global and open nature of the Internet.

Bolsonaro said he would ""consult the people"" before deciding whether to veto the bill or sign it into law.

Cariocas, as Rio's inhabitants are known, went to bars, restaurants and gyms that are now allowed to operate again in the latest stage of reopening that had some experts worried about a new wave of infections. The beaches remained closed for sunbathing, but opened for individual exercise. 
""It is a relief and provides hope that things can get better,"" said Flavio Vicente, 38, as he worked out on Copacabana Beach. 
Brazil has the world's second largest outbreak behind the United States, with the country's death toll passing 60,000 on Wednesday. 
In Rio alone, 6,618 people have died of COVID-19 in the past four months. Only 14 countries in the world have a death toll higher than the city. Public hospitals are at 70% capacity.
At a restaurant in Copacabana, Fernando Melo said he was relieved to be back at work. 
""They were difficult days at home, without doing anything, without money,"" he said. ""We are returning slowly with the hope of better days in this new normal.""
City Hall has laid out various public health criteria to try and ensure a safe return to business, such as limiting capacity and requiring people book spots in advance, but medical experts still fear the move may have come too soon.
""The opening was hasty. We are seeing a drop in deaths, but it doesn't mean that at the first sign of a fall it is safe open,"" said Américo Cunha, a professor at Rio's state university UERJ who has monitored the outbreak.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hong Kong's fate shows China's true authoritarianism so the rest of the world should stand up to President Xi Jinping and start to put human rights above financial gain, pro-democracy activist Nathan Law told Reuters.
China unveiled a national security law this week which Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters and the West say breaches the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British treaty that guaranteed the autonomy of Hong Kong. 
""The protests in Hong Kong have been a window for the world to recognise that China is getting more and more authoritarian,"" Law told Reuters via internet video. Law, 26, left Hong Kong this week. He declined to disclose his location.
Law called on the international community to put human rights above the financial interests of trading with the world's second largest economy and to ""multilaterally deal with the China issue in a more assertive way.""
""It is important we prioritise human rights issues over trade when we deal with China,"" he said.
The British flag was lowered over Hong Kong when the colony was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule - imposed after Britain defeated China in the First Opium War.
Britain says the national security law breaches the agreements made at the time of the handover and that China is crushing the freedoms that have helped make Hong Kong one of the world's most glittering financial hubs.
Hong Kong and Beijing officials have said the law is vital to plug holes in national security defences exposed by the protests. China has repeatedly told Western powers to stop meddling in Hong Kong's affairs. 
""The national security law is basically the end of 'one country, two systems' because there is no longer two systems, no more firewall between Hong Kong and China - it is basically merged,"" Law said.
""The international community should recognise that and put relevant mechanisms to hold China accountable,"" he said. ""The international community should review whether Hong Kong should enjoy certain privileges that were given under the premise that Hong Kong was autonomous.""
Law said businesses and professionals were seriously considering leaving Hong Kong, once ranked as Asia's top financial hub, due to China's crackdown.
While Law said the national security law was aimed at crushing the pro-democracy movement, he said Hong Kong would not surrender and the resistance would continue. 
""The democratic movement will still be vibrant even though it will be in other forms or in other ways of representation but still we can see that the resistance movement is still alive,"" Law said.
So what would Law tell President Xi?
""It is better for you to step down,"" he said. 

""It is time for a leader for the country who knows how to treat the people good and lead the country in a more healthy, positive way instead of just messing up the whole country.""

The latest phase in a gradual reopening of the British economy on Saturday will see pubs in England open their doors for the first time since mid March, as well as the reopening of restaurants, museums, hotels and other businesses.
The much-awaited event has been dubbed ""Super Saturday"" in the media, sparking worries that after months cooped up indoors, some could get carried away and risk spreading COVID-19.
""Ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly,"" Johnson is expected to say at a news conference on Friday.
Many of the elements that define a pub will be missing when they reopen: with numbers limited, there will be no crowds, no standing at the bar and no live music. Venues will have to keep a record of customers in case of a virus outbreak.
Johnson has previously said he is looking forward to visiting a pub himself, but has warned that patrons will have to stick to new rules. 
He is expected to repeat that caution on Friday, pointing to a spike in cases that has forced the English city of Leicester to be locked down. Johnson will warn that freedoms could be swiftly revoked if the virus takes hold elsewhere.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - To eliminate the risk of contagious human beings, a Mexican company has launched a drone delivery service to get clean medical supplies to hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
Mexico-City based firm Sincronia Logistica has begun deploying unmanned drones to deliver personal protective gear and other essential equipment to public hospitals in the central state of Queretaro, north of the capital.
Mexican healthcare workers have staged protests nationwide over the lack of personal protective equipment. The drones help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus by allowing for quick, contact-free drop-offs.
""In addition to reducing time, we've also reduced human contact,"" said Diego Garcia, director of business excellence at Sincronia Logistica.
The innovation comes as the pandemic has surged in Mexico to give the country the sixth-highest death toll worldwide, with some 28,510 confirmed COVID-19 fatalities.
Sincronia Logistica says it has used drones to deliver donations of antibacterial gel, facemasks, gloves, 3D-printed face shields and other basic supplies for healthcare workers.
Doctors value the service, said Juana Angelica Garcia, director of the El Marques public hospital in the city of Queretaro, the state capital.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison will on Saturday vie to secure a 100-year first by winning a seat from the opposition at a by-election, a contest that will test how well voters believe his government has handled the dual crises of catastrophic summer bushfires and COVID-19 pandemic.
The sprawling Eden-Monaro electorate on the south coast of New South Wales state was one of the worst hit by fires and some locals jeered Morrison over his handling of the deadly event when he visited the devastation. 
The conservative leader was widely criticised for taking his family on holiday to Hawaii as fires raged across the country.
Political polls soon rebounded, however, with Morrison lauded for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has seen Australia record about 8,000 infections and 104 deaths - well below other countries.
""By rights, the opposition Labor party should win the seat - but he has turned his standing around dramatically since the bushfires,"" said John Hewson, a former leader of the Liberal Party now headed by Morrison.
""If the Liberals win, then coronavirus has changed the landscape.""
Voters in Eden-Monaro - about 478 km (297 miles) south of Sydney - are voting to elect a new parliamentary member after the retirement of an opposition Labor lawmaker due to ill-health. Election campaigns in Eden-Monaro are historically tightly-fought contests.
While a victory for the Liberal candidate, Fiona Kotvojs, won't change the balance of power in the national parliament, it would be a boon for Morrison, given voters usually lodge protest votes against the sitting government in by-elections.
The last time the opposition lost a by-election to a government candidate was in 1920, in the West Australia state goldfields electorate of Kalgoorlie.
Haydon Manning, a political science specialist at Flinders University in South Australia, said a victory for the Liberal candidate would provide strong momentum ahead of a tricky period ahead navigating an economic recovery out of the pandemic.
The next federal election is due by mid-2022.

The explosion in 2019 was the worst attack in years in Colombia's capital Bogota and resulted in President Ivan Duque dismissing the possibility of continuing nascent peace talks with the left-wing group, founded in 1964.
""Eight people who participated in the financing, planning and execution of the attack on Jan. 17, 2019 have been successfully captured,"" Attorney General Francisco Barbosa said in a joint broadcast with Duque and Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo. 
The arrests were carried out in cities including Bogota, Zipaquira and Manizales, as well as the settlement of La Esmeralda in Arauca province, which borders Venezuela, where equipment and vehicles were seized. 
The detainees, accused of murder and terrorism, face jail sentences of between 40 and 50 years, Barbosa said. 
Authorities had earlier captured five other people accused of belonging to the ELN and participating in the attack on the National Police Academy, which injured 89 people.
Since the bombing, Duque has refused to consider possible peace talks with the group, saying it must first suspend kidnappings and free all hostages. Duque has also insisted the ELN stop recruiting minors, end its attacks on infrastructure, and discontinue its alleged use of landmines.
The ELN, which has 2,000 fighters and is considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union, has declined to meet the demands. 
""We once again send a strong message to the terrorists: we are going to keep fighting them, we are going to keep breaking them up,"" Duque said.

ELN chief negotiator Pablo Beltran told Reuters in May the group would support a three-month global ceasefire proposed by the Untied Nations to help combat the coronavirus pandemic.

Jorge Valero, Venezuela's ambassador to the United Nations Office and other international organizations in Geneva, said the report was based on ""unfounded questioning"" meant to ""fuel the agenda of aggression that is unfolding against Venezuela.""
Valero said that Venezuela in August will receive Alena Douhan, the Office's Special Rapporteur on ""the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of human rights,"" who focuses on the impact of sanctions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Thomas Boone has spent 22 years as a police officer in Prince George's County, Maryland, a predominantly Black suburb of Washington, proudly wearing his uniform and driving his patrol car to coach kids' football and basketball teams.
Some of those athletes are now 18 to 20 years old, including his own son. They might have pursued careers in law enforcement, Boone believes, but the death of George Floyd has made that less likely due to the anger directed at police, particularly in Black communities
""When we go to the grocery store in town, we have to get stopped to be asked, 'Why do you all do this to us?'"", said Boone, a lieutenant. 
Floyd's killing by a white policeman in May has triggered fresh scrutiny of police brutality against African Americans. Black men are more than twice as likely to die in an interaction with U.S. police than white ones, a 2018 study https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-race-police-deaths/police-involved-deaths-vary-by-race-and-place-idUSKBN1KL2M4 showed. 
Some policing experts believe one way to address the crisis is to attract more Black Americans to law enforcement, and promote them to the top ranks. U.S. police forces remain generally whiter than the community that surrounds them, despite decades of attempts to reform. 
Whites accounted for 71.5% of the 701,000 sworn local police officers in the United States in 2016, Bureau of Justice Statistics data https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd16p.pdf show, compared to an estimated 60% of the population. African Americans account for 11.4% of local police forces, compared to around 13% of the population, a drop from 11.9% in 2013. 
The nationwide averages mask much bigger gaps in big cities, which are both less white and have more police per capita than many rural areas, suburbs, and small towns. 
Reuters spoke to more than a dozen former and current law enforcement officers, as well as criminal justice experts and families of police officers. Black representation in U.S. police forces has long been hampered by discrimination in hiring and promotion, they say, and some warn it could shrink further.
""George Floyd is such a ground-breaking situation. It is definitely going to affect the recruitment of minorities for a long time,"" said Sergeant Anthony Russell, a former recruitment supervisor who heads a Black officers’ advocacy group in Baltimore County, Maryland.
He and other Black officers said there are several reasons why the numbers of African Americans in the blue uniform are low, including application tests skewed against Black candidates, straightforward nepotism in the senior ranks and a lingering reluctance by Blacks to be part of a group that enforced segregation in the South decades ago.
FEDERAL EFFORTS 
The race gap in U.S. policing remains pronounced in big cities and districts, and among top ranks, despite years-long attempts to rectify it. 
Department of Justice (DOJ) data https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/lpd16p.pdf shows that 90% of the police chiefs in local departments and 81% of supervisors above sergeant were white in 2016 - compared to 4% and 9% African American, respectively
In New York City, 47.7% https://www1.nyc.gov/site/ccrb/policy/data-transparency-initiative-mos.page of uniformed officers are white and 15% Black, compared to 42.7% https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/newyorkcitynewyork and 24.3% of the population. Some 80% of officers are white in Baltimore County, compared to 57% of the population. 
U.S. law enforcement agencies stepped up efforts to recruit Black officers after Michael Brown, an unarmed Black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. 
A task force set up by former President Barack Obama recommended https://cops.usdoj.gov/pdf/taskforce/taskforce_finalreport.pdf reforms to rebuild trust, including improved diversity. The Trump administration shelved those efforts, and limited oversight https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/department-justice-announces-changes-collaborative-reform-initiative of local police departments in 2017. 
A DOJ spokesman said the Trump administration changes had no impact on pressure on police forces to hire more minorities. 
In 2019, the DOJ filed https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-employment-discrimination-lawsuit-against-baltimore-county-alleging a lawsuit against Baltimore County's police department, alleging race discrimination in entry-level hiring. It said the county had engaged in unintended employment discrimination by basing hiring decisions on exams that were not job-related and that disproportionately excluded African-American applicants. 
Baltimore County and its police force plan a comprehensive review of police hiring and recruitment and “county leadership strongly believes the police department must look like the communities it serves,” said Sean Naron, a spokesman for the county.
Across the country, Black recruits face nepotism, more problems during background checks, greater barriers to promotion and higher discipline rates once hired, according to Sonia Pruitt, head of the National Black Police Association and other police experts.
""We do not have a lack of qualified black and brown and female candidates, but they are vetted out during the background process, or at the academy, or during the field training program,"" Pruitt said. 
She said Black recruits are routinely weeded out for reasons that do not hold up white candidates.
But Roberto Villasenor, a Latino former police chief of Tucson and a member of the Obama-era task force on policing, said his department had struggled to find enough minority candidates and that he was not aware of any problems with disparate treatment during hiring by his force. 
White officers sometimes feel minority candidates received preferential treatment, he added. All the same, problems in hiring and retaining Black and brown officers remain and police departments need to become more diverse, he said.
""This has got to be one of the driving calls to come out of this and say, 'Okay, let's change the face of policing. Not just figuratively, but literally.'"" 
For Black officers, it can be a discouraging environment for a challenging job where complaints about discrimination can trigger retaliation, officers say. 
Boone, in Maryland, says he was moved to another job after collecting data on disproportionate rejections of minority candidates. ""I noticed that people who were Black or brown were getting disqualified,"" he said. ""I had the numbers, but they didn't want to listen."" 
Boone and 11 other minority officers filed a lawsuit in 2018 alleging systemic racism in his force. In June, the police chief named in the ongoing suit resigned.
Boone says he is encouraged by the increased attention to the problems he encountered on the force, but has counseled his own 19-year-old son to pursue a different career.
""Like any parent, would I like my son to follow my footsteps? Yes, I would. Would I like him to do better than me? Yes. I'm not completely sure this is the place for that reason."" 
""I DON'T WANT TO BE PART OF THIS""
Regina Holman worked for the Las Vegas police for 28 years, including four years as a recruiter.
After Floyd's death, Holman's 18-year-old grandson, whose stepfather is also a police officer, told her a career in law enforcement was not in his future. 
""He told me he will never be a cop. He has lost respect for the police because of the things that have happened,"" said Holman, president of the Nevada Black Police Association.
Michael Brown, a former Prince George's County officer who now trains police and security guards, said Floyd's death and later videos on social media of white police officers mocking the incident so shocked his students that some quit. 
""We actually shed some tears in here that very next day,"" Brown said of his classroom of about 10 students. ""I've had officers walk out and say, 'You know what, I don't want to be part of this.'""
Brown was fired from his force in 2016 for conduct unbecoming an officer, which he denies. He said he teaches his students that policing is a ""noble profession"" that allows officers to help their communities. But he also shares his own negative experiences on the police force and is part of the lawsuit against Prince George's County.

Despite everything, he says, he hopes to rejoin the force someday. ""I'm telling you right now, my best time in my life was being a Prince George's County police officer to deal with my community.'""

Street protests are the main form of opposition against government policies in Greece, a country still recovering from a deep socioeconomic crisis that erupted in late 2009 and led to three international bailouts on tough austerity terms.
As many as 3,500 members and supporters of Greece's communist party gathered in central Syntagma square to protest legislation now pending in parliament and which is expected to be put to the vote next week. 
Demonstrators held banners calling for the bill to be withdrawn, and others calling it an 'abomination'. 
The bill mandates the appointment of a rally organiser who will liaise with police and imposes restrictions on a demonstration if the number of participants is low. It also imposes penalties on people displaying violent behaviour, holding organisers legally responsible for any harm or damage caused by protesters.

""The aim of the bill is to put an end to the chaos created,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters earlier on Thursday, adding that there were 80 rallies in Athens in May.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Only one of Russia's 85 regions, a sparsely-populated patch of the Arctic known for reindeer herders, defied the Kremlin and voted against changes granting President Vladimir Putin the right to stay in power until 2036, results on Thursday showed.
The former KGB officer, who has ruled Russia for more than two decades as president or prime minister, handily won the right to run for two more six-year terms after the current one ends in 2024.
But in the remote Nenets Autonomous District, located 1,600 km (994 miles) northeast of Moscow, over 55% of 37,490 voters voted against the reforms, the only region to say ""nyet"".
Discontent there has been brewing for some time and its rejection appeared to be a protest vote designed to signal anger over a local issue.
Specifically, residents object to a plan put forward earlier this year by authorities to merge with neighbouring region Arkhangelsk, a move they believe would leave them poorer by stripping them of special financial support.
A memorandum outlining the plan was signed by the two regions' governors on May 13. A September referendum on the issue has since been cancelled but locals remain wary. 
""SIGN OF PROTEST""
""People voted (against the constitutional reforms) as a sign of protest ... They wanted to use this to get the attention of authorities in Moscow and to tell them that we live here too, that we have an opinion,"" Tatyana Antipina, a local businesswoman, said by telephone.
Antipina travelled to Moscow this week to deliver a petition to the Kremlin with over 15,000 signatures opposing the plan. 
Olga Bondareva, who voted no, said locals had been protesting the planned merger since May. 
""We held flash mobs every day, stood in solitary pickets, and on Saturdays we'd do protests driving in our cars, all so that our district authorities and deputies would hear us,"" Bondareva said in a chat over social media. 
In Volonga, a village with 32 registered resident voters, located on the coast of the Arctic Ocean, 17 people took part in the referendum and all voted ""no"".

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the region's voters had the right to vote against but were ""the absolute minority.""

1252,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",Slain Ethiopian singer electrified a generation with songs of freedom and protest,"By Ayenat Mersie and Kumerra Gemechu
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Imprisoned as a teenager for his political activism, singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa grew into one of Ethiopia's biggest stars and his songs became anthems for the young protesters who brought down one of Africa's most repressive regimes. 
Haacaaluu sang in the Oromo language of Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, but his lyrics - about yearning for freedom and exhorting Ethiopians to solve their own problems - touched a chord more broadly. 
His first album was released in 2009, after he had served five years in prison, where he wrote most of his songs, according to a profile in O Pride, an Oromo magazine. 
His second album two years later was a hit on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), but it was his single ""Maalan Jira?"" (What fate is mine?), released just before a wave of government-backed evictions began around the capital in 2015, that became a rallying cry. The song has been viewed more than 3 million times on YouTube. 
As the government wavered, in 2017 he released ""Jirra"", a defiant cry meaning ""We Are Here"" - that has become a greeting among Oromo youth. That December, he sung at a star-studded concert in the capital to raise money for displaced Oromo families. 
""Over the course of the Oromo protests between 2015 and 2018, it's impossible to really think of anyone who played such an important role in terms of galvanizing young people to come out to the streets and protest,"" said Awol Allo, senior lecturer of law at Keele University in England. 
""Today's ruling party and the prime minister would not have come to power if it were not for the immense contribution that Haacaaluu made to the Oromo protest movement.""
Over the next two years, the protests spread far beyond the Oromiya region, meeting a bloody response from security forces. Around 30,000 people were jailed, including activists, writers and opposition leaders. 
Eventually the prime minister resigned in February 2018 - unprecedented in Ethiopian history. Abiy Ahmed, whose father is Oromo, was appointed prime minister instead.
Abiy released the political prisoners, unbanned many political parties and promised free and fair elections. But some Oromo say they are still suffering government persecution - part of the region is under federal military control. 
""I did not know how to write lyrics and melodies until I was put behind bars,"" he told the British Broadcasting Corporation in 2017. ""Music is my life. It got me friends and foes. But it remains a tool that I use to speak for my people.""

Haacaaluu was shot dead in Addis Ababa on Monday by unknown gunmen and buried on Thursday at a church in Ambo, his home town about 100 km (60 miles) west of the capital.

DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (Reuters) - Bride-to-be Merve Kacar adjusted her gown, placed a crown on her head and added the finishing touch of a lace-trimmed white face mask as she prepared for her wedding in southeast Turkey after a three-month delay. 
The country allowed wedding halls, along with theatres and internet cafes, to open again from Wednesday as it wound down some of its last major coronavirus curbs in a bid to return life to normal and revive the economy.
But some restrictions remained. 
""There is no dancing without touching our families, and no gold ceremony,"" Kacar, said, referring to the custom where guests give coins to the couple.
""We are not happy about it but it's more appropriate this way,"" the 24-year-old told Reuters at her dress rehearsal in Diyarbakir, the southeast's main city. 
At a separate wedding in the city on Wednesday, the groom Serdal Aman felt more sanguine. ""We are feeling lucky in all this unluckiness. We were really lucky to get an appointment for the first day,"" he said. 
At the start of June, Turkey opened restaurants and cafes, and lifted weekend stay-home orders and inter-city travel bans. A subsequent doubling of daily coronavirus cases prompted President Tayyip Erdogan to warn the country had lost some ground in its battle with coronavirus.
Turkey has recorded more than 200,000 COVID-19 cases and 5,150 deaths, with new daily cases running around 1,300.
As Turks poured out into streets, parks, malls and vacation spots last month, Ankara made face masks compulsory in major cities. More measures could come even as officials have said there is no plan to slow momentum in the economy, which emerged in June from a near standstill since mid-March. 
Some 1,150 wedding halls in Istanbul were cleaned and prepared for the reopening, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported. 
New rules mean guests' temperatures are taken and sanitisers are used upon arrival. Tables are separated and everyone - including the bride and groom - must wear masks.
Biricik Kiziltas, a bridal gown designer, said she had responded by making a new line of masks with lace and other decorative touches. 

""Brides are already feeling sad, and they have no excitement, so we tried to make something to cheer them up,"" she said.

The dead elephants were first spotted months ago in the Okavango Panhandle region, and the authorities say they have since been trying to discover the cause. Poaching has been ruled out as the cause of death, as the carcasses were found intact.
""Three laboratories in Zimbabwe, South Africa and Canada have been identified to process the samples taken from the dead elephants,"" the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources, Conservation and Tourism said in a statement.
Elephants Without Borders (EWB), a conservation organisation, reported that its own aerial surveys showed that elephants of all ages appeared to be dying. The group counted 169 dead elephants on May 25, and another 187 on June 14.
""Several live elephants that we observed appeared to be weak, lethargic and emaciated. Some elephants appeared disorientated, had difficulty walking, showed signs of partial paralysis or a limp,"" EWB director Mike Chase said in a report reviewed by Reuters on Thursday.
""One elephant was observed walking in circles, unable to change direction although being encouraged by other herd members."" 
Chase said urgent action was needed to establish if the deaths were caused by disease or poisoning.
Africa's overall elephant population is declining due to poaching but Botswana, home to almost a third of the continent's elephants, has seen numbers grow to 130,000 from 80,000 in the late 1990s.
However, they are seen as a nuisance by some farmers, whose crops have been destroyed.

President Mokgweetsi Masisi lifted a five-year ban on big game hunting in May last year but the hunting season failed to take off in April as global travel restrictions meant hunters from many coronavirus-hit countries could not enter Botswana.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said Russians had shown how much they trusted President Vladimir Putin with a nationwide vote that gave him the right to run for two more terms, while people wondered on Thursday whether he really would stay on another 16 years.
Announcing final results of the week-long vote, officials said nearly 78% of voters had backed changes to the constitution allowing Putin, whose fourth term as president ends in 2024, to run for two more, back-to-back six-year terms. 
This means the 67-year-old former KGB officer, who has ruled Russia for over two decades as either president or prime minister, could be in power until he is 83.
An independent monitoring group said the vote was deeply flawed. But Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman, said the emphatic nature of the result was a measure of how deeply Russians trusted Putin to run the country.
""It's definitely considered a triumph. What took place was in effect a de facto triumphant referendum on trust in Putin,"" said Peskov.
Putin thanked voters for their support and trust. ""We need stability and time to strengthen the country,"" he said.
Golos, a non-governmental organisation that monitors elections, said it had recorded numerous irregularities during the vote, including ballot stuffing and widespread cases of employers forcing staff to cast a ballot.
Already the longest-serving leader in modern Russian history since Josef Stalin, Putin has said he has yet to decide on his political future, but wanted officials to avoid getting distracted by the question of who one day might succeed him.
NO WORTHY SUCCESSOR?
Public opinion on his intentions was divided on Thursday.
Some people said they were sure he would try to stay in the Kremlin for as long as he could while others predicted he would step down in 2024 but thought he wanted to keep his options open so as not to become a lame duck before then.
Evgeniy Somov, member of a patriotic organisation in the central Russian republic of Udmurtia, said Putin would not necessarily stay in power until 2036, describing the vote as a ""safety net"" in case no one emerges who could replace him.
""Running such a country is very difficult and apparently there is no worthy successor yet, or they are just not ready,” he said.
Others said they had no doubts at all that Putin would be staying in the Kremlin for many years to come.
“It is clear to everyone that Putin will run again until 2036. It was a scam as always,"" said Vyacheslav, a 61-year-old pensioner in the town of Belgorod.
Andrei Kolesnikov, an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Center think tank, said Putin had been unable to find a successor because he only trusted himself. ""Democracy is somewhere far ahead, after the next two terms,"" Kolesnikov told Reuters.
Putin's approval rating stood at 60% last month, still high but hovering around just above a two-decade low after slipping in April amid the coronavirus crisis and related economic pain, a poll by the Levada Center showed.
Opposition activists have called the vote illegitimate and said it was designed to legalise a Putin presidency-for-life.
Moscow resident Ksenia was one of several people who told Reuters she did not believe the official results. ""I think none of my friends took part in the vote, I think it is all a fake (the result). No one voted.""
Others were more upbeat.
""My attitude to the vote is very positive,"" said Yevgeny, a Moscow resident who said he had voted in favour of changing the constitution.

Only one of Russia's 85 regions, remote Nenets, was recorded as having voted against the constitutional changes amid discontent there over a plan to merge it with another region.

BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged European Union leaders to reach agreement on a multi-billion euro coronavirus recovery fund, calling for resolve and saying Europe was facing the most difficult situation in its history. 
Echoing Merkel's urgency as Germany took the helm of the bloc, the EU's chief executive Ursula von der Leyen joined the chancellor via video link to warn that the next six months were crucial after the region reacted slowly to the coronavirus and now faced a severe economic downturn. 
""We are clear where the difficulties are but we all know it would be good if we agree in July. If we need more time it would be a less good variant,"" Merkel said, also referring to plans for the new seven-year EU budget.
""There must be a deal in the summer, I cannot imagine any other variant so we will work very hard to show a sign of our resolve. We know that Europe is in the most difficult situation in its history,"" she told a news conference. 
With almost 35,000 deaths from COVID-19 recorded in Italy alone, lockdowns across most of the European Union have shuttered businesses, upended livelihoods and indebted governments as they seek to shield workers.
A Commission proposal for a 750 billion euro ($843.08 billion) rescue fund has been largely welcomed by EU leaders but must still be agreed, and fiscally conservative northern countries led by the Netherlands are loath to see their taxpayers pay for grants to southern European states.
""In such times, solidarity is a test,"" Merkel said, in a veiled reference to frustration across Italy and Spain, the EU countries most affected by the novel coronavirus and which have questioned the value of the union in the crisis.

Trudeau and his family are based in a large house on the grounds of Rideau Hall, the residence of Governor General Julie Payette, the official representative of head of state Queen Elizabeth. Rideau Hall sits on an 88-acre (0.35 square km) wooded estate.
""At approximately 6:40 this morning (1040 GMT), an armed man was able to access the grounds ... the Prime Minister and the Governor General were not present at the moment of the incident,"" the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said on Twitter.
""The man was arrested shortly after without any incident. He is currently in custody and is being interviewed,"" it added, saying criminal charges were pending.
A spokesman for Trudeau confirmed that the 48-year-old prime minister was not at home at the time. Trudeau, who is married with three children, also has access to a summer house about 22 miles (35 km) northwest of Ottawa.
Unlike the United States, where four presidents have been assassinated since 1865, there is almost no history of serious political violence in Canada.
The one exception was in 1970, when a radical group seeking independence for Quebec kidnapped the Canadian province's deputy premier and later killed him.

Trudeau donned a bulletproof vest for an election campaign rally in October last year after officials detected a security threat.

SAGYIN, Myanmar (Reuters) - The fine white dust that shrouds much of his northern Myanmar village also covers sculptor Chin Win as he leans over a half-finished Buddha statue.
""We are blessed to carve Buddha,"" he said at his stone workshop surrounded by the seven white hills that give Sagyin village its name, which means ""marble"" in Burmese.
For generations, artisans in this part of Buddhist-majority Myanmar have carved out a living from the marble, fashioning mostly colossal Buddha statues to be sold in the nearby city of Mandalay or exported to neighbouring China and Thailand.
(Click https://reut.rs/2BjaSWE to see a picture package of Sagyin.)
Many of the several thousand villagers here earn a modest living from the marble mines, hauling the slabs down the hill, carving them into statues, or exporting them overseas.
Burmese marble, which ranges from pure white to bluish grey, is prized for its hardness and texture. A 45-tonne slab can sell for $40,000. In Sagyin, specks of the stone are used for everything from brushing teeth to washing clothes.
""We grew up breathing the dust,"" said Chin Win, 35, who has been carving statues since he was 11 years old. ""We use it as toothpaste, for soap powder, lipstick.""
'NOT SAFE'
The stone used to be chiselled by hand. Now, much of the work is done with machines.
""I was born in this village and for generations this is what we have done: the men work on marble carving and the women work in the marble mines or polish the marble statues,"" said 25-year-old Mya Lay, in a house fashioned from dry bamboo sheets, with a floor made of marble chippings.
For years, she has walked down from the mines from morning till sunset carrying large marble slabs on her head, laborious work for about $3.50 per day.
""If I could I would leave the village and find a job in the city,"" she said, adding that she wanted a better life for her daughter.
Some fear the clouds of dust that cloak the village could make them sick. Inhaling marble dust in other contexts has been linked to silicosis, a serious lung disease that can be deadly.
Few workers wear masks or other protective clothing, and several nursed rasping coughs, although they said the coughing could also be the result of smoking.
Kyi Khaing, a workshop owner, said most residents are too poor to worry about their health.
""I think the marble dust is not safe, but most people here only focus on survival, rather than their healthcare,"" he said. 
NEW CHALLENGES
A bigger worry is the impact of the novel coronavirus, which originated in China late last year and has since spread globally, infecting more than 10.4 million people. 
Myanmar has reported only 299 cases of the virus, and six deaths, but trade with China, which buys most of Sagyin's statues, has been hit.
The closure of the border between the two countries has meant Kyi Khaing, 49, has been unable to export his wares. 
""The finished products are just sitting still,"" he said. ""I haven't been able to deliver them anywhere. The buyers stopped coming as well.""
Still, Kyi Khaing thinks some things in Sagyin will remain constant.

""I believe until I die we will still have marble here,"" he said. ""Anywhere you dig, there are marble stones.""

The miners were collecting stones in the jade-rich Hpakant area of Kachin state - the centre of Myanmar's secretive jade industry - when the ""muddy wave"" crashed onto them, after heavy rain, the fire service department said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
By late afternoon rescue workers had recovered 126 bodies, the department said, but more were missing.
""Other bodies are in the mud,"" Tar Lin Maung, a local official with the information ministry, told Reuters by phone. “The numbers are going to rise.”
Deadly landslides and other accidents are common in the poorly regulated mines of Hpakant, which draw impoverished workers from across Myanmar in search of gems mostly for export to China. But Thursday's accident was the worst in over five years. 
About 100 people were killed in a 2015 collapse which strengthened calls to regulate the industry. Another 50 died in 2019.
Many of those killed are freelance ""jade pickers"" who scour tailings - the residue from mining - for gemstones overlooked by larger operators. One good piece of jade, worth tens of thousands of dollars, could transform their lives.
Video footage on social media showed frantic miners racing uphill to escape as a towering pile of black waste cascaded into a turquoise lake, churning up a tsunami-like wave of mud.
Photos showed rows of dead bodies laid out on a hill, covered by tarpaulin.
In a statement posted online on Thursday evening, the armed forces commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, said military officers would continue the rescue efforts.
'RUN, RUN'
Maung Khaing, a 38-year-old miner from the area who witnessed the accident, said he was about to take a picture of the precarious waste mound he felt looked set to collapse when people began shouting ""run, run!""
“Within a minute, all the people at the bottom (of the hill) just disappeared,” he told Reuters by phone. “I feel empty in my heart. I still have goose bumps...There were people stuck in the mud shouting for help but no one could help them.”
Than Hlaing, a member of a local civil society group helping in the aftermath of the disaster, said those killed were freelancers scavenging the waste left by a larger mining firm.
She said about 100 people were still missing and 30 had been hospitalized.
A local official had warned people not to go to the mine on Thursday because of the bad weather, she said.
“There’s no hope for the families to get compensation as they were freelance miners.” 
The government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi pledged to clean up the industry when it took power in 2016, but activists say little has changed.
Official sales of jade in Myanmar were worth 671 million euros ($750 million) in 2016-17, according to data published by the government as part of an Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
But rights group Global Witness says the trade is worth billions of dollars a year, funds it says fuel armed conflict between government troops and ethnic Kachin rebels fighting for greater autonomy for the region. 

In a statement, the group called Thursday's accident a ""preventable tragedy"" and said the Suu Kyi's administration had failed to implement promised reforms to curb ""illicit and rapacious mining practices"". A government spokesman did not answer phone calls by Reuters seeking comment.

The court in Saint Petersburg said Vladimir Neyelov had admitted to selling information linked to how the Federal Security Service, the successor agency to the Soviet-era KGB, trains and retrains its operational staff. But, it said, Neyelov did not consider the data classified. 
The trial was held behind closed doors because of what the court said was its classified nature, and details of the case have not been made public. The court did not name the German consulting company. 
Prior to his arrest in 2018, Neyelov had written about private military contractors and worked for two think tanks including one called the Centre for the study of strategic outlooks, Russia's Kommersant newspaper said. 
Russia has been accused by the United States of using Russian private military contractors in for instance Libya to conceal its role there. Moscow says any Russian mercenaries there do not represent the Russian state's interests.

LONDON (Reuters) - All pupils in England will be expected to return to school in September as part of government plans unveiled on Thursday, which include dividing students into separate groups to limit the spread of COVID-19.
At present, only some students in certain year groups and the children of key workers are at school, depending on the area and set-up. 
'BUBBLES'
Schools will be asked to maintain distinct student groups, known as bubbles, which strive to not mix with pupils in other bubbles. They could be the size of a class or a year group. 
This makes it easier to pinpoint who needs to self-isolate if there is a positive case and will keep that number to a minimum, the education ministry said. 
Officials acknowledge younger children will not be able to maintain social distancing and that could be challenging for everyone when using shared facilities such as dining halls, toilets and playgrounds. 
IN CLASS
Seating arrangements should be changed so pupils are all facing forwards rather than face-to-face.
OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM 
Assemblies involving more than one group of pupils should be avoided. Use of staff rooms will need to be minimised. 
STAGGERING START TIMES 
Schools should consider asking pupils in different ""bubbles"" to follow separate start and finish times but break times and free periods may be cut to ensure this does not reduce teaching time.
IF THERE IS A POSITIVE CASE
Small groups of students and staff may need to self-isolate for up to 14 days. If there are two or more cases in a two-week period, a greater number of pupils might have to stay home.
FINES FOR NON-ATTENDANCE 
""Unless there is a good reason for absence, then we'd be looking at the fact that we would be imposing fines on families,"" education minister Gavin Williamson said on Monday. 
RESPONSE FROM NATIONAL EDUCATION UNION (NEU)

""The practical difficulties involved in arranging this separation of year group bubbles are immense and will not be possible in many schools,"" said NEU Joint General Secretary Kevin Courtney.

PERUWELZ, Belgium (Reuters) - Residents of a Belgian retirement home are able to soothe the pain of social distancing measures imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic by embracing their loved ones through a 'hug curtain'.
Staff at the Jardins de Picardie nursing home near the French border installed the large plastic curtain on June 14 and it has proven very popular with the residents, who had not been allowed any visitors for 11 weeks.
Lili Hendrickx, an 86-year old resident of the home, said the curtain was ""the most beautiful invention"" she had ever seen.
""It's terribly emotional for me,"" she said, adding that she cried the first time she was able to hug her daughter again.
""The feeling you get when you are close to someone like that, I felt like the heat was passing through.""
Visitors were equally enthusiastic.
""The fact that you can meet your loved ones again, it's a real pleasure, especially physically and emotionally, it feels good,"" said Amandine Josefiak, 35, who had come to visit her father at the home.
The curtain, decorated with flowers and bright colours, is made of a big plastic sheet with two pockets on each side where residents and visitors or staff insert their arms.
After each use, nurses carefully disinfect the plastic curtain.
""Due to the coronavirus and this social distancing we all suffered a lot from the lack of affection,"" Marie Christine Desoer, the director of the home, said.
""We know it will last for a while, we don't know where we're going with this virus...""
Belgium imposed its lockdown on March 18 to halt the spread of COVID-19 but has now started to relax the restrictions.
The disease has so far claimed 9,761 lives in Belgium, a country of 11 million, one of the highest fatality rates per capita in the world.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam's foreign ministry has lodged a complaint with China over military drills in the South China Sea that it said were ""detrimental"" to Beijing's relationship with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Vietnam and the Philippines warned of growing insecurity in Southeast Asia at a regional summit last Friday, amid concerns that China was using the cover of the coronavirus pandemic as a means to step up its activity in the disputed waterway.
On Wednesday, China began five days of drills in waters near the Paracel Islands, where Vietnam has competing claims, according to a June 27 announcement by the Maritime Safety Administration of Hainan, a large provincial island off China's southern coast. 
""China's drills around (the Paracels) seriously violate Vietnam's sovereignty"", foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told a regular briefing on Thursday. 
The drills ""further complicate the situation, and are detrimental to the relationship between China and ASEAN,"" she added. 
Hang said Vietnam had contacted China and delivered a diplomatic note opposing the drills.
""We request that China refrain from repeating similar actions in the South China Sea,"" she said. 
The United States has also called on China to stop its ""bullying behaviour"" in the South China Sea, and accused Beijing of using the COVID-19 pandemic as cover to push its territorial claims there with a surge in naval activity. 

In early April, Vietnam said one of its fishing boats was sunk by a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel. China said that Vietnam's claims in South China sea are illegal and ""doomed to fail"".

A Turkish court on Thursday heard a petition seeking to convert the massive sixth century building, originally built as a Christian cathedral and today one of Turkey's most visited tourist sites, back into a mosque.
The court will announce its verdict within 15 days, a lawyer said.
""Hagia Sophia is a world heritage monument... Many countries, culminating in the intervention of the U.S State Department, highlighted this very point, urging Turkey not to take steps which would create a huge emotional chasm between the Christians of the world and Turkey,"" Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told a news briefing.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday urged Turkey to let Hagia Sophia, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, to remain a museum and to ensure it remains accessible to all.
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual head of some 300 million Orthodox Christians worldwide and based in Istanbul, said converting it to a mosque would disappoint Christians and would ""fracture"" East and West.
Completed in the year 537 in what was then Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine empire, Hagia Sophia was the biggest cathedral in Christendom for 900 years before becoming a mosque after the city fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453.
It was converted into a museum in 1934 under the founder of the modern secular Turkish republic, Kemal Ataturk, but the case before the court challenges the legality of this step.

President Tayyip Erdogan, a pious Muslim, has lent his support to turning Hagia Sophia, called Ayasofya in Turkish, back into a mosque.

The theatre, whose stage is underpinned by bright yellow pillars and is decorated in the light blue of the national flag, was opened in 1967 and closed in 1991 as the Horn of Africa country plunged into civil war.
Clan-based warlords blasted each other with anti-aircraft guns as they fought over the theatre, which they used as a base. Its roof collapsed a year into the conflict.
It reopened in 2012 after African Union and government troops beat back the al Shabaab insurgents from the capital, but was blown up two weeks later.

He said security forces would protect the theatre and even the new coronavirus would not deter them from putting on shows.
President Mohammed Abdullahi joined a choir on stage during a ceremony to mark the official opening last week.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested a 24-year-old man at the city's airport early on Thursday on suspicion of stabbing an officer during protests against a new national security law imposed by Beijing on the financial hub.
The arrest followed the latest protests on Wednesday in which police fired water cannon and tear gas and arrested more than 300 people as demonstrators defied the sweeping security legislation introduced by China to snuff out dissent.
There were no signs of protests on Thursday.
Police posted pictures on Twitter from Wednesday's disturbances showing on officer with a bleeding arm saying he was stabbed by ""rioters holding sharp objects"". The suspects fled while bystanders offered no help, the police said.
A police spokesman said the arrested man was surnamed Wong but could not confirm whether he was leaving Hong Kong or working at the airport. 
Media, citing unidentified sources, said the suspect was on board a Cathay Pacific flight to London due to depart just before midnight. A witness said three police vehicles drove towards a gate as a Cathay Pacific plane was preparing to take off and about 10 riot police ran up the bridge to the aircraft.
The suspect held an expired British National Overseas passport, a special status which provides a route to citizenship, the source told the Cable TV station.
Cathay Pacific did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Wednesday that a bounty of HK$500,000 ($64,513) would be offered to anyone helping catch the fugitive.
China's parliament adopted the security law in response to protests last year triggered by fears that Beijing was stifling the city's freedoms and threatening its judicial independence, guaranteed by a ""one country, two systems"" formula agreed when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
Beijing denies the accusation.
Hong Kong and Beijing officials have said the law is vital to plug holes in national security defences exposed by the protests, pointing to the city’s failure to pass such laws by itself as required under its mini-constitution, the Basic Law. 
Another unfulfilled constitutional requirement for Hong Kong is to introduce universal suffrage, the protesters' main demand.
DIPLOMATIC TENSION
The new law punishes crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison. It will also see mainland security agencies in Hong Kong for the first time and allows extradition to the mainland for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party.
Ten of the arrests made on Wednesday involved violations of the new law, police said, with most of the 360 or so others involved illegal assembly and other offences.
In the latest diplomatic tension over the law, China said Britain would bear all consequences for any offer to Hong Kong citizens of a path to settlement.
China also denounced the United States after the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation that would penalize banks doing business with Chinese officials who implement the national security law in Hong Kong.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the United States ""must stop advancing the bill, let alone sign it or implement"" it. [L1N2E82R1]
Democratically ruled and Chinese-claimed Taiwan advised its citizens to avoid unnecessary visits to or transit through Hong Kong, Macau or mainland China. Britain and Canada have also updated their travel advisories for Hong Kong, warning their citizens of detention risks.
Apparently seeking to allay fears that judges for national security cases would be cherry-picked by Hong Kong's unpopular, pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma said they would be appointed on the basis of judicial and professional qualities, rather than politics.

Hong Kong's independent judiciary, one of many freedoms guaranteed when it returned to Chinese rule, has long been considered key to its success as a global financial hub.

French President Emmanuel Macron has said that alienating Russia was ""a profound strategic mistake"" and wants Moscow’s help to solve the world’s most intractable crises, while reducing the distrust between Russia, NATO and the EU.
He sent his defence and foreign ministers to Moscow in September, ending a four-year freeze on such high-level diplomatic visits, and appointed a special envoy to make progress on a so-called five-point structured dialogue that he proposed to President Vladimir Putin.
""If the question is: have there been concrete results in the dialogue that France initiated with Russia, I'll answer sincerely that it is still not the case,"" Parly told a European parliament hearing.
Macron's efforts have upset other EU governments, particularly those in the east that escaped Moscow's orbit after the Cold War. They say little has changed to merit a thaw in relations on ice since Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014.
Parly said Russia's role in Libya, where it has supported eastern fighters against the Tripoli government, was also a threat to the European Union. 

""We aren't happy about this role ... but in our efforts to reach a ceasefire in Libya, we need to talk with Russia. Libya isn't the only domain where that discussion is necessary, she said.""

OSLO (Reuters) - The Swedish border town of Stromstad is paying a heavy price for Sweden's decision not to lock down its economy like neighbouring Norway and other Nordic nations to halt the spread of COVID-19.
Stromstad is just a two-hour drive from Oslo and popular with Norwegians who shop for cheaper consumer goods in Sweden, but Norway's lockdown, imposed in mid-March, put a stop to that.
And now, though Norway has lifted its lockdown following a sharp fall in COVID-19 cases, it still quarantines people returning from Sweden, which has registered more than four times the combined number of deaths in Norway, Denmark and Finland.
""When Norway closed its borders, (Stromstad) went overnight from full activity to total stillness,"" said Kent Hansson, the town's mayor.
""The border retail trade, it is (still) completely dead. The large supermarkets close to the border are completely deserted.""
Sweden kept most businesses and schools open when the COVID-19 pandemic struck, bucking the international trend.
With a population of 10.2 million, Sweden has so far reported 5,370 COVID-19 deaths, while Norway - population 5.3 million - has had only 251 deaths. 
NORDIC COOPERATION DENTED
Sweden's sudden isolation from its neighbours has come as something of a shock.
Nordic citizens have been able to travel without passports across the region and to reside in each other's countries without permits since the 1950s, creating deep personal, business, cultural and other ties across national borders. 
""I do think that Nordic cooperation has taken a hit,"" said Hansson. 
Norwegians back their government's approach, with almost three out of four people not wanting restrictions for leisure travel to Sweden to be lifted yet, according to a June 5 poll among 1,200 people by the Opinion survey group.
Some Swedes who work in Norway, which they have been able to do during the lockdown, have felt treated differently.
""People took a step back when I started to speak,"" said a Swedish artist who travels to Norway for work, and who declined to give his name to avoid drawing attention to himself. ""So I didn't talk much when I was out in the shops. I nodded.""

""You feel a bit dirty as a Swede. You feel a bit of shame for coming.""

Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers over articles its Mail on Sunday newspaper printed last year which included parts of a handwritten letter she had sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in August 2018.
Markle and his daughter have not spoken since he pulled out of appearing at her wedding to Harry three months earlier after undergoing heart surgery and following news he had staged photos with a paparazzi photographer. 
The Mail justified publishing the letter by saying five unnamed friends of Meghan, who gave birth to Archie in May 2019, had put her version of events in interviews with the U.S. magazine People. 
""The Claimant had become the subject of a large number of false and damaging articles by the UK tabloid media, specifically by the Defendant, which caused tremendous emotional distress and damage to her mental health,"" her lawyers said in a submission to the High Court.

""As her friends had never seen her in this state before, they were rightly concerned for her welfare, specifically as she was pregnant, unprotected by the Institution, and prohibited from defending herself.""

Anti-racism protesters demonstrating in the port city of Bristol in western England in the wake of the killing of George Floyd in the United States pulled down the statue of Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour.
""A 24-year-old man was ... arrested on suspicion of criminal damage and has since been released under investigation,"" Avon and Somerset Police said in a statement. 
Colston had made a fortune from trading in West African slaves and his statue had long been a contentious issue in Bristol. The memorial has since been retrieved from the water, and the mayor said it would displayed in a museum alongside Black Lives Matter placards.
After the incident, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said he understood people's strong feelings on the issue but removing the statue was a criminal act.
The tearing down of Colston's statue led to other memorials being taken down or their future being debated, while many academics and public figures voiced opposition to the removal of such monuments, arguing they merely reflected history and should be used as points of discussion.

Taiwan has complained in recent months of repeated Chinese air force patrols near it, in some cases crossing into Taiwan-controlled airspace. In April, a Chinese naval flotilla led by the country's first aircraft carrier passed near Taiwan.
China claims the democratic island as its own territory, and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing's control. Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by China.
The drills, in a coastal area facing the sensitive Taiwan Strait, simulated fending off an attempted landing by enemy forces, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said. 
They involved Taiwan's most modern fighter jet the F-16V, Apache (NYSE:APA) attack helicopters, tanks and artillery, which fired live rounds, the ministry added, showing pictures of plumes of water in the sea where ordinance had hit their targets.
The drills were aimed at improving the military's effectiveness at ""enemy annihilation on the shore"" and to ""prevail along the coastline"" to stop an enemy invasion, it said.
Taiwan later this month holds its main annual Han Kuang military exercise, which was postponed from earlier this year due to the new coronavirus.
Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped, mostly with U.S.-made weapons, and President Tsai Ing-wen has made boosting the island's defences a top priority since she first won office in 2016.
However Taiwan faces an increasingly formidable and far larger Chinese military, which has been undergoing its own modernisation programme, adding stealth fighters, aircraft carriers and anti-satellite missiles.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 02, 2020 04:14AM ET</span>",Russians grant Putin right to extend his rule until 2036 in landslide vote,"By Andrew Osborn and Vladimir Soldatkin
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russians opened the door to Vladimir Putin staying in power until 2036 by voting overwhelmingly for constitutional changes that will allow him to run again for president twice, but critics said the outcome was falsified on an industrial scale. 
Official results published on Thursday, after 100% of ballots had been counted, showed that the former KGB officer who has ruled Russia for more than two decades as president or prime minister had easily won the right to run for two more six-year terms after the current one ends in 2024. 
That means Putin, 67, could rule until the age of 83.
The Central Election Commission said 77.9% of votes counted across the world's largest country had supported changing the constitution. Just over 21.2% had voted against, it said.
Ella Pamfilova, head of the commission, said the vote had been transparent and that officials had done everything to ensure its integrity. 
Opposition politician Alexei Navalny had a different view and called the vote an illegitimate and illegal show designed to legalise Putin's presidency for life.
""We'll never recognise this result,"" Navalny told supporters in a video.
Navalny said the opposition would not protest for now because of the novel coronavirus pandemic, but would do so in big numbers in the autumn if its candidates were blocked from taking part in regional elections or their results were falsified.
""What Putin fears most is the street,"" said Navalny. ""He... will not leave until we start to take to the streets in the hundreds of thousands and in the millions.""
Russians had been encouraged to back Putin's power move, described by critics as a constitutional coup, with prize draws offering flats and an ad campaign highlighting other constitutional amendments in the same reform bundle, such as pensions protection and a de facto ban on same-sex marriages.
One-off payments of 10,000 roubles ($141) were transferred to those with children at Putin's order as people headed to polling stations on Wednesday, the last day of the vote, held over seven days to try to limit the spread of the virus.
Moscow resident Mikhail Volkov said he'd voted in favour of the reforms. ""We need radical changes and I'm for them,"" he said.
'READ SOMETHING AND VOTE'
Others were less enthusiastic.
""I didn't read about the amendments if I'm honest,"" Lyudmila, another voter, said. ""What's the point of voting if they've already decided for you. It's like that in our country - read something and vote. I voted.""
Turnout was 65%, election officials said. 
Putin, already the longest-serving leader in modern Russian history since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, made no mention of how the changes could affect his own career in an eve-of-vote speech on Tuesday.
He has said he has yet to decide on his future. Critics, who liken Putin to a latter-day Tsar, say they are sure he will run again, but some analysts say he may want to keep his options open to avoid becoming a lame duck.
At 60%, according to the Levada pollster, his approval rating remains high but well down on its peak of nearly 90%.
With Russia reporting thousands of new COVID-19 cases each day, opponents have been unable to stage protests but have mocked the vote online, sharing photographs of polling stations in apartment stairwells, supermarket trolleys and the boot of a car.
A small group of activists staged a symbolic protest at the Red Square on Wednesday afternoon, using their prostrate bodies to form the year 2036 before being swiftly detained by police, TV Rain reported. 
Separately, the ""No! Campaign,"" called on supporters to head for Moscow's Pushkinskaya Square after voting.
""We need to remind the authorities that we exist and that there are tens of millions of us who do not want Putin to rule until 2036,"" Andrei Pivovarov, an activist, said in a video.
In the event, only dozens turned out amid a heavy police presence, a Reuters reporter said. Opposition politicians said a couple of hundred had attended. Those who did chanted ""Russia will be free."" Another slogan suggested Putin should resign.
Golos, a non-governmental organisation that monitors elections, cited numerous irregularities with the vote and said it would not be able to confirm the outcome as legitimate.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Security was high in Ethiopia's Ambo town on Thursday for the funeral of singer Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, whose killing earlier this week sparked two days of protests that killed more than 80 people. 
A farewell ceremony began with well-wishers laying wreaths in Ambo stadium. 
""Haacaaluu is not dead. He will remain in my heart and the hears of millions of Oromo people forever,"" said Santu Demisew Diro, his wife. ""I request a monument erected in his memory in Addis where his blood was spilt.""
A live broadcast showed that the numbers of people in the stadium were sparse. Police were turning people away from the stadium, said one Ambo resident who tried to attend but met crowds of people who had been told to return home. Members of the military, federal police and regional police were out in force, he said. 
""It is very sad that his body is accompanied by only a few people and security forces are keeping many others away,"" one of Haacaaluu's relatives, who had been allowed to attend the funeral, told Reuters. 
The Ethiopian singer, who was shot dead in the capital Addis Ababa on Monday by unknown gunmen, will later be laid to rest at a church in his home town of Ambo, about 100 km (60 miles) west of Addis. 
The killing of the popular singer sparked protests in the capital and surrounding Oromiya region that have killed more than 80 people so far.
Haacaaluu's songs provided a soundtrack to a generation of Oromo protesters whose three years of anti-government demonstrations finally forced the unprecedented resignation of the prime minister in 2018 and the appointment of the Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. 
The Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, have long complained of exclusion from political power. In recent months, some Oromo activists who initially supported Abiy have become more critical, accusing him of not protecting the interests of the Oromo people. 

The service was being broadcast by Oromo Broadcasting Network, which is owned by the Oromiya regional state.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Starved of the travel experience during the coronavirus lockdown? One Taiwanese airport has the solution - a fake itinerary where you check in, go through passport control and security and even board the aircraft. You just never leave.
Taipei's downtown Songshan airport on Thursday began offering travelers the chance to do just that, with some 60 people eager to get going, albeit to nowhere.
Around 7,000 people applied to take part, the winners chosen by random. More fake flight experiences will take place in coming weeks.
""I really want to leave the country, but because of the epidemic lots of flights can't fly,"" said Hsiao Chun-wei, 38, who brought her young son.
The passengers got boarding passes, and proceeded through security and immigration before boarding an Airbus A330 of Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines, where flight attendants chatted to them.
""I hope the epidemic ends soon so we can really fly away,"" said a 48-year-old woman who gave her family name as Tsai.
The airport is using the event to show off renovations completed while passengers have stayed away, and show people what coronavirus-prevention steps they are taking.
Songshan usually has flights to Tokyo, Seoul and several Chinese cities, and is also an important domestic hub.
Taiwan has emerged relatively unscathed from the pandemic thanks to early and effective prevention steps, but has largely closed its borders since mid-March. It has advised citizens against overseas travel unless absolutely necessary.
With fewer flights operating, passenger numbers have plummeted 64% in the first five months of 2020 compared with the same period last year, according to the government.
Still, in one bright spot, internal travel is booming. 
Taiwan's two main domestic carriers - China Airlines unit Mandarin Airlines and Eva Air's Uni Air - have added extra capacity over the summer to Taiwan's sun-soaked offshore islands and rugged east coast.

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian police set up suburban checkpoints in coronavirus hotspots in Melbourne on Thursday and were considering using drones to enforce stay-at-home orders as authorities struggled to contain new outbreaks in the country's second-largest city.
More than 1,000 police set up posts around 36 suburbs, which returned to lockdown after a spike in new infections.
While the rest of Australia opened state borders and loosened social distancing restrictions, Melbourne's state of Victoria promised to fine those in the affected zones that breached curbs on non-essential movement.
Victoria reported 77 new cases, up slightly from the previous day and in line with weeks of double-digit daily increases.
The state government has also commenced an inquiry into enforcement of hotel quarantine for people returning from overseas amid worries some new infections came from people who had dodged the mandatory two-week isolation.
""I'm obviously concerned about the outbreak, and I'm pleased that the premier has taken the action he's taken by putting in place the lockdown for the outbreak in those suburbs,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in a televised news conference, referring to the Victorian state government.
""We have seen some levelling (in new cases) although they remain at elevated levels and that is of concern and that means as the lockdown now is in place, we would hope to see those numbers fall again.""
Victoria police commissioner Shane Patton promised a heavy presence in ""high-volume public places"" and said police may even use drones to track down people travelling for reasons other than work, school, healthcare and grocery shopping.
""People will not know where we will be, they will not know how long we'll be there for, but they'll be intercepted,"" he said.
Australia has fared better than many countries in the pandemic, with around 8,000 cases and 104 deaths. However, the recent jump in Victoria has stoked fears of a second wave of COVID-19, echoing concerns expressed in other countries.
Most states have said they will reopen their internal borders except to Victoria. Neighbouring New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state, has kept its border open except to people arriving from the targeted Victorian suburbs. 
A director at Phat Milk cafe in Melbourne's Travancore, one of the affected suburbs, said the sudden return to lockdown had left him with a kitchen full of food.
""What do you do with that stock? You have to close the kitchen because it's takeaway,"" said the director, who gave only his first name, Hach.
""From four to six staff, you only have one staff on. It is hard, but you just got to find the passion, the drive, and be a bit creative and hang in there.""
WEAK LINK
The Victorian outbreak has raised concerns about the efficacy of the state's quarantine procedures.
In neighbouring New South Wales, supermarket chain Woolworths Group (AX:WOW) put 50 staff at a Sydney store into isolation after a worker tested positive to the virus despite clearing a mandatory two-week quarantine in Victoria, authorities said.
Meanwhile, remote Northern Territory reported its first infection in two months after a traveler who had entered the country via Melbourne and completed quarantine showed symptoms after returning to his home territory.
""People will be anxious hearing this news ... but we have measures in place to protect our community (and) these measures have been followed,"" Northern Territory Health Minister Natasha Fyles told reporters.
The infected person, aged in their 30s, has been isolated in hospital, she added.
Globally, coronavirus cases exceeded 10 million on Sunday, a major milestone in the spread of a disease that has killed more than half a million people in seven months.

Police in the city in Guanajuato state said the unidentified attackers also shot and wounded seven people in what was the second attack at an Irapuato rehab center in the past month.
Photos from the scene shared by police with reporters showed at least 11 prone and bloodied bodies in a room.
Police said in a statement that three of the wounded were in grave condition, and that the facility was not formally registered. 
Social media videos following the incident showed ambulances on site and several dozen people described as relatives of the victims clustered on the street.
Guanajuato's Attorney General Carlos Zamarripa said he had designated a specialized team to investigate the killing, which he called a ""cowardly criminal act,"" while Governor Diego Sinhue called for a joint effort from federal and state authorities to tackle violence.
The attack was one of the worst mass slayings since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office 19 months ago pledging to reduce record levels of violence. But homicides hit a new record last year and are trending higher still in 2020. 
Guanajuato, a major carmaking hub, has become one of the principal flashpoints of criminal violence in Mexico, ravaged by a turf war between the local Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
According to federal data, Guanajuato registered 1,405 homicides this year through May, more than any other state. 
On June 6, gunmen opened fire at a different addiction rehab center in Irapuato, killing 10 men. Rehab centers are known to have been targeted by criminal gangs waging battles for control of the drug business.

At least 26 people were killed in an arson attack by suspected gang members on a bar in the southern port of Coatzacoalcos last August.

BOA VISTA (Reuters) - Soldiers handed out masks to barefooted Yanomami indigenous people including body-painted warriors carrying spears and bows and arrows on Wednesday on the second day of a military operation to protect isolated tribes from COVID-19.
The Yanomami are the last major isolated people in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest where dozens of indigenous communities have been infected with the latest disease to come from the outside to threaten their existence.
""It's all under control. We detected no cases here,"" Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo, a retired army general, told reporters at a frontier post called Surucucu on the border with Venezuela.
Azevedo said the death of two Yanomami purportedly shot by illegal gold miners on the vast reservation was an isolated case that is being investigated by the federal police.
A gold rush that has brought an estimated 20,000 gold prospectors to invade the Brazil largest reservation has poisoned rivers and destroyed forest, and the Yanomami say the miners have brought the novel coronavirus. 
Indigenous leaders appealed to the Supreme Court on Wednesday to order the federal government to protect isolated tribes by barring outsiders from reservation lands and expelling illegal poachers, loggers and wildcat miners said to bring fatal diseases.
The indigenous umbrella organization APIB asked that invaders be removed, with the deployment of military forces if necessary, from the reservations of the Yanomami, Karipuna, Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau, Kayapó, Arariboia and Munduruku peoples.
APIB said 405 indigenous people had died of COVID-19 by June 27, with 9,983 infected among 112 different tribes.   
In Surucucu, Yanomami families with mothers carrying their bundled infants were frightened at first by the arrival of the medical personnel and supplies of protective equipment and medicine in roaring military helicopters.
The men fumbled the mask as they covered their faces painted with red body paint from tress barks.
""The indigenous health service (Sesai) is good for us, they help us so we came to ask for help to see if we are well,"" said a Yanomami elder through a large white face mask. ""We walked four hours to arrive here,"" he said through an interpreter.
Nurses took temperatures and rapid COVID-19 tests.
""When we arrived they were a little bit afraid, observing us from afar, but then we started gaining their trust, they came closer and all went well,"" said Brazilian Air Force medic, Lieutenant Fernanda Ribeiro. 

""They ended up liking the care. It has been so rewarding!""

1288,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 08:45PM ET</span>",What Hong Kong Losing Its ‘Special Status’ Would Mean,"(Bloomberg) -- Under the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. treats Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous part of China with its own legal and economic system, differently than the Chinese mainland in trade, commerce and other areas. President Donald Trump has begun stripping away that “special status” to punish China for moves to tighten its grip on the city after a year of pro-democracy street protests. At its most extreme, that could mean the global financial hub being treated the same as any other Chinese city -- a seismic shift that could harm both economies at an already difficult time. China has already begun retaliating.
1. Is the special status gone?
It’s going. On May 27, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo notified Congress that the Trump administration no longer regarded Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China. On June 29, Commerce Secretary William Ross said the special status had therefore been revoked.
2. What’s been the impact?
In an opening salvo, Pompeo announced visa restrictions against unspecified Chinese officials; China did the same against Americans. Pompeo said the U.S. would also cease selling defense equipment to Hong Kong, a largely symbolic act that will mostly affect the city’s police and corrections forces. The Commerce Department made it harder to export sensitive American technology to Hong Kong by suspending special treatment in areas including export license exceptions; Hong Kong’s leader said the impact would be “minimal.” More far-reaching measures could follow. The city is still treated differently from the the mainland when it comes to tariffs, for instance.
3. Why so slow?
It’s up to Trump to decide how quickly he wants to move while he’s also threatening consequences for China over its handling of the coronavirus and its repression of minorities in Xinjiang province. Hurting China also carries additional risks for the U.S. economy, including the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump had considered one of his biggest achievements, which could affect his odds of winning re-election. Trump has made harsh comments but hasn’t threatened specific punishments for the Beijing government.
4. What’s at stake for Hong Kong and China?
While Hong Kong remains a key gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the country’s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China’s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and has made a much lower priority of making the yuan an international currency. Nonetheless, the city still matters. Hong Kong’s open capital account and adherence to international standards of governance are unmatched by any mainland Chinese city and make it an important base for international banks and trading firms. Revoking the special status would be “the nuclear option” and “the beginning of the death of Hong Kong as we know it,” said Steve Tsang, director of the University of London’s SOAS China Institute.
5. And their financial markets?
One worst-case scenario: if the U.S. treats Hong Kong no differently than any other Chinese city, why wouldn’t ratings firms and investors do the same? It’s a question posed by  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn), which noted that S&P Global Ratings has Hong Kong three notches above China while Moody’s and Fitch have Hong Kong one notch higher. The risk is that China’s own rating gets lowered in coming years and drags Hong Kong’s with it. At the same time, equity index providers may take a fresh look at Hong Kong, which is currently in the MSCI World Index with other developed markets. China is in the emerging market index, raising the question, should Hong Kong be treated the same as Shanghai and Shenzhen?
6. What about for the U.S.?
It has its own reasons for not rocking the boat too much. Hong Kong, the only semi-democratic jurisdiction under Chinese rule, offers U.S. companies a relatively safe way to access the Chinese market and employs a U.S. dollar peg, linking it with the American financial system. According to the Congressional Research Service, the largest U.S. trade surplus in 2019 was with Hong Kong — $36 billion. Hong Kong counted 278 U.S. companies with regional headquarters in the city that year and another 457 with offices. Hong Kong’s first justice minister after the handover to China in 1997, Elsie Leung, told the South China Morning Post in May that any damage would be mutual: “We are not just getting the benefits – it’s a free-trade arrangement which is good for both sides.”
7. How has China responded?
Despite the U.S. action, Chinese lawmakers approved new national security legislation for Hong Kong anyway. The Foreign Ministry has promised unspecified retaliation against what it terms foreign interference, insisting Hong Kong is purely an internal affair. China said last year it would sanction some U.S.-based activist groups including the National Endowment for Democracy, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, and suspend port visits by U.S. Navy ships to Hong Kong. The official Xinhua News Agency has dismissed as “groundless” accusations about the loss of freedom or human rights issues in Hong Kong. It also noted that the 2018 Human Freedom Index compiled by the Fraser Institute, a Vancouver-based think tank, ranked Hong Kong at No. 3, well ahead of the U.S. at No. 17.
8. And Hong Kong?
The city’s leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, has defended the national security law (as has Li Ka-shing, Hong Kong’s richest tycoon). Lam also has said it would be “totally unacceptable” for foreign legislatures to interfere in Hong Kong’s internal affairs, and that sanctions would only complicate the problems in the city. (Lam was selected in 2017 by a committee of 1,200 political insiders overwhelmingly loyal to the Chinese government.) She has sought to reassure investors that the city still adheres to the rule of law and has an independent judiciary. She also has defended police actions.
9. Is this what the protesters have been seeking?
As a largely leaderless movement, the Hong Kong protests have made no official request for international assistance. But some prominent activists including Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong called on Trump to hit China hard with sanctions, even to the point of revoking the city’s special trading status. Wong had testified last year in Washington in favor of the bill, seeking to put pressure on China. On the streets of Hong Kong, some protesters have made clear their interest in U.S. support by waving American flags, singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” and calling on Trump to “liberate” Hong Kong.

Security forces in Burkina Faso and neighbouring Sahel nations are on the offensive against jihadi militants linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State, who have carried out attacks and stoked inter-communal conflicts.
Rights groups have warned abuses are rampant in the region as national armies track suspected militants.
""Following a military operation carried out on June 29 in the locality of Boumoana, near Tanwalbougou, seven bodies of individuals who were shot dead were reportedly discovered by the residents in the outskirts of the town,"" the ministry said.
It added that those responsible would be held accountable.
In May, a prosecutor launched an investigation after 12 people died during the same night in detention cells, hours after they were arrested for suspected terrorism-related offences in the same area.
Concerns over several reports of right abuses prompted European Union and Sahel states leaders to warn during a security summit on Tuesday that any of their troops found guilty of human rights abuses against civilians would be punished severely.

The drugs ""belonged to drug trafficking structures associated with the Gulf Clan organized armed group,"" it said, and were to be received by other criminal groups in Central America and Europe.
Potential production of pure cocaine hydrochloride in Colombia rose 1.5% last year to 1,137 metric tonnes, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime said last month, even as the areas planted with primary ingredient coca decreased.
Despite decades of anti-narcotics efforts, Colombia remains one of the world's top cocaine producers.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers earlier on Wednesday detained a shipment originating in Xinjiang of hair products and accessories suspected of being forced labor products made with human hair, the agency said in a statement. 
The products, part of a shipment of almost 13 tons of hair products worth over $800,000, indicated potential human rights abuses of forced child labor and imprisonment, the statement said. 
""The production of these goods constitutes a very serious human rights violation, and the detention order is intended to send a clear and direct message to all entities seeking to do business with the United States that illicit and inhumane practices will not be tolerated in U.S. supply chains,"" Brenda Smith, a senior Customs and Border Protection official, said in the statement.
The U.S. Commerce Department last month added seven companies and two institutions to an economic blacklist for being ""complicit in human rights violations and abuses committed in China's campaign of repression, mass arbitrary detention, forced labor and high-technology surveillance against Uighurs"" and others.
China's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Chen Xu, told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva on Wednesday that Beijing categorically rejects what he called ""groundless accusations against China on the Hong Kong and Xinjiang issues"" made by some countries due to political motives.

SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle authorities moved on Wednesday to dismantle a protest zone that the city's police chief derided as ""lawless and brutal"" and which had prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to call for action against demonstrators. 
Officers, clad in helmets and extra protective gear, entered the ""autonomous zone"" early and by midmorning had arrested 31 people for failure to disperse, assault and other alleged crimes, according to the police department's Twitter feed.
Police moved to retake the zone after Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan declared the gathering around the police department's East Precinct and Cal Anderson Park an ""unlawful assembly,"" the police chief, Carmen Best, said in a statement that highlighted a recent spate of shootings and the deaths of two teenagers.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr commended Best in a statement for distinguishing between the right to protest and violent crime in ""restoring the rule of law."" Barr did not mention Durkan, a Democrat who has been a target of the Republican president's ire.
Harry ""Rick"" Hearns, a protester who said he volunteered to provide armed security at CHOP for 24 straight days, told Reuters he supported the police crackdown ""1,000 percent."" He blamed the violence on outsiders who he said had marred an otherwise successful monthlong occupation.
""We don't represent violence. People brought that to us,"" said Hearns, 59.
Police were walking in and out of the East Precinct on Wednesday, re-establishing control. Weeks earlier, they abandoned the building following clashes with protesters in the wake of the May 25 killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of that city's police. 
Floyd's death triggered a nationwide wave of largely peaceful demonstrations against racial injustice and police brutality, giving rise in Seattle to the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP) zone east of downtown.
""The CHOP has become lawless and brutal. Four shootings -- two fatal -- robberies, assaults, violence and countless property crimes have occurred in this several-block area,"" Best said.
Trump has been demanding that local authorities eject the protesters, whom he labeled ""domestic terrorists."" Conservative pundits have pointed to the zone in Seattle to support an argument that protests across the country were less peaceful than they were being portrayed.
Black armored vehicles and baton-wielding officers patrolled the perimeter of the area that was barricaded with spray-painted plywood, some marked with phrases like ""All Lives Don't Matter Until Black Lives Matter"" and ""RIP E Precinct.""
Bicycle police employed three dozen bikes to create a barricade at East Pike and 12th Avenue, allowing city crews to take down protesters' tents. Some officers sipped Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX)' coffee, evidence the operation had met no serious resistance.
The zone had become less crowded and active over the past several days. Crowds that came by the thousands to listen to speeches about police brutality and marvel at street art commemorating Black lives had disappeared, as had medic stations and multiple free food tents.
Businesses in the area, a trendy neighborhood of hipster bars and boutiques, have been pushing for a tougher stance by authorities. Attorneys have filed two class action lawsuits against the City of Seattle, including one aimed at preventing the establishment of ""lawless autonomous zones"" in the future. 
Lencho Williams (NYSE:WMB), who was roused by police from the CHOP encampment on Wednesday, said protesters would regroup. He said the movement had become disorganized when three original demands -- defund the police, fund the Black community and amnesty for demonstrators -- morphed into 12.

""We're going to be back. If not tomorrow, the next day. You can't stop a revolution. Black lives matter now and forever,"" said Williams, 32.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican labor attorney and independent union leader Susana Prieto was released from jail on Wednesday after her arrest nearly a month ago on charges of inciting violence at a workers protest, state prosecutors said.
A judge's order for her release came hours after the July 1 start of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal, according a statement from the attorney general's office of the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
Prieto's release was contingent on her paying 66,000 pesos ($2,911) for damages and her agreement to not travel abroad for the next 30 months, the statement said. She was also ordered to reside at her home in nearby Chihuahua state.
Prieto is still charged with crimes against public servants, including threats and inciting a riot linked to a worker protest outside a labor board in the city of Matamoros last March. 
She has denied the charges.
U.S. union leaders and Democratic lawmakers had called for her release ahead of the start of the new regional trade deal, fearing her detention was a warning sign of Mexico's challenges in meeting its labor obligations.
One of the USMCA's central aims is to improve labor rights and union independence in Mexico.

According to the June survey of 820 respondents by Mexican newspaper El Financiero, the leftist leader's approval rating slipped to a low of 56% from 60% in May.
That was well down from a peak of 83% scaled in February last year, soon after Lopez Obrador took office in December 2018, pledging to bring down record levels of violence and lift growth in Latin America's second-biggest economy.
Instead, Mexico slipped into a moderate recession last year and homicides have risen higher still on Lopez Obrador's watch. The coronavirus pandemic has hit Mexico hard, and forecasters expect the economy to shrink by 10% or more this year. 
Two years since his landslide election victory in July 2018, some 51% of respondents polled said Lopez Obrador was meeting his pledges, while 44% said he was not.
Assessments of his performance on the economy, security and tackling poverty were far more negative. Fully 65% of those polled said he was doing poorly on the economy with only 20% of the opposite view. On poverty, the negative scores outweighed the positive by 60% to 22%, and on security it was 63% against Lopez Obrador versus 23% in favor.
Still, Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday he is satisfied with his administration's work and optimistic for the future.

""The results are good, in spite of everything,"" he told reporters at his daily news conference.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government will investigate allegations that officials at state power firm the Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) signed fraudulent contracts with private energy companies, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Wednesday.
The contracts were signed before the leftist president took office. He had already ordered formal complaints to be drawn up alleging fraud by mostly foreign power companies that produce electricity from renewable sources. So far, he has given no evidence for his allegations. 
Lopez Obrador said some annexes to agreements under which private companies supply power to CFE included unfair rates. He gave no details for the contracts which he said were signed several years before he took office in late 2018. 
""Formal accusations are being prepared in order to proceed against those responsible,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference, referring to CFE officials and owners of private companies. He said he is open to a dialogue.
CFE and the sector's regulator Cenace recently announced changes to the rules that govern the electricity market, some of which have been suspended pending a Supreme Court ruling.
Critics argue these have put up obstacles to private firms and mean higher distribution costs for them.
""It's not just a legal or court matter, it's a matter that has to do with public morals, that has to do with corruption,"" Lopez Obrador said.
So far, Lopez Obrador has focused much of his criticism on Spanish company Iberdrola (OTC:IBDRY), a major investor in Mexico.

Gutierrez published a celebratory post on the two-year anniversary of the election victory of her husband President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in July 2018.
Responding to her post, Twitter user Jose David Guerra asked: ""When will you personally attend to the parents of children with cancer? Thank you for your kind response.""
Gutierrez responded, ""I'm not a doctor, maybe you are. On you go, you help them,"" in a tweet that has since been deleted but was seen by Reuters and widely retweeted.
Gutierrez, who was trending on Twitter, then made her own account private, according to Mexican media reports.
The office of the president declined to comment on the row, which threatened to take some of the shine off Lopez Obrador's celebration of his landslide win's anniversary. A representative for Gutierrez could not immediately be reached for comment.
A shortage of medicines to treat cancer in children drew negative headlines for Lopez Obrador earlier this year as his government tried to overhaul the health system.
Images of sick children and distraught parents criticizing the government from crowded hospital wards damaged his reputation and ate into his popularity.
Gutierrez has been a strong defender of her husband, and has come under fire frequently from critics on social media.
The row sparked a trending hashtag #LaBrujaDelPalacio (The Witch of the Palace), referring to the National Palace, site of the president's offices and residence. Supporters of the first lady denounced the attacks, saying she deserved respect.

Lopez Obrador himself rarely shies away from conflict with adversaries. His critics and defenders have attacked each other vigorously on Twitter since he took office in December 2018.

(Reuters) - The Vatican, in a highly unusual move, summoned both the U.S. and Israeli ambassadors to express the Holy See's concern about Israel's moves to extend its sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank.
A Vatican statement on Wednesday said meetings with Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican's secretary of state, and U.S. Ambassador Callista Gingrich and Israeli Ambassador Oren David, took place on Tuesday.
A senior diplomatic source told Reuters that Parolin met the two envoys separately, a detail which was not clear in the Vatican statement.
It said Parolin, the Vatican's top diplomat, expressed ""the concern of the Holy See regarding possible unilateral actions that may further jeopardize the search for peace between Israelis and Palestinians, as well as the delicate situation in the Middle East"".
Israeli leaders decided in May that cabinet and parliamentary deliberations on extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, in coordination with Washington, could begin as of July 1.
But with no agreement with Washington yet on the modalities of the move under a peace proposal announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January, and talks with the White House still underway, no cabinet session was scheduled for Wednesday.
The Vatican statement reiterated its position in support of a two state solution, saying ""Israel and the State of Palestine have the right to exist and to live in peace and security, within internationally recognised borders.""
The Vatican appealed to Israelis and Palestinians to do everything possible to reopen the process of direct negotiations on the basis of U.N. resolutions.

Palestinians seek the West Bank for a future state. In a show of Palestinian unity, some 3,000 people in the Gaza Strip, including members of the mainstream Fatah party and the rival Hamas group that runs the enclave, protested against annexation.

Mali has been in political turmoil since a disputed legislative election in March. The lead-up to the poll was marred by allegations of vote buying and intimidation and the kidnapping of opposition leader Soumaila Cisse.
Thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Bamako twice in June to demand the immediate resignation of Keita saying he had been unable to resolve Mali's numerous crises, while corruption and economic hardship have flourished.
Choguel Kokala Maiga, a leader of the M5-RFP opposition coalition, on Tuesday presented a nine-point proposal that included the appointment of a prime minister by the opposition. 
""He (the prime minister) could not be dismissed by the president,"" Maiga said, adding that the prime minister should be able to appoint his government and other senior officials in the administration, justice, armed forces and security departments. 
Among the group's proposals are the dissolution of the national assembly, a transitional legislative body, the renewal of members of Mali's highest court, and a government of national unity. 
Their proposal would effectively curtail Keita's powers to that of a ceremonial head of state. Keita, 75, was re-elected in 2018 for a second five-year term.
His government has offered concessions, including a unity government, while mediators from the regional body ECOWAS have proposed new legislative elections in disputed constituencies. These have been rejected by the opposition.
Concerns about Mali's political instability are growing. 
The West African nation has struggled to regain stability since a 2012 military coup, and an uprising by Tuaregs in the north that was hijacked by jihadist fighters.

The United Nations, which has thousands of peacekeepers in the country, has called for calm and dialogue. At a Sahel security summit on Tuesday, France, EU and regional leaders called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis.

Elected last December, Tebboune has already urged protesters to opt for dialogue and promised appeasement measures to ensure stability in the OPEC member and gas-exporting country.
He has also drafted amendments to the constitution to boost freedoms and give Parliament a greater role. A referendum over the amendments is due to be held later this year.
The pardon, which marks the 58th anniversary of Algerian independence, included six activists serving sentences for charges including undermining national unity. Several other members of the protest movement, known as Hirak, have been in detention.
The protests broke out in February 2019 to demand political reforms and reject Bouteflika's plan to seek a fifth term after 20 years in power.

The authorities banned the protests in mid-March this year as part of measures to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - At least 118 members of the Colombian army have been investigated since 2016 for alleged involvement in sexual abuse against minors, the head of the army said on Wednesday, amid accusations of sexual violence by soldiers against young girls.
Of the 118 soldiers and army officials, 45 were fired, while the remaining 73 are facing criminal and disciplinary investigations by the attorney general and procurator's offices, General Eduardo Zapateiro told a virtual news conference.
The army has ""zero tolerance"" for sexual abuse by those within its ranks Zapateiro said, referencing figures from an army review going back four years.
Seven soldiers were arrested last week for alleged sexual abuse of an indigenous girl in Risaralda province. All seven men and three of their superiors have been fired, while two higher-up officials have been re-assigned.
Another case - that of a young girl allegedly sexually abused by various soldiers while being held at an army site in jungle Guaviare province for several days without food or water - emerged over the weekend.
Zapateiro denied a systematic effort to protect army members implicated in acts of sexual violence against minors and said all soldiers receive human rights training.
""No Colombian soldier is trained within the institution to attack the human rights of boys, girls or adolescents,"" he said.
""I will not tolerate any type of conduct distant from ethical principles, moral values and good customs,"" Zapateiro said. ""There are no second chances.""
The general did not specify how many cases the 118 officials are involved in or discuss allegations of sexual harassment made by women soldiers in recent months.
The Colombian army has 240,000 members and leads the country's fight against leftist guerrillas and crime gangs founded by former members of right-wing paramilitary groups.

The army has long been accused by victims and human rights groups of rights violations during Colombia's more than five decades of internal conflict.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will respond strongly if it is confirmed that Russia paid Taliban-affiliated militants to kill U.S. and allied soldiers in Afghanistan, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Wednesday, without providing details.
President Donald Trump has been under pressure since a New York Times report on Friday that a Russian military intelligence unit offered such bounties and a later report that he received a written briefing on the matter in February.
O'Brien and other aides tried to quell controversy over what Trump knew and when he knew it, saying that a senior CIA civil servant decided not to brief Trump verbally ""because she didn't have confidence in the intelligence.""
He declined to say whether Trump got anything in writing.
""These are important allegations that, if they're verified I can guarantee you the president will take strong action. We've been working for several months on options,"" O'Brien told reporters outside the White House, though he added Washington may never know the truth of the matter because of media leaks.
After Trump over the weekend said he was not briefed on the matter, the White House said Trump was not ""personally"" briefed but did not address whether he had received a written report, read it, and why he had not responded more aggressively if so.
The shifting statements have generated controversy among his fellow Republicans as well as Democrats and the suggestion that Trump may have ignored or not known about a threat to U.S. troops could damage him as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3.
Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat from West Virginia who received a classified briefing on the matter on Tuesday evening, said in a statement that if Trump ""was briefed on this and did nothing, not only did he fail our service members but he broke his oath to protect and defend the constitution.""
Four U.S. government sources have confirmed to Reuters that credible intelligence suggested Russia offered such bounties. A fifth person familiar with the matter said such intelligence was first brought to the White House's attention around March 2019 but was then uncorroborated and may have been ""disinformation.""
U.S. and European investigators strongly suspect the unit of the GRU Russian military intelligence agency accused of targeting U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan using Taliban-linked militants is the same unit that was implicated in the poisoning of Russian intelligence defector Sergei Skripal in Britain, according to four sources familiar with intelligence reporting.
One of the four said other U.S. agencies had largely discredited reporting by the National Security Agency which had challenged the intelligence accusing Russia of targeting U.S. troops in Afghanistan. 
O'Brien on Wednesday said Trump has now been briefed on the Russian bounty reports, but declined to provide details.
Democrats and a leading Republican hawk, Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, on Tuesday called on the president to consider imposing new economic sanctions on Russia if the information was confirmed. 
Trump has tried to deflect criticism by saying the intelligence was not conclusive enough to be brought to his attention, and by calling news reports ""fake news.""
""I was never briefed because any info that they may have had did not rise to that level,"" he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday.

Democratic lawmakers have asked for more in-depth briefings on the issue. O'Brien said the Gang of Eight - congressional leaders and intelligence committee lawmakers - would be briefed by intelligence officials. A congressional source said this was expected on Thursday.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The office of Switzerland's top prosecutor on Wednesday defended its record as an independent enforcer of Swiss law after a Financial Times report about international scrutiny of Attorney General Michael Lauber and concerns about his independence. 
The FT reported on Wednesday that senior U.S. and European politicians had written to the Swiss government to express concerns over Lauber's connections to Russia.
Lauber's links were highlighted this month when a former aide was convicted by a federal appellate court of accepting benefits from Russian authorities, with Lauber's own conduct subjected to scrutiny during the hearings.
Lauber's office found itself in the position of having to file charges against the man from its own ranks.
After Wednesday's FT report, Lauber's office said in an emailed statement that all its investigations were conducted on a legal basis, not the basis of personal or political ties. 
Lauber himself did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. A spokesman for the federal government also did not heed a request for comment. 
Concerns over Russian ties are only the latest headache for Lauber, who last month became the first national official since modern Switzerland's founding in 1848 to undergo an impeachment process, relating to a separate investigation into corruption in world soccer. The impeachment proceedings, launched by a parliamentary panel in May, remain ongoing.
The Financial Times said that U.S. and European politicians were especially concerned about Switzerland's handling of a graft scandal linked to the death of Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Moscow jail in 2009, after court revelations that one of Lauber's ex-aides, who was involved in the investigation, had been accepting gifts from Russian prosecutors.

Lauber's office said it was responsible for handling several legal assistance requests from Russia, some of which had been executed and some of which were still being carried out.

Bars, karaoke venues and massage parlours were in the latest category of businesses allowed to reopen - with conditions - now that Thailand has gone 37 days since recording any local transmission of the virus.
It meant a return to work for some of the hundreds of thousands of people in the nightlife industry who have been struggling to survive.
""I lost all my income,"" said Bee, a 27-year-old dancer who goes by her stage name at the XXX Lounge in the Patpong district.
""I'm glad that I can come back to work in a job that I'm good at. I'm OK with the mask because it's one of the precautions.""
All customers have their temperature taken. They must give a name and telephone number. Inside, everybody must sit at least one metre (yard) apart and two metres from the stage.
British expatriate Michael Theo was among those who questioned the need.
""You can take a BTS (train) in the morning with 200 people on a packed train but then you can come into a bar and still have to sit 2 metres apart,"" he said.
Thailand has staggered the reopening of public places over several weeks. Schools also resumed on Wednesday.
Cockfighting and fishfighting venues remain closed.
The coronavirus has killed 58 people out of 3,173 infections, a relatively low number even within the region.
But Thailand's economy is forecast to sink further than any other in Southeast Asia with the number of foreign tourists expected to drop 80% this year.

The government-aligned Supreme Court in June appointed a new National Electoral Council (CNE) ahead of the vote to elect new lawmakers to the National Assembly, which the opposition has held for the previous five-year period.
The electoral board will meet later on Wednesday to approve a final date, the director, Rafael Simon Jimenez, told reporters. 
The main opposition coalition, led by Guaido, who is the National Assembly's current president, does not recognize the Supreme Court's rulings as legitimate and says it will boycott the vote unless Maduro's administration demonstrates it will be free and fair.
As evidence the elections will not be fair, the opposition has pointed to a recent court ruling ousting the leaders of two key opposition parties and replacing them with politicians accused of being shadow allies of the ruling Socialist Party.
Any loss of control of the parliament would complicate the standing of Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela's rightful leader by dozens of Western countries due to his position. Guaido and allies accuse Maduro of rigging his 2018 re-election.

The involvement of South Africa in vaccine trials is intended to ensure the continent will have access to an affordable vaccine and not be left at the back of the queue.
About 50 people held protests at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, saying they did not want Africans to be used as guinea pigs, reflecting concerns among some on the continent over testing drugs on people who do not understand the risks.
""I'm not happy at all! I mean this feels like the 1980s all over again when the AIDS pandemic just broke out in South Africa,"" said 29-year-old graphic designer Tebogo Legoale.
Some of the placards carried by demonstrators read: ""We are not guinea pigs.""
Twenty-nine-year-old community activist Walter Mashilo said the vaccine should be tested first on members of parliament and ministers' children, not on poor people.
""We are clear, comrades, we don't want this vaccine (trial),"" he said, addressing the crowd.
South Africa has the highest rate of infections on the continent, with confirmed cases at over 150,000 and more than 2,600 deaths.
Traditional healers are also fighting for their medicine to be used against the virus instead of a vaccine. 

""We are not going to follow a vaccine because we as healers believe that our traditional medicine is not given a chance,"" said Sellwane Mokatsi, 32-year-old compliance officer, who is also part of the traditional healers' organisation.

A statement attributed to union election commission chairman Hla Thein and read out during an evening broadcast by Myanmar Radio and Television said a ""multi-party general election for the parliament"" would be held on that day.
The polls are seen by analysts as an important test of Myanmar's transition away from direct military rule.
Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi won power in a landslide in 2015 that ended decades of junta rule.
But her administration has come under pressure internationally over a military crackdown that drove hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims into Bangladesh in 2017.
At home, while Suu Kyi remains overwhelmingly popular, her government has struggled to match sky-high expectations and has had to rebut criticism over escalating fighting with ethnic armed groups and slower-than-expected economic growth.
The army continues to wield enormous power under the constitution, which guarantees it control over key ministries, and 25 per cent of seats in parliament.
Monywa Aung Shin, a senior member of the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) party and editor of its journal, told Reuters by phone the party would compete in all constituencies across Myanmar and was developing its list of candidates.
""Just like in 2015, we do believe that we will win a landslide,"" he said.
A spokesman for the major opposition, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, could not be reached for comment by Reuters.
While the NLD is expected to do better than others in the election, analysts say its large majority could be dented.
""There is greater disaffection with the NLD today, especially among minority ethnic communities,"" said Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based political analyst with the International Crisis Group.

""But Aung San Suu Kyi remains extremely popular with her base - the Bamar majority in the centre of the country - and it is difficult to see any outcome other than another NLD landslide.""

Hashtags demanding a ban on LGBT activities and a boycott by shoppers of companies expressing solidarity have been trending on Twitter since Sunday, celebrated worldwide as Pride Day. 
On Sunday, Kerem Kinik, chair of the Red Crescent Society of Turkey, said he would ""fight against those who violate healthy creation"". His tweet drew a rebuke from the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), the movement's international network.
In response, Fahrettin Altun, a top aide to President Tayyip Erdogan, tweeted: ""LGBT propaganda poses a grave threat to freedom of speech. The IFRC became complicit in that attack by targeting (Kinik) — a doctor who devoted his entire life to protecting children around the world. We won't be silenced!""
Kinik said he was referring to paedophilia, not sexual orientation. ""There is nothing in my tweet targeting any specific group or any identity, any race, any gender or sexual orientation,"" he told Reuters. 
Erdogan joined the debate by saying on Monday that an assault on traditional values of the society was under way, without specifically addressing homosexuality.
""Some people insidiously attack our national and moral values by normalizing perversions that have been condemned throughout history and aim to poison young minds,"" he said, calling on Turks to confront ""any type of perversion forbidden by our God, and those who support them"".
Turkish fashion designer and LGBT activist Barbaros Sansal said people were being made to ""pay the bill"" for opposing Erdogan and demanding human rights such as freedom of speech. 
""If you are pro-regime, and pro-Erdogan, you can be a homosexual. But if you are opposition, you are sin,"" Sansal told Reuters.
In April, Erdogan had defended Ali Erbas, the head of the state's religious affairs directorate, after he said homosexuality caused disease and corruption. Prosecutors opened probes into bar associations that accused Erbas of inciting hatred.

A report published in June by the Istanbul-based advocacy group SPoD, showed that discrimination and violence due to sexual identity and orientation doubled in the 45 days following Erbas' remarks.

In Yemen, Houthi-run Al Masirah TV reported coalition air strikes on the capital Sanaa, Marib, al-Jouf, al-Bayda, Hajjah and Saada provinces on Wednesday.
The coalition, which has been battling the Iran-aligned movement for five years, will hold a news conference on the operation against Houthi targets that aims to neutralise its military capabilities, Al-Ekhbariya channel and Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV said.
Last week, Houthi fighters fired missiles that reached the Saudi capital Riyadh in the first such assault since a six-week ceasefire prompted by the coronavirus epidemic expired in late May. The coalition said it intercepted the attack.
The alliance intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.
The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court will open the trial on Friday of 20 Saudi officials indicted over the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a step his fiancee hopes will shed more light on the death and reveal where his body was hidden.
The indictment by Istanbul prosecutors accuses the former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence, Ahmed al-Asiri, and former royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani of instigating ""premeditated murder with monstrous intent"", the prosecutor's office said in March.
It says 18 other defendants carried out the killing by suffocating Khashoggi, who had grown increasingly critical of Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. All 20 defendants are expected to be tried in absentia.
The October 2018 attack at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul prompted widespread revulsion, damaged relations between Ankara and Riyadh, and tarnished the prince's international image. Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, have said they believed he ordered the killing - an accusation Saudi officials denied.
Khashoggi was last seen entering the consulate seeking documents for his impending wedding. Turkish officials said his body was dismembered and removed from the building. His remains have not been found.
""I hope this criminal case in Turkey brings to light the whereabouts of Jamal's body (and) the evidence against the killers,"" his fiancee Hatice Cengiz, who was waiting for him outside the consulate on the day of his killing, told Reuters.
It was not clear whether Saudi Arabia would cooperate with Friday's hearing. The Saudi government media office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
In December a Saudi court sentenced five people to death and three to jail for Khashoggi's killing after a largely secretive trial. Khashoggi's family later said they forgave his murderers, paving the way for their formal reprieve.
Cengiz said neither the trial nor the pardon followed due process. ""No one can take the 'trial' that took place in Saudi Arabia legitimately; it was done in secret and the individuals sentenced are unnamed,"" Cengiz said. 
Turkey has accused Saudi officials of obstructing investigations, while Riyadh repeatedly said the Istanbul prosecutor has not complied with requests to share information.

Prince Mohammed has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto leader. Saudi Arabia initially denied any involvement in or knowledge of Khashoggi’s death but later changed its position multiple times.

1318,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 10:36AM ET</span>","Iraq Seeks IMF Loan, Saudi Investments to Boost Oil-Battered Economy","(Bloomberg) -- Iraq is in talks with the International Monetary Fund for a loan and is seeking Saudi investments in its natural-gas fields, as Baghdad tries to bolster its battered economy in the face of the coronavirus and low energy prices.
The IMF and Iraq are in “intensive” negotiations about a loan that would probably be a maximum of $5 billion, Ali Allawi, the OPEC member’s finance and deputy prime minister, said in an interview in Baghdad on Tuesday night. He didn’t specify if Iraq wanted a rapid credit facility, which would come with few strings attached, a conditional line or both.
“There is no formal proposal from the Iraqi government and there is no formal response from the IMF, but we are moving in that direction,” he said.
Saudi Arabia has expressed interest in Iraqi gas projects, Allawi said. Iraq’s government has proposed that the Saudis put money into the gas field of Akkas in the west or Mansuriya in the east. They could also invest in capturing gas from the southern oil deposit of Ratawi, according to Allawi.
“Saudi Arabia has a high readiness to back our energy projects,” he said. “At the end of the day, they will pick one field. They are also interested in solar energy.”
Allawi, who traveled to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in late May, ruled out getting budgetary support from either country. Iraq still owes Kuwait about $2 billion in reparations for invading it during the Gulf War of 1990-91, and has sought debt relief in the past.
The IMF and Saudi talks come as Iraq tries to shore up its finances. The economy will probably contract 7% to 9% in 2020, Allawi said. That’s more than the IMF’s forecast of 4.7%.
Riyadh is pressing Iraq to cut oil production sharply to meet its OPEC+ quota, adding more pressure on Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, who came to power in May. Baghdad initially refused to curb output as much as other OPEC+ members, but relented after intense lobbying from Saudi Arabia and Russia.
Iraq exported about 3.32 million barrels a day of crude last month, down 7% from May, according to Bloomberg tanker tracking. Still, that would have left only 275,000 barrels daily for domestic refineries if it was to meet its overall production cap for June of 3.59 million barrels. Last month, Iraq kept 600,000 barrels a day for its local market.
The production quota was agreed between the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and their partners in April.
Iraq’s monthly oil revenue is around $2.7 billion, Allawi said. That’s down from $7 billion in 2019.
The budget deficit will hit 22% of gross domestic product this year, higher than anywhere else in the Middle East and North Africa, according to the IMF. The government will not issue new Eurobonds to fund the gap because it would be too expensive, according to Allawi.
Yields on the nation’s $1 billion of notes maturing in March 2023 dropped almost 60 basis points on Wednesday after the news of the potential IMF loan. But at 9.54% they’re still the highest of any Eurobond issuer in the Middle East aside from Lebanon, which is in default.
“We’re not ready to pay 10%,” Allawi said.

Turkey's ambassador to France Ismail Hakki Musa had earlier told French senators that Paris was withdrawing after the investigation into the incident had been inconclusive and did not back Paris' claims.
Ties between NATO allies France and Turkey have soured in recent weeks over Libya, Northern Syria and drilling in the eastern Mediterranean.
France has been especially angry after accusing Turkish warships of being aggressive towards its Courbet warship after it tried to inspect a vessel in June that it suspected was violating a United Nations arms embargo on Libya. The Courbet was operating in the NATO Sea Guardian operation.
NATO opened an investigation after France protested during a meeting of alliance defence ministers in June.
An official from the French Armed Forces Ministry said a letter had been sent to NATO on Tuesday outlining four demands: a reaffirmation by alliance members of their commitment to respecting the embargo, ensuring NATO call signals were not used by countries during national missions, better coordination between NATO and EU missions enforcing the embargo and putting in place mechanisms to avoid similar incidents in the future.
""While waiting to move ahead on these demands, we have decided to temporarily withdraw our assets from Operation Sea Guardian,"" the official said."" It doesn't make sense to keep our assets ... with allies who do not respect the embargo.""
France has said that on June 10 Turkish warships flashed their radar lights three times at the Courbet and that Turkish sailors had also put on bullet-proof vests and stood behind their light weapons during the incident.
Musa denied the French account telling senators that it was the French warship that had been aggressive. He said the ship in question had been carrying humanitarian aid.

1321,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 10:07AM ET</span>",Kissing off menu as lockdown ends for Dutch sex workers,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch sex workers welcomed customers back on Wednesday as the Netherlands further eased coronavirus measures, but they were advised to avoid heavy breathing and kissing to help reduce the risk of transmitting COVID-19.
Erotic dancers and prostitutes lost their main source of income for three-and-a-half months and generally did not have access to state support during lockdown.
They were surprised when the government brought forward the date they could reopen from a tentative Sept. 1 to July 1.
Amsterdam's ""Red Light"" district, where thousands of tourists generally crowd the canals to see sex shows, erotic gift shops and prostitutes, has been deserted.
Red Light United, which represents Amsterdam's window prostitutes, had campaigned to get back to work as soon as possible, noting some sex workers still had to pay rent on their premises and lockdown was forcing them to work illegally, exposing them to greater risks.
""I am really looking forward to going back to work,"" said Moira Mona, a 29-year-old sex worker who will perform at an S&M club this week. ""The extra income is going to be welcome, so in that sense I am hoping for a busy day... although I don't expect it to be as busy as before the corona crisis.""
Sex workers already adhere to strict health safety regulations in the Netherlands, but the industry has compiled a list of recommendations, including sexual positions to avoid.
Even with new guidelines, sex workers will be more exposed to the dangers of CODVID-19 than other professions, said Debbie Mensink, a public health advisor in Amsterdam.
""There is a heightened risk. Sex workers already have a heightened health risk due to their line of work... because people get so close to each other.""
Mona, however, said she is not worried and will take precautions. 
She added a few new items to her collection of latex outfits, stiletto heels and tasseled whips to adhere to the protocol: a leather face cover with metal studs, black gloves and surgical face masks.
""I don't get unemployment benefits if I get sick, so if someone shows up and starts coughing or sneezing in my hallway I'll say 'Can you come back another time?' because if I am ill for a week that means a week without income.""
Mona made some income during lockdown by doing webcam shows, but said that if the government-imposed measures had remained in place much longer she would have spent her entire savings.
As the number of new infections and COVID-19 deaths fell fast in recent weeks, the Netherlands lifted most lockdown measures. The country has recorded more than 50,000 infections and over 6,000 deaths since mid-March.
Despite the improved COVID-19 statistics, people are advised to keep 1.5 meters (nearly 5 feet) apart and must wear face masks while riding public transportation.
Those rules won't apply to sex workers and health authorities recommend avoiding face-to-face encounters.

""We advise against literally getting in each others' faces, where you can breathe in each others' warm breath,"" said Mensink, the health worker. ""We also advise against kissing because saliva carries the virus and you could transfer it that way.""

The leftist Lopez Obrador has not left his country since taking office in December 2018, and paying his first foreign visit to Trump is politically risky because the U.S. Republican president is widely disliked in Mexico.
The Mexican president has described the planned visit, which is intended to celebrate the start of a new North American trade deal on July 1, as a matter of economic necessity.
Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said Lopez Obrador would hold bilateral talks with Trump on the afternoon of July 8. Trilateral matters that include Canada will be on the agenda on the morning of July 9, he added.
Mexico wanted to stress its commitment to trade, investment and social welfare at the Washington summit, Ebrard told a news conference, standing alongside Lopez Obrador.
Lopez Obrador floated the idea of talks in Washington to mark the July 1 start of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which is replacing the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Mexico has urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to take part in the meeting, and Ebrard said he expected Canada's government to detail its plans soon.
So far, Canada had not responded to the invitation to participate in Washington, Lopez Obrador said.
Many Mexicans have held Trump in low regard since he described Mexican migrants as rapists and drug runners in his 2015-16 election campaign and vowed to make Mexico pay for his planned border wall.

He has also made repeated threats against Mexico's economy to pressure its government to stem illegal immigration.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration judges planned to ask a federal court on Wednesday to strike down a new Justice Department policy barring them from speaking publicly about immigration law or even about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected detained immigrants.
The lawsuit was to be filed on behalf of more than 460 immigration judges in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia by Columbia University's Knight First Amendment Institute. 
According to a draft seen by Reuters, it alleges that a January 2020 policy violates their rights by banning them from speaking publicly, even in cases where they make it clear they are not speaking as representatives of the Justice Department.
The policy requires all immigration judges, who work for the Justice Department and are not part of the federal judiciary branch, to get departmental clearance before they speak with journalists, at bar associations or law school events about immigration legal issues or any other topic. 
For years, immigration judges were allowed to speak publicly as long as they made clear they were not speaking on behalf of the Justice Department. 
But since 2017 the Trump administration has tightened the rules, first by making them get clearance, and then in 2020, implementing a prohibition about speaking on immigration, while requiring approval to speak on any other topic.
""The 2020 policy imposes a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment,"" the draft of the lawsuit alleges. 
""As the Supreme Court has repeatedly held, people do not surrender their free-speech rights when they accept government employment,"" the draft says. ""They retain their rights, as citizens, to speak on matters of public importance, and the government can silence them only if it can show that its interest in doing so outweighs the employee's interests in speaking and the public's interest in hearing what they have to say.""
President Donald Trump has made limiting immigration, both illegal and legal, a key priority, putting the immigration courts in the national spotlight.
The draft says the policy has been particularly difficult during the coronavirus pandemic, when most of the country's 69 immigration courts have remained open.
Apart from union leaders who represent immigration judges, the draft says the policy has effectively gagged judges who have ""privately expressed concerns"" about keeping the courts open.
It asks the district court to issue a preliminary injunction against enforcement of the policy.

Putin also told Turkey's Tayyip Erdogan and Iran's Hassan Rouhani in a televised video conference that hot spots of terrorism still remain in Syria's Idlib and other regions.
""An inclusive inter-Syrian dialogue should be actively promoted within the framework of the constitutional committee in Geneva. I propose to support this process, to help the participants to meet and start a direct dialogue,"" Putin said.
In Syria's nine-year-old war, Russia and Iran are the main foreign supporters of President Bashar al-Assad's forces, while Turkey backs opposition fighters. Under a diplomatic process dating back to 2017, they agreed to work to reduce fighting.
In a joint statement, Russia, Turkey and Iran ""expressed the conviction"" that Syria's war had no military solution and has to be settled only via a political process.
They also welcomed a meeting of the Syrian constitutional committee in August, a gathering that is meant to be a step forward in what the United Nations says will be a long road to political rapprochement, followed by elections. 
They agreed to hold the next trilateral summit on Syria in Iran, but gave no date, saying it would meet when possible.
Apart from the Syrian issue, the three countries agreed to promote their economic cooperation, the document said.
After worsening violence displaced nearly a million people, Turkey and Russia agreed in March to halt hostilities in northwest Syria's Idlib region. This month military jets bombed villages in the rebel-held area. 
Erdogan also told the video conference that the priority for Syria is a lasting solution to the conflict, ""achievement of calm in the field and the protection of Syria's political unity and territorial integrity"".
""We will continue to do all we can so that our neighbour Syria finds peace, security and stability soon,"" he said.
Rouhani called the presence of U.S. forces in Syria ""illegitimate"", urging them to quit immediately. He also pledged Iran's support for the ""legal government"" of Bashar Al-Assad.

After saying last year all U.S. troops would leave northern Syria, Washington has left some behind for at some bases but rolled back most of their operations.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The former Atlanta police officer charged in last month's death of Rayshard Brooks, which touched off days of anti-racism protests, has been released from jail on bail, an official said on Wednesday.
A Georgia County judge on Tuesday set bond for Garrett Rolfe, 27, at $500,000, and added numerous conditions, including that he wears an ankle monitor and obeys a curfew.
Rolfe left Gwinnett County Jail at 12:27 a.m. EDT (0337 GMT) on Wednesday, according to county Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Shannon Volkodav. 
Representatives for the jail, police, Rolfe and Brooks' family were not immediately available for comment.
The white policeman is charged with felony murder and 10 other offenses in the shooting of Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, at a Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) parking lot in south Atlanta. 
At a hearing on Tuesday, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jane Barwick said she would allow Rolfe to be freed from jail while awaiting trial because she did not believe the former officer was a danger to the community or a flight risk.
Brooks' June 12 death exacerbated tensions in the United States over police brutality and racism stoked by the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
Surveillance and cellphone video of the Atlanta shooting was widely viewed on social media, triggering sometimes-violent demonstrations and the burning of the fast-food restaurant.
At Tuesday's hearing, before the judge gave her decision, Brooks' widow Tomika Miller asked the court to deny bond, saying she would not feel safe with the former officer free.
""I say 'no' because mentally, I'm not able to handle it. I don't feel safe with him out there,"" she said. 

Rolfe's attorneys have said they intend to present strong evidence asserting he was legally justified in using deadly force because he was acting in self-defense. Rolfe was fired from the police and had been held at the Gwinnett County jail.

PARIS (Reuters) - Turkey's ambassador to Paris accused France of having a biased policy over Libya, turning a blind eye to suspected violations of a U.N. arms embargo by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt to the benefit of eastern Libyan commander Khalifa Haftar. 
Turkey has intervened decisively in recent weeks in Libya, providing air support, weapons and allied fighters from Syria to help the internationally recognised government based in Tripoli repel a year-long assault by Haftar, who is backed by the UAE, Egypt and Russia.
""When one supports the legitimate government we're accused of playing a dangerous game but when some countries like Egypt and the UAE support Haftar, then they are deemed legitimate and it's not dangerous. I'd call that biased, no?,"" envoy Ismail Hakki Musa told a hearing of French senators.
The United Nations has previously named the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey for breaching the embargo.
A joint statement issued in February by 13 countries involved in Libya, included Egypt, UAE and Turkey, said there had been a discussion on the ""deplorable"" arms embargo violations and ""renewed determination to contribute to its thorough implementation"".
Ties between NATO allies France and Turkey have soured in recent weeks over Libya, as well as the conflict in northern Syria and drilling in the eastern Mediterranean. 
The animosity was aggravated in June after an incident between Turkish and French warships over an attempt to inspect a vessel that was suspected of smuggling weapons to Libya.
Turkey accuses Paris of supporting Haftar politically, having previously given him military assistance to fight Islamist militants. It denies this. President Emmanuel Macron this week said Turkey had a ""criminal responsibility"" in the country.
When asked about the Turkish comments, a French official said Paris had never been ambiguous in condemning all arms violations, but said that Turkey's intervention and attitude towards NATO allies created a specific threat to France and Europe's interests unlike the UAE.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - In Greenland, 21-year-old hip-hop artist Josef Tarrak-Petrussen is the tattooed face of the local Black Lives Matter movement, and his music of anti-colonial protest is striking a deep chord with younger generations seeking to rewrite their history.
The Black Lives Matter protests, which have inspired people all over the world to expose and condemn injustice and past oppression, have inflamed old tensions in Greenland with former colonial power Denmark and prompted calls for the removal of a statue of an 18th century coloniser.
For a century, the figure of Danish-Norwegian colonist Hans Egede has towered over Greenland's capital Nuuk. Some people say it is a symbol of Denmark's superiority over Greenland.
""We should do as the rest of the world is doing and remove it, because it's a part of the oppression here in Greenland and the systemic racism,"" said Tarrak-Petrussen.
In a music video shot in front of the statue, he raps in Greenlandic how locals are labelled by Danes as ""drunks"", ""Eskimo pakis"" and ""Arctic monkeys"", and asks ""Are we still a colonized people?"" 
Tarrak-Petrussen has a Greenlandic mother and Moroccan father and traditional Greenlandic tattoos on his face.
Greenlandic lawmaker Aki-Matilde Hoegh-Dam called the statue a symbol of colonial violence and suggested putting it in a museum.
An online petition to remove the statue gathered nearly 2000 signatures in one week, equivalent to more than a tenth of Nuuk's population. 
In an echo of protests elsewhere, ""Decolonize"" was scrawled on the statue and it was spattered with red paint on Greenland's National Day on June 21.
Another statue of Egede in central Copenhagen was also defaced.
""The younger generations will no longer accept the way others have written their history - they want to start telling their own story,"" Associate Professor of Cultural History at University of Greenland, Ebbe Volquardsen, told Reuters. 
Hans Egede, also known as the Apostle of Greenland, was a missionary whose arrival there in 1721 marked the beginning of the colonial era. Volquardsen described the colonisation as relatively unbloody, with no slavery or violent riots. 
Nuuk's mayor Charlotte Ludvigsen last week called for a public meeting to let citizens decide the fate of the statue.
""Much of the criticism of Hans Egede is that he forced Christianity and the Western way of life on Greenlanders,"" she said.
Greenland remained a Danish colony until 1953, then became a formal part of the Kingdom of Denmark. It was granted broad self-governing autonomy in 2009, including the right to declare independence, but the island of 56,000 people is unlikely to do so anytime soon as it relies heavily on Denmark for economic aid. 

Although Greenlanders enjoy the same welfare benefits as Danes, many say their Greenlandic language and heritage limit their opportunities to get good schooling and jobs.

1329,By Reuters,"<span>Jul 01, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>",Israeli foreign minister says annexation move unlikely Wednesday,"By Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's foreign minister said a move toward the proposed annexation of occupied West Bank land was unlikely on Wednesday, the start date set by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government for discussing such a move.
""It seems unlikely to me that this will happen today,"" Gabi Ashkenazi, a member of the centrist Blue and White party that is a coalition partner of Netanyahu's conservative Likud, told Israel's Army Radio. 
""I reckon there will be nothing today, regarding (the extension of Israeli) sovereignty.""
Netanyahu and his senior coalition partner, Defence Minister Benny Gantz are at odds over the timing of any unilateral annexation move. 
After meeting U.S. envoys on Tuesday to discuss annexation within the framework of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan, Netanyahu said such talks would continue for several days. 
Trump's proposal calls for Israeli sovereignty over about 30% of the West Bank - land on which Israel has built settlements for decades - as well as creation of a Palestinian state under strict conditions.
""There are very robust conversations with Israel on the Trump plan,"" a U.S. official told Reuters after White House adviser Avi Berkowitz concluded his trip to Israel. 
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and have rejected Trump's plan, saying it would deny them a viable state. 
Most world powers view Israel's settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the West Bank, as well as security needs. 
In an editorial published in Israel's largest selling newspaper on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for any annexation plans to be scrapped.

""Annexation would represent a violation of international law,"" Johnson wrote in Yedioth Ahronoth, echoing remarks he made in parliament on June 16. ""I profoundly hope that annexation does not go ahead. If it does, the UK will not recognise any changes to the 1967 lines, except those agreed between both parties.""

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Child labour has increased in top grower Ivory Coast's cocoa sector during its coronavirus lockdown, according to a report released on Wednesday by an industry-backed foundation. 
The percentage of children engaged in labour between mid-March and mid-May rose to 19.4% from 16% in the same period in recent years, according to a survey of over 1,400 households conducted by the International Cocoa Initiative (ICI). 
The report said it was too early to attribute the increase entirely to the lockdown, but that child labour tends to rise when children have no access to school and during economic downturns. The inability of adult workers to move around the country due to lockdowns may also have been a factor, it said. 
""These findings underline the vulnerability of cocoa-growing households in West Africa and show how quickly progress in addressing child labour can potentially be reversed,"" the ICI report said. 
The ICI is supported by the chocolate and cocoa industries and civil society. Its report provides the first comprehensive look at the pandemic's impact on child labour in the cocoa sector of the world's top producer of the crop.
The Ivorian government introduced coronavirus-related restrictions on March 16, including closing schools and partially sealing its external borders. It has eased some of those measures in recent weeks. 
More than 1 million children work on cocoa farms in the West African country, studies have found.
ICI says projects it supports have succeeded in reducing child labour. However, a draft of a U.S. government-sponsored report seen by Reuters in April found that nationwide use of child labour in the cocoa sector had actually increased overall over the past decade.

That report has not yet been published because the Ivorian and Ghanaian governments are disputing the methodology.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The United States has told Japan that it wants to organize an in-person Group of Seven leaders' summit in late August, two Japanese government sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday.
Japan told the United States in response that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would be willing to attend the summit if it were to be held in late August, the sources said.
U.S. President Donald Trump decided in May to postpone the summit to September or later expand the list of invitees to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India.
Trump had earlier sought to host the group of major industrialised countries in Washington in June as a demonstration that the United States was returning to normal after the coronavirus pandemic, which has killed more than 127,000 people in the United States to date.
Although it is not clear why the event would be held earlier than September, opinion polls show clear signs of erosion of Trump's electoral support since the coronavirus outbreak.
""It's possible he is seeking a breakthrough from an achievement in foreign relations,"" one of the Japanese government sources said.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish business delegation is set to visit Libya within two weeks to assess how Turkey's companies and banks can help rebuild the war-torn country and secure its energy needs, two people familiar with the plan told Reuters.
Ankara has made increasingly clear its ambitions for lasting cooperation with Tripoli on oil exploration, construction, banking and manufacturing after its military support helped the Government of National Accord (GNA) reverse a 15-month offensive.
With Turkish help, the internationally recognised GNA halted an assault on Tripoli and in recent months pushed back Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which is supported by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. 
While fighting continues near the city of Sirte, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's top deputies visited the GNA in Tripoli in mid-June. The sources said politicians could join the upcoming trip by what they called a ""committee"" of business representatives.
They will craft a business plan and initially focus on meeting Libya's energy needs and re-building and renewing its infrastructure, the Turkish official and industry official said. 
Before Turkey officially threw its support behind the GNA in November, Turkish builders had worked on projects in Libya. The backlog of Turkish contract work there amounts to $16 billion, a sector official said in January.
The Turkish official said ""it may take time"" for Tripoli to make the payments. 
Turkish state lenders will help set up Libya's banking system and regulator and work is being done to funnel payments through Turkey for key Libyan imports, the official added.
""Concrete steps could be taken in the period ahead,"" the person said, requesting anonymity.
Separately, a meeting between Libyan business heads and Turkish manufacturers of food, medicine and other goods is expected to be rescheduled ""soon"" after a coronavirus-related delay, said Murtaza Karanfil, head of the Turkey-Libya business council at the Foreign Economic Relations Board of Turkey.
""As Libya lacks a strong manufacturing base, they thought these industries could be a good starting point to alleviate production issues,"" he told Reuters.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian police said on Wednesday they had seized about 14 tonnes of amphetamine pills worth around 1 billion euros ($1 billion) arriving from Syria, in what they described as the world's single largest operation of its kind. 
Investigators said they impounded three container ships that had docked in the southern Italian port of Salerno and found 84 million pills of the drug Captagon inside machinery and large paper cylinders for industrial use they were carrying.
""It is possible that the local Camorra crime groups are involved in this business,"" Lieutenant Colonel Giordano Natale told Reuters.
Used in the 1960s to treat narcolepsy and depression, Captagon is one of several brand names for fenethylline hydrochloride, a drug compound belonging to a family of amphetamines that can inhibit fear and ward off tiredness.
Captagon is popular in the Middle East, and widespread in war-torn areas such as Syria, where conflict has fuelled demand and created opportunities for producers. 
Production was initially concentrated in Lebanon and the Islamic State group sells it to finance its activities, police said in a statement.
It said Captagon was known as the ""drug of the Jihad"" after being found in militant hideouts, including one used by the Islamists who killed 90 people at the Bataclan theatre in Paris in 2015. 
Italian authorities believe the coronavirus lockdown cross Europe has hindered the production and distribution of synthetic drugs, forcing traffickers to organise shipments from Syria, where these activities have not slowed down.

In a raid two weeks ago, Italian police seized 2,800 kg of hashish and 1 million Captagon pills in the port of Salerno. The shipment was hidden among counterfeit clothing items.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates is seeking to verify the credentials of the Pakistani pilots and engineers employed in its airlines after the South Asian government grounded 262 pilots for holding ""dubious"" qualifications.
Pakistan grounded the pilots on June 26 on suspicion that they allegedly falsified their examinations to qualify for flying aircraft, leading to them having licenses the country's aviation minister termed ""dubious.
A total of 262 of the country's 860 pilots were affected, including 141 of national carrier Pakistan International Airline's (PIA) pilots.
The Director General of the UAE's General Civil Aviation Authority Saif Mohammed Al Suwaidi requested the verification of the credentials of Pakistani pilots, aircraft maintenance engineers, and flight operations officers working in the Middle Eastern country in a June 29 letter reviewed by Reuters to the Director General of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority Hassan Nasir Jamy. 
""We would like to request your good offices to verify the licensing credentials of the attached pilots list who are currently holding UAE's pilots licences based on licences and qualifications issued by Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority,"" the letter said. 
Pakistan's aviation ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
The European Union Air Safety Agency (EASA) on Tuesday suspended PIA's authorisation to fly to the bloc for six months because of the licensing concerns. 
In a statement on Wednesday, the Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association (PALPA), the union for PIA's pilots, alleges the announcement of the ""dubious"" license holders was a planned government move against the pilots to cut their headcount.
""The malicious efforts of some at the helm of affairs with a mindset to cut the pilots down to size has resulted in PIA being reduced to an airline on paper,"" the union said.

The PALPA rejected the government's list of pilots with licences deemed dubious, and pointed out that it was full of discrepancies, demanding a judicial investigation.

SAM KHOK, Thailand (Reuters) - Thai schools reopened on Wednesday for the first time since mid-March, with precautions in place to guard against the coronavirus, ranging from temperature checks to installing makeshift cubicles for social distancing in classrooms. 
At Sam Khok school, about 50 km (31 miles) north of Bangkok, nearly 5,000 students were told to self-quarantine at home for 15-days prior to the re-start as an extra precaution, Principal Chuchart Thiengtham said. 
""Once students arrive at school, teachers hand face masks to them because it's mandatory to wear them,"" said Chuchart, adding that face shields were also provided to pupils for additional safety during some activities.
Students also get their temperatures checked and a facial recognition scanner automatically sends a message to parents, he said. 
In the classroom, the school has turned cardboard ballot boxes used in elections into partitions to ensure social distancing between desks.     ""I feel good studying behind the box because it makes me feel safer returning to school,"" said student Kanlaya Srimongkhol. 
However, 17-year-old Soponwich Thianthong said while he felt more secure the partitions could be irritating because it limited his field of vision.  

The coronavirus has killed 58 people in Thailand out of 3,173 infections, though the country has not recorded a case of local transmission for 37 days.     Thailand this week extended an emergency decree until the end of July in a bid to avoid the risk of a second wave, even as it relaxed more restrictions by also opening bars and allowing some foreigners into the country.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should meet again before the U.S. presidential election in November, a Seoul official told reporters on Wednesday. 
Moon's remarks were made during a video conference with European Council President Charles Michel on Tuesday, during which he said another summit between Trump and Kim would help resume stalled nuclear negotiations. 
""I believe there's a need for North Korea and the United States to try dialogue one more time before the U.S. presidential election,"" a presidential official quoted Moon as saying. 
""The issues of nuclear programmes and sanctions will ultimately have to be resolved through North Korea-U.S. talks."" 
Moon's office had conveyed such views to Washington and the officials there are making efforts to resume the talks, the South Korean official said. 
Trump and Kim met for the first time in 2018 in Singapore, raising hopes of an agreement to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons programme. But their second summit, in early 2019 in Vietnam, fell apart.
Trump and Kim met again at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas in June 2019 and agreed to restart negotiations, but working-level talks between the two sides in Sweden in October were broken off.
Inter-Korean tensions flared last month after the North blew up a joint liaison office, severed hotlines and threatened military action over plans by defector groups in the South to send anti-Kim leaflets across the border. Following weeks of heated exchanges, Kim suspended the military plans, without specifying why. 
The moves from Pyongyang were seen aimed at recapturing the attention of Trump and making a renewed push for sanctions relief before the November election, experts said.
On Monday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, who led working-level negotiations with North Koreans, said there is still time for both sides to re-engage and ""make substantial progress"".

Biegun, however, said an in-person summit would be difficult before the November election, citing the coronavirus pandemic which has all but wiped the world's diplomatic calendar clean.

Speaking to reporters in Van province, Soylu said authorities had detained 11 people in relation to the incident, which the provincial governor's office said took place late on Saturday. Search and rescue operations continued, Soylu said.
The lake is near the border with Iran, from where migrants regularly cross into Turkey, heading west toward Europe. The lake, which completely within Turkey's borders, is located on the path of migrants attempting to reach western Turkey from Iran, Afghanistan and other countries. 
Seven people died and 64 were rescued when a boat carrying migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan sank on Lake Van in December.
More than a million people reached Greece from Turkey in 2015-16, although the numbers later dropped sharply under a 2016 agreement between the EU and Turkey for Ankara to take migrants back in return for funds.
Earlier this year, tens of thousands of migrants tried to cross into Greece via land and sea borders after Ankara said it would no longer stop them. Turkey, home to 3.6 million Syrians, the world's largest refugee population, had said it would open the frontier because it was alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria.

Turkey said in May it was still producing and delivering parts for the stealth jets despite being suspended from the programme nearly a year ago over its purchase of Russian S-400 anti-aircraft defence systems.
Turkey was both a parts manufacturer and major buyer of the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35s. Washington says the S-400s jeopardise the jets - which Ankara denies - and are incompatible with NATO defence systems.

The Pentagon was not immediately available to comment. 
Washington announced last July - when the first Russian S-400 units arrived in Turkey - that it was suspending Ankara from the F-35 programme and expected to ""wind down"" Turkey's involvement by March 2020.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The number of North Korean defectors arriving in South Korea hit an all time low in recent months, as border restrictions from the coronavirus pandemic made movement more difficult, the South's Unification Ministry said on Wednesday.
Twelve defectors were recorded as arriving in South Korea from April to June this year, compared to 320 in the same quarter a year before, according to the Unification Ministry, which handles affairs with the North.
The number is the lowest since 2003, when the ministry began recording defector arrivals by the quarter, Yonhap news agency said.
Ministry spokesman Yoh Sang-key said the sharp fall in defector arrivals was primarily because countries bordering North Korea have closed their borders due to coronavirus concerns.
""A more professional analysis is needed, but for now the decline in the number of incoming defectors appears to be affected by the shutdown of borders in neighbouring countries after the coronavirus outbreak emerged, which made it difficult for people to travel,"" he told a regular briefing. 
Relations between South Korean President Moon Jae-in's administration and many in the defector community have been strained in recent years.
After North Korea complained about defector-led groups that send propaganda leaflets and aid into the North, Moon's government said it would take legal action against two groups.
This week police questioned the defector leaders of the two groups, after having raided their offices last week.
The South Korean government also says it is planning to significantly cut funding for defector resettlement programmes, but Yoh said that was only because of the expected drop in arrivals.
North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, but it imposed a strict border closure and quarantine programme.
American and Japanese government officials have cast doubt on those claims, but one diplomatic source said that whatever the truth is, Pyongyang appears increasingly confident that it has the situation under control.
Border traffic in goods appears to have increased and some once-scarce imported foods have reappeared in Pyongyang supermarkets, the source said.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Suspects arrested by Beijing's new security office in Hong Kong could be tried on the mainland, a senior Chinese official said on Wednesday, a move certain to spark alarm in the Chinese-ruled city as a contentious new national security law takes effect.
Zhang Xiaoming, Executive Deputy Director of Beijing's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, told reporters during a briefing that the mainland's national security office abides by Chinese law and that Hong Kong's legal system cannot be expected to implement the laws of the mainland.
""The law is a birthday gift to (Hong Kong) and will show its precious value in the future,"" Zhang said, adding the law would not be applied retroactively.
Article 55 of the law states that Beijing's national security office in Hong Kong could exercise jurisdiction over ""complex"" or ""serious"" cases. 
The news comes a day after Beijing unveiled the full details of the much-anticipated law amid weeks of uncertainty and confirms widespread fears it will be harsher than expected. 
Under the law, mainland security agencies will be based in Hong Kong officially for the first time, with powers that go beyond the city's local laws.
Security was tight near the heart of Hong Kong's government district on Wednesday only hours after new security law came into force and as the city marked the 23rd anniversary of the former British colony's handover to China.
The contentious law will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, heralding a more authoritarian era for the Asian financial hub.
Among other details certain to rattle democracy and rights activists in the city is a ban on violators of the law standing for election and greater oversight of non-governmental organisations and news groups. 
Speaking at a flag-raising ceremony to mark the anniversary of Hong Kong's handover in 1997, the city's embattled leader Carrie Lam said the law was the most important development since the city's return to Beijing.
""It is also an inevitable and prompt decision to restore stability in the society,"" Lam said at the same harbour-front venue where 23 years ago the last colonial governor, Chris Patten, a staunch critic of the security law, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to Chinese rule. 
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few ""troublemakers"" and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests.
Critics fear the legislation will crush wide-ranging freedoms in Hong Kong denied to people in mainland China that are seen as key to its success as a global financial centre.
""With the release of the full detail of the law, it should be clear to those in any doubt that this is not the Hong Kong they grew up in,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of equity research, Tellimer in Dubai.
""The difference is that U.S. and China relations are far worse and this could be used as a pretext to impede the role of Hong Kong as a finance hub."" For more analysts comments, click
HONG KONG'S 'SECOND RETURN'
Some pro-Beijing officials and political commentators say the law is aimed at sealing Hong Kong's ""second return"" to the motherland after the first failed to bring residents of the restive city to heel.
Luo Huining, the head of Beijing's top representative office in Hong Kong, said at the flag-raising ceremony the law was a ""common aspiration"" of Hong Kong citizens. 
Critics of the legislation blasted the lack of transparency surrounding its details up until it was unveiled, with even Beijing-backed Lam saying she was not privy to the draft despite her insisting most people had no reason to worry.
The complex legislation came into force at 11 p.m. (1500 GMT) on June 30, giving Hong Kong's 7.5 million people no time to digest it. Some pro-democracy activists quit their posts only hours before the law came into force, calling on the campaign for democracy to continue offshore.
""I saw this morning there are celebrations for Hong Kong's handover, but to me it is a funeral, a funeral for 'one country two systems',"" said democracy lawmaker Kwok Ka-ki.
Critics of the law fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms promised to Hong Kong for 50 years when it returned to Beijing under a ""one country, two systems"" style of governance.
Neighbouring Taiwan, which Beijing regards as part of China and has said it would use force to reclaim it, said it had opened an office on Wednesday to help people fleeing Hong Kong.
Authorities barred an annual handover anniversary march due to be held on Wednesday, citing a ban on gatherings of more than 50 people in a bid to curb coronavirus, but many activists pledged to defy the order and march later in the afternoon.
On July 1 last year, hundreds of protesters stormed the city's legislature to protest against a now-scrapped bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, trashing the building in a direct challenge to authorities in Beijing.

Those protests evolved into calls for greater democracy, paralysing parts of the city and paving the way for Beijing to directly impose national security law on Hong Kong.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will boost defence spending by 40% over the next 10 years, buying long-range military assets that will be focused on the Indo-Pacific region, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday. 
In a speech that threatens to inflame tensions with China, Morrison said Australia will spend A$270 billion ($186.5 billion) over the next 10 years to acquire longer-range strike capabilities across air, sea and land. 
Australia in 2016 promised to spend A$195 billion over the next 10 years.
Morrison said Australia will also pivot its military focus to the Indo-Pacific region.
""We want a Indo-Pacific free from coercion and hegemony. We want a region where all countries, large and small, can engage freely with each other and be guided by international rules and norms,"" Morrison said in a speech in Canberra.
Although Morrison did not name China, Australia's muscular posturing towards the Pacific is seen as a signal that Canberra intends to be more assertive in its dealings with Beijing and less reliant on the United States.
""China is the unspoken elephant in the room,"" said Sam Roggeveen, director of the Sydney-based Lowy Institute's International Security Program.
""While it's absolutely right that we focus on our region, but buying long-range missiles - particularly ones for land targets - could invite a response from Beijing.""
Morrison said Australia would first buy 200 long-range anti-ship missiles from the U.S. Navy for A$800 million, and would also consider developing hypersonic missiles that can travel at least at five times the speed of sound.
The defence spend will please U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused allies of taking Washington's protection for granted.
But Australia's defence spend will do little for relations with China - its largest trading partner. The two nations have butted heads as both compete for influence in the Pacific.
Already dealt a blow by Australia's 2018 decision to ban China's Huawei from its nascent 5G broadband network, bilateral ties have in recent months been soured by Canberra's call for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
Last month, Australia said a ""sophisticated state-actor"" has spent months trying to hack all levels of the government, political bodies, essential service providers and operators of critical infrastructure.
Australia sees China as the chief suspect, three sources told Reuters.
China denies it is behind the spate of cyber-attacks, and the souring of ties has spilled over to trade.

China has suspended beef imports from four of Australia’s largest meat processors and imposed hefty tariffs on barley, although both sides say that is unrelated to the latest spat.

Indira Alfonzo, who was named chief of the National Electoral Council (CNE) by the Maduro-friendly Supreme Court earlier this month, said on state television the increase was necessary due to a surge in the number of political parties slated to participate in the 2020 parliamentary elections.
The legislature currently has 167 legislators, and the increase to 277 will go into effect with the next parliament. 
The opposition has criticized the Supreme Court's naming of Alfonzo and four other new CNE members, as well as a court ruling ousting the leaders of two key opposition parties and replacing them with politicians accused of being shadow allies of the ruling Socialist Party, as evidence the elections will not be fair. 
The parliamentary elections are due by the end of the year, but the CNE has not yet announced an exact date. The opposition has held a majority in the congress for the previous five-year period. 
Any loss of control of the parliament would complicate the standing of National Assembly speaker Juan Guaido, who is recognized as Venezuela's rightful leader by dozens of Western countries as a result of his position. Guaido and allies accuse Maduro of rigging his 2018 re-election. 
Maduro has overseen an economic collapse in the once-prosperous OPEC nation, triggering a humanitarian crisis that has seen millions of Venezuelans emigrate from the country.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A visit by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to Washington to meet his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump has been planned for around the middle of next week, two sources familiar with the matter said.
Lopez Obrador previously said the meeting could take place soon after July 1 but on Monday announced it would not be this week.
Planning is underway for the visit to be on July 8-9, according to a Mexican official familiar with the matter. A second official said the trip was very likely to be those days.
Foreign ministry spokesman Daniel Millan said the conversations are continuing but that the government was ""exploring dates after 4th July"". Lopez Obrador said on Tuesday the government would provide details on Wednesday.
The Mexican president says the Trump meeting is intended to celebrate the July 1 start of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a trade deal that is replacing the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
It was in April that Lopez Obrador initially floated the idea of meeting the U.S. president. For the Mexican president to make his first foreign trip to see Trump has stirred criticism from both opposition ranks and some of his own supporters.
Trump, who referred to Mexican migrants as rapists and drug runners in his 2015-16 election campaign and vowed to make Mexico pay for his planned border wall, is held in low public esteem in Mexico, so the visit carries risks for Lopez Obrador.
Lopez Obrador has publicly urged Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to take part in the meeting, but Canada's government has given no indication yet he will attend.
A Canadian government source said any invitation to attend would be evaluated from a health perspective.

Under federal health rules, Trudeau faces 14 days in quarantine upon returning to Canada if he leaves the country.

At least 40 dissident activists were also detained by police, according to exiled rights group Cubalex, with some later released.
Those included performance artist Tania Bruguera in Havana and the leader of Cuba's most active opposition group, Jose Daniel Ferrer, who had been under house arrest in the eastern city of Santiago de Cuba.
Cuba does not usually comment on the detention of dissidents, which would give them more publicity. The government did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
No would-be protesters appeared able to make it to the site of what was supposed to be the main demonstration in Havana which was full of security forces. Some said state telecoms monopoly ETECSA had cut their mobile internet service overnight.
Protests against the state are rare in a country where public spaces are tightly controlled and Communist authorities are quick to crack down on dissent.
The calls for protests on Tuesday were triggered by news last week that police had shot and killed a 27-year-old unarmed Black man, Hansel Hernandez.
A woman who identified herself as his aunt denounced the killing on social media and called for justice, grabbing attention amid protests against police violence and racism in the United States.
For three days, authorities did not comment. But on Saturday, Cuba's Interior Ministry issued a statement saying police had been chasing Hernandez, who had done jail time previously for other crimes.
Hernandez, who had committed an act of vandalism, started throwing stones at police as they chased him and hit one officer in the shoulder, throwing him to the ground, the statement said.
The officer shot Hernandez after firing off two warning shots, the statement said, adding that he acted in self defense and without the intent of killing him.
The Interior Ministry said it lamented his death.
Critics have denounced the government for not holding police to account by launching an investigation, especially given how quick officials have been to condemn U.S. police brutality, with extensive coverage in state media of the Black Lives Matter protests.
They also accuse the government more broadly of allowing police brutality and failing to adequately address racism in Cuba.
Cuba's government prides itself on having improved the lives of Black Cubans by officially eliminating racial segregation after its 1959 revolution and providing universal access to education and healthcare.

But anti-racism activists say that by acting as if the issue of racism were resolved and suppressing debate over it, the government has prevented the steps needed to fully eradicate it.

Economist Carlos Decotelli's resume included a doctorate and post-doctoral work that were not completed, according to reports in the Brazilian media. 
Decotelli told journalists on Monday he had explained the ""inconsistencies"" to the president. He was also accused of plagiarism in his masters degree thesis, which he denied.
Decotelli told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo newspaper on Tuesday that he would not take the job and his swearing-in ceremony, scheduled for Tuesday, had not taken place.
Bolsonaro had praised Decotelli's academic achievements when he announced the appointment on Thursday. The president's office did not reply to a request for comment on Tuesday.
The first Black minister named to Bolsonaro's cabinet, Decotelli was a professor at Brazil's naval academy, a military connection that led him to back Bolsonaro's election campaign in 2018 and he become involved in the transition team. 
Decotelli was Bolsonaro's third education minister since his term began in January last year. The first served for just three months and the second, Abraham Weintraub, for 14 months.
Bolsonaro's ideologically conservative backers consider the education ministry key to their efforts to reinforce Christian family values and roll back what they call years of Marxist influence on education in Brazil.
Weintraub, one of the loudest right-wing ideologues in Bolsonaro's cabinet, resigned last week, a target of a Supreme Court probe after the release of a videotape in which he called its judges ""bums"" who should be jailed. 
Bolsonaro nominated Weintraub to be an executive director at the World Bank and he left Brazil for the United States on June 19 even before his resignation became official.

Instead of slinging cocktails at the bar or dancing on stage, ValeTodo Downtown's famed staff of drag queens will sell customers daily household products as the space reopens as a market while nightclubs are ordered to remain closed. 
The Peruvian government will lift the lockdown in most regions of the country at the beginning of July, but will keep borders closed, as well as nightclubs and bars.
The lockdown has been a struggle for the club's 120 employees like drag queen Belaluh McQueen. Her life completely changed when the government announced the quarantine. Her nights were spent at home, rather than performing as a dancer at the club in vivid-colored costumes. 
""I was very depressed because I have been doing this art for years, but you have to adapt to new challenges for the future,"" said McQueen, who is identified by her stage name. 
Now McQueen is back to work as a grocery store employee, wearing a sequined suit, high heels and a mask. A DJ will play club music as patrons shop. 
""We have a new job opportunity,"" McQueen added.
Renamed as Downtown Market, the club, which has been a mainstay hallmark of the local LGBTQ community, ushered in its reopening with an inauguration ceremony. 
""Before, I used to come here to dance and have a good time, but now we come to buy,"" said Alexandra Herrera, a regular attendee of the club. ""The thing is to reinvent yourself."" 
The club's general manager, Claudia Achuy, said that the pandemic impacted the heart of Lima night life, but she chose to reopen as a market rather than risk cutting staff. 
""If we had just stayed as a nightclub we did not have a close horizon or a way of working,"" Achuy said. 

Peru's confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 282,364 with 9,504 associated deaths on Monday, according to government data. It has the second highest outbreak in Latin America after Brazil, according to a Reuters tally.

A separate body, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), which watches for nuclear weapon tests, said on Friday a monitoring station in Sweden had found higher-than-usual levels of caesium-134, caesium-137 and ruthenium-103. The CTBTO said they were produced by nuclear fission.
CTBTO chief Lassina Zerbo posted a borderless map https://twitter.com/SinaZerbo/status/1276559857731153921?s=20 online showing where the particles might have come from in the 72 hours before they were detected - an area covering the tips of Denmark and Norway as well as southern Sweden, much of Finland, Baltic countries and part of western Russia including St. Petersburg.
All those countries except Denmark, which has no nuclear power plants http://www.ensreg.eu/country-profile/Denmark, and Russia, which has a history of not fully explaining incidents that emitted radioactive particles, told the International Atomic Energy Agency by Monday that there were no events on their territory that could explain the increase.
On Tuesday evening, however, the IAEA issued a statement https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/pressreleases/more-countries-provide-radioisotope-information-to-iaea-reported-levels-very-low saying the list of countries that had declared themselves incident-free had grown to around 40 and now included Denmark and Russia. 
""Apart from Estonia, Finland and Sweden, none of the other countries which have so far provided information and data to the IAEA said they had detected elevated radioisotope levels,"" said the IAEA, which asked member states for information over the weekend after the CTBTO announcement.

Asked on Monday if Russia was the origin of the elevated particle levels, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had detected no sign of a radiation emergency.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The shutters were down, but the pub chatter in the midst of a coronavirus quarantine gave the game away: a crowded Brazilian bar under the cover of a pet shop with no pets.
Municipal authorities in the city of Petropolis said they discovered the speakeasy on Friday after neighbors complained.
Inspectors found 16 patrons drinking beer, none of them wearing a mandatory mask or keeping to social distancing rules.
""The owner served customers behind a closed door. They came in through the adjacent pet shop,"" a city spokesman said.
The mayor's office said the shop, which had pet food but no animals, lacked proper registration papers. 
Under the lockdown in the mountain city above Rio de Janeiro, bars are not allowed to open while pet shops are viewed as an essential service that can.
The shop was closed after the raid and the bar owner fined.
Petropolis, a city of 300,000 inhabitants that was built up in the 19th century as the summer retreat of Brazil's royal family, has had 92 deaths from COVID-19. Rio de Janeiro is the second worst hit state in Brazil, with almost 10,000 deaths.

The U.N. Refugee Agency (UNCHR) and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) later said at least 2,800 people had fled according to early estimates but the true number could be ""significantly higher"" as the ""scope and impact"" of the reported clashes was not yet fully known.
Government and military spokesmen did not answer phone calls by Reuters seeking comment on the number of people who had fled or the reported fighting between the army, known as the Tatmadaw, and Arakan Army insurgents.
“Estimates indicate as many as 10,000 residents have already fled as the Tatmadaw advanced and heavy fighting commenced,” Michelle Bachelet, the U.N High Commissioner for Human Rights, told the Human Rights Council, a Geneva-based forum, during a debate on Myanmar.
U.N. agencies cited ""reports by local partners and public sources"" for the estimates of numbers of displaced people.
It was not possible for Reuters to independently verify the reports of fighting and displacement. Access for humanitarian workers is tightly limited in Rakhine. Journalists are banned, making it hard to verify reports from the region.
LETTER ABOUT ""CLEARANCE OPERATIONS""
The reported flight of civilians came after a local administrator, in a letter seen by Reuters, last week warned dozens of village leaders in Rathedaung township that the army planned “clearance operations” against insurgents and urged them to go.
A government spokesman later said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that an evacuation order had been sent to local administrators by border-affairs officials but had later been revoked.
The spokesman did not specify why, but said that the government had instructed the military not to use the term ""clearance operation"". Myanmar's border affairs ministry acknowledged to Reuters that it had issued the evacuation order, but said that it affected only a few villages. 
“Clearance operations” is the term the Myanmar authorities used in 2017 to describe operations against insurgents from Rakhine’s Muslim-minority Rohingya people. 
During those operations, hundreds of thousands of people fled from their homes. Refugees said at the time that the army had carried out mass killings and arson, accusations the army has denied, saying troops were responding to attacks.
SHELLING FOLLOWED EVACUATION ORDER, U.N. SAYS
Citing ""local reports"", UNHCR and OCHA said in a joint statement on Tuesday the order to evacuate had been followed by shooting and shelling. But the two agencies added that information was hard to verify in part because of government-imposed restrictions on humanitarian access.
Since late 2018, the Myanmar army has been fighting the AA, a group from the largely Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group that is seeking greater autonomy for the western region, also known as Arakan.
Dozens had died and more than 77,000 people displaced before the latest fighting, according to U.N. figures.
After fleeing the reported bout of Tatmadaw-AA fighting, hundreds of displaced villagers are sheltering in Buddhist monasteries in Rakhine's state capital Sittwe, two lawmakers in the city said.
“Now it is rainy season but people are fleeing with only one set of clothes,” Khin Saw Wai, an MP for Rathedaung township, told Reuters by phone. “They don’t have blankets, pillows, and mosquito nets to sleep at night.”
Khin Aye Win, a 23-year-old woman who said she fled with her mother and sister, told Reuters by phone that there had been shelling near her village. She said many elderly people, including her grandmother, stayed behind.

“Now the soldiers are near my village... so I cannot go back,” she said.

Russians have been voting to amend the constitution, a move that if, as expected, is endorsed would allow Vladimir Putin to run again for president twice, potentially extending his long rule until 2036. 
Video footage of the incident circulated online and obtained by Reuters showed two policemen trying to detain David Frenkel, a reporter and photographer for Mediazona, an independent outlet, at a polling station.
Frenkel could be heard screaming in pain after his arm was pinned behind his back by the policemen following an audible cracking sound. ""Well, I have a broken arm,"" - Frenkel wrote on Twitter after being sent to hospital.
Mediazona said he had gone to the polling station to check possible violations. He had undergone surgery due to his injury, it added.
Frenkel and the police were not available for immediate comment. 
Mediazona cited the police in St Petersburg as saying they had helped election officials remove an individual who was interfering with their work, had acted legally, and that they had not received any complaint about their actions.
Putin has called for officials to ensure that the vote, which culminates on Wednesday, is beyond reproach, something they have promised to do. Kremlin critics allege multiple violations and say the vote is being rigged.

The warrants are for officials from Guerrero state, where the students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College disappeared in a 2014 case that became a crisis for the administration of then-President Enrique Pena Nieto and triggered international outrage.
Authorities under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took a renewed push at solving the case, after independent experts picked holes in the official version. Beyond a single bone fragment, the students' remains were never found.
Attorney General Alejandro Gertz said the new probe, which on Monday led to the arrest of a leader from a Guerrero gang accused of involvement in the disappearance, opened up new theories overriding what the past administration dubbed the ""historical truth."" 
""All of the proceedings undertaken during this new investigation period... have let us establish a chronology of what happened, as well as the participation of those who committed these crimes,"" Gertz told reporters. ""The historical truth is finished."" 
Remains found during the current administration's probe have been sent to Austria's University of Innsbruck for analysis, and Gertz said he hoped to provide more information at the end of the week. He added he expected to soon press charges against public officials of various ranks.
An Interpol red notice issued in March for the arrest of Tomas Zeron, a former official who has been accused of manipulating the probe, is still active along with warrants for other former officials, he added. 

Zeron, who has denied wrongdoing, had fled the country, Gertz said. He also accused former investigators of violations and missteps in handling of the case, including torture, arbitrary arrests and hiding evidence.

On Tuesday, the first Czechs left for what has long been their nation's favourite foreign vacation destination following the easing of travel curbs imposed to contain the coronavirus.
The RegioJet train and bus service said it has sold more than 30,000 tickets for the route it plans to operate until September.
From July 11, trains will go daily, each carrying up to 560 passengers, offering both seating and sleeping sections, with the starting price of 590 crowns ($24.95) for one leg of the journey via Slovakia's Bratislava and Slovenia's Ljubljana.
Direct train service was dropped two years because it was loss-making. Its resumption was a welcome change for travellers keen to avoid the high-season traffic jams that motorists risk.
""I have done this trip several times by car...and I see this as very comfortable and a little bit of an adventure. I like it and I think this is a new way to get to the sea,"" Jan Vrana said aboard the train with his wife and son. 
Croatia has long been the first choice of many Czechs going abroad for holiday except during Europe's migration crisis in 2015 when neighbouring Slovakia, formerly in one state with the Czech Republic, took the top spot.
Travelling to the Adriatic Sea has been a long tradition for the Czechs, dating to the early 20th century when they were part of the Austrian-Hungarian empire together with Croatia.
Czechs also gravitated to Croatia during the Cold War era - ending in 1989 - when it was part of federal Yugoslavia, then a communist country like their homeland but with personal freedoms as it was outside the Soviet-dominated Eastern Bloc. 
For many Czechs, Yugoslavia also became a conduit for emigration to the West as its borders with Austria and Italy were more porous than those along the Iron Curtain.

KINGSTON (Reuters) - Jamaica has suspended the use of a badge representing one of the highest British royal honors after anti-racism protesters decried its imagery of a white angel standing on the head of Satan depicted as a chained man with dark skin.
Protesters in Jamaica and elsewhere have likened the image to George Floyd, the Black American who was killed last month after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The Queen’s Representative to Jamaica, Governor General Patrick Allen, said on June 26 he had requested that the imagery on the badge be ""changed to reflect an inclusive image of the shared humanity of all peoples.""
The Order of St Michael and St George badge is an honor the Queen typically awards to British ambassadors and senior Foreign Office officials and royal representatives throughout the Commonwealth.
But Clyde Williams (NYSE:WMB), a Jamaican lawyer who was one of the first to raise the issue on social media, said the badge's imagery was a clear depiction of ""white supremacy.""
A British online petition calling for its redesign has garnered more than 15,000 signatures.
It is unclear whether Jamaica is the first country to have suspended its use. Buckingham Palace told Reuters it was a matter for the government, which had no immediate comment.
In the wake of the global reckoning with racism, Jamaicans have staged a couple of protests, launched petitions agitating for changes to rectify remnants of colonialism and reignited discussions about becoming a separate republic from the monarchy.
Jamaica became independent from Britain in 1962, however, it is still a part of the Commonwealth of Nations, which is mostly composed of territories of the former British Empire. Successive administrations on the island have talked of also dropping Queen Elizabeth as head of state but never put it to a vote.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing on Tuesday unveiled new national security laws for Hong Kong that will punish crimes of secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, heralding a more authoritarian era for China's freest city.
As the law came into force, authorities were set to throw a security blanket across the heart of the city's financial centre on Wednesday after activists vowed to defy a police ban and rally against the measures.
Local media said up to 4,000 officers would be deployed to stamp out any protests. 
China's parliament passed the detailed legislation earlier on Tuesday, giving Beijing sweeping powers and setting the stage for radical changes to the global financial hub's way of life.
Beijing had kept full details shrouded in secrecy, giving Hong Kong's 7.5 million people no time to digest the complex legislation before it entered into force at 11.00 pm (1500 GMT) on June 30.
The timing was seen as a symbolic humiliation for Britain, coming just an hour before the 23rd anniversary of when Hong Kong's last colonial governor, Chris Patten, a staunch critic of the law, tearfully handed back Hong Kong to Chinese rule. 
Amid fears the law will crush the city's freedoms, prominent activist Joshua Wong's Demosisto and other pro-democracy groups said they would dissolve.
""The punitive elements of the law are stupefying,"" Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school and a barrister, told Reuters.
""Let us hope no one tries to test this law, for the consequences to the individual and the legal system will be irreparable.""
The legislation pushes Beijing further along a collision course with the United States, Britain and other Western governments, which have said it erodes the high degree of autonomy the city was granted at its July 1, 1997, handover.
Britain and some two dozen Western countries urged China to reconsider the law, saying Beijing must preserve the right to assembly and free press.
The United States condemned the legislation as a violation of Beijing's international commitments and vowed to go on acting ""against those who smothered Hong Kong’s freedom and autonomy.""
Washington, already in dispute with China over trade, the South China Sea and the coronavirus, began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting technology access.
China, which has rejected criticism of the law by Britain, the European Union, Japan, Taiwan and others, said it would retaliate.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, in a video message to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, urged the international community to ""respect our country's right to safeguard national security"".
She said the law would not undermine the city's autonomy or its independent judiciary.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few ""troublemakers"" and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests.
As the law was passed in Beijing, the Chinese People's Liberation Army garrison in Hong Kong held a drill which included exercises to stop suspicious vessels and arrest fugitives, according to the Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) social media account of state-run CCTV's military channel. 
'OVERPOWERING'
In their most severe form, crimes will be punishable with life in prison. Punishments otherwise largely go up to 10 years. Properties related to crimes could be frozen or confiscated. 
The security legislation will supersede existing Hong Kong laws where there is a conflict and mainland Chinese authorities could exercise jurisdiction over some major cases. 
Interpretation powers belong to the Chinese parliament's top decision-making body.
Judges for security cases will be appointed by the city's chief executive.
According to the law, a new national security agency will be set up for the first time in Hong Kong and will not be under the jurisdiction of the local government. Authorities can carry out surveillance and wire-tap people suspected of endangering national security, it said.
Those asking foreign countries to sanction, blockade or take other hostile action against Hong Kong or China could be guilty of colluding with foreign forces. 
Authorities shall take necessary measures to strengthen the management and servicing of foreign countries' and international organisations' branches in Hong Kong, as well as foreign media and NGOs in the city, the law says.
""We can all start again,"" pro-Beijing heavyweight Maria Tam, a member of China’s National People’s Congress, told reporters.
Activists and pro-democracy politicians said they would defy a police ban on a rally on the handover anniversary on Wednesday.
""We will never accept the passing of the law, even though it is so overpowering,"" said Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai.
A majority in Hong Kong opposes the legislation, a poll conducted for Reuters this month showed, but support for the protests has fallen to only a slim majority. 
Dozens of supporters of Beijing popped champagne corks and waved Chinese flags in celebration in front of government headquarters.
""I'm very happy,"" said one elderly man, surnamed Lee.

""This will leave anti-China spies and people who brought chaos to Hong Kong with nowhere to go.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Tuesday deployed a helicopter and a dozen drones spraying insecticide to stop desert locusts that have spread to nine heartland states of the world's second-biggest producer of rice and wheat.
The move came after swarms invaded Gurugram, a satellite city of the capital New Delhi, during the weekend, prompting people to criticise authorities for not quickly containing the outbreak.
The government has also placed an order for five new helicopter-mounted spray systems from Britain to install in Indian Air Force helicopters, Agriculture & Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.
India, battling its worst desert locust outbreak for decades, pressed into service 12 drones to track the movement of locusts and spray insecticides on the swarms.
The Ministry of Civil Aviation has amended rules to allow state government officials to use drones at night, a step that experts have said may help neutralise the locusts.
The government had already been using specialist vehicles and fire engines for spraying operations in at least nine densely populated states in the north, centre and west.
The locust infestation has not caused significant damage so far because it has fallen in the lean season - the gap between the previous harvest and the next planting season. But some farmers have complained about crop losses in a few districts of the desert state of Rajasthan.
The federal government said it had provided financial assistance to the Rajasthan government against the locusts.
It said representatives from India, Iran, Pakistan and Afghanistan have had weekly talks to try to stem locust swarms across the wider region.

The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization has warned of a new wave of locusts coming across the Indian Ocean from Somalia just as farmers are planting an array of summer crops.

Maduro's decision on Monday to give the EU envoy, Isabel Brilhante Pedrosa, 72 hours to leave the country followed fresh European financial sanctions on 11 Venezuela officials who the bloc accuses of hindering Venezuela's National Assembly. 
""The EU firmly condemns this decision and profoundly regrets the further international isolation that will result,"" the 27 governments of the bloc said in a statement. ""We call for this decision to be reversed.""
Separately, the EU said it would summon the Venezuelan ambassador in Brussels. The bloc's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said on Twitter that he would take ""the usual necessary measure of reciprocity.""
An EU spokeswoman declined to give more details.
While the EU is among Western parties pushing for fresh elections, the dispute is likely to make a negotiated diplomatic solution to Venezuela's crisis even harder. The EU reiterated on Tuesday that a way out ""must be based on credible elections."" 
The bloc earlier this month said a decision by the South American nation's Supreme Court in May to ratify an ally of Maduro as president of the National Assembly was illegitimate. 
The EU believes opposition leader Juan Guaido is the rightful congressional president following his election by the majority of members in January, not the court-approved Luis Parra.
Parra was among those named in Monday's sanctions, along with Franklyn Duarte and Jose Gregorio Noriega, who were named as vice-presidents of the assembly in the May court ruling.

The EU said the new list took the number of Venezuelan officials under travel bans and asset freezes to 36.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Halkbank will ask the U.S. judge overseeing a criminal case accusing it of helping Iran evade American sanctions to recuse himself, a lawyer for the Turkish bank said on Tuesday.
The lawyer, Robert Cary, notified U.S. District Judge Richard Berman of Halkbank's intention at a hearing, without providing a reason. Berman set a July 14 deadline for a formal request.
Halkbank and its lawyers declined to comment.
U.S. prosecutors have accused Halkbank and bank executives of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates to evade sanctions. 
They said improper transactions included letting revenue from oil and gas sales be spent on gold, and facilitating sham food and medicine purchases.
Halkbank pleaded not guilty on March 31 to bank fraud, money laundering and four conspiracy charges.
Berman has overseen several related cases, including the January 2018 conviction of former Halkbank executive Mehmet Hakan Atilla and a guilty plea by Reza Zarrab, a wealthy Turkish-Iranian gold trader who testified against Atilla.
Before pleading guilty, Zarrab unsuccessfully sought Berman's recusal, citing comments by the judge at a 2014 conference in Istanbul.
Halkbank's case gained renewed attention in June when John Bolton, a former national security adviser for U.S. President Donald Trump, discussed it in his new memoir.
Bolton said Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan gave Trump a memo saying Halkbank was innocent, and Trump told Erdogan in 2018 he would intervene and the problem would be ""fixed"" once prosecutors were replaced.
Former U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan, whose office has overseen the case, was fired on June 20. 
Last Wednesday, Turkey said Bolton's book contained misleading presentations of Erdogan's conversations with Trump.
No trial date for Halkbank has been set.
Cary requested March 2022, citing the coronavirus pandemic and the ""vast majority"" of witnesses being overseas.
U.S. prosecutor Michael Lockard proposed February 2021. ""This is not a case where we are starting from scratch,"" he said, citing the Atilla case.

The case is U.S. v. Halkbank, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 15-cr-00867.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union has excluded the United States from its initial ""safe list"" of countries from which the bloc will allow non-essential travel from Wednesday.
The 27-member bloc gave approval on Tuesday to leisure or business travel from 14 countries beyond its borders, the Council of the EU, which represents EU governments, said in a statement.
The countries are Algeria, Australia, Canada, Georgia, Japan, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Rwanda, Serbia, South Korea, Thailand, Tunisia and Uruguay.
China has also been provisionally approved, although travel would only open up if Chinese authorities also allowed in EU visitors. Reciprocity is a condition of being on the list.
Russia, Brazil and Turkey, along with the United States, are among countries whose containment of the virus is considered worse than the EU average, and so will have to wait at least two weeks for approval. The bloc will carry out fortnightly reviews.
The move is aimed at supporting the EU travel industry and tourist destinations, particularly countries in southern Europe hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The list needed a ""qualified majority"" of EU countries to be passed, meaning 15 EU countries representing 65% of the population.
It acts as a recommendation to EU members, meaning they could potentially set restrictions on those entering from the 14 nations and will almost certainly not allow access to travellers from other countries.
Within hours of the EU announcement, Italy, which has one of the highest COVID death tolls in the world, said it would opt out and keep quarantine restrictions in place for all nations that were not part of the free-travel Schengen area.
""The global situation remains very complex. We must prevent the sacrifices made by the Italians in recent months have been in vain,"" Italy Health Minister Roberto Speranza said.

The EU's efforts to reopen internal borders, particularly within the 26-nation Schengen area which normally has no frontier checks, have been patchy as various countries have restricted access for certain visitors.

More than 19,000 new cases of the new coronavirus have been recorded since Duterte eased one of the toughest and longest lockdowns in the world for residents in the capital Manila from June 1 to breathe some life back into the economy.
The Philippines, which before the pandemic was one of Asia’s fastest growing economies, is facing its biggest contraction in more than three decades after the coronavirus shuttered businesses and crushed domestic demand.
Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez said restrictions in Manila, which accounts for 40% of the country's gross domestic product, should be loosened further ""as quickly as possible"" so more business will start humming again and more people can go back to work.
Most businesses in the capital have been allowed to reopen but in a limited capacity.
""The reality today is that the virus is not going to go away and we will have to live with it for a very long time,"" Dominguez said.
Duterte also said in a late televised address strict lockdown measures, which were reinstated in Cebu City from June 16, would be maintained to slow the spread of the virus in the country's fifth most populous city.
Cebu city now accounts for over 12% of the nationwide tally of confirmed coronavirus cases, making it the new hot spot of infections in the Southeast Asian country.
The country's confirmed cases totalled 37,514 as of June 30, while the number of fatalities has reached 1,266.
Health authorities have conducted more than 666,000 tests since January, or 0.62% of the 107 million population, still below the government's 1.5% target.

But Harry Roque, the president's spokesman said in a media briefing on Tuesday that the government was ""winning"" the fight against the coronavirus.

The regulator said RT had tried to portray Latvia as a failed country and that Latvia's security services saw RT as the most influential Russian propaganda channel in the west of Europe.
Seven RT channels - RT, which shows news and current affairs programmes, RT HD, RT Arabic, RT Spanish, RT Documentary, RT Documentary HD, and RT TV were taken off-air because they are controlled by Kiselyov, head of the Russian Federal State news agency Rossiya Segodnya, who has been sanctioned by the EU since 2014, the watchdog said.
""We have made the decision based on the information at our disposal that these (TV) programmes are under de facto control of Dmitry Kiselyov,"" said the watchdog's chairman Ivars Abolins in a statement.
Kiselyov became subject to EU sanctions in March 2014 due to his role in ""government propaganda supporting the deployment of Russian forces in Ukraine"" the EU said at the time. 
""Our evidence is very convincing, and we will ask all the regulators within the EU to follow our example and to ban RT in their territory,"" Abolins added. 
RT said in a statement given to Reuters: ""we congratulate Latvia's secret services and national media council on finally being able to defend the country's entire Arab and Spanish speaking population from RT, 'the most influential Russian propaganda channel'."" 
Kiselyov told Russian news agency RIA, ""This decision is an indicator of the level of stupidity and ignorance of the Latvian authorities, blinded by Russophobia... the declared basis for the ban has no legal sense, therefore Latvia should immediately return RT broadcasting to the air.""
Latvia's watchdog previously suspended several Russian TV channels, saying they had spread false and misleading information or propaganda about the country's history and claimed that the rights of Russian speakers are being violated in Latvia.

About 30 percent of Latvia's population speaks Russian as a first language. Most Russian speakers are ethnic Russians. Latvia also has domestic broadcasting in Russian.

More than 5,300 Swedes have died compared to around 250 in Norway, 600 in Denmark and 325 in Finland, all of which have populations around half the size. 
Sweden, unlike the rest of Scandinavia, chose not to close schools and businesses to fight the spread of the virus. 
""It is not a question of whether Sweden is going to change as a result of this - the question is how,"" Prime Minister Stefan Lofven told a news conference.
The commission has a broad mandate to look at how the virus arrived in Sweden, how it spread, the government's and other authorities' response, and the effect on equality.
Sweden's response to the virus outbreak, which has relied mainly on voluntary measures and common sense hygiene rules, has led to its being snubbed by its neighbours and other countries in Europe that have kept their borders shut to Swedish tourists.
Its toll is still lower than in some European countries, such as Britain, which has one of the worst death rates in the world.
Criticism in Sweden has focused mainly on the death toll among elderly residents of care homes, who make up the majority of deaths from the virus, and the late start to widespread testing.
The head of the Public Health Agency says Sweden followed established practice.
Anders Tegnell, who has become the face of Sweden's virus strategy, told Reuters it remained unclear whether total lockdowns were effective.

The commission will report on elderly care at the end of November, although its final conclusions are not due until 2022, ahead of a national election.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin made a last-ditch appeal to Russians on Tuesday to vote for constitutional changes that would allow him to run again for president twice, potentially extending his rule until 2036.
Putin spoke at the scene of a series of bloody World War Two battles on the eve of the main and last day of a seven-day nationwide vote that would change the constitution for the first time since 1993, a move critics have likened to a legal coup.
""We are not just voting for amendments. We are voting for the country in which we want to live ...for a country for whose sake we are working and want to pass onto our children,"" said Putin in front of a monument of a Red Army soldier he had just unveiled on a hill in the town of Rzhev in western Russia.
Putin made no mention of how the changes could affect his own career. That is consistent with the official get-out-the-vote campaign which has stressed other amendments instead.
State exit polls suggest the changes will be backed by over two thirds of voters, allowing the 67-year-old former KGB officer - if he wishes - to run for another two six-year, back-to-back stints after his current term expires in 2024.
He has already led Russia for more than two decades.
At 60%, according to the Levada pollster, his approval rating remains high but well down on its peak of nearly 90%.
Putin has said he has yet to take a final decision on his future, though critics are convinced he will run again. However, some analysts believe he has yet to decide, and wants to keep his options open so as not to become a lame duck.
""WORLD CLASS LEADER""
Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed head of Chechnya, a mainly Muslim republic in Russia's Caucasus region, told aides that Putin should be made president for life.
""Right now who can replace him?"" said Kadyrov. ""There's no such world class leader and we should be proud of that.""
With Russia still reporting thousands of new COVID-19 cases every day, opponents have been unable to stage protests but they have mocked the vote online, saying it is a farce whose outcome has already been decided by the authorities.
Putin has said he wants a clean vote, something election officials have pledged to deliver.
Critics have shared photographs of makeshift polling stations set up in apartment stairwells, courtyards and in the boot of a parked car.
""We'll fall ill and die - but we'll deliver the votes for Putin,"" joked allies of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, posting a video of a vote being held in a stairwell in Siberia near a flat where a coronavirus case had been registered.
The Communist Party, which has advised supporters to vote ""no"" to the changes, complained of irregularities at two Moscow polling stations, where it said the number of registered home voters was 10 times higher than normal.
In one video shared on social media on Tuesday, two policemen were seen wrestling to the ground a journalist observing a polling station in St Petersburg. He screamed out in pain after his arm was pinned behind his back. 

Golos, a non-governmental organisation that monitors elections, said it was already clear it would not be able to confirm the vote's outcome as legitimate.

Waving Sudanese flags, protesters gathered in Khartoum and its twin cities Khartoum North and Omdurman after the government closed roads and bridges leading to the centre of the capital.
Similar protests took also place in Kassala in eastern Sudan and in the restive region of Darfur. They chanted ""freedom, peace and justice"", the slogan of the anti-Bashir movement. Some protesters blocked streets with burning tyres.
Premier Abdalla Hamdok, a technocrat, governs the country in awkward tandem with the long dominant military that helped remove Bashir after mass protests against his 30-year autocracy.
An opposition coalition agreed to joint governance with the military in a two-year transition towards free elections but key parts of the deal have not been implemented, such as appointing civilian state governors and establishing a parliament.
Hamdok's government has been preoccupied with a worsening economic crisis that has seen a plunge in Sudan's pound currency diving and annual inflation topping 100%. 
Last week, foreign donor nations pledged $1.8 billion at a conference hosted by Germany to help Sudan overcome the economic crisis hampering its transition. But the pledges were well below the $8 billion in aid Hamdok has said is needed.
The crisis has been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic, which has diverted the resources of many donors.
Hamdok sought to appease disgruntled citizens with a speech Monday night in which he said he would announce major decisions on the way forward within two weeks. 
He gave no details, but added: ""The transitional government ...(is) aiming to achieve the highest levels of consensus and popular approval.""

Hamdok is also pursuing peace talks with rebel groups across the sprawling country but no deal is in sight.

Representatives of Guyana asked judges at the United Nations court, formally known as the International Court of Justice (ICJ), to confirm that the border was laid down in an 1899 arbitration between Venezuela and the then-colony of British Guiana.
""We are here today because contrary to international law and to the biding award of 1899, our neighbour to the west (Venezuela), has cultivated a nationalist passion to...lay claim to almost three quarters of Guyana,"" Guyana's representative before the court, Shridath Ramphal, told judges.
Venezuela did not respond as it is not participating in the proceedings. It argues the ICJ does not have jurisdiction.
The dispute over the territory - a massive, sparsely populated area west of Guyana's Essequibo River - was revived in recent years after oil was discovered offshore. 
In 2018, Venezuela's navy intercepted an Exxon (NYSE:XOM) ship exploring for oil on behalf of Guyana in waters that are jointly claimed by the two countries.
The ICJ is the United Nation's court for resolving disputes between states.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A former Atlanta police officer who shot a Black man twice in the back, touching off mass demonstrations and the burning of the fast-food restaurant where the killing occurred, is scheduled to face a judge on Tuesday for a bond hearing.
Garret Rolfe, 27, is charged with felony murder and 10 other offenses in the June 12 shooting of Rayshard Brooks at a Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) parking lot in south Atlanta. The incident, caught on surveillance and cellphone video, was widely viewed on social media.
In a motion filed on Monday, attorneys for Rolfe argued he deserved to be released on bond because he was a ""longstanding, law-abiding member of the community, who will stay here to fight this case.""
The motion said there was strong evidence in Rolfe's defense, asserting the former officer was legally justified in using deadly force as he was acting in self-defense.
The death of Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, heightened tensions over police brutality and racism stoked by the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
Before the deadly encounter, Brooks was found sleeping in his car in the Wendy's drive-thru, and had failed a sobriety test. He tussled with Rolfe and another police officer, wrested away one of their taser stun guns and ran, officials said. He appeared to fire the taser toward the officers, and was then shot twice in the back with one bullet piercing his heart as he fled.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard has pursued the case aggressively, arguing that Brooks was not a threat.
Rolfe was fired and has been held without bond at the Gwinnett County jail. A second officer, Devin Brosnan, 26, was placed on administrative duty and charged with aggravated assault. The city's police chief resigned after the incident.

The anti-corruption minister said on Tuesday that he had assigned a public watchdog to look into the issue and report back within three weeks, and that Fakhfakh had promised to step down if investigators found wrongdoing. 
The row comes as Tunisia tries to put state finances on a sounder footing after years of deficit spending and mounting public debt - issues the coronavirus crisis has turbo-charged. 
Fakhfakh became prime minister only in February after September's election produced a fractured parliament in which no party took more than a quarter of the seats, leading to months of wrangling to form a coalition. 
""The prime minister said that if the error is proven he will resign - and this means the whole government will resign,"" said the anti-corruption minister, Mohamed Abbou. 
Last week an independent member of parliament published documents indicating that companies Fakhfakh owns shares in had won deals worth 44 million dinars ($15 million) from the state. 
Fakhfakh told parliament he was ready to resign if any violation was proved, but added that he had sold his shares in the companies and rejected accusations of corruption. 
The state anti-corruption commission has said Fakhfakh did not inform it that companies where he has shares had commercial deals with the state. Its head, Chawki Tbib, told parliament the firms' contracts with the state should be cancelled.
Abd Karim Harouni, a senior official in Ennahda, a moderate Islamist party that is in the coalition and commands the most seats in parliament, said Ennahda was awaiting the results of investigations. 
The coalition has previously been troubled by disputes among its members, which include parties with opposing political ideologies and views on key issues such as economic reform.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani airline pilots and their union have raised questions about a government list of 262 pilots with ""dubious"" credentials, saying it is full of discrepancies.
Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan announced last week the grounding of 262 airline pilots suspected of dodging their exams, a move that caused global concern.
The minister said the pilots included 141 from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), nine from Air Blue, 10 from Serene Airline, and 17 from Shaheen Airlines.
The PIA said the list showed discrepancies once the airlines received it. Thirty-six of the 141 had either retired or moved out, it said. Air Blue said seven of the pilots on the list no longer worked for the airline.
The pilots and their union have rejected the list and demanded a judicial investigation. 
""We don't have full details of the discrepancies with us,"" said Abdul Sattar Khokhar, a spokesman at Pakistan's civil aviation ministry. ""The issue is being sorted out in consultation with airlines and civil aviation authorities."" 
The Pakistan Airlines Pilots Association (PALPA) has also raised doubts about the list. 
""It contains names of highly educated and qualified pilots who have passed all the tests,"" its president, Chaudhry Salman, told Reuters. ""We want a fair and impartial resolution to this matter."" 

The action on the ""dubious"" licences was prompted by the preliminary report on an airliner crash in Karachi that killed 97 people last month. It found the plane's pilots failed to follow standard procedures and disregarded alarms.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will boost defence spending by nearly 40% over the next 10 years as Canberra shifts its military assets to focus on the Indo-Pacific region, Prime Minister Scott Morrison will say on Wednesday.
In a speech that threatens to inflame tensions with China, Morrison will say Australia will spend A$270 billion ($184.8 billion) over the next 10 years to acquire longer-range strike capabilities across air, sea and land.
In 2016, Australia promised to spend A$195 billion over the next 10 years.
Morrison will say that Australia's defence policy will also pivot to prioritise the Indo-Pacific region, an area that he will describe as the ""epicentre of rising strategic competition.""
""We want an open, sovereign Indo-Pacific, free from coercion and hegemony. We want a region where all countries, large and small, can engage freely with each other, guided by international rules and norms,"" Morrison will say, according to excepts sent to Reuters.
Morrison will not name China specifically but Australia's military shift to Indo-Pacific comes amid rising competition between the two for influence in the Pacific.
Already elevated by Australia's 2018 decision to ban China's Huawei from its nascent 5G broadband network, bilateral ties have in recent months been soured by Canberra's call for an independent inquiry into the origins of coronavirus.

LYON, France (Reuters) - The coronavirus lockdown persuaded retired speech therapist Anne-Marie Arnaud a better future could be had, one with emptier skies, fresher air and quieter streets rid of diesel-belching cars.
And so the pensioner from Lyon switched her vote in last Sunday's municipal election, among the first worldwide to be held after countries began emerging from lockdown, in favour of the Green party.
The results, which saw the Greens take control of or become an alliance partner in no fewer than 11 city halls, may point to a broader shift in voting patterns as governments, companies, and citizens adjust to the COVID-19 era.
""I realised how clean the air was, how nice it was to walk in a city, and be awoken by birdsong rather than car horns,"" Arnaud, 64, said. ""I told myself there was good in this crisis and that we had to rethink our city in a different way.""
Certainly, support for the party officially known as European Ecology - The Greens (EELV) was already growing. 
With no lawmakers in France's parliament and only four staff in its Paris headquarters, the Green party performed more better than expected in last year's European Parliament elections, polling third with 13.5% of the vote.
Over the past couple of years, they have made strides elsewhere in Europe too.
In Germany, the Greens are the second most popular political party though have sunk into the background during the pandemic, while they are junior partners in Ireland's new coalition government, as well as in Austria. 
GREEN WAVE 
But the pandemic is forcing a rethink of how we live our lives: from the future of global supply chains to how we work in offices, from how we plan our cities to the food we eat, 
""That played a part,"" Julien Bayou, leader of the Greens in France, told Reuters of his party's success in the elections.
In Lyon, Green candidate Gregory Doucet won 52.4% of Sunday's vote, wrestling control from Gerard Collomb, the veteran socialist mayor of France's third biggest city who was representing President Emmanuel Macron's ruling party.
He did so on a campaign platform to create a 450 kilometre-long network of cycle highways, widen pavements for pedestrians, source 50% of school food locally and build more social housing. 
From Bordeaux in the southwest to Strasbourg in the east, Sunday's green wave engulfed cities large and small across France. In Paris, too, they joined forces with the socialist incumbent re-elected on a promise to cut pollution.
In Lyon, Doucet's campaign chief Ninon Guinel said the coronavirus crisis had exposed the fragility of Western economies and the need to unwind the excesses of globalisation.

MONTGOMERY, Alabama (Reuters) - Judge Les Hayes once sentenced a single mother to 496 days behind bars for failing to pay traffic tickets. The sentence was so stiff it exceeded the jail time Alabama allows for negligent homicide.

“Judge Hayes took away my life and didn’t care how my children suffered,” said Johnson, now 36. “My girls will never be the same.”
Fellow inmates found her sentence hard to believe. “They had a nickname for me: The Woman with All the Days,” Johnson said. “That’s what they called me: The Woman with All the Days. There were people who had committed real crimes who got out before me.”
In 2016, the state agency that oversees judges charged Hayes with violating Alabama’s code of judicial conduct. According to the Judicial Inquiry Commission, Hayes broke state and federal laws by jailing Johnson and hundreds of other Montgomery residents too poor to pay fines. Among those jailed: a plumber struggling to make rent, a mother who skipped meals to cover the medical bills of her disabled son, and a hotel housekeeper working her way through college.
Hayes, a judge since 2000, admitted in court documents to violating 10 different parts of the state’s judicial conduct code. One of the counts was a breach of a judge’s most essential duty: failing to “respect and comply with the law.”
Despite the severity of the ruling, Hayes wasn’t barred from serving as a judge. Instead, the judicial commission and Hayes reached a deal. The former Eagle Scout would serve an 11-month unpaid suspension. Then he could return to the bench. 
Until he was disciplined, Hayes said in an interview with Reuters, “I never thought I was doing something wrong.” 
This week, Hayes is set to retire after 20 years as a judge. In a statement to Reuters, Hayes said he was “very remorseful” for his misdeeds. 
Community activists say his departure is long overdue. Yet the decision to leave, they say, should never have been his to make, given his record of misconduct. 
“He should have been fired years ago,” said Willie Knight, pastor of North Montgomery Baptist Church. “He broke the law and wanted to get away with it. His sudden retirement is years too late.”
Hayes is among thousands of state and local judges across America who were allowed to keep positions of extraordinary power and prestige after violating judicial ethics rules or breaking laws they pledged to uphold, a Reuters investigation found.
Judges have made racist statements, lied to state officials and forced defendants to languish in jail without a lawyer – and then returned to the bench, sometimes with little more than a rebuke from the state agencies overseeing their conduct.
Recent media reports have documented failures in judicial oversight in South Carolina, Louisiana and Illinois. Reuters went further. 
In the first comprehensive accounting of judicial misconduct nationally, Reuters reviewed 1,509 cases from the last dozen years – 2008 through 2019 – in which judges resigned, retired or were publicly disciplined following accusations of misconduct. In addition, reporters identified another 3,613 cases from 2008 through 2018 in which states disciplined wayward judges but kept hidden from the public key details of their offenses – including the identities of the judges themselves. 
All told, 9 of every 10 judges were allowed to return to the bench after they were sanctioned for misconduct, Reuters determined. They included a California judge who had sex in his courthouse chambers, once with his former law intern and separately with an attorney; a New York judge who berated domestic violence victims; and a Maryland judge who, after his arrest for driving drunk, was allowed to return to the bench provided he took a Breathalyzer test before each appearance.
The news agency’s findings reveal an “excessively” forgiving judicial disciplinary system, said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University who writes about judicial ethics. Although punishment short of removal from the bench is appropriate for most misconduct cases, Gillers said, the public “would be appalled at some of the lenient treatment judges get” for substantial transgressions.
Among the cases from the past year alone: 
In Utah, a judge texted a video of a man’s scrotum to court clerks. He was reprimanded but remains on the bench. 
In Indiana, three judges attending a conference last spring got drunk and sparked a 3 a.m. brawl outside a White Castle fast-food restaurant that ended with two of the judges shot. Although the state supreme court found the three judges had “discredited the entire Indiana judiciary,” each returned to the bench after a suspension. 
In Texas, a judge burst in on jurors deliberating the case of a woman charged with sex trafficking and declared that God told him the defendant was innocent. The offending judge received a warning and returned to the bench. The defendant was convicted after a new judge took over the case.
“There are certain things where there should be a level of zero tolerance,” the jury foreman, Mark House, told Reuters. The judge should have been fined, House said, and kicked off the bench. “There is no justice, because he is still doing his job.”
Judicial misconduct specialists say such behavior has the potential to erode trust in America’s courts and, absent tough consequences, could give judges license to behave with impunity.
“When you see cases like that, the public starts to wonder about the integrity and honesty of the system,” said Steve Scheckman, a lawyer who directed Louisiana’s oversight agency and served as deputy director of New York’s. “It looks like a good ol’ boys club.”
That’s how local lawyers viewed the case of a longtime Alabama judge who concurrently served on the state’s judicial oversight commission. The judge, Cullman District Court’s Kim Chaney, remained on the bench for three years after being accused of violating the same nepotism rules he was tasked with enforcing on the oversight commission. In at least 200 cases, court records show, Judge Chaney chose his own son to serve as a court-appointed defense lawyer for the indigent, enabling the younger Chaney to earn at least $105,000 in fees over two years.
In February, months after Reuters repeatedly asked Chaney and the state judicial commission about those cases, he retired from the bench as part of a deal with state authorities to end the investigation.
Tommy Drake, the lawyer who first filed a complaint against Chaney in 2016, said he doubts the judge would have been forced from the bench if Reuters hadn’t examined the case. 
“You know the only reason they did anything about Chaney is because you guys started asking questions,” Drake said. “Otherwise, he’d still be there.”
BEDROCK OF AMERICAN JUSTICE
State and local judges draw little scrutiny even though their courtrooms are the bedrock of the American criminal justice system, touching the lives of millions of people every year. 
The country’s approximately 1,700 federal judges hear 400,000 cases annually. The nearly 30,000 state, county and municipal court judges handle a far bigger docket: more than 100 million new cases each year, from traffic to divorce to murder. Their titles range from justice of the peace to state supreme court justice. Their powers are vast and varied – from determining whether a defendant should be jailed to deciding who deserves custody of a child. 
Each U.S. state has an oversight agency that investigates misconduct complaints against judges. The authority of the oversight agencies is distinct from the power held by appellate courts, which can reverse a judge’s legal ruling and order a new trial. Judicial commissions cannot change verdicts. Rather, they can investigate complaints about the behavior of judges and pursue discipline ranging from reprimand to removal.
Few experts dispute that the great majority of judges behave responsibly, respecting the law and those who appear before them. And some contend that, when judges do falter, oversight agencies are effective in identifying and addressing the behavior. “With a few notable exceptions, the commissions generally get it right,” said Keith Swisher, a University of Arizona law professor who specializes in judicial ethics.
Others disagree. They note that the clout of these commissions is limited, and their authority differs from state to state. To remove a judge, all but a handful of states require approval of a panel that includes other judges. And most states seldom exercise the full extent of those disciplinary powers.
As a result, the system tends to err on the side of protecting the rights and reputations of judges while overlooking the impact courtroom wrongdoing has on those most affected by it: people like Marquita Johnson.
Reuters scoured thousands of state investigative files, disciplinary proceedings and court records from the past dozen years to quantify the personal toll of judicial misconduct. The examination found at least 5,206 people who were directly affected by a judge’s misconduct. The victims cited in disciplinary documents ranged from people who were illegally jailed to those subjected to racist, sexist and other abusive comments from judges in ways that tainted the cases.
The number is a conservative estimate. The tally doesn’t include two previously reported incidents that affected thousands of defendants and prompted sweeping reviews of judicial conduct.
In Pennsylvania, the state examined the convictions of more than 3,500 teenagers sentenced by two judges. The judges were convicted of taking kickbacks as part of a scheme to fill a private juvenile detention center. In 2009, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court appointed senior judge Arthur Grim to lead a victim review, and the state later expunged criminal records for 2,251 juveniles. Grim told Reuters that every state should adopt a way to compensate victims of judicial misconduct.
“If we have a system that holds a wrongdoer accountable but we fail to address the victims, then we are really losing sight of what a justice system should be all about,” Grim said.
In another review underway in Ohio, state public defender Tim Young is scrutinizing 2,707 cases handled by a judge who retired in 2018 after being hospitalized for alcoholism. Mike Benza, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University whose students are helping identify victims, compared the work to current investigations into police abuse of power. “You see one case and then you look to see if it's systemic,” he said.
The review, which has been limited during the coronavirus pandemic, may take a year. But Young said the time-consuming task is essential because “a fundamental injustice may have been levied against hundreds or thousands of people.”
SPECIAL RULES FOR JUDGES
Most states afford judges accused of misconduct a gentle kind of justice. Perhaps no state better illustrates the shortcomings of America’s system for overseeing judges than Alabama.
As in most states, Alabama’s nine-member Judicial Inquiry Commission is a mix of lawyers, judges and lay people. All are appointed. Their deliberations are secret and they operate under some of the most judge-friendly rules in the nation.
Alabama’s rules make even filing a complaint against a judge difficult. The complaint must be notarized, which means that in theory, anyone who makes misstatements about the judge can be prosecuted for perjury. Complaints about wrongdoing must be made in writing; those that arrive by phone, email or without a notary stamp are not investigated, although senders are notified why their complaints have been summarily rejected. Anonymous written complaints are shredded.
These rules can leave lawyers and litigants fearing retaliation, commission director Jenny Garrett noted in response to written questions. 
“It’s a ridiculous system that protects judges and makes it easy for them to intimidate anyone with a legitimate complaint,” said Sue Bell Cobb, chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court from 2007 to 2011. In 2009, she unsuccessfully championed changes to the process and commissioned an American Bar Association report that offered a scathing review of Alabama's rules.
In most other states, commission staff members can start investigating a judge upon receiving a phone call or email, even anonymous ones, or after learning of questionable conduct from a news report or court filing. In Alabama, staff will not begin an investigation without approval from the commission itself, which convenes about every seven weeks.
By rule, the commission also must keep a judge who is under scrutiny fully informed throughout an investigation. If a subpoena is issued, the judge receives a simultaneous copy, raising fears about witness intimidation. If a witness gives investigators a statement, the judge receives a transcript. In the U.S. justice system, such deference to individuals under investigation is extremely rare.
“Why the need for special rules for judges?” said Michael Levy, a Washington lawyer who has represented clients in high-profile criminal, corporate, congressional and securities investigations. “If judges think it’s fair and appropriate to investigate others for crimes or misconduct without providing those subjects or targets with copies of witness statements and subpoenas, why don’t judges think it’s fair to investigate judges in the same way?” 
Alabama judges also are given an opportunity to resolve investigations confidentially. Reuters interviews and a review of Alabama commission records show the commission has met with judges informally at least 19 times since 2011 to offer corrective “guidance.” The identities of those judges remain confidential, as does the conduct that prompted the meetings. “Not every violation warrants discipline,” commission director Garrett said.
Since 2008, the commission has brought 21 public cases against judges, including Hayes, charging two this year. 
Two of the best-known cases brought by the commission involved Roy Moore, who was twice forced out as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court for defying federal court orders.
Another Alabama justice fared better in challenging a misconduct complaint, however. Tom Parker, first elected to the state’s high court in 2004, pushed back when the commission investigated him in 2015 for comments he made on the radio criticizing the U.S. Supreme Court's decision legalizing gay marriage. 
Parker sued the commission in federal court, arguing the agency was infringing on his First Amendment rights. He won. Although the commission had dropped its investigation before the ruling, it was ordered to cover Parker’s legal fees: $100,000, or about a fifth of the agency’s total annual budget.
In 2018, the people of Alabama elected Parker chief justice.
These days, Parker told Reuters, Alabama judges and the agency that oversees them enjoy “a much better relationship” that’s less politically tinged. “How can I say it? It’s much more respectful between the commission and the judges now.” 
""GUT INSTINCT""
Montgomery, Alabama has a deep history of racial conflict, as reflected in the clashing concepts emblazoned on the city’s great seal: “Cradle of the Confederacy” and “Birthplace of the Civil Rights Movement.”
Jefferson Davis was inaugurated here as Confederate president after the South seceded from the Union in 1861, and his birthday is a state holiday. As was common throughout the South, the city was the site of the lynchings of Black men, crimes now commemorated at a national memorial based here. Police arrested civil rights icon Rosa Parks here in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a city bus to a white passenger.
Today, about 60% of Montgomery’s 198,000 residents are Black, U.S. census records show. Even so, Black motorists account for about 90% of those charged with unpaid traffic tickets, a Reuters examination of court records found. Much of Judge Hayes’ work in municipal court involved traffic cases and the collection of fines. Hayes, who is white, told Reuters that “the majority of people who come before the court are Black.”
City officials have said that neither race nor economics have played a role in police efforts to enforce outstanding warrants, no matter how minor the offense.
In April 2012, Marquita Johnson was among them. Appearing before Hayes on a Wednesday morning, the 28-year-old single mother pleaded for a break. 
Johnson had struggled for eight years to pay dozens of tickets that began with a citation for failing to show proof of insurance. She had insurance, she said. But when she was pulled over, she couldn’t find the card to prove it.
Even a single ticket was a knockout blow on her minimum-wage waitress salary. In addition to fines, the court assessed a $155 fee to every ticket. Court records show that police often issued her multiple tickets for other infractions during every stop – a practice some residents call “stacking.”
Under state law, failing to pay even one ticket can result in the suspension of a driver’s license. Johnson’s decision to keep driving nonetheless – taking her children to school or to doctor visits, getting groceries, going to work – led to more tickets and deeper debt. 
“I told Judge Hayes that I had lost my job and needed more time to pay,” she recounted.
By Hayes’ calculation, Johnson owed more than $12,000 in fines. He sentenced Johnson to 496 days in jail. Hayes arrived at that sentence by counting each day in jail as $25 toward the outstanding debt. A different judge later determined that Johnson actually owed half the amount calculated by Hayes, and that Hayes had incorrectly penalized her over fines she had already paid. To shave time off her sentence, Johnson washed police cars and performed other menial labor while jailed.
Hayes told Reuters that he generally found pleas of poverty hard to believe. “With my years of experience, I can tell when someone is being truthful with me,” Hayes said. He called it “gut instinct” - though he added, in a statement this week, that he also consulted “each defendant's criminal and traffic history as well as their history of warrants and failures to appear in court.” 
Of course, the law demands more of a judge than a gut call. In a 1983 landmark decision, Bearden v. Georgia, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state judges are obligated to hold a hearing to determine whether a defendant has “willfully” chosen not to pay a fine. 
According to the state’s judicial oversight commission, “Judge Hayes did not make any inquiry into Ms. Johnson’s ability to pay, whether her non-payment was willful.” 
From jail, “I prayed to return to my daughters,” Johnson said. “I was sure that someone would realize that Hayes had made a mistake.”
She said her worst day in jail was her youngest daughter’s 3rd birthday. From a jail telephone, she tried to sing “Happy Birthday” but slumped to the floor in grief.
“She was choking up and crying,” said Johnson’s mother, Blanche, who was on the call. “She was devastated to be away from her children so long.”
When Johnson was freed after 10 months in jail, she learned that strangers had abused her two older children. One is now a teenager; the other is in middle school. 
“My kids will pay a lifetime for what the court system did to me,” Johnson said. “My daughters get frantic when I leave the house. I know they’ve had nightmares that I’m going to disappear again.”
Six months after Johnson’s release, Hayes jailed another single Black mother. Angela McCullough, then 40, had been pulled over driving home from Faulkner University, a local community college where she carried a 3.87 grade point average. As a mother of four children, including a disabled adult son, she had returned to college to pursue her dream of becoming a mental health counselor. 
Police ticketed her for failing to turn on her headlights. After a background check, the officer arrested McCullough on a warrant for outstanding traffic tickets. She was later brought before Hayes.
“I can’t go to jail,” McCullough recalled pleading with the judge. “I’m a mother. I have a disabled son who needs me.”
Hayes sentenced McCullough to 100 days in jail to pay off a court debt of $1,350, court records show. Her adult son, diagnosed with schizophrenia, was held in an institution until her release.
McCullough said she cleaned jail cells in return for time off her sentence. One day, she recalled, she had to clean a blood-soaked cell where a female inmate had slit her wrists. 
She was freed after 20 days, using the money she saved for tuition to pay off her tickets, she said.
Jail was the darkest chapter of her life, McCullough said, a place where “the devil was trying to take my mind.” Today, she has abandoned her pursuit of a degree. “I don’t think I’ll ever be able to afford to go back.” 
A clear sign that something was amiss in Montgomery courts came in November 2013, when a federal lawsuit was filed alleging that city judges were unlawfully jailing the poor. A similar suit was filed in 2014, and two more civil rights cases were filed in 2015. Johnson and McCullough were plaintiffs. 
The lawsuits detailed practices similar to those that helped fuel protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after a white police officer killed a Black teenager in 2014. In a scathing report on the origins of the unrest, the U.S. Department of Justice exposed how Ferguson had systematically used traffic enforcement to raise revenue through excessive fines, a practice that fell disproportionately hard on Black residents. 
“Montgomery is just like Ferguson,” said Karen Jones, a community activist and founder of a local educational nonprofit. Jones has led recent protests in Montgomery in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, the Black man whose death under the knee of a cop in Minneapolis set off worldwide calls for racial justice. 
In Montgomery, “everybody knew that the police targeted Black residents. And I sat in Hayes’ court and watched him squeeze poor people for more money, then toss them in jail where they had to work off debts with free labor to the city.”
It was years before the flurry of civil rights lawsuits against Hayes and his fellow judges had much impact on the commission. The oversight agency opened its Hayes case in summer 2015, nearly two years after plaintiffs’ lawyers in the civil rights cases filed a complaint with the body. Hayes spent another year and a half on the bench before accepting the suspension. 
Under its own rules, the commission could have filed a complaint and told its staff to investigate Hayes at any time. Commission director Garrett said she is prohibited by law from explaining why the commission didn’t investigate sooner. The investigation went slowly, Garrett said, because it involved reviewing thousands of pages of court records. The commission also was busy with other cases from 2015 to early 2017, Garrett said, issuing charges against five judges, including Moore. 
""SLAP IN THE FACE""
A few months after Judge Hayes’ suspension ended, his term as a municipal judge was set to expire. So, the Montgomery City Council took up the question of the judge’s future on March 6, 2018. On the agenda of its meeting: whether to reappoint Hayes to another four-year term.
Hayes wasn’t in the audience that night, but powerful supporters were. The city’s chief judge, Milton Westry, told the council that Hayes and his colleagues have changed how they handled cases involving indigent defendants, “since we learned a better way of doing things.” In the wake of the suits, Westry said, Hayes and his peers complied with reforms that required judges to make audio recordings of court hearings and notify lawyers when clients are jailed for failing to pay fines. 
As part of a settlement in the civil case, the city judges agreed to implement changes for at least two years. Those reforms have since been abandoned, Reuters found. Both measures were deemed too expensive, Hayes and city officials confirmed.
Residents who addressed the council were incredulous that the city would consider reappointing Hayes. Jones, the community activist, reminded council members that Hayes had “pleaded guilty to violating the very laws he was sworn to uphold.” 
The city council voted to rehire Hayes to a fifth consecutive term. 
Marquita Johnson said she can’t understand why a judge whose unlawful rulings changed the lives of hundreds has himself emerged virtually unscathed. 
“Hiring Hayes back to the bench was a slap in the face to everyone,” Johnson said. “It was a message that we don't matter.”
On Thursday, Hayes will retire from the bench. In an earlier interview with Reuters, he declined to discuss the Johnson case. Asked whether he regrets any of the sentences he has handed out, he paused.

“I think, maybe, I could have been more sympathetic at times,” Hayes said. “Sometimes you miss a few.”

Critics have in the last three months raised questions about the future of the bloc as national borders shut and each state resorted, at least initially, to national policies to tackle COVID-19, which has killed more than 100,000 people in the EU.
Merkel, who helped steer the EU through its debt and migrant crises, has stressed the need for solidarity in overcoming the COVID-19 crisis.
""During the German EU Presidency we will do everything in our power to master this task together in a forward-looking way and to make Europe strong again,"" the government said in a draft of its six-month presidency programme, dated June 8.
With Europe facing its deepest recession since World War Two, it must first agree on a multi-year budget of more than 1 trillion euros ($1.12 trillion) and also on European Commission proposals for a recovery fund to help revive economies hardest hit, notably Italy and Spain, at a summit on July 17-18. 
This is no easy task. 
Daniela Schwarzer, director of the DGAP foreign policy think-tank, said the health and economic crises would probably deepen social and political tensions and internal divisions.
""Still, Berlin must help make 2020 the year in which the EU gets set up to cope with the future,"" she said, adding the economic recovery should advance major transformations in digitalisation and green policies through European projects.
Germany also wants the EU to better protect itself from pandemics, coordinate more on health policy and agree on a mechanism for common border management. 
Also on the agenda is clarifying the future relationship with post-Brexit Britain, especially as London rejects any extension of negotiations on a trade deal beyond 2020.
Relations with Beijing, including making progress on an EU-China investment deal, will loom large. Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said on Monday an EU-China summit in Leipzig which was cancelled should be rescheduled as soon as possible.

The EU is also concerned by growing tensions between China and the United States, which under President Donald Trump and his 'America First' agenda has proven an erratic and often critical ally for Europe.

The son of a pro-reform Shi'ite cleric, Zam headed Amadnews, which had more 1 million followers on social media before it was suspended by the messaging app Telegram in 2018 after Iran accused it of carrying calls for violence during the protests.
The channel soon re-appeared under a new name.
Last October, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had ""trapped"" Zam, who had been given political asylum in France and was also based in other parts of Europe, in a ""complex operation using intelligence deception"".
It did not say where the operation took place.
""Zam has been convicted of corruption on Earth by a Revolutionary Court,” judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said, according to the Mizan news agency, adding that he could appeal. The charge, used in cases of armed uprising and espionage, is a capital offence under Iran’s Islamic law. 
Iranian officials have accused arch-foe the United States as well as Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia and government opponents living in exile of fomenting the unrest, which began as protests about economic hardship and spread nationwide.
Officials said 21 people were killed during the unrest and thousands were arrested.

Moscow, which ratified the CTBT 20 years ago on Tuesday, said the non-proliferation and arms control regime was facing serious challenges and urged Washington to reconsider its position. It said the situation around the CTBT was ""seriously deteriorating"". 
""Russia is calling on ... above all the United States to reconsider its position and 'give the green light' to transform this most important agreement from the point of view of global security into a fully functioning international legal instrument,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. 
The United States has denied Russian accusations in the past that it intended to quit the CTBT on the pretext that Moscow was violating it first.
Washington, which formally withdrew from the landmark Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty in August 2019, has signed but not ratified the CTBT, along with seven other countries. 
It complies with the treaty’s prohibition on nuclear explosions by observing a unilateral moratorium on testing, which U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has said will continue.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli minister played down on Tuesday the likelihood of major moves to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank on July 1, the planned starting point for cabinet debate on the issue.
Zeev Elkin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, said Israel still did not have the green light it seeks from Washington to begin extending its sovereignty to parts of the West Bank, territory Palestinians seek for a state.
Palestinian leaders, the United Nations, European powers and Arab countries have all denounced any annexation of land that Israeli forces captured in a 1967 war.
""Whoever painted a picture of everything happening in one day on July 1, did so at their own risk,"" Elkin, minister of higher education, told Army Radio when asked what would happen on Wednesday. ""From tomorrow, the clock will start ticking.""
No cabinet session for Wednesday has been announced.
U.S. officials are in Israel as part of the White House's efforts to win consensus within its government for annexation as envisioned in an Israeli-Palestinian peace plan announced by President Donald Trump in January.
The proposal calls for Israeli sovereignty over about 30% of the West Bank - land on which Israel has built settlements for decades - as well as the creation of a Palestinian state under strict conditions.
Palestinians say the blueprint would make statehood, in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, unviable, and most world powers view Israel's settlements on occupied land as illegal. Netanyahu says the Jewish people have a legal, historic and moral claim to the West Bank, the biblical Judea and Samaria.
Netanyahu and his main coalition government partner, Defence Minister Benny Gantz, are at odds over annexation, which the right-wing prime minister has promoted.

In an interview with the YNet news site on Tuesday, Gantz repeated his call for Israel to try to enlist Palestinian and international support for the Trump plan before proceeding with a unilateral annexation move.

1388,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 30, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Killing of Ethiopian singer sparks protests in capital city,"By Dawit Endeshaw
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Youths enraged by the killing of a popular protest singer burned tyres during demonstrations in Ethiopia's capital on Tuesday, in a display of anger from the prime minister's own Oromo ethnic community.
Addis Ababa city police commissioner Getu Argaw told state media late on Monday that Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, an Oromo musician known for his protest songs, had been shot dead at around 9:30 in the evening. Some suspects had been detained, he said, giving no further details. 
On Tuesday morning the normally busy streets of Addis Ababa were eerily empty as protesters lit fires and chanted slogans. 
The internet connection to Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous nation, appeared to be down, a common occurrence during political protests. 
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed expressed his condolences, promised an investigation and asked the public to remain calm, in a message posted on Twitter.
Haacaaluu, a former political prisoner, rose to prominence during prolonged anti-government protests which propelled Abiy into office in 2018.
Abiy's Oromo ethnic group sparked the protests, and his rise to power ended decades during which the multi-ethnic ruling coalition was dominated by ethnic Tigray leaders.
His rule has ushered in greater political and economic freedoms in what had long been one of the continent's most repressive states, and he won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for ending conflict with neighbouring Eritrea.
But the rise in political activism has also led to an increase in unrest in a country made up of more than 80 ethnic groups. Abiy's rule has been frequently challenged by local powerbrokers demanding more access to land, power and resources.
His pan-Ethiopian politics have sparked a backlash from some elements of his own Oromo powerbase, spearheaded by a media magnate, Jawar Mohammed.
""They did not just kill Hachalu. They shot at the heart of the Oromo Nation, once again !!...You can kill us, all of us, you can never ever stop us!! NEVER !!"" Jawar posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Tuesday.
Clashes between police and Jawar's supporters killed at least 78 people in October last year after the government tried to withdraw Jawar's security detail.

HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's parliament passed national security legislation for Hong Kong on Tuesday, setting the stage for the most radical changes to the former British colony's way of life since it returned to Chinese rule 23 years ago.
Details of the law - which comes in response to last year's often-violent pro-democracy protests in the city and aims to tackle subversion, terrorism, separatism and collusion with foreign forces - are due out later on Tuesday.
Amid fears the legislation will crush the global financial hub's freedoms, and reports that the heaviest penalty under it would be life imprisonment, pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong's Demosisto group said it would dissolve.
""It marks the end of Hong Kong that the world knew before,"" Wong said on Twitter.
The legislation pushes Beijing further along a collision course with the United States, Britain and other Western governments, which have said it erodes the high degree of autonomy the city was granted at its July 1, 1997, handover.
The United States, already in dispute with China over trade, the South China Sea and the novel coronavirus, began eliminating Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law on Monday, halting defence exports and restricting technology access.
China said it would retaliate.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, speaking via video link to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, urged the international community to ""respect our country's right to safeguard national security"".
She said the law, which is expected to come into force imminently, would not undermine the city's autonomy or its independent judiciary.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have repeatedly said the legislation is aimed at a few ""troublemakers"" and will not affect rights and freedoms, nor investor interests.
The editor-in-chief of the Global Times, a tabloid published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said on Twitter the heaviest penalty under the law was life imprisonment, without providing details.
Details of the law would be published later on Tuesday, said Henry Tang, a Hong Kong delegate to China's top advisory body, after a meeting at Beijing's main representative office.
'OVERPOWERING'
The legislation may get an early test with activists and pro-democracy politicians saying they would defy a police ban, amid coronavirus restrictions, on a rally on the anniversary of the July 1 handover.
At last year's demonstration, which came amid a series of pro-democracy protests, a crowd stormed and vandalised the city's legislature.
""We will never accept the passing of the law, even though it is so overpowering,"" said Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai.
It is unclear if attending the unauthorised rally would constitute a national security crime if the law came into force by then.
A majority in Hong Kong opposes the legislation, a poll conducted for Reuters this month showed, but support for the protests has fallen to only a slim majority. 
Police dispersed a handful of activists protesting against the law at a shopping mall.
Dozens of supporters of Beijing popped champagne corks and waved Chinese flags in celebration in front of government headquarters.
""I'm very happy,"" said one elderly man, surnamed Lee.
""This will leave anti-China spies and people who brought chaos to Hong Kong with nowhere to go.""
This month, China's official Xinhua news agency unveiled some of the law's provisions, including that it would supersede existing Hong Kong legislation and that interpretation powers belong to China's parliament top committee.
Beijing is expected to set up a national security office in Hong Kong for the first time and could also exercise jurisdiction on certain cases.
Judges for security cases are expected to be appointed by the city's chief executive. Senior judges now allocate rosters up through Hong Kong's independent judicial system.
It is not known which specific activities are to be made illegal, how precisely they are defined or what punishment they carry.
Britain, the European Union, Japan, Taiwan and others have also criticised the legislation. 
China has hit back at the outcry, denouncing ""interference"" in its internal affairs.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's King Philippe expressed deep regret on Tuesday for the ""suffering and humiliation"" inflicted on the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during its 75-year period under Belgian rule.
The letter to DRC president Felix Tshisekedi to mark the 60th anniversary of independence is the first such expression of regret for Belgium's colonial past by a reigning monarch, the royal palace said.
""I want to express my deepest regret for these past injuries, the pain of which is regularly revived by the discrimination that is still all too present in our societies,"" the letter seen by Reuters said.
The DRC achieved independence in 1960 after the Central African country had been a Belgian colony for 52 years and, before that, the personal property of King Leopold II for 23 years until 1908.
During Leopold's rule ""acts of cruelty were committed, while the subsequent colonial period ""caused suffering and humiliation"", Philippe said. 
Statues of Leopold, whose troops killed and maimed millions of people in Congo, have been defaced or removed in Belgium after global anti-racism protests sparked by the police killing of black American George Floyd swept across Europe.
Philippe pledged to ""continue to fight every form of racism"" and welcomed the Belgium parliament's move to launch a reconciliation commission to address racism and the country's colonial past. This process of reflection could help Belgians ""finally make peace with our memories"", he said.
The coronavirus pandemic prevented the Belgian king from travelling to the DRC to mark the anniversary.

Philippe struck a different tone to his younger brother, Prince Laurent, who said earlier this month that Leopold could not have ""made people suffer"" in the DRC because he never visited his colony.

KABUL (Reuters) - The head of the Taliban's political office in Doha and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held a video conference to discuss the Afghan peace process, the Islamist group said on Tuesday, in a bid to remove hurdles in the path to peace talks.
Increasing violence and a contentious prisoner swap between the Afghan government and the Taliban have delayed talks that were to have begun in March between the insurgent group and a team mandated by Kabul.
On Twitter, Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said Monday's talks between the official, Mullah Baradar, and Pompeo discussed full implementation of the Doha accord and the withdrawal of foreign troops, as well as the release of prisoners, intra-Afghan talks and a reduction in fighting.
The Doha agreement, signed between the United States and Taliban in February, drew up plans for a withdrawal of foreign forces from the war-torn country in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgent group.
""Baradar once again reiterated that the Taliban are committed not to let anyone use Afghan soil (to launch attacks) against any country,"" Shaheen said.
Pompeo acknowledged the insurgent group had ""lowered the war graph by not attacking cities and major military bases"" but said more needed to be done by all parties, the spokesman added. 
The U.S. embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 
The Baradar-Pompeo conference came amidst U.S. media reports that American intelligence had briefed President Donald Trump about Taliban-linked fighters collecting bounties from Russia to attack foreign troops in Afghanistan.
Trump has denied getting any such briefing.
Shaheen said Baradar told Pompeo the delay in talks was because the Afghan government did not release the agreed number of prisoners.
Kabul and some foreign countries have raised concerns about the release of about 200 prisoners they say are involved in major attacks in Afghanistan. 
Since the Doha pact, Taliban fighters have launched 44 attacks and killed or wounded an average of 24 civilians each day, Javid Faisal, the spokesman for the Afghan national security adviser, said on Tuesday. 

Baradar told Pompeo the increased attacks were because of provocation by the government in areas under Taliban control, Shaheen added.

Hungary shut so-called migrant transit zones on its borders last month, freeing about 300 refugees from prison-like conditions, but also hardened rules, in effect barring future asylum applicants.
The new rules require asylum seekers to submit applications at consulates in neighbouring countries rather than at the Hungarian border.
""This may expose asylum-seekers to the risk of refoulement and ill-treatment which would amount to a violation of the 1951 Refugee Convention and other international and regional human rights instruments to which Hungary is a State Party,"" the UNHCR said in a statement late on Monday.
""Effective access to territory is an essential pre-condition to be able to exercise the right to seek asylum.""
A government spokesman said the new rules would provide a possibility for asylum seekers to submit their requests in a regulated manner.
""Illegal migration goes against Hungarian and European Union regulations,"" the spokesman said in an email. ""Therefore, in line with the opinion of the Hungarian people, Hungary will continue to protect the EU's Schengen (agreement on visa-free travel) borders from illegal migration.""
The UNHCR urged Orban's government to withdraw the act and bring its asylum system in line with international human rights laws and EU law.
During the peak of Europe's 2015 migration crisis, Orban ordered Hungary's southern border to be sealed, blocking a route for hundreds of thousands of migrants.
Hungary moved to dismantle the migrant transit zones at its southern border after a European court ruling. But human rights groups say the newly tightened rules will make it even harder for refugees to gain asylum in the EU via Hungary.

The organisations set up the campsite overnight near the French capital's Place de la Republique, to highlight to political authorities the plight of homeless, young refugees, according to their statement. 
Since the closure of a huge migrant camp in Calais in 2016, many refugees have moved to Paris. Authorities have repeatedly dismantled illegal campsites only to see them pop up again in different areas a few months later. 
Many of the migrants have fled to France from North Africa, the Middle East and Asia, escaping countries blighted by wars and poverty.
The French government is under pressure to take a tough stance on illegal immigration and in January police cleared out a campsite housing more than 1,000 migrants set up in northern Paris.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea has the world's lowest birth rate, according to a United Nations report released on Tuesday, as women in Asia's fourth-largest economy struggle to achieve a balance between work and other life demands.
The annual report by the U.N. Population Fund (UNFPA) found the fertility rate per woman in South Korea was only 1.1, the lowest among 201 countries surveyed. 
""Even as women have gained equality in access to education and work, decisions on having more children are constrained by their 'second shift' in taking care of children and managing households,"" said Won Do-yeon, chief of the UNFPA's Seoul office, in an email interview with Reuters. 
Reversing the decline in fertility will require wider institutional reform consisting of policies to empower women, as well as the greater involvement and support of men, he said. 
The U.N. report, which looked at practices that harm women and girls and undermine equality, featured a group of South Korean female activists who fought to curb a deep-rooted preference for son in the 1980s.
In 1994, 115.4 boys were born in the country for every 100 girls, but the ratio has dropped to 105.6, around a natural level, it said. 
However, women in the country still face more domestic responsibilities, a glass ceiling at workplaces and new forms of gender-based violence including online sexual abuse, the report said. 
Crimes involving dating violence and spy cams have led thousands of women in South Korea to protest in recent years, calling for stricter penalties and enforcement of laws.
""A strong civil society and women's groups are critical to addressing the emerging forms of violence,"" Won said.
Other countries with a low birth rate included Bosnia and Herzegovina and Singapore at 1.2, and Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Portugal at 1.3.

MANILA (Reuters) - After taking a job in a hospital's COVID-19 emergency room, Philippine doctor Jan Claire Dorado planned to move out of the family home to protect relatives from the risk of infection. 
But Dorado's parents insisted the 30-year-old keep living at home, so her father constructed a makeshift isolation area in a storage room there. 
Now, when she returns from work at one of the country's main hospitals treating coronavirus patients, her dinner is placed outside the room's door on a stool.
""The hardest part is being away from them. I miss them a lot,"" said Dorado, who greets family members from behind a plastic window on a wall covered in foil.
Her parents are considered high-risk for COVID-19 because of preexisting conditions, and Dorado said she once painfully refused her mother's request for a hug.
Hundreds of Philippine medical workers have been infected by the coronavirus and more than 30 have died.
Safekeeping loved ones is also a high priority for paediatrician Mica Bastillo, even as she confronts COVID-19 head on.
The 38-year-old took on a new role at a children's hospital in another part of Manila after it became a COVID-19 referral facility in April. 
""My family thought about asking me to resign, but anywhere I go I would still have to face COVID,"" she said.
With her father and sister battling medical conditions, the family built a makeshift tent next to their home for Bastillo, which they dubbed a ""quarantent"". 
Made out of plastic sheets to keep out the rain, it allows Bastillo to be with her family at a safe distance. 

""My mother put the curtains and the table cloth to make it look like home... And my brother added the plastic sheet. It was a real family effort,"" said Bastillo, who still joins her family for nightly prayers seated beside the front door wearing a mask.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Singapore prime minister's estranged brother said on Tuesday he will not contest the July 10 election as the city-state ""does not need another Lee"".
Lee Hsien Yang, who has been embroiled in a bitter family dispute with Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, last week joined the opposition to the party their father, Lee Kuan Yew, led through the city-state's independence and rise as a nation.
He has made multiple criticisms of the government in recent weeks, including its decision to hold the vote during the coronavirus pandemic, but his emergence was seen as unlikely to challenge the People's Action Party's tight grip on power. 
""I have chosen not to stand for political office because I believe Singapore does not need another Lee,"" Lee Hsien Yang said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Tuesday, the deadline for candidates to register their intent to stand in the election.
Lee Hsien Yang was earlier seen with members of his new Progress Singapore Party near the nomination centre for a seat which his father held for 60 years until his death in 2015.
PSP chief Tan Cheng Bock told media on Tuesday Lee Hsien Yang did not want voters to think the family dispute was his motivation for entering politics. 
Prime Minister Lee, 68, declined to comment on his brother on Tuesday and has previously said the election is not about family disputes.
The PAP - which has ruled unbroken since independence in 1965 currently holds all but six of parliament's 89 seats and has never seen its vote drop below 60%. 
The only opposition party with seats in parliament - the Workers' Party - has warned they face a potential wipe-out in the upcoming election where physical campaigning has been severely restricted by virus safeguards.
Lee Hsien Yang, 62, was a senior business executive who had largely stayed out of the public eye before his father's death in 2015 sparked a feud with his brother over their family home. 

""It would have been the most natural thing for me to have entered political office. But political leadership in Singapore needs to be much more than about one family or one man,"" Lee Hsien Yang said in his Facebook post.

Abe's policies to boost the role of women in the economy and politics, dubbed ""womenomics"", is a pillar of his efforts to cope with Japan's low birth rate and ageing population.
Japan's global ranking on gender parity, however, fell to 121st out of 153 countries in a World Economic Forum report for 2020, the largest gap among advanced countries and down from 101st when Abe took office for a rare second time as prime minister in 2012.
Only 15% of senior and leadership posts are held by women, the report said. Abe's 19-member cabinet has two female ministers and just shy of 10% of lawmakers in parliament's powerful lower house are women.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - An elderly ex-policeman confessed on Monday to being the violent serial prowler known as the ""Golden State Killer,"" pleading guilty to 13 murders and admitting to dozens of rapes and break-ins that terrorized California during the 1970s and '80s.
Joseph James DeAngelo, 74, entered the pleas as part of a broader deal with prosecutors sparing him from a potential death sentence in return for his admission to all of the offenses he stood accused of - charged and uncharged - in 11 California counties.
Under terms of the unusual plea agreement, approved by Superior Court Judge Michael Bowman at Monday's hearing, DeAngelo faces life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than a potential death sentence.
Prosecutors said the deal ensured that aging survivors and victims' relatives lived to see the case resolved, sparing them further legal proceedings likely to have dragged on for 10 years. 
""The time for justice stands in front of us now,"" said Amy Holliday, deputy district attorney for Sacramento County.
The hearing was held in a Sacramento university ballroom, rather than a courthouse, to allow for socially distanced seating amid the coronavirus pandemic. The defendant and his attorneys wore medical-style, clear plastic face shields. 
DeAngelo, dressed in orange jail garb, sat expressionless and slack-jawed in a wheelchair throughout the seven-hour proceeding. 
He spoke in a weak, raspy voice only to give yes and no answers to procedural questions from the judge, and later to answer ""guilty"" when Bowman asked his plea to each of 13 counts of first-degree murder and kidnapping.
He also replied ""I admit"" to dozens of allegations of rape, robbery, and other crimes as prosecutors took turns presenting ""factual-basis"" statements graphically detailing every murder, sexual assault and burglary with which DeAngelo was accused. His admissions encompassed a total of 161 uncharged crimes, prosecutors said.
Prosecutors also revealed that on the day of his arrest, while alone in an interview room, DeAngelo was overheard having an animated conversation with himself, referring to an apparent alter ego named ""Jerry,"" whom he described as being ""in my head"" and compelling him to ""do those things.""
'NOT AFRAID TO FACE HIM'
One of many surviving victims who attended the hearing, Kris Pedretti, said she felt satisfied with the outcome of DeAngelo's plea, telling Reuters during a break, ""I do think he is owning it."" 
Pedretti, who was 15 when sexually assaulted, said she and other survivors ""want people to know that there's hope and that we're not afraid to face him.""
DeAngelo's arrest in 2018 capped more than 40 years of investigation that authorities finally solved through DNA evidence and data from commercial genealogy websites.
The breakthrough came about two months after the case gained renewed national attention in the bestselling book, ""I'll Be Gone in the Dark."" A TV documentary series spawned by the book premiered by coincidence on HBO on Sunday.
Besides the 13 murders and kidnappings, prosecutors said DeAngelo was tied to nearly 50 rapes and more than 120 home invasions - mostly in and around Sacramento, the eastern San Francisco Bay area and Southern California. 
The crime spree ran from 1975 to 1986 and began while DeAngelo was still a police officer. He served on two small-town departments during the 1970s.
The suspect, whom authorities also nicknamed the ""East Area Rapist"" and the ""Original Night Stalker,"" was notorious for creeping into his victims' bedrooms at night, tying them up, raping them, and stealing their valuables.

Formal sentencing was set to begin on Aug. 17.

The laws will punish activities involving terrorism, secession, foreign interference and subversion of state power.
The Basic Law Committee will be meeting later in the day to discuss inserting the laws into the Basic Law, Hong Kong’s constitution-like instrument. Full details of the laws, which come into effect on July 1, will also be disclosed later in the day.
The Hong Kong government’s first attempt at enacting national security laws in 2003 resulted in mass protests and the resignation of then Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa. But after a half year of protests in the city over an extradition bill, which was later withdrawn, in the latter half of 2019, the committee passed a motion to draft and enact the laws for both Hong Kong and Macau in May.
The U.S. stripped Hong Kong of its special trade status soon after the motion was passed, and the Senate passed a bill during the previous week imposing sanctions on Chinese entities involved in enacting the laws.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepali housewife Shiba Kala Limbu grimaced as she recalled how she went hungry in order to feed her five-year-old daughter after the coronavirus pandemic cost her husband his job as a mason in the Gulf state of Qatar. 
The 25-year-old said she had no money for rent after the payments from her husband, Ram Kumar, stopped.
""It is painful,"" she said, as she peeled potatoes in a dimly lit kitchen that doubles as her bedroom in the Baniyatar locality of the Nepali capital.
""I skipped several evening meals to save whatever little food I had for my daughter.""
The spread of the deadly respiratory disease caused by the virus has choked economies worldwide and pitched millions of migrant workers out of jobs, leaving them unable to send money home. 
More than 56 percent of Nepal’s estimated 5.4 million households receive remittances that are a vital lifeline for families that have no other source of income, official figures show.
Remittances totaled $8.1 billion last year, or more than a quarter of Nepal's gross domestic product, but are likely to drop 14% in 2020 because of the global recession caused by the virus, as well as a fall in oil prices, the World Bank says.Millions of Nepali migrants work in the oil-rich Gulf countries and Malaysia.
Remittances are crucial for lower-middle-class families that have moved to city centres and rely on them to pay for rent, groceries, school fees and utilities, said analyst Ganesh Gurung.
""Without remittances these families will get poorer and crimes like human trafficking and prostitution could rise,"" said Gurung, an expert on migrant issues at the Nepal Institute of Development Studies think tank. 
Limbu, the housewife, used to receive up to 20,000 Nepali rupees ($165) every month before the pandemic.
But in the last six months she has received only 40,000 Nepali rupees from her husband, most of it borrowed from his friends.
""That’s all he has managed to send this year,"" she said. ""I used some of it to pay for the rent and the rest to buy groceries.""
In the southwestern town of Gajedah, Radha Marasini said her husband, Indra Mani, lost his job as a security guard at a textile factory in India's northern city of Ludhiana after the outbreak.
As her income dried up, the 43-year-old had no option but to turn to a local lender and pay crippling interest rates to ensure she and her 15-year-old son can survive.
""If the corona (virus) situation does not improve, we’ll have to eat only one meal a day,"" Marasini said.
The virus has caused 13,248 infections and 29 deaths in Nepal. 
Some migrants, like Limbu’s husband Ram Kumar, are staying overseas despite the loss of their jobs, in hopes the situation will improve and they can resume work.
""It is traumatic to be away from the family,"" Kumar said from Qatar, which plans a limited re-opening of restaurants, beaches and parks from July 1.
""If there was any hope for finding a job in Nepal, I would go.""

This year, the United Nations is looking for almost $10 billion for people in Syria and surrounding countries. It hopes much of that will come from the 60 governments and non-governmental agencies gathering by video link on Tuesday from 0800 GMT. The European Union is hosting the event.
The pledging, now an annual event, breaks down into a U.N. appeal of $3.8 billion for aid inside Syria and $6.04 billion for countries hosting refugees. Only a fraction has been raised so far. 
""The needs have never been greater,"" said Corinne Fleischer at the World Food Programme, a U.N. agency.
In Syria, more than 11 million people need aid and protection, the U.N. says, while 6.6 million have fled to neighbouring countries in the world's largest refugee crisis.
Many Syrians face an unprecedented hunger crisis, with over 9.3 million people lacking adequate food, while the country's coronavirus outbreak could accelerate, the U.N. has said.
A combination of an economic slump and COVID-19 lockdown measures have pushed food prices more than 200% higher in less than a year, according to the World Food Programme.
""The COVID-19 crisis has had an immediate and devastating impact on livelihoods of millions of Syrian refugees and their hosts in the region,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said in a statement. 
However, money pledged is only what European officials call a sticking plaster to meet Syrians' immediate needs.

Rebuilding destroyed cities is likely to take billions more dollars and cannot start until powers involved in the war back a peaceful transition away from the rule of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the European Union says.

The disagreement over a proposal to give the justice ministry more control over criminal prosecutions has highlighted strains in the coalition between Tshisekedi and allies of his long-serving predecessor, Joseph Kabila. 
It led last week to the brief arrest of the justice minister, prompting the prime minister to threaten the resignation of the government.
In an address to the nation to mark Democratic Republic of Congo's 60th anniversary of independence from Belgium, Tshisekedi alluded to the dispute.
""Under no circumstances will I accept reforms in this sector which, by their nature and content, would harm the fundamental principles governing justice,"" he said.
Tshisekedi came to power in January 2019, forming a coalition with Kabila, who maintains extensive powers through his parliamentary majority and control of most cabinet ministries and the prime minister's office.
In his wide-ranging speech, Tshisekedi affirmed his commitment to working with the coalition.
But ""let me take this symbolic occasion of commemorating independence to reaffirm that no majority, political or parliamentary ... can overstep the founding principles of the republic,"" he warned.

HAVANA (Reuters) - In the courtyard of a temple belonging to the Abakua Afro-Cuban religious brotherhood in Havana, Nelson Piloto is pulling up the lawn to plant bell peppers and cassava in the face of Cuba's looming food crisis. 
Piloto, 40, says he is responding to the Communist government's call for citizens to produce more of their own food, including in big cities, in whatever spaces they can find, from backyards to balconies.
Standing across from two giant ceiba trees that are considered sacred by many in Cuba, the temple usually resounds with ceremonies involving drumming, animal sacrifices and dance. But it sits empty now due to coronavirus lockdown restrictions on gatherings. 
""I'm making the most of the earth,"" said Piloto, leaning on his hoe. 
Food security has lately risen to the top of the national agenda in Cuba, with countless news headlines and televised roundtable discussions dedicated to the topic.
""Cuba can and must develop its program of municipal self-sustainability definitively and with urgency, in the face of the obsessive and tightened U.S. blockade and the food crisis COVID-19 will leave,"" José Ramón Machado Ventura, 89, deputy leader of the Cuban Communist Party, was quoted as saying by state-run media on Monday.
The Caribbean island imports roughly two-thirds of the food it consumes at a cost of around $2 billion annually, in addition to key farming supplies like fertilizer, machinery and animal feed.
But imports have nosedived in recent years as aid from ally Venezuela shrank following its economic implosion and U.S. President Donald Trump tightened the half century-old U.S. trade embargo. 
That led first to shortages of imported food and then to drops in national agricultural production. Output of Cuban staples like rice, tomatoes and pork fell 18%, 13% and 8% respectively last year, according to data released this month.
The coronavirus pandemic, which has paralyzed the key tourism sector, has only exacerbated the situation.
""Today we Cubans have two big worries: COVID-19 and food. Both kill. We are flooded with scarcity,"" said Yanet Montes, 51, leaving a popular Havana agricultural market with just a few mangoes.
She and others said the availability of produce at such markets was dwindling, with long lines for the most sought-after items like tarot root sometimes starting at dawn.
1990s SURVIVAL LESSONS
Leaders have appealed to Cubans to redeploy lessons learned during the so-called ""Special Period,"" the deep economic depression Cuba fell into after the 1991 collapse of former benefactor the Soviet Union.
Last year, they urged farmers to use oxen instead of tractors due to fuel scarcity.
The premium placed on fuel savings is one reason planning departments are now looking to expand organic farming in urban and suburban areas where goods can be sold directly.
Cuba became something of an organic farming pioneer in the 1990s, developing techniques like worm composting, soil conservation and the use of biopesticides, to replace imported supplies and large scale monoculture.
Havana now produces 18% of the agricultural produce it consumes, according to state run media.
Communist Party activists are signing up in some provinces to do voluntary work in the fields while authorities have distributed leaflets to neighborhood leaders in towns and cities on expanding family farming.
In a residential neighborhood in east Havana, Luis Ledesma asked his wife if he could tear up her flower beds so he could plant pumpkin, sweet potato, cassava, cucumber and chives.
""One of the things that is difficult to find these days is rice,"" said the 61-year-old, who recently acquired five chickens and a cockerel and wants to install rabbit cages next. ""But root vegetables can replace rice.""
REFORM
Some Cuba observers are cautiously hopeful the crisis will push the government to reform its agricultural model which, like the rest of the economy, remains heavily centralized.
""Nothing good can come from the combination of monopoly of supplies, monopoly of distribution and distorted prices,"" said Cuban economist Pedro Monreal.
The government has hinted recently at a possible reform of the vast state network responsible for purchasing and distributing most farm output, which has come under fire for wasting crops and disincentiving production. 
Another Cuban economist, Omar Everleny, said the government should free farmers altogether from this monopoly, allowing them to find their own ways to sell produce and import their own equipment.
""I have the impression in the next few months we will see new reforms,"" he said. 
Come what may, some Cubans like sustainable agriculture enthusiast Marnia Briones hope the country won't lose the habits that have arisen from this and previous crises, which some have termed its ""green revolution"". 

""It’s great more people are planting but it cannot just be when there is a crisis,"" said the Havana-based artist. ""It should be fomented as a healthier lifestyle for the whole of humanity.""

1410,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 05:50PM ET</span>",Pompeo calls China Muslim sterilization reports 'shocking' and 'disturbing',"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday labeled as ""shocking"" and ""disturbing"" reports that China's ruling Communist Party is using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against minority Muslims.
Pompeo highlighted a report about the situation in China's Xinjiang region by German researcher Adrian Zenz published by the Washington-based Jamestown Foundation think tank.
Pompeo, a persistent critic of China, including its treatment of Muslims in Xinjiang, said in a statement the findings were consistent with decades of Chinese Communist Party practices ""that demonstrate an utter disregard for the sanctity of human life and basic human dignity.""
""We call on the Chinese Communist Party to immediately end these horrific practices and ask all nations to join the United States in demanding an end to these dehumanizing abuses.""
In his report, Zenz said his findings represented the strongest evidence yet that Beijing’s policies in Xinjiang met one of the genocide criteria cited in the U.N. Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, namely ""imposing measures intended to prevent births within the [targeted] group.""
Zenz said analysis of Chinese government documents showed natural population growth in Xinjiang had fallen ""dramatically."" He said that in its two largest Uighur Muslim prefectures, growth rates fell by 84% between 2015 and 2018 and further in 2019.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington referred to a statement by Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, saying that ""some institutions are bent on cooking up disinformation on Xinjiang-related issues. ... Their allegations are simply groundless and false."" 
Documents from 2019 revealed plans for a campaign of mass female sterilization targeting 14% and 34% of all married women of childbearing age in two Uighur counties, Zenz wrote. The campaign, he said, likely aimed to sterilize rural minority women with three or more children, as well as some with two children - equivalent to at least 20% of all women of childbearing age.
""Budget figures indicate that this project had sufficient funding for performing hundreds of thousands of tubal ligation sterilization procedures in 2019 and 2020,"" he wrote.
Zenz said that by 2019, Xinjiang planned to subject at least 80% of women of childbearing age in its four southern minority prefectures to intrusive birth prevention surgeries - placement of intrauterine devices or sterilizations.

He said that in 2018, 80% of all new IUD placements in China were performed in Xinjiang, while only 1.8% of the population live there.

The three sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, did not specify how many of the 14 that the military announced were detained had been released.
A paramilitary official told Reuters that all 14 had been released and that a judge did not find evidence of possession of rockets or launchers, without giving further details.
The military said Friday that its forces had raided a base in southern Baghdad used by militiamen suspected of firing rockets at foreign embassies in Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone and its international airport.
Iraqi authorities were questioning the 14 men detained during the raid, the military added.
The incident took place after a number of rocket attacks near the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad and other U.S. military sites in recent weeks.
The raid was the most brazen action by Iraqi forces against a major Iran-backed militia in years and targeted the Kataib Hezbollah group, which U.S. officials accuse of firing rockets at bases hosting U.S. troops and other facilities in Iraq.

LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - Gabon's Senate voted on Monday to decriminalise homosexuality, a landmark result that makes the country one of the few in Africa to reverse a ban on same-sex relationships.
Under a law passed in 2019, Gabon became one of 73 countries or jurisdictions around the world, including more than two dozen in Africa, where sex between men and between women was illegal. 
The government's move to reverse part of the law has sharply divided opinion and sparked intense debate on social media in the central African nation, where homosexuality is still broadly seen as a taboo.
Efforts to remove legislation criminalising homosexuality still face challenges elsewhere. In Botswana, the government has said it will appeal a high court ruling that legalised same sex relationships. 
The government did not explain why it decided to revise the law. The bill won the support of the lower house last week. 
In the Senate, it ""was adopted with a large majority of 59 votes"", Jessye Ella Ekogha, a spokesman for Gabon's presidency, told Reuters. 
In a closed door session, 17 Senators voted against the move and four abstained.
It will now be ratified by President Ali Bongo. Bongo's wife, Sylvia, has voiced support for the bill, saying the ability to love freely without being condemned is a fundamental human right.
London-based rights group the Human Dignity Trust said Gabon had taken a hugely welcome step.
""Gabon now joins African states such as Seychelles, Angola, Mozambique and Botswana who have chosen to rid their lawbooks of archaic provisions which enable discrimination, violence and harassment against LGBT people,"" legal chief Victoria Vasey said.
Some politicians and religious authorities had expressed their disapproval ahead of Monday's vote. 
The Catholic archdiocese in Libreville urged senators to vote no.
""In the name of the wisdom of our ancestors, contained in our various cultures, which celebrates life, love, family, we say no to the decriminalisation of homosexuality,"" it said in a June 24 statement.

Ties between NATO allies France and Turkey have soured in recent weeks over Libya, Northern Syria and drilling in the eastern Mediterranean. 
Turkey has intervened decisively in recent weeks in Libya, providing air support, weapons and allied fighters from Syria to help the internationally recognised government based in Tripoli repel a year-long assault by eastern military leader Khalifa Haftar.
""I think it's a historic and criminal responsibility for a country which claims to be a NATO member,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said. 
Without providing any evidence on the nature of the fighters, he said Turkey was ""massively importing"" jihadists from Syria.
Paris has been accused of supporting Haftar politically, having previously given him military assistance to fight Islamist militants. France denies backing Haftar but has stopped short of rebuking his allies, especially the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has also been singled out by the United Nations for violating an arms embargo. 
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) is backed by the UAE, Egypt and Russia. In recent weeks, French officials have repeatedly said that Turkey's intervention was encouraging Russia to gain a greater foothold in Libya.
Libya's National Oil Corporation said on Friday Russian mercenaries had entered the Sharara oilfield. A United Nations report in May said Russian private military contractor Wagner Group had up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya.
Macron spoke to Putin on Friday, but stopped short of denouncing Moscow as he has with Ankara. He said the two leaders agreed to work towards a common goal of a ceasefire. 
On Monday, Macron said Putin had told him that private contractors did not represent Russia. 

""I told him of my very clear condemnation of the actions which are carried out by the Wagner force... he plays on this ambivalence.""

The protest comes as state-controlled utility EDF (PA:EDF) plans to shut down the second and last ageing nuclear reactor of its Fessenheim plant near the German border overnight.
The French government is working to reduce the share of atomic power in its electricity mix to 50% by 2035 from the more than 71% currently, as well as to promote more renewable energy, sparking an intense debate.
Advocates of nuclear power say it is essential to providing sufficient quantities of carbon-free energy to balance intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and solar. Opponents say it is not carbon-free over its entire life-cycle.
Several dozen protesters - wearing face masks - carried banners in front of the Greenpeace headquarters in Paris, with slogans such as ""Less nuclear means more coal"". 

In February this year, some 50 Greenpeace militants had broken into another EDF plant, Tricastin, to demand its closure, saying it was also ageing and should be unplugged. In recent years, they have also made their way into the Fessenheim site to stage demonstrations.

Last week, a special prosecutor's office dealing with Kosovo's 1998-99 uprising against Serbian rule said it had indicted Thaci, former parliamentary speaker Kadri Veseli and others for murder, enforced disappearances, persecution and torture.
The Specialist Chamber was set up in The Hague in 2015 to handle cases of alleged crimes by Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) guerrillas during the war that led to Kosovo’s independence from Serbia a decade later.
""I may have made political mistakes in peace, but war crimes, never!"" Thaci said in a televised address.
Thaci and Veseli were one of the ex-top commanders in the KLA. Veseli also has denied all the accusations.
A judge will now take several months to decide whether the cases built by the special prosecutor's office are strong enough to put Thaci, charged with nearly 100 murders, and the others on trial.
""I assure you (citizens) again, I will not face justice from this office,"" Thaci said. ""If the accusation is confirmed, I will immediately resign as your president and face the accusations.""
The Specialist Chamber is governed by Kosovo law but is staffed by international judges and prosecutors.
War crimes allegations against the KLA first surfaced in a 2011 report by the Council of Europe rights agency that accused guerrillas of killing civilian Serbs and ethnic Albanian political opponents during the 1998-99 conflict.
Local efforts to investigate alleged KLA war crimes have so far been foiled by widespread intimidation in the tiny state, where clan loyalties run deep and former rebels are lionised.

The special prosecutor's office is based in the Netherlands partly to help ensure protection of witnesses.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's ambassador to Afghanistan said on Monday that negotiations between the Afghan government and the insurgent Taliban were expected to begin soon but that the release of 5,000 prisoners and a reduction of violence were the final hurdles.
Pakistan is Afghanistan's top trading partner and is seen as a key regional player in helping facilitate a February troop withdrawal deal between the United States and the Taliban to begin the process of ending 18 years of war. 
The agreement was intended to quickly lead to talks between the militant group and the Afghan government, but became mired in delays. 
Pakistan's ambassador to Kabul, Zahid Nasrullah Khan, told Reuters in an interview he was ""cautiously optimistic"" and that talks could begin next month, so long as the final issues were overcome. 
""The two important things are the level of violence – that it should be kept low to have an enabling environment – and to reach that magic figure of 5,000 prisoners (released),"" he said. 
Reuters reported on Friday that progress was being made over the release of a few hundred controversial Taliban prisoners and that the issue would likely be resolved soon.
However, Khan raised concerns at growing violence. Attacks have picked up around the county in recent months. On Monday at least 23 civilians were killed in Afghanistan's southern Helmand province when rockets hit a cattle market.
""The rising violence is a concern for Pakistan as it is for other countries who want to see the U.S.-Taliban agreement implemented in letter and spirit and to reach the first milestone of the (intra-Afghan negotiations),"" he said. ""We have been persuading the Taliban to show that the violence level remains down; it's very important.""
Khan said negotiations need to begin as soon as possible so a ceasefire agreement could be struck, which the Taliban have so far refused.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Tracing contacts of people with coronavirus infections is the most important step in fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, and countries that are failing to do so have no excuse, the World Health Organization chief said on Monday.
""Although many countries have made some progress, globally the pandemic is actually speeding up,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing.
""We all want this to be over. We all want to get on with our lives. But the hard reality is that this is not even close to being over,"" he said. ""Most people remain susceptible, the virus still has a lot of room to move.""
Countries such as South Korea had managed to contain the disease by tracking down the contacts of those carrying infection, Tedros said. This was possible even under extreme conditions, as the WHO itself had shown by halting an outbreak of Ebola in eastern Congo, tracing 25,000 contacts a day in a remote area where some 20 armed groups were fighting, he added.
""No excuse for contact tracing. If any country is saying contact tracing is difficult, it is a lame excuse.""
TEAM TO INVESTIGATE ORIGINS IN CHINA
In a move sought by the WHO's biggest critic, the United States, Tedros announced that a team would be sent to China next week to investigate the origins of the outbreak.
""We can fight the virus better when we know everything about the virus, including how it started,"" Tedros said. ""We will be sending a team next week to China to prepare for that.""
U.S. President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have both said the disease could have escaped from a lab in Wuhan, although they have presented no evidence of this, and China denies it. Scientists say the virus emerged in nature.
Trump has announced plans to quit the WHO, which he says is too close to China. He has repeatedly emphasised the Chinese origins of the virus, calling it ""Kung Flu"" at two rallies this month, a term the White House had previously described as unacceptable and which Asian-American groups say is racist.
Asked about Trump's use of the term, the director of the WHO's emergencies program, Mike Ryan, called for an ""international discourse that is based on mutual respect"".
""Many people around the world have used unfortunate language in this response,"" he said.
Ryan said there had been tremendous progress towards finding a vaccine, but there was no guarantee of success. In the meantime countries must use the strategies available, such as social distancing and contact tracing.

""Many, many countries through applying a comprehensive strategy have reached a very low level of virus transmission in their countries but always have to remain vigilant in case there are clusters or small outbreaks.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Twenty-year-old Russians Yekaterina Mikhailova and Iya Barsegyan have only ever known life under President Vladimir Putin who rose to power in 1999, before they were even born. 
The pair may be of the same generation, but politically they are worlds apart, a contrast that shows how the divisions created by Putin's politics could last for years. 
This week, Russians are taking part in a nationwide vote on constitutional reforms that would clear the way for Putin to remain in the Kremlin until 2036. 
Mikhailova wants Putin out, and is fiercely opposed to the idea of letting him serve two more terms in the Kremlin, instead of stepping down in 2024, accusing him of persecuting his political opponents, stymying Russia's development and ushering in an era of political stagnation.
""The best thing for our country now would be a change of power,"" said Mikhailova, a member of Russia's Libertarian Party, a small organisation with no representation in the national parliament. She plans to vote ""no"" at the seven-day vote ending on July 1.
""I don't want him to stay there until the end of my life."" 
Barsegyan, on the other hand, sees no harm in voting in Putin's favour on this point, one among the dozens of reforms being put to a simple yes or no vote ending on July 1.
""The majority of the amendments are important and they should be of benefit to the whole country,"" Barsegyan told Reuters at a square in central Moscow.
She points to a proposed minimum wage guarantee and a constitutional pledge to defend the legacy of the Soviet World War Two effort against what some Russians believe are attempts by the West to skew history in its favour.
And while Barsegyan was skeptical of some of the more socially conservative reform proposals, such as changing the constitution to define wedlock as a union between a man and a woman only, she also said had no problem with changing the law to allow Putin to reset his count of terms served to zero. 
""I see nothing bad in this. I doubt the current president will run for another term,"" she said.
Putin's approval rating is at its lowest since 1999 when he was prime minister, the Levada pollster says, but at 59% it is still high, and reforms are likely to pass with ease.
Russian state opinion pollster said on Monday that its exit polls showed that 76% of Russians had so far voted to support reforms.
The Kremlin's critics say the vote is rigged and describe it as a constitutional coup. Some young voters, like Alexander Kostyuk, 18, have decided to stage a boycott.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 12:22PM ET</span>","In major ruling, U.S. Supreme Court strikes down strict Louisiana abortion law","By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court defended abortion rights in a major ruling on Monday by striking down a Louisiana law placing restrictions on doctors who perform the procedure, dealing a blow to anti-abortion advocates.
The 5-4 ruling, with conservative Chief Justice John Roberts joining the four liberal justices in the majority, represented a victory for Shreveport-based abortion provider Hope Medical Group for Women in its challenge to the 2014 law. The measure had required doctors who perform abortions to have a sometimes difficult-to-obtain formal affiliation called ""admitting privileges"" at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic.
Two of the three clinics that perform abortions in Louisiana, a state of about 4.6 million people, would have been forced to close under if the law had taken effect, according to lawyers for Hope Medical Group. 
President Donald Trump's administration supported Louisiana in the case. Anti-abortion advocates had hoped the Supreme Court, with its 5-4 conservative majority, would be willing to permit abortion restrictions like those being pursued by Louisiana and other conservative states.
""Today's ruling is a bitter disappointment,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the anti-abortion group Susan B. Anthony List.
The decision, authored by liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, marked the second time in four years the court ruled against an ""admitting privileges"" requirement.
In 2016, the court struck down a Republican-backed Texas law that mandated admitting privileges and required clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities, finding the restrictions represented an impermissible ""undue burden"" on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. The two laws, Breyer wrote, are ""almost word-for word identical,"" meaning the court must reach the same result.
There is sufficient evidence that the Louisiana measure ""would place substantial obstacles in the path of women seeking an abortion in Louisiana,"" Breyer added. 
Roberts dissented in the 2016 case, called Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, but said he voted with the liberals on Monday based on the court's tradition of respecting its precedents.
""I joined the dissent in Whole Woman's Health and continue to believe that the case was wrongly decided. The question today however is not whether Whole Woman's Health was right or wrong, but whether to adhere to it in deciding the present case,"" Roberts wrote. 
But Roberts did question some of the court's analysis in the Texas ruling, suggesting he may side with his conservative colleagues in future challenges to abortion restrictions.
'WE'RE RELIEVED'
Consequently, the positive reaction to the ruling from abortion rights group was muted.
""We're relieved that the Louisiana law has been blocked today but we're concerned about tomorrow,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which represented the Louisiana clinic.
""After today's decision, we can breathe a sigh of relief,"" added Alexis McGill Johnson, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, another abortion rights group.
Writing in dissent, conservative Justice Samuel Alito said the Louisiana and Texas rulings were similar only because ""the abortion right recognized in this court's decisions is used like a bulldozer to flatten legal rules that stand in the way.""
Roberts also sided with the liberal justices in two other important rulings this month. One found that gay and transgender people are protected from workplace discrimination under federal civil rights law. The other blocked Trump's bid to end a program that protects from deportation hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered the United States illegally as children.
Several other cases involving legal challenges to state abortion restrictions are heading toward the justices that could provide other avenues for its conservatives to roll back access to the procedure.
Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, promised during the 2016 presidential race to appoint justices who would overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The Louisiana case marked the first major abortion dispute heard by the court since Trump appointed Brett Kavanaugh in 2018 and Neil Gorsuch in 2017 as justices. Both ruled in favor of the Louisiana abortion restrictions.
Abortion remains a divisive issue in the United States as it is in many countries. Christian conservatives - an important political constituency for Trump - are among those most opposed to it. The Republican president, who years earlier had supported abortion rights, attended an anti-abortion march in January and declared, ""Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House."" 
Abortion rights advocates have argued that restrictions such as admitting privileges are meant to limit access to abortion not protect women's health as proponents say. When the Supreme Court in 1992 reaffirmed the Roe v. Wade ruling, it prohibited laws that placed an ""undue burden"" on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. 

Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge John deGravelles cited the undue burden precedent when he struck down Louisiana's law in 2016. After Louisiana appealed, the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the law.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - While Belgians confront their colonial past in the wake of global protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody, a neighbourhood in Brussels seen by some as a haven for Black citizens is gearing up for a big celebration.
The Matonge quarter, named after a district in the Democratic Republic of Congo, on Tuesday marks 60 years since the DRC gained independence from Belgian colonial rule.
While social distancing will make the planned barbecues, live music and parties harder to arrange, people say they won't let that get in the way.
""There is no limit here in Matonge; everything is possible,"" said 34-year-old rapper Gabriel Fodderie.
Statues of colonial-era King Leopold II have been defaced this month as Belgians across the ethnic spectrum joined in anti-racism demonstrations.
In Matonge, known for its hairdressers selling hair extensions, wigs and African cuisine, the focus has also been on reopening after the coronavirus lockdown. Most salons were shuttered from March 18 until May 4.
""I completely understand it (the removal of statues) is being done because one must recognise that a lot of countries we call developed, industrialised, civilised, built their towns with a lot from Africa,"" said Monique Fodderie, Gabriel's mother who manages the Inzia restaurant named after a street in Kinshasa.
""And it's not taught in history books or schools,"" she said.
Tucked away between the luxury stores of Brussels' upmarket Avenue Louise and the European Union institutions, Matonge long suffered from a reputation for crime, including drug dealing.
Paul Jamoulle, co-owner of L'Horloge du Sud African restaurant, says it is where he feels safest.
For some, it is simply a home from home.

""It feels like you're in Africa, but in Belgium,"" said 34-year-old Nicky Chou, who's lived in Belgium for 22 years.

A Shi’ite judge in the southern city of Tyre ruled on Saturday that comments made by Ambassador Dorothy Shea had incited sectarian strife, and banned media in Lebanon from interviewing her for a year.
The foreign minister in Lebanon's Hezbollah-backed government summoned Shea to the ministry on Monday.
""We turned the page on this unfortunate distraction so we could all focus on the real crisis at end, which is the deteriorating economic situation in Lebanon,"" Shea told journalists at the foreign ministry after the meeting.
The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group.
Foreign Minister Nassif Hitti emphasised the importance of media freedom and the right to free expression during the meeting, the ministry said in a statement.

Lebanon is grappling with an acute economic crisis seen as the worst threat to its stability since the 1975-90 civil war.

1429,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 29, 2020 10:48AM ET</span>",Former French PM Fillon sentenced to jail for embezzling public funds,"By Tangi Salaün
PARIS (Reuters) - A French court on Monday sentenced former Prime Minister Francois Fillon to five years in jail, three of them suspended, for embezzling public funds in a scandal that wrecked his 2017 run for president.
The court also found Fillon's wife, Penelope, guilty for her role in the scam that saw her receive about 1 million euros for minimal work as her husband's parliamentary assistant. She received a suspended three-year sentence. 
In a scathing ruling, the chief judge said Fillon, 66, had eroded public trust in the political class as a result of paying his wife a salary that was disproportionate to the work done.
""Mrs. Fillon was hired for a position that was without use,"" chief judge Nathalie Gavarino told the couple.
The Fillons would appeal the verdict, defence lawyer Antonin Levy said. It means Fillon will avoid going to jail before the appeal is heard.
A consummate political insider who was prime minister under Nicolas Sarkozy from 2007-2012, Fillon had been the frontrunner in the election race when the allegations surfaced. 
At the time, he denied wrongdoing, resisted party pressure to pull his candidacy, and was eliminated in the first round of the vote.
When the scandal broke, Fillon denounced what he called a campaign of dirty tricks and denied having done anything illegal, though he later admitted an error of judgment.
But the court said the couple had failed to prove what work Penelope did and had amassed wealth as a result of the scam. 
""The resulting personal enrichment (was) substantial,"" the judges determined.
Fillon stood expressionless as the sentence was announced. 
The court also convicted a third co-defendant, Marc Joulaud, to a suspended three-year sentence for continuing to channel money to Penelope Fillon after he took the conservative politician's parliamentary seat while her husband was in government. 

The court ordered the Fillons to pay 401,000 euros in damages to the National Assembly, and told Penelope Fillon and Joulaud to pay a further 679,000 euros.

The United States and Interpol both dismissed the idea of acting on such a warrant.
The United States killed Soleimani, leader of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, with a drone strike in Iraq on Jan. 3. Washington accused Soleimani of masterminding attacks by Iranian-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region.
Alqasimehr said the warrants had been issued on charges of murder and terrorist action. He said Iran had asked Interpol to issue a ""red notice"" seeking the arrest of Trump and the other individuals the Islamic Republic accuses of taking part in the killing of Soleimani.
Alqasimehr said the group included other U.S. military and civilian officials but did not provide further details. 
U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook said the warrant was a ""propaganda stunt"" at a news conference in Saudi Arabia.
""Our assessment is that Interpol does not intervene and issue red notices ... (of) a political nature,"" he said.
""This is a political nature. This has nothing to do with national security, international peace or promoting stability ... It is a propaganda stunt that no-one takes seriously.""
Interpol said in a statement that its constitution forbade it to undertake ""any intervention or activities of a political, military, religious or racial character"".
""Therefore, if or when any such requests were to be sent to the General Secretariat,"" it added, ""... Interpol would not consider requests of this nature.""
Alqasimehr said Iran would continue to pursue the matter after Trump left office.

The killing of Soleimani brought the United States and Iran to the brink of armed conflict after Iran retaliated by firing missiles at American targets in Iraq several days later.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi and U.S. officials on Monday urged the international community to extend a U.N. arms embargo on Iran, saying that letting the ban expire would allow Tehran to further arm its proxies and destabilise the region.
The 13-year-old arms curbs on Iran are due to expire in October under the terms of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Russia and China have signalled they oppose extending the embargo. Both wield vetoes on the U.N. Security Council, which will decide the matter. 
""Despite the embargo, Iran seeks to provide weapons to terrorist groups, so what will happen if the embargo is lifted? Iran will become more ferocious and aggressive,"" Saudi minister of state for foreign affairs Adel al-Jubeir told a joint news conference with U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook in Riyadh.
Jubeir said a shipment of Iranian weapons bound for Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement was seized as recently as Sunday. A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Houthis in Yemen for five years.
The conference venue displayed weapons, including drones and missiles, that Saudi authorities said were used in cross-border Houthi attacks on Saudi cities and that were supplied to the group by Tehran. 
""We urge the international community to extend the embargo on selling arms to Iran and on Iran's ability to sell arms to the world,"" Jubeir said.
Iran denies arming groups in the Middle East, including the Houthis, and blames regional tensions on the United States and its allies in the region.
Hook said lifting the ban would ""only embolden"" Tehran, drive greater instability and trigger a regional arms race.

""This is not an outcome that the U.N. Security Council can accept. The council's mandate is clear: to maintain international peace and security,"" Hook added.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday paved the way for President Donald Trump's administration to carry out the first federal executions since 2003, turning away an appeal by four inmates challenging the lethal injection protocols due to be used.
The justices left in place a lower court ruling that had let the executions proceed. The condemned men, convicted in federal courts of murder, had appealed after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit on April 7 threw out a judge's injunction that had blocked the executions.
The inmates - Daniel Lee, Wesley Purkey, Alfred Bourgeois and Dustin Honken - are scheduled for execution in July and August at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana.
The brief court order noted that two of the four liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, favored hearing the appeal.
Lee, a white supremacist, is due to be the first executed, on July 13. He was convicted in Arkansas in the suffocation deaths carried out with an accomplice of a gun dealer, the man's wife and her 8-year-old daughter in 1996.
While some individual states have continued to carry out executions of inmates convicted in their courts, the U.S. government has not conducted an execution since 2003 during the administration of President George W. Bush amid protracted litigation over the practice. 
But Attorney General William Barr last year announced that Trump's administration would resume executions, citing the need to uphold ""the rule of law"" and saying that ""we owe it to the victims and their families to carry forward the sentence imposed by our justice system."" 
At issue in the legal battle is whether a U.S. law called the Federal Death Penalty Act requires the federal government to follow all execution protocols in the state where the sentence was imposed as opposed to where the execution will take place.
The law requires that the execution be implemented ""in the manner prescribed by the law of the state in which the sentence is imposed,"" which the federal government has interpreted loosely as the general method of execution, which in all four cases would be lethal injection.
But lawyers for the inmates have argued that under this law the government must follow the detailed execution protocols in the states where the inmates were convicted.

Lee was convicted in Arkansas, Purkey in Missouri, Bourgeois in Texas and Honken in Iowa. Iowa is among the states that does not have the death penalty, but Honken was sentenced to death, as federal law allows, subject to Indiana's method of execution.

NEAR JERICHO, West Bank (Reuters) - The Israeli government faces calls from campaigners to declare sovereignty over ancient Jewish ruins on land in the occupied West Bank that Israel does not plan to annex under U.S. President Donald Trump's peace blueprint.
The annexation plan, which the government is due to start discussing as of Wednesday, envisages Israel annexing Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley - some 30% of the West Bank. Under Trump's plan, a Palestinian state would be created in the rest of the West Bank, occupied by Israel since a 1967 war.
An Israeli advocacy group called ""Safeguarding Eternity"" is worried about what will happen to Jewish archaeological sites on parts of the West Bank not included in Trump's annexation map.
It wants Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government to guarantee Israeli control over sites such as the remnants of hilltop Hasmonean and Herodian forts dating back two millennia, and hundreds of ruins from earlier Jewish rule. 
""This entire plan - its right, its essence - is the connection of the Jewish people to their land and our heritage,"" Eitan Melet, a director of Safeguarding Eternity, said as he stood among a jumble of limestones that were the foundation of the desert fortress of Cypros, overlooking the Palestinian city of Jericho.
""If we don't take our heritage sites into account, this plan has no right to exist at all."" 
The Israeli government has not commented on the campaigners' demands. The Palestinians reject Trump's blueprint and Israel's plan to annex territory they seek for a future state.
PALESTINIAN MINISTRY: SITES ARE PROTECTED 
Assaf Avraham, an archaeologist at Israel's Bar-Ilan University, said he too was worried about the fate of archaeological sites in the West Bank.
""If these areas are not in the hands or under the sovereignty of (authorities) that know how to take care of and maintain archaeological sites, and which have the motivation to do so, we really fear for these places,"" he said.
The Palestinian Tourism and Antiquities Ministry dismissed such concerns. 
It said in a statement that it is ""able to protect and preserve the cultural heritage sites under Palestinian control, as maintenance and restoration work is carried out continuously"". 
The Palestinians say Trump's plan is biased, and most world powers view Israel's settlements in the West Bank as illegal.

Interim 1993 peace accords granted the Palestinians limited self-rule in West Bank areas, where they agreed to secure Jewish heritage sites for Israeli visits.

The migrants were rescued around 2:45 a.m. (2345 GMT) near a small island off the coast of Ayvalik in Turkey's western Balikesir province, the coastguard said. 
Greece has been the main gateway into the European Union for people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond, largely via its islands near the Turkish coast. More than a million people reached its shores from Turkey in 2015-16.
Earlier this year, tens of thousands of migrants tried to cross into Greece via land and sea borders after Ankara said it would no longer stop them, as it had agreed in a 2016 deal with Brussels in return for European aid for Syrian refugees.
Turkey, which hosts about 3.6 million Syrians, the world's largest refugee population, said it lifted restrictions on the migrants because it was alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria.

Ndayishimiye, 52, a retired army general, won last month's presidential election as the ruling party's candidate, defeating six opposition contenders. He had been due to take office in August, but the death of predecessor Pierre Nkurunziza earlier this month brought the succession forward.
The new cabinet unveiled late on Sunday includes prime minister Alain Guillaume Bunyoni, who has been under U.S. sanctions since 2015 over his alleged role in violations of human rights and repression of dissent during violence sparked by Nkurunziza's decision to seek a third term in office.
Critics accused Nkurunziza of violating a constitutional limit of two five-year terms per president. He denied wrongdoing.
Gervais Ndirakobuca, who is also on the U.S. sanctions list, was appointed as interior minister.
Neither the government, nor Bunyoni and Ndirakuboca, were immediately available for comment.
Bunyoni, an influential figure in the ruling CNDD-FDD party, was one of the key allies of Nkurunziza, serving as security minister during the violent crackdown on unrest in 2015.
The United Nations has said in recent years that under Nkurunziza's rule, members of the state security forces and the ruling party's youth wing routinely gang-raped, tortured and killed political opponents.
The East African nation of 11 million people is one of the world’s poorest countries. It became an international pariah after Nkurunziza stamped out protests triggered by his decision to run for a third term in 2015.
Donors cut off funding while Nkurunziza shut down the U.N. human rights office and withdrew Burundi's membership in the International Criminal Court.

GENEVA(Reuters) - At least 129 children have been killed in the Philippines' four-year war on drugs, most by police or allied assailants, but they may only represent a fraction of the toll, activist groups said on Monday.
Minors have been directly targeted, punished as proxies, or victims of mistaken identity or ""collateral damage"", they said in a report, ""How could they do this to my child?"".
The World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) and the Children's Legal Rights and Development Centre, a Philippines- based group, urged the U.N. Human Rights Council to launch an independent commission of inquiry into extrajudicial killings and other crimes at its three-week session opening on Tuesday.
The figures, which include seven child murders this year, are ""the tip of the iceberg because it is only those cases that we were able to document and verify, there may be many more in the country"", said Gerald Staberock, OMCT secretary-general.
""We are calling on the Human Rights Council to give a clear investigative mandate on the ground to collect the evidence and to ensure accountability,"" he told a news conference.
A Philippine presidential palace spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Spokesman Harry Roque rejected as ""rehashed claims"" a separate U.N. report this month that found tens of thousands of people may have been killed in the war on drugs amid near impunity. 
But the activists' report said: ""Far from being only 'collateral damage', as callously stated by President Rodrigo Duterte, these have often been deliberate killings.""
Their investigations found that 38.5% of the documented child killings were carried out by policemen while 61.5% were by unknown assailants, ""some of them with direct links to the police"". The youngest victim was a 20-month-old girl.
Perpetrators enjoy impunity, with only one case, involving the killing of 17-year-old Manila student Kian delos Santos, recorded on video in 2017, leading to a conviction, the report said.
Children violating quarantines in the pandemic have been killed, Rose Trajano of the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates, said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Julian Assange's lawyer said on Monday he was surprised U.S. authorities issued a new and wider indictment last week against the WikiLeaks founder whom they are seeking to extradite from Britain.
Assange is wanted by U.S. authorities to stand trial for 18 offences including conspiring to hack government computers and espionage. Last year, the United States began extradition proceedings after he was dragged from London's Ecuadorean embassy where he had been holed up for almost seven years. 
The U.S. Department for Justice issued a second, superseding indictment last week which, it said, contained no new charges but broadened ""the scope of the conspiracy"" and included accusations of recruiting hackers.
""We are to say the least surprised by the timing of this development,"" Assange's lawyer Mark Summers told a brief technical hearing at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday, adding it could derail the timing for the case. 
Assange's full extradition hearing began in February but was interrupted by Britain's coronavirus lockdown and is now scheduled to resume on Sept. 7.
Judge Vanessa Baraister said the case would ""almost certainly"" be now held at London's Old Bailey criminal court.
Assange himself was again absent from Monday's hearing and unable to appear by videolink from prison because of medical reasons, Summers said. 
Baraitser said the prison had said Assange was not unwell but was choosing not to attend. She said his legal team needed to provide up-to-date medical information for the next hearing.
Summers said the medical issues related to Assange attending the court via an unventilated video booth. His lawyers say he has had past respiratory illnesses making him susceptible to COVID-19. 

Assange, 48, an Australian, fears decades in prison if convicted in the United States and calls the case against him a threat to free speech. Washington says he put the lives of informants in danger by publishing secret diplomatic cables.

The remarks, which the source said Gantz made during a meeting with U.S. Ambassador David Friedman and White House adviser Avi Berkowitz, threw doubt on prospects for a unified Israeli approach to President Donald Trump's peace plan.
Washington wants Gantz on board for the plan, which envisages Israel annexing Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley, and a Palestinian state established under strict conditions elsewhere in the West Bank.
With the Palestinians boycotting the plan, however, Netanyahu and Gantz had agreed in a deal under which they formed a coalition government last month that a cabinet debate on annexation could begin as of July 1.
""Gantz made clear in the meeting that July 1 is not a sacred date"" and voiced preference for Israel dealing with the economic ravages of the coronavirus crisis, a source in his centrist Blue and White party said.
Briefing reporters last week, Gantz -- who serves as Israel's defence minister, as well as alternate prime minister -- predicted that the coronavirus crisis could last 18 months.

PARIS (Reuters) - Mali and Burkina Faso must guarantee at a summit this week that their domestic political problems do not reverse fragile military successes against Islamist militants in the Sahel region, a French presidential source said on Monday.
Former colonial power France has deployed thousands of soldiers in the arid region south of the Sahara desert since 2013, and now has 5,100 troops there. But attacks by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State have been on the rise.
Leaders of the G5 Sahel states of Mali, Burkina Faso, Chad, Niger and Mauritania will meet French President Emmanuel Macron and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Nouakchott on Tuesday to assess recent military victories and plan next steps.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, who is set to confirm a contribution to a special forces unit in the Sahel, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will also take part by video call.
But there are fears that recent advances may be derailed amid political instability in the Sahel. 
""All the progress that's been made is fragile and can be put into question if the political momentum does not follow,"" the French official said ahead of a summit.
""We see that in the Burkina and Mali context...So (what's at) stake is to put in guarantees so that these electoral contexts don't weaken the gains that have been achieved."" 
Burkina Faso will hold legislative and presidential elections in November in which incumbent President Marc Roch Kabore is expected to seek a second term against opponents challenging his approach to tackling militants. 
In Mali, there are growing concerns about instability in recent weeks after thousands of people took to the streets for the second time in a month to demand President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita step down. 
Keita, in the middle of his second five-year mandate after a 2018 election, has struggled with an surge in militant attacks.

""We will look very precisely at who was behind this escalation during these recent demonstrations.""
""It would be unacceptable if it turns out that Turkish groups on Ankara's orders, so to speak, are causing destabilisation in Austria,"" Nehammer added. 
Police fined some counter-demonstrators for using a banned hand gesture associated with the Grey Wolves, a Turkish nationalist group. In total, 11 arrests were made and seven police officers injured, Nehammer said.
Austria has a large ethnic Turkish minority but conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz is an outspoken critic of Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan.
PKK militants have been waging an insurgency against the Turkish state in mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey since 1984 in a conflict that has claimed more than 40,000 lives.
The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the European Union and the United States.

Maltese farmers had expected to export the potatoes to the Netherlands, but a drop in demand there because of the coronavirus crisis mean they were no longer required.
The Maltese government decided to step in and buy the potatoes instead to save the country's farmers from losses.
Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo said Namibia had suffered a severe drought and Malta's donation was expected to help around half a million people in the southern African country. 
""Malta was among the first countries to back independence for Namibia 30 years ago and we awarded many scholarships to Namibians at the time,"" Bartolo wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""We want to start a new page in our relations in order to boost trade and other mutual cooperation to create jobs in Namibia and Malta,"" he added.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian politician whose home and office were raided by the federal police and an intelligence agency said the probe was part of a foreign interference investigation focused on China and he was not a suspect and had done nothing wrong.
Australia passed foreign interference legislation in 2018, spurred in part by a classified Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) report on Chinese influence activity, sparking anger from Beijing.
Early on Friday, federal police searched New South Wales (NSW) state politician Shaoquett Moselmane's home and parliamentary office in an investigation Prime Minister Scott Morrison linked to foreign interference.
""The investigation is into certain other people allegedly advancing the goals of a foreign government, namely the People's Republic of China,"" Moselmane told a news conference on Monday
""My allegiance is first and foremost to Australia.""
An ASIO representative said on Friday the agency had conducted ""search warrant activity"" as part of an investigation that ""does not relate to any specific threat to the community"". ASIO did not provide any further details of the raids or the reason they took place.
Moselmane this year attracted criticism from fellow politicians for praising Chinese President Xi Jinping's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""I have done nothing wrong,"" said Moselmane.
""I have no access or knowledge ... on any of the laws or secrets of the state. Nor was there any campaign on my part to change the ALP's China policy."" 
Moselmane is a member of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) opposition in NSW.
China's foreign ministry declined to comment on the case on Monday but said certain Australian political figures were ""stigmatising and demonising normal China-Australia relations"".
""People in Australia are passionately cooking up stories of Chinese espionage and infiltration without producing tangible evidence. In contrast, China has so much evidence of Australia spying on China,"" said ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian. 
Moselmane said that while there had been much talk about his travels to China, he had never been on a Chinese government-sponsored trip. 
He said six out of nine trips he had made to China involved the delivery of wheel chairs to disabled children for a charity he was involved with and he paid for flights and accommodation.
Australia's ties with China, its largest trading partner, have become strained after Canberra pushed for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the coronavirus that emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Gunmen attacked the  Pakistan Stock Exchange  building in the city of Karachi on Monday killing two guards and a policeman before security forces killed all four of the attackers, police said.
Separatist insurgents from Balochistan province - the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) - claimed responsibility in a post on Twitter but Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the claim and spokesmen for the group were not available for comment.
""We locked ourselves in our offices,"" Asad Javed, who works at a brokerage in the stock exchange building, which is in a high security zone that also houses the head offices of several banks, told Reuters.
Javed said he was on the ground floor when he heard gunfire and an explosion and people scattered for safety.
The police chief in Pakistan's biggest city and financial hub, Ghulam Nabi Memon, told Reuters the gunmen attacked with grenades and guns after pulling up in a silver Corolla car.
They threw a grenade at security men posted outside the compound then opened fire on a security post. The four were killed when security forces posted there responded.
Their car was abandoned where they left it.
Two guards and a policeman were killed and seven people were wounded, Deputy Inspector General of Police Sharjil Kharal told media.
A counter-terrorism official told Reuters the attackers were carrying significant quantities of ammunition and grenades in backpacks.
The BLA claimed responsibility in a brief message on a Twitter account set up shortly before the raid, describing it as a ""self-sacrificing"" attack carried out by its Majeed brigade.
The account was suspended a short time after the attack.
Separatists have been fighting for years in resource-rich Balochistan, complaining the southwestern province's gas and mineral wealth is unfairly exploited by Pakistan's richer, more powerful provinces.
The BLA's Majeed brigade also took responsibility for an attack on the Chinese consulate in Karachi in 2018. Several projects linked to China's Belt and Road initiative are in Balochistan.
This month, three explosions on the same day claimed by a little-known separatist group killed four people including two soldiers in the southern province of Sindh, of which Karachi is capital.
The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX:PAKS) did not suspend trading during the attack. Its main KSE-100 index dropped 220 points but it later recovered and was 200 points higher at 0830 GMT.

Islamist militants have also launched attacks in Karachi and elsewhere in Pakistan over the years but their violence has become less frequent after military operations against various factions in strongholds on the Afghan border.

The Brahmaputra River, one of the largest rivers in the world which flows from Tibet into India and then into Bangladesh, burst its banks in Assam over the weekend, inundating more than 2,000 villages, and it was still raining on Monday.
""Two people have died in separate incidents of drowning in the past 24 hours and more than one million people have been affected, with the flood situation turning critical by the hour,"" a state government flood bulletin said.
Torrential rain hit at least 23 of Assam's 33 districts and the federal water resources body said water levels in the Brahmaputra were expected to rise, with more rain forecast over the next three days.
""The flood situation remains extremely grave with several embankments breached,"" Assam Water Resources Minister Keshab Mahanta told Reuters.
Most of the Kaziranga National Park, home to the rare one-horned rhino, was under water, authorities said.
Assam, famous for its tea plantations, is hit by seasonal flooding each year, forcing state and federal governments to spend millions of rupees on flood control.
Paramilitary personnel were deployed across the state for rescue operations and to ensure people maintain social distance in makeshift shelter camps to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, authorities said. 
Assam has so far reported 7,492 coronavirus infections and 11 deaths.

The announcement comes as the top decision-making body of China's parliament deliberates a draft national security law for Hong Kong that pro-democracy activists in the city fear will be used to eliminate dissent and tighten Beijing's control. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, who announced the new sanctions during a press briefing in response to a question about Washington's new visa restrictions, did not specify which U.S. individuals have been targeted. 
""The U.S. is attempting to obstruct China's legislation for safeguarding national security in the HK SAR (Hong Kong Special Administrative Region) by imposing the so-called sanctions, but it will never succeed,"" he told reporters. 
""In response ... China has decided to impose visa restrictions on U.S. individuals with egregious conduct on HK related issues.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that the new visa restrictions by Washington apply to ""current and former"" officials of China's ruling Communist Party ""believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy.""
The U.S. Senate also approved a bill last week that would impose mandatory sanctions on people or companies that back efforts to restrict Hong Kong's autonomy. It includes secondary sanctions on banks that do business with anyone backing any crackdown on the territory's autonomy.

Zhao, the foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters that China has lodged a complaint with the U.S. over the bill and warned that Beijing will respond with strong countermeasures in response to U.S. actions on Hong Kong.

Nearly 14 million people in 26 different provinces had been affected by storms and floods by Friday, with 744,000 evacuated, the China Daily reported, citing the Ministry for Emergency Management. The ministry said 78 people have been confirmed dead or missing, with direct economic losses at 27.8 billion yuan ($3.93 billion). 
Much of the damage has hit southwestern regions like Guangxi and Sichuan, and the municipality of Chongqing on the upper reaches of the Yangtze river last week experienced its worst floods since 1940. 
But central and eastern regions are set to bear the brunt this week, with some facing 30mm to 50mm (1.2 inches to 2 inches) of rain per hour by Wednesday, the state meteorological bureau said. 
Regions along the banks of the Yangtze and its tributaries are traditionally vulnerable to flooding in China's summer, with the impact of heavy rainfall worsened by deforestation, dwindling flood plains and the diversion of natural river systems for hydropower and irrigation. 
Rainfall has also been heavier than usual, with water volumes in 148 rivers already reaching emergency levels by mid-June. Local authorities are under instruction to pay attention to potential dam and reservoir collapses.
Some Yangtze tributaries have already experienced their worst floods ever, including the Xiaojinchuan in Sichuan province. The water resources ministry warned last week that other smaller rivers could be ""stricken by major floods"" and lakes are also under close scrutiny.
Authorities have promised to minimise flood damage in the city of Wuhan as it struggles to recover from the coronavirus outbreak.
Wuhan, which lies on the Yangtze, was hit by China's last major floods in 1998, which killed more than 3,000 people and left 14 million homeless.

It said it had polled 163,124 voters at 800 polling stations in 25 Russian regions. 
The results are roughly in line with projections ahead of the vote based on previous polls by VTsIOM.

The suspect taken into custody had opened fire at a crowd in Jefferson Square Park late on Saturday.
He was wounded in the shooting himself and taken to a hospital in police custody, Assistant Police Chief Robert Schroeder told a press briefing on Sunday. 
""The man has been participating in the protest since the beginning and he had been arrested a couple of times in the past several weeks,"" Schroeder said.
He said the suspect had been repeatedly asked by other people in the park to leave due to his disruptive behavior. 
Police said on Saturday homicide detectives were investigating the shooting. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said he was saddened by the incident.
The park has been a focal point of protests against the death of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technicinan who was killed in a hail of gunfire when drug investigators burst into her home in Louisville on March 13.
Officers entered her apartment bearing a ""no-knock"" arrest warrant. One of the three officers involved in her shooting was fired last week.
Taylor's killing drew renewed attention after the May 25 death of George Floyd, an African-American man killed after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him in Minneapolis.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Fighting erupted in Taiwan's parliament on Monday as lawmakers from the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) broke through barricades erected by the main opposition Kuomintang (KMT) who had occupied it to protest against government ""tyranny"". 
Taiwan is a rambunctious democracy and fights and protests inside the parliament building are not uncommon.
More than 20 KMT lawmakers occupied the legislature overnight on Monday, blocking entry to the main chamber with chains and chairs, saying the government was trying to force through legislation and demanding the president withdraw the nomination of a close aide to a high-level watchdog.
Late morning on Monday, DPP lawmakers pulled down the barricades and forced their way in, surrounding the main podium where their KMT opposite numbers had holed up.
There were scuffles and shouting as the KMT, including its youthful new chairman Johnny Chiang, struggled to hold their position. 
The KMT lawmakers eventually withdrew, but denounced their DPP counterparts for using violence against them.
""This is a very dangerous thing. You can't treat lawmaker colleagues like that,"" KMT lawmaker Wayne Chiang, the great-grandson of late autocratic leader Chiang Kai-shek, told reporters. 
Wayne Chiang is not related to the party chairman.
DPP lawmakers complained about defacement of the chamber by the KMT members, including spray-painted slogans in a bright green colour and chairs piled high to block doors, posting pictures on social media of the damage.
The KMT, trounced in January's parliamentary and presidential elections, began their protest in parliament on Sunday afternoon. The party traditionally favours close ties with China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory.
The KMT said it was protesting the DPP and President Tsai Ing-wen's forcing though bills and Tsai's nomination of her senior aide Chen Chu to head the Control Yuan, an independent government watchdog, calling Tsai's government ""more tyrannical than before"".
The DPP has a large parliamentary majority, and has been angered by the targeting of Chen, who was jailed in 1980 for helping lead pro-democracy demonstrations against the then-KMT government when Taiwan was a dictatorship.
""What a nerve!"" senior DPP legislator Wang Ting-yu wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Both the DPP and the presidential office condemned the KMT's action, with the DPP saying the KMT was orchestrating a ""farce"".
The KMT is undergoing a policy revamp to try and win back popular support, but faces an uphill struggle. 

Earlier this month the KMT mayor of the major southern city of Kaohsiung lost a recall vote by a huge margin, in another setback for the party.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's second most populous state said on Monday it is considering reimposing social distancing restrictions after the country reported its biggest one-day rise in new coronavirus infections in more than two months.
Propelled by Victoria state reporting 75 cases, Australia recorded 85 new COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours, its biggest daily outbreak since April 11.
Australia has fared better than many countries in the coronavirus pandemic, with around 7,800 cases and 104 deaths, but the recent surge has stoked fears of a second wave after several weeks of fewer than 20 new cases a day.
The resurgence in Australia comes as total infections hit 10 million cases worldwide and the global death toll from the virus tops half a million people. 
As new coronavirus cases have mounted, Victoria has embarked on a massive testing regime and the state's chief health officer said the state may need to re-introduce social distancing restrictions.
""Changing the law is something we have to consider because we have to do whatever is required to turn this around,"" Brett Sutton told reporters in Melbourne, referring to questions about enforcing localised lockdowns.
Victorian state officials last week deployed ambulances and mobile test centres in a bid to test most residents in 10 hotspot suburbs. 
However, some locals declined the voluntary throat and nasal swab tests. Victoria is hoping a new saliva test, which is less intrusive, will encourage more people to get tested - even though it is slightly less accurate.
""We think it will play a role in bolstering testing reach across the state,"" said Professor Sharon Lewin, Director of the Doherty Institute, which developed the test.
""Vulnerable populations or in people who have trouble with the throat swab, such as children or other individuals who find it more acceptable."" 
MORE STIMULUS NEEDED
In May, Victoria - home to more than 6 million people - began lifting restrictions imposed a month earlier to slow the spread of the virus.
It has pledged to remove the bulk of restrictions by the end of July.
The restrictions, including forcing restaurants and cafes to offer only takeaway services, shutting schools and halting sports proved successful in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
But it was a hammer blow to Australia's economy, which is heading into its first recession in three decades as the unemployment rate hits a 19-year high of 7.1%. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called on states to continue easing restrictions, insisting the country's economy must be revived.
Morrison ruled out a blanket extension of a A$60 billion ($41.1 billion) wage subsidy scheme beyond its scheduled end in September.
""It can't be sustained forever,"" Morrison said, adding that another phase of stimulus at the end of September would be targeted ""to the people who need it most"".
The Grattan Institute, an independent think tank, said in a report published on Monday the government needs to inject up to A$90 billion more in stimulus, including extending its wage subsidy programme.
That stimulus was needed before the annual budget in October to bring the unemployment rate down to about 5% by the middle of 2022, the report said.

Vietnam had licensed 27 Pakistani pilots, and 12 of them were still active, while the other 15 pilots' contracts had expired or were inactive due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the CAAV.
Of the 12 active pilots, 11 were working for budget airlines Vietjet Aviation and one for Jetstar Pacific, a unit of the national flag carrier Vietnam Airlines.
Vietnam Airlines and Bamboo Airways were not using any pilots from Pakistan, the CAAV said.
Vietnamese airlines currently have 1,260 pilots, with nearly half of them holding foreign citizenship, according to the CAAV.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - When the brother of Singapore's prime minister joined the opposition to the party their father led through the city-state's independence and rise as a nation, he brought a bitter family squabble into the realm of politics on the eve of a general election.
Lee Hsien Yang, younger brother of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong and son of modern Singapore's founder, Lee Kuan Yew, said last week he was a member of the new Progress Singapore Party (PSP). He said the People's Action Party, which has governed Singapore since independence in 1965, had ""lost its way"" without his late father.
The younger Lee, 62 - described by people close to him as shy, distant from his powerful brother but not afraid to challenge the status quo - has made no policy statements or said whether he will run for office, something candidates for the July 10 election must declare on Tuesday. 
It is not clear if his move can energise an opposition that holds just six of parliament's 89 seats, and it is not expected to alter prospects for a lopsided ruling party win.
But Lee Hsien Yang's dramatic move presents Singaporean voters an inversion of the campaign that the PAP is offering as Prime Minister Lee, 68, prepares to retire in the coming years.
The ruling party depicts the government's aggressive response to the COVID-19 pandemic as this generation's heroic sacrifice, harking back to the ""Pioneer Generation,"" led by Lee Kuan Yew, that forged the tiny island from a dot on Britain's colonial map into a first-world economy.
Lee Hsien Yang's rebuke: This is not our father's PAP.
""I have never sought the limelight, and most people know that actually I value my own privacy,"" Lee Hsien Yang told reporters on Sunday at a PSP event at a food court. ""I'm here because I think sometimes we need to speak truth to power.""
He has criticised the PAP government for calling an election during a pandemic and its response to the COVID-19 outbreak, in which thousands of Singapore's migrant workers have been infected. He has also criticised a 2019 ""fake news"" law that has been used against government opponents and said the PAP suffers from ""narrow group-think"" and mainly serves the elite in society.
The ruling party declined to comment.
""NOT UNDER HIS BROTHER'S SHADOW""
The Lee brothers were not close but had no major quarrels most of their lives, said a person close to the younger Lee. A business associate said Lee Hsien Yang was mild-mannered but defensive about his parents.
He had repeatedly said he was not interested in politics. 
That changed after his father's death in 2015, when Lee Hsien Yang and his sister alleged their older brother wanted to preserve the family home for political gain despite their father requesting it be demolished in his will. 
The younger Lee said the lengthy feud did not motivate him to join the opposition. 
The brothers, who declined to be interviewed for this article, were both army brigadier-generals but their careers have otherwise diverged.
Lee Hsien Loong, first elected in 1984, became deputy prime minister aged 38 and has led the PAP for 16 years. Lee Hsien Yang was CEO of telecommunications firm Singtel and chairman of drinks conglomerate F&N.
Patriarch Lee Kuan Yew, known as LKY, wrote little in his memoirs about his younger son compared to mentions of the current prime minister but said in a 2011 interview Lee Hsien Yang was a ""sensible and practical man"" who was ""not under his brother's shadow.""
With an openly gay son, Lee Hsien Yang last year attended a Pride march in the conservative city-state where sex between men is outlawed.
Can this iconoclastic scion with the common touch make a difference?
Loke Hoe Yeong, author of a history of Singapore's opposition, said Lee Hsien Yang's arrival will energise opposition parties but could also antagonise voters who don't think a family spat over a house should be aired publicly. 
Former PAP lawmaker Inderjit Singh said Lee Hsien Yang's presence in the opposition could sway some voters, who have always given the ruling party at least 60% of the vote. 

""When people see LKY's son switching camp to the opposition, this may create doubts...that the PAP of the present is not the same as the PAP of the past,"" Singh said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic forced the cancellation of most in-person Pride events this year, but a march in Manhattan on Sunday drew thousands to the streets in solidarity with protesters demanding an end to racial injustice and police brutality.
The second annual Queer Liberation March capped a month of Pride events, virtual and live, during which the celebration of LGBTQ lives has merged with the nationwide demonstrations ignited by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.
People chanted ""No justice, no peace"" as the crowd snaked through Manhattan, while techno music blasted from a pickup truck carrying two DJs, one of whom led marchers in chanting ""Black lives matter.""
Reclaim Pride Coalition, the group that organized the march, staged its first protest last year by walking in the opposite direction to New York City's marquee Pride parade, rejecting that event's large uniformed police presence and the ubiquitous corporate-sponsored floats that normally drift down Manhattan's 5th Avenue each year.
This year, the march was the city's main in-person event on Pride Sunday, after the official parade was canceled in April for the first time in its 50-year history due to the pandemic.
Ryan Lewis, 28, said the march was a necessary part of getting people to understand a system that has oppressed Black people and stolen Black history, including the Pride movement.
""Pride as it is a very white space that caters to straight people,"" Lewis said.
Demonstrators took a knee in silence as the front of the march reached its destination at Washington Square Park.
On June 28, 1969, patrons of the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in Manhattan's Greenwich Village, fought back during a police raid, sparking days of sometimes violent demonstrations against harassment and giving birth to the modern LGBTQ rights movement.
Activists memorialized the first anniversary of the Stonewall rebellion with what they called Christopher Street Liberation Day, starting an annual Pride tradition that is now celebrated around the world. 
Marches and rallies with a focus on racial injustice, and the struggle of Black transgender people in particular, took place in other U.S. cities.

In Chicago, thousands of people attended a Pride march on Sunday aimed at drawing attention to the historic origins of Pride as a movement of protest, and to amplify the voices of Black and brown members of the LGBTQ community, local media reported https://abc7chicago.com/community-events/hundreds-gather-to-participate-in-reclaim-pride-march-in-lakeview/6278094.

1465,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 28, 2020 08:28PM ET</span>",Polish president Duda faces tough run-off vote on July 12,"By Pawel Florkiewicz and Alicja Ptak
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's nationalist incumbent Andrzej Duda won the first round of a presidential election on Sunday but will have to face the centrist mayor of Warsaw in a run-off on July 12, in a race that could transform the nation's ties with the European Union.
The re-election of government ally Duda is crucial if the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party is to implement further its socially conservative agenda, including judiciary reforms the EU says contravene democratic standards.
An exit poll showed Duda winning 41.8% of ballots on Sunday, against 30.4% for Rafal Trzaskowski from the Civic Platform party. Final results could differ slightly but any changes are not expected to affect who will compete in the second round.
Two opinion polls conducted late on Sunday for private broadcaster TVN and the state-run TVP showed Duda having a lead of less than 2 percentage points over Trzaskowski in two weeks.
PiS has cast Duda as the guardian of its generous welfare programmes, which have helped it win national elections in 2015 and 2019, and of its pledge to protect traditional family values in predominantly Catholic Poland.
A devout believer himself, Duda had campaigned on a promise to ban classes about gay rights in schools, saying LGBT ""ideology"" was worse than communist doctrine.
""The campaign goes on because Poland needs it,"" Duda told jubilant supporters in the central town of Lowicz. ""Some people have a complex and think we are not Europeans. We are, and have been... since we converted to Christianity.""
But his long-held lead crumbled in the weeks ahead of the election, after a late entry by Trzaskowski who appears to have galvanised many voters keen to end Poland's isolation within the EU or angry over Duda's allegiance to PiS.
FRAGILE MAJORITY
The Civic Platform, a party once led by former EU Council president Donald Tusk, replaced its flagging candidate with Trzaskowski after the election was postponed amid the coronavirus pandemic by seven weeks. 
A former EU emissary for his party, Trzaskowski has promised to work towards repairing relations with Poland's European allies, and to oppose any government efforts to tighten already restrictive abortion rules.
The election is being closed watched in Brussels.
Under PiS, Poland became the only EU state to refuse to commit to the bloc's 2050 climate goal in December 2019, which critics said could undermine its ambition to take on the leading role in the global fight with climate change.
If he wins the election in July, Trzaskowski will have limited scope to direct policy, but will be able to veto legislation proposed by the government. 
This could give him a chance to block efforts by the government of prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki to deepen court reforms, which the EU has said politicise the judiciary, or refuse appointments of new judges.
""We will soon decide whether we will have a strong president who will hold the government to account or a president who doesn't respect his own signature,"" Trzaskowski said during an election-night rally in Warsaw.
Observers say a win by Trzaskowski could undermine the fragile majority PiS has in parliament, and force Morawiecki to govern as a minority cabinet, or even face an early national election.
""The second round is expected to be closer than it has been in a long time,"" said Agnieszka Kwiatkowska, a sociologist at the SWPS university. 

""Duda will have the support of the entire government, with its ability to make election promises and offer financial incentives to voters ... The question is will he be able to use it.""

BARCELONA (Reuters) - When police ordered a local mayor in southern Spain to take down a rainbow flag put up to celebrate gay pride on Friday because it was illegal, more than 300 households in the village rallied to the cause and flew their own flags.
By the time gay pride celebrations took place in Spain on Sunday, the Andalusian village of Villanueva de Algaidas near Malaga was awash with flags hanging from balconies, windows and even a bar in solidarity.
Juan Civico, Socialist mayor of the village of 4,000 inhabitants, only found out it was illegal for authorities to fly the flag after three residents complained about the one he had put up.
Civico said the local government was bound by a recent ruling by the Spanish Supreme Court that only official flags, of Spain, its regions or the European Union, can be flown from council buildings.
""After the complaints, we studied what we had to do. We saw that under the law we had to remove the flag. But the people can put what they like on their balconies,” said Civico.
Hearing about the police action, Antonio Carlos Alcántara who runs a shop in the seaside resort of Torremolinos, 62 km away, had an idea.
He sells rainbow flags in his shop in the resort, which is popular with the LGBT community, but because of the coronavirus they were not selling and he had plenty in stock. 
After he put out a message on the council's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page asking if anyone in Villanueva de Algaidas wanted to fly a rainbow flag, he received more than 100 requests for the flags, prompting him to drive over and hand out another 300.
""The village is full(of flags). It is incredible,"" Alcántara said. 
Piedad Queralta hung two flags from her house in the village.
“I think people should be free to love who they want to as long as it does not cause anybody any harm,” she said.
In 2005, Spain became the third country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands and Belgium.
A 2013 report for the U.S.-based Pew Research Center found 88% of Spaniards accepted homosexuality, making it one of the most accepting countries of the 39 polled.
Antonio Ferre, of the Federation of Andalusian LGTB+ Diversity, said the villagers’ initiative in Villanueva de Algaidas was “especially moving”.
Manolo Garcia, another resident, was just happy to support the cause.

“To me it is not good nor bad. Every person should be able to do what they like in their own home and in the public street if it does not offend others,” he said.

Hariri's office said the incident, in which nobody was hurt, took place during a tour of the eastern Beqaa valley and was not made public at the time to prevent inflaming passions in an already politically charged atmosphere.
""Since the convoy did not get exposed to any attack ...(Hariri's) decision was to keep it secret and await the results of the relevant security forces,"" it said in a statement.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's most senior civil servant stepped down on Sunday after reports of clashes with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's top political adviser, part of what is expected to be a wider shake up of officials at the heart of power.
Johnson's senior political adviser, Dominic Cummings, has long been critical of the civil service, saying government is not nimble enough to deliver change. Some newspapers reported he warned aides last week that a ""hard rain is going to fall"".
Earlier this year, Johnson forced the resignation of his finance minister, tightening his control over the treasury, and just earlier this month he announced the merger of its diplomatic and aid departments.
Mark Sedwill, a career diplomat, was appointed cabinet secretary and national security adviser by Johnson's predecessor Theresa May. In a letter to Johnson released on Sunday, he wrote that, having stayed on for ""the acute phase"" of the coronavirus crisis, he was now leaving as ""the government's focus is now shifting to domestic and global recovery and renewal"".
He said he would leave government service at the end of September.
Johnson's office released a letter in which he thanked Sedwill for his ""outstanding service"", and asked him to lead a new G7 panel on global economic security as Britain assumes the presidency of the rich nations' group and hosts its summit next year.
David Frost, Britain's chief negotiator with the European Union, will replace Sedwill as national security adviser at around the end of August and there will be a competition to appoint a new cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. 
Britain's main opposition Labour Party raised questions over the timing of the move. Helen Hayes, policy chief shadowing the cabinet office, said: ""On the day it was revealed millions of jobs across the country could be under threat in the coming months, it is very concerning that Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings are preoccupied with reshuffling Whitehall.""
Johnson's team has been criticised over its response to the coronavirus crisis, blamed by opposition parties and some scientists for being too slow to tackle the pandemic. 
Britain now has one of the world's highest death tolls from the disease and both the Bank of England and government budget forecasters have warned of the potential for unemployment to surge as the government phases out temporary support measures for workers hit by lockdown measures.
Sedwill also bore the brunt of criticism from Brexit supporters during Britain's earlier negotiations with the EU over its exit from the bloc, with some Conservatives accusing him of not doing enough to prepare for a so-called no deal departure.
Earlier on Sunday, interior minister Priti Patel hinted that there could be changes. 

""This is the people's government, delivering on the people's priorities, and effectively any reforming government will be based around the type of delivery that our prime minister wants to drive for our great country and obviously have the right kind of support around him to deliver that,"" she told Sky News.

In an exchange of letters with Johnson, Sedwill said: ""Two years ago, when my predecessor fell ill, your predecessor asked me to step in as Cabinet Secretary, and you asked me to continue to support you through Brexit and the election period.
""It was obviously right to stay on for the acute phase of the Covid-19 crisis. As you are setting out this week, the government's focus is now shifting to domestic and global recovery and renewal."" 
Johnson thanked Sedwill for his ""outstanding service"". The prime minister said he had asked Sedwill to lead a new G7 panel on Global Economic Security as the UK assumes the G7 presidency, and said he had nominated Sedwill for a life peerage.

David Frost, Britain's chief negotiator with the European Union, will replace Sedwill as national security adviser, Downing Street said.

Around 200 protesters took part in Sunday's demonstration, far fewer than a week ago when several thousand attended a similar protest. Organisers had called on people to stay home this week in view of Friday's court ruling that the protest violated restrictions on public gatherings.
The protesters say a policy of requiring people to stand 1.5 metres (about four feet) apart is undemocratic and should be lifted.

The Netherlands has recorded more than 50,000 COVID-19 infections and more than 6,000 deaths since mid-March. Restrictions are being lifted after a steep decline in new cases and deaths in recent weeks.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is seeking the extradition of a top Pakistan militant suspected to have planned the 2008 Mumbai attacks after the United States said last week he was living freely in Pakistan, government officials said on Sunday. 
India and the United States have both indicted Sajid Mir of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group for the three-day attacks on hotels, a train station and a Jewish centre in which 166 people were killed including six Americans.
While Pakistan took action against the Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed last year, it continued to provide safe harbour to other top militant leaders, the U.S. State Department's 2019 country report on terrorism said. 
One of them was Sajid, the ""project manager"" of the Mumbai attack, believed to remain free in Pakistan, the U.S. report said. 
An Indian official said the government has repeatedly asked Pakistan to hand over Sajid who is charged with serving as chief planner of the attacks, directing preparations and reconnaissance and was also named as one of the Pakistan-based controllers during the attacks.
""We have asked before, and are demanding again, he needs to be handed over,"" the official dealing with regional security issues said.
Pakistan’s foreign office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Pakistan has repeatedly rejected U.S. allegations that it is a safe haven for militants and said it has prosecuted the leadership of several proscribed groups.
Another Indian official said the lack of action against Sajid was in conflict with Pakistan's assurances to international organisations including the Financial Action Task Force, the global watchdog on terrorism financing. Pakistan is trying to get off the FATF grey list of offending nations.
The FBI has posted a reward of $5 million for information leading to the capture of Sajid who is also wanted for a 2008/2009 plot against Denmark’s Jyllands-Posten newspaper to avenge its publication of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad that enraged many Muslims.

Hezbollah is the main political force behind the Lebanese government. Washington considers the heavily armed pro-Iran movement to be a terrorist group.
In an interview with Saudi-owned AlHadath television on Friday, U.S. ambassador Dorothy Shea said Hezbollah's behaviour was preventing Lebanon from properly dealing with a deep economic crisis.
A Shi'ite judge in the southern city of Tyre ruled on Saturday that Shea's comments had incited sectarian strife, and banned broadcasting interviews with her for a year. State-owned National News Agency (NAA) said media that violate the ban would be fined $200,000.
But the government has repudiated the court ruling, while criticising Shea over the remarks that had prompted it.
Information Minister Manal Abdel Samad tweeted that while she understood the judge's concerns about diplomats meddling in Lebanon's internal affairs ""no one had the right to prevent the media from covering news, or to curb press freedoms"".
A Lebanese government official and a Western diplomatic source both said Shea had been summoned to the foreign ministry on Sunday. No further details were given.
In one of several media appearances on Sunday, Shea told broadcaster MTV that a senior government official had assured her the court did not have the authority to order the ban, and that the government would take steps to reverse it.
She described the ruling as a ""really pathetic"" attempt to silence the media, and said the government should focus more on implementing economic reforms.

Polls in the Basque Country and Galicia on July 12 will be the first since Spain went into lockdown in March. Restrictions were eased on June 21, and Spaniards have been adapting to social distancing and precautionary measures in everyday life. 
""The enemy of Spain is the virus,"" Socialist Sanchez told a reduced group of about 100 party faithful -- all wearing masks and sitting the recommended 1.5 metres apart -- at a venue in San Sebastian on the country's northern coast.
The building had been cleaned ahead of the rally, sources from his party told Reuters. 
To avoid crowding at polling stations, voters in the elections will be able to vote by post or at post offices.
Spain is among countries worst-hit by the pandemic, with more than 28,000 deaths officially reported and a much higher than average infection rate of six per 10,000 people. 
Health officials say at least 20 outbreaks across the country are under control. 
At another meeting in Ourense in northwest Spain on Saturday, Sanchez supporters were seated apart in a tent while those who could not attend watched live on YouTube.
""We can be walls (against the virus) or we can be transmitters. Be a wall!"" Sanchez told the audience.
Polls show the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) is likely to win the largest share of the vote in Basque elections. It has been in alliance with the Socialists for the last four years but might opt to share power with EH Bildu, a separatist party.

Proudly democratic Taiwan is a bastion of liberal values in a part of the world where in many countries homosexuality remains illegal or taboo. Taiwan legalised same sex marriage last year, the first in Asia.
The ""Taiwan Pride Parade for the World"" billed itself as a show of solidarity with countries unable to hold LGBTQ celebrations due to restrictions on public events to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. The pandemic is under control in Taiwan.
An international crowd of more than 200 people waving rainbow flags and masks, some singing and dancing, marched up to the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, where a small group briefly displayed the flag in front of the building, which houses a giant statue of Taiwan's late leader.
After scattered shouts of ""Fuck you, Chiang Kai-shek"", the crowd marched back down the steps, accompanied by a handful of police, blowing whistles to stop people lingering.
Chiang, who died in 1975, was lauded in life as an anti-communist hero, especially in the United States, but many Taiwanese revile him as a despot who imprisoned and killed opponents during a reign of terror. 
Darien Chen, who represented Taiwan at Mr. Gay World 2013 and organised Sunday's event, said they were holding high the banner for the rest of the world, with hundreds of events cancelled in the traditional Pride month. 
""With the rest of the world under the peak of the epidemic, only Taiwan can do this,"" Chen told Reuters. ""Of course we won't give in, and we must continue with this flame of hope and stand up for the world, to hold the only parade in the world in this Pride month.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hong Kongers marched silently through the city's streets on Sunday in protest against the looming national security legislation to be implemented by the mainland Chinese government. 
Riot police armed with shields were present as the crowd moved from Jordan to Mong Kok in the Kowloon district, as part of a ""silent protest"", in which they marched with the usual chanting or slogan shouting mainly absent.
Scuffles broke out in Mong Kok during the event, prompting police to use pepper spray to subdue parts of the crowd, according to a Reuters witness. 
The proposed national security laws were reviewed by the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Sunday, according to a report by state media Xinhua. 
The laws are expected to be passed before the end of June but a draft has yet to be made public. 
""I am here to oppose the national security laws,"" said Esther, 25, who was on the streets of Jordan on Sunday. 
""It's not the last battle, there is a long term resistance (to the laws),"" she said, declining to give her surname. 
The event came a day after Hong Kong police refused permission for an annual march usually held on July 1 to mark the handover of the city from Britain to Chinese authorities 23 years ago.
Police said in a statement to the organiser that a march would be in violation of Hong Kong's current ban of gatherings of more than 50 people that was put in place as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. 
A survey conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute for Reuters showed the national security legislation is opposed by a majority of people in the financial centre.

Justice Minister Celestin Tunda was detained by police on Saturday evening and released following several hours of questioning by prosecutors at the court of cassation, triggering a political storm within the ruling coalition.
""This serious and unprecedented incident is likely to weaken the stability and the harmonious functioning of institutions, and to cause the resignation of the government,"" Prime Minister Sylvestre Ilunga said in a statement.
Tunda has clashed with President Felix Tshisekedi over judicial changes proposed by Tunda's party that would give the justice ministry more control over criminal prosecutions. Opponents of the change say it would undermine the independence of the judiciary.
The disagreement has highlighted strains in the ruling coalition between Tshisekedi and allies of his long-serving predecessor, Joseph Kabila.
Kabila stepped down last year but maintains wide-ranging powers through his parliamentary majority and control of most cabinet ministries and the prime minister's office. Tunda is a heavyweight in Kabila's PPRD party.
""No member of the government can be prosecuted for opinions expressed during deliberations of the council of ministers,"" Ilunga said referring to Friday's meeting where Tshisekedi and Tunda reportedly quarrelled over the judicial changes.
Ilunga said the magistrates responsible for what he called Tunda's ""brutal and arbitrary arrest"" should face disciplinary action.
Tshisekedi came to power in January 2019, forming a coalition with Kabila, but the alliance has shown increasing signs of disharmony.
Hundreds of protesters rallied against the planned law on the grounds of parliament on Wednesday. They were dispersed by police firing tear gas and water cannon.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's bustling capital was once seen as a relative oasis in the country's raging drug war, but a shocking military-style assassination attempt on the city's police chief offers proof at least one gang is unafraid to shatter the peace.
The hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel, or CJNG, was quickly fingered as the probable culprit by the wounded target of the attack, Mexico City security head Omar Garcia Harfuch, in a message tapped out on his phone shortly after the shooting, likely from his hospital bed. 
The 38-year-old Garcia Harfuch - who was shot in the shoulder, collarbone and knee during the attack - defiantly pledged to keep working.
While cartel gunmen failed to kill Garcia Harfuch in Friday morning's daybreak hit in one of Mexico City's most upscale neighborhoods, two of his bodyguards plus an innocent bystander on her way to work were gunned down in the crossfire.
""Until recently, many denied that big drug cartels operate in Mexico City, and it's just not true,"" said security expert Erubiel Tirado.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in a video message on Saturday that government intelligence services knew that such an attack on the chief was being planned, and were able to warn him ahead of time to take additional precautions. 
Nearly 20 suspects have already been arrested in the case, according to Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, including the man described as the leader of the attempted assassination.
The attack played out on the city's leafy Paseo de la Reforma boulevard. Security camera footage showed heavily armed and mostly hooded cartel hit men pouring out of a truck after blocking the roadway and unleashing hundreds of rounds on Garcia Harfuch's armored SUV.
Many analysts described the hit as a show of strength by CJNG and evidence that drug gangs are probably expanding their presence in Mexico's capital. Some, however, offered a contrarian view.
""For me, this looked like the futile struggle of a drowning man more than a show of strength,"" said cartel expert Tomas Guevara.
He noted that preliminary reports describe some three weeks of planning that went into the attack, and pointed to a well-executed counteroffensive by police immediately afterwards in which fleeing cartel gunmen were swiftly rounded up.
""In Mexico City, at least, the police are doing a good job... and I hope this can boost other police departments in other states.""
CJNG is regarded as Mexico's strongest gang, along with the Sinaloa Cartel formerly led by jailed kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. It is often credited with successfully infiltrating poorly paid and trained local police departments across the country to better protect its wide-ranging criminal rackets.
Unlike his predecessors, Lopez Obrador has sought a less confrontational approach to crime-fighting, preferring to attack what he describes as root causes like poverty and youth joblessness, via social spending.
The leftist Lopez Obrador repeated that message on Saturday, stressing that he will not be ""declaring war on anyone"" while also promising to prevent future attacks.
""We won't let them intimidate us,"" he said.
However, during Lopez Obrador's first full year in office last year murders hit a new record, and the homicide rate is on pace to surpass it this year.
The grisly crime wave will likely apply new pressure on the president to change tack.
""The army will need to be brought in,"" said Tirado, even as he acknowledged it will not likely contain the growth of sophisticated actors like CJNG or new rounds of deadly shootouts.

""We've seen this movie before.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France emerges from months of coronavirus lockdown to vote on Sunday in a delayed second round of municipal elections, with opinion polls suggesting a dire outcome for President Emmanuel Macron, whose party could fail to win in any big city.
A year ago Macron had hoped the local elections would help anchor his young party in towns and cities across France, including Paris, ahead of an anticipated 2022 re-election bid. But more recently, presidential aides have been playing down expectations.
In the capital, the election's biggest prize, the sitting socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo is on track for a comfortable win after a shambolic campaign by Macron and his La Republique en Marche (LaRem) party.
Meanwhile, the Greens are projected to do well in cities such as Lyon, Marseille and Bordeaux, sometimes in alliance with the Left, building on momentum they created in 2019's European elections. In Perpignan, Marine Le Pen's far-right party may take control of its first city with a population over 100,000.
France pressed ahead with the first round of the municipal elections in mid-March, less than 48 hours before Macron imposed one of Europe's strictest lockdowns, forcing a long delay before the second round.
""We'll be careful. We can always bring our own pen, wear a mask and use sanitizer gel,"" remarked Paris pensioner Christian Courtot.
Macron has said he will ""reinvent"" his presidency and present a detailed plan next month for the final two years of his mandate.

A government reshuffle is widely expected, with the biggest question-mark over the future of Macron's popular prime minister, Edouard Philippe. Philippe is running for his old job as mayor of Le Havre.

BLANTYRE (Reuters) - Malawi's opposition leader Lazarus Chakwera on Saturday was declared the winner of a re-run presidential election, a dramatic reversal of incumbent Peter Mutharika's discredited win 13 months earlier in a process that analysts viewed as a triumph for democracy in Africa.
Chakwera, 65, secured the required majority, with 58.57% of the vote on Tuesday, the electoral commission said, beating Mutharika. Chakwera won election to a five-year term as president of the nation of 18 million people.
In power since 2014, Mutharika must now either challenge the result in court or step aside. The vote was regarded by analysts as a test of the ability of African courts to tackle ballot fraud and restrain presidential power.
The judiciary infuriated Mutharika in February by overturning the result of the May 2019 election that had given him a second term, citing irregularities, and ordering a re-run. Mutharika's disputed win sparked months of anti-government demonstrations, a rare sight in Malawi.
""The commission declares that Lazarus Chakwera ... has attained the requisite majority of electorate and is duly elected as president,"" the electoral commission chairman Chifundo Kachale said.
Before seeking public office, Chakwera served as president of the Malawi Assemblies of God.
Mutharika earlier on Saturday said there had been voting irregularities including violence and intimidation against his party's election monitors, but the complaint was dismissed by the electoral commission. The opposition has denied the allegations.

The ruling against Mutharika's election victory, upheld by the nation's supreme court, echoed one by a Kenyan court in 2017 that nullified President Uhuru Kenyatta's election win - although in that case Kenyatta went on to win the re-run.

The interception of the Russian Tu-142s marks the 10th time this year that Russian military aircraft have been intercepted off Alaska, the North American Aerospace Defense Command, or NORAD, said in a statement. 
The Russian aircraft did not enter U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD said.
The intercepting aircraft are based at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, said a NORAD spokesman, Captain Cameron Hillier.
The incident is one of a series of back-and-forth probes by Russia and the United States this year. On June 19, Russia scrambled fighter jets to intercept two U.S. B-52 bombers flying over the Sea of Okhotsk, off Russia's far eastern coast, the Interfax news agency reported.

Six people, including a policeman, were stabbed at a hotel in the city centre on Friday before the attacker was shot dead.
Police said they were not looking for any other suspects and were not treating the incident as terrorism. The attacker was the only person killed.
Earlier on Saturday, the injured police officer, Constable David Whyte, issued a statement from hospital.
""The incident myself and colleagues faced in West George Street was extremely challenging. The scene we were confronted with is something I will never forget,"" he said.
""Despite suffering serious injuries myself, I know that the swift actions of colleagues saved lives and prevented a far more serious incident.""
Whyte's condition was initially described as critical. On Saturday police said he was in a stable condition.
The hotel where the attack took place was being used to house asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic. Police cautioned against speculating about the attacker's motives.
Three of the other people who were injured were asylum seekers, and two were hotel staff. All five remained in hospital, and one was in a critical but stable condition.

Several British media outlets reported that the attacker had been behaving erratically and displaying signs of mental health problems in the hours leading up to the incident. Police did not confirm those details.

ISLAMABAD/KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan's national airline has written to foreign missions and global regulatory and safety bodies, assuring them it has grounded all 141 pilots suspected of obtaining licences through unfair means, the carrier's spokesman said on Saturday.
The move looks to assuage concerns after Pakistan's Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said on Friday the government had asked various commercial airlines, flying clubs and charter companies to ground a total of 262 pilots until investigations into their qualifications were completed.
Pakistan Air Line Pilots Association on Saturday questioned the authenticity of the list and called on the judiciary to intervene and investigate the matter instead of the government to ensure transparency.
Global safety and transport bodies expressed concern about the alleged ""dubious"" licences and said they were looking into the matter. PIA flies a number of international routes, including to the United States, Britain and Europe.
The letter, signed by PIA Chief Executive Arshad Malik, promised the airline would remain compliant with all international aviation safety and regulatory standards.
""It is also ensured that all pilots flying PIA flights are having genuine licences endorsed by the government of Pakistan,"" said a copy of the letter sent to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad seen by Reuters.
PIA's spokesman said the letter had been sent to all heads of foreign missions in Pakistan as well as international aviation regulators and safety monitoring agencies.
Aviation Minister Khan had said the move to ground the pilots would help allay global concerns and show wrongdoing had been corrected. He said five officials from the aviation authority had been suspended for abetting the suspected pilots. 

In a joint statement, The International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations and the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers' Associations called for the crash probe to be conducted along international standards, urging against ""premature conclusions"" based on incomplete or speculative information.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Diana and Jillian Rosile of Denver this year would have marked their first Pride celebration as an out queer couple since Diana, a transgender woman, changed her legal name this month.
But as the relentless coronavirus pandemic forced Colorado's Pride events to go virtual, the young software engineers had to shelve their plans. However, the Rosiles still showed their Pride, sharing their news on social media.
The response, they said, has been overwhelmingly positive. ""Family and friends and coworkers have all been supportive,"" said Diana, 33. 
The pandemic has forced organizers to move parades, marches and forums online across the United States in June for Pride Month, an annual celebration of the LGBTQ community and a renewed call for equal rights. Still, ""canceling"" Pride was not an option, said Cathy Renna, director of communications at the National LGBTQ Task Force. 
""Our community just said, 'A year without Pride is not acceptable - let's find a way to try and create an experience online',"" she said. ""And in some ways, it's allowed an accessibility to Pride that we didn't have before.""
Millions of people from every corner of the world are expected to tune in on Saturday to Global Pride, a 24-hour virtual broadcast that organizers say could become the largest LGBTQ event ever. 
Chazzie Grosshandler, a 14-year-old transgender activist, would have attended her first Pride parade in New York City on Sunday. Instead, she will follow the event online from her home in Chicago. She will also participate in virtual events for the GenderCool Project, the organization co-founded by her mother to advocate for transgender and non-binary young people. 
""It is sad that we can't do stuff in person,"" Grosshandler said. ""We have to accept the change, and it's really disappointing but, you know, we have to move on.""
STILL MARCHING
Some in-person demonstrations will still take place. On Sunday in New York City, the Reclaim Pride Coalition, a group of queer and trans activists, will hold its second annual Queer Liberation March which this year will focus on a protest against racial injustice and demands for police reform.
""Inspired by the historic, Black-led protest movement that has taken to the streets here in NYC and across the world, Reclaim Pride supports demands for immediate defunding, disarming, and dismantling of police forces,” the organization's Francesca Barjon said in a statement. 
Organizers of Reclaim Pride reject commercial sponsorship as well as the presence of uniformed police, and have asked participants to wear face coverings and maintain social distancing during the march. 
Pride Month is especially significant this year for Michael Bridgeforth, 56, a Black gay man who said he grew up afraid ofcelebrating his identity and battling racism. 
""I think we all should take pride in who we are, regardless of our skin color, but it just makes me feel prouder,"" he said. ""Now I feel more empowered to stand my ground."" 
Bridgeforth and his husband Roland Ducharme, 60, have been attending Pride events together since they met at a gay bar in Baltimore in 1994. They took part in many Pride parades across the country over the years as they moved frequently due to Ducharme's job with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. 
In recent years, they favored smaller gatherings with friends in the gay community in Westfield, Massachusetts, but this year things will be different.
""I'm not sure if anything has been planned"" locally for Pride this year, Bridgeforth said. ""I don't think so because we were all very cautious"" of the coronavirus threat.

""We'll probably have a fire in our backyard.""

A man wielding a five-inch knife attacked people out enjoying the sun at Forbury Gardens, a Reading park, on the evening of June 20, killing three people and injuring three others.
""The Crown Prosecution Service has today authorised Counter Terrorism Policing South East to charge Khairi Saadallah, 25, with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder,"" the CPS said.
Saadallah will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on Monday.
A security source had previously told Reuters that the suspect, a resident of Reading, was a Libyan national.
Police named the victims as Britons James Furlong, 36, and David Wails, 49, and U.S. national Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39.
Ritchie-Bennett's family said in a statement on Saturday: ""We LOVED Joe so much and we are in such deep sorrow. We need all the prayers for Joe and the Ritchie and Bennett families.""
Local authorities in Reading held a memorial on Saturday evening at which civic and religious leaders and a police chief paid tribute to the victims and to members of the public who tried to help, some by tearing their shirts to make bandages.
While the speeches were televised, residents of Reading were encouraged not to gather in large numbers due to social distancing measures, but to light candles on their doorsteps.
Neil Basu, the national head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said that as the coronavirus lockdown was beginning to ease, members of the public should play their part in protecting themselves and others from what he called the scourge of terrorism.

""As we begin to return to normal, and public places become more crowded, we must be vigilant to the ongoing threat. If you see any suspicious activity, don't hesitate to act - report it,"" Basu said in a statement.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - China lashed out at Canada on Saturday over criticism about Chinese prosecution of two Canadians, saying the matter is based on evidence and urging Ottawa to cease ""megaphone diplomacy.""
Chinese prosecutors this month charged Canadians Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, for suspected espionage. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called on Beijing to cease the ""arbitrary detention,"" and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also called for their release.
In a website post, a representative of the Chinese embassy in Ottawa criticized recent ""irresponsible remarks"" by Canadian leaders.
""The facts are clear and evidence solid and sufficient. The accusation of so-called 'arbitrarily' detaining Canadian citizens is totally groundless,"" the post said.
Chinese authorities arrested the men in late 2018, soon after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. warrant.
The embassy spokesperson said Meng's arrest is the true arbitrary detention, and repeated Beijing's call for her release.
""Stop making irresponsible remarks on cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, and exerting pressure on China through megaphone diplomacy.""
Spokespersons for Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland could not immediately be reached.
Kovrig's wife asked this week that the Canadian justice minister consider intervening in the Chinese executive's extradition case to try and free the two Canadians. 

Trudeau has said exchanging Meng for the two men would weaken Canada's values and justice system.

LISBON (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters marched through one of Lisbon's main avenues on Saturday shouting ""Portugal is not racist"", in a demonstration organised by the leader of a far-right party known for his derogatory remarks against ethnic minorities.
Dozens of police officers were on standby as protesters wearing face masks marched and waved Portuguese flags in the demonstration organised by the leader of the Chega (Enough) party Andre Ventura, a former soccer commentator. There were no immediate reports of violence or arrests.
In October, Ventura won the far right's first seat in parliament since Portugal's dictatorship ended in 1974. 
""Today will be history because after 40 years the right decided to go out on the streets,"" Ventura, who has been involved in several controversies since the election, told a crowd of supporters.
In January, Ventura called for a Black fellow MP with dual Portuguese-Guinean citizenship to be ""returned to her own country"" after she proposed that items in Portuguese museums be sent back to their countries of origin.
A month later, Ventura questioned if Porto striker Moussa Marega, who quit a soccer match in protest after being subjected to monkey chants and other insults, was a victim of racism.
Saturday's protests took place at a time when Portuguese authorities are worried about a wave of new coronavirus cases across Lisbon's suburbs and have been forced to reintroduce certain lockdown measures.
""We are outdoors, we know the virus dies under a certain temperature, we are social distancing, we have masks and I believe we are complying with all rules,"" said Chega supporter Joao Rodrigues. 
The march came around three weeks after thousands gathered in Lisbon and other Portuguese cities in protest against racism and alleged police brutality.
Among the crowd of right-wingers at the Saturday demonstration, a 27-year-old man stood alone and waved a rainbow LGBT+ pride flag in protest.

""Someone has to show this ideology in 2020 is wrong,"" Joao Pedro said.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain is to uphold a ban on cruise liners from docking at its ports to stop the spread of COVID-19, according to a ministerial order published on Saturday. 
Cruise liners carrying thousands of passengers regularly stop off at ports in the Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, Barcelona and Malaga, but were prohibited when Spain went into lockdown on March 14.
With their crowds of often elderly passengers, cruise ships have been especially vulnerable to outbreaks of the virus and have been barred from disembarking in several countries.
Spain's ban on the vessels will continue until the coronavirus epidemic is brought under control, according to the Official State Gazette, even as the country otherwise reopens to tourists in an effort to revive an industry hammered by the coronavirus lockdown. 
The retention of the ban was described as a “proportionate, objective and non-discriminatory measure that is in line with the objective set by the WHO Emergency Committee to stop the spread of the virus”, the order said, referring to the World Health Organization.

Cruise liners form part of Spain's tourist sector which contributes 12% of GDP. In 2019 10 million cruise line passengers visited Spain.

But a government spokesman said late on Saturday an evacuation order issued by border-affairs officials had been revoked. Border affairs acknowledged issuing the order through the local administrator but said it affected fewer villages.
The warning to the village leaders came in a letter written on Wednesday, which was seen by Reuters and verified by a state government minister, Colonel Min Than.
The letter, signed by the administrator of Rathedaung township, Aung Myint Thein, told village leaders he had been informed the operations were planned in the township's Kyauktan village and nearby areas suspected of harbouring insurgents.
The letter does not specify where the order came from, but Min Than, Rakhine state’s border affairs and security minister, told Reuters it was an instruction from his border affairs ministry, one of three Myanmar government ministries controlled by the army.
“Clearance operation will be done by forces in those villages,” the letter from the administrator said.
“While this is being done, if the fighting occurs with AA terrorists, don't stay at the villages but move out temporarily,” it said, referring to the Arakan Army, the name of the Rakhine state insurgents.
The administrator could not be reached for comment by Reuters.
Min Than said the “clearance operation” described in the letter referred to military operations targeting “terrorists.”
He said the administrator had misinterpreted the order from his ministry and that the operations would only take place in a few villages, not the dozens mentioned, but confirmed other details.
The operations could last up to a week, Min Than said by phone, adding that “those who remain will be those who are loyal to the AA.”
On Saturday, government spokesman Zaw Htay said in a statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) the government had instructed the military not to use the term “clearance operations”. He also said the letter ordering people to flee had been revoked.
He did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking further comment. Reuters did not see the revocation instructions.
This year the Myanmar army has been fighting the AA, a group from the largely Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group that is seeking greater autonomy for the western region, also known as Arakan.
Dozens have died and tens of thousands been displaced in the conflict. Save the Children says 18 children were killed and 71 injured or maimed between January and March, citing local monitoring groups. The army says it does not target civilians.
""Clearance operations"" is the term the Myanmar authorities used in 2017 to describe operations against insurgents from Rakhine's Muslim-minority Rohingya people. During those operations, hundreds of thousands of people fled from their homes. Refugees said the army carried out mass killings and arson, accusations the army has denied.
Rohingyas fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during that military crackdown, which the government said was a response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
In a joint statement on Saturday, the British, U.S. and Canadian embassies in Myanmar said they were “deeply concerned by the reports of the Myanmar Military’s clearance operations along the Kyauktan village tract” and “the worsening humanitarian and security situation across the region.""
“We are aware of the historic impacts of such operations disproportionately affecting civilians,” the statement said. It called on “all armed actors to exercise restraint while in areas inhabited by local communities, some of whom may not, by no fault of their own, be able to seek refuge elsewhere.”
In anticipation of the new operation, Min Than said 80 people had fled Kyauktan to elsewhere in Rathedaung township and that the army had prepared shelter and food.
Zaw Zaw Htun, the secretary of the Rakhine Ethnic Congress, a humanitarian group, said at least 1,700 had fled to the neighbouring Ponnagyun township.
Another 1,400 are sheltering in a nearby village and are in dire need of food and other supplies, said regional parliamentarian Oo Than Naing from Rathedaung township.
A military spokesman did not answer phone calls seeking comment about the operations. Reuters could not independently verify how many people had fled their homes.
The UK-based rights group Burma Human Rights Network said residents of 39 villages had begun to flee since the order was issued in Kyauktan on Wednesday, citing local sources.     The Kyauktan area is home to tens of thousands of people, from both Rohingya and Rakhine communities, according to the Rakhine Ethnic Congress.
Journalists are barred from most of Rakhine state, and the government has imposed an internet shutdown on most of the region, making information difficult to verify.

The police source said the attack, the latest on the strategically important town of Mocimboa da Praia, 60 km (40 miles) south of the gas projects, was ""very violent"" and the country's defence and security forces (DSF) had suffered a number of casualties. 
""The DSF are fighting a fierce fight because they were met with hefty firepower,"" the source said, adding that communications were now down. 
Spokespeople for the defence ministry and police did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
Mozambique's northern-most province of Cabo Delgado is home to the gas developments worth some $60 billion. Since 2017, it has also seen an Islamist insurgency with links to Islamic State that has gathered pace over the past year. 
A separate security source confirmed the attack on Saturday and said helicopters operated by private security firm Dyck Advisory Group, which has been acting alongside government forces since earlier this year, also responded after initially being delayed by weather conditions and poor visibility. 
Last year the insurgent group, known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama, pledged allegiance to Islamic State, which subsequently began claiming the attacks via their media channels, including an earlier strike on Mocimboa da Praia in March. The town's port is used for cargo deliveries to the gas developments.
Exxon and Total did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent outside business hours. 
The insurgents have this year increasingly hit towns and military targets, prompting growing concern including from Mozambique's regional neighbours. 
Aid agency Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) recently halted its operations in Mocimboa da Praia, as well as in another town in the region, due to the security situation.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's parliament picked veteran opposition leader Micheál Martin as prime minister on Saturday to head the first ever coalition uniting the two parties that have battled each other for power since a civil war nearly a century ago.
He pledged to rescue Ireland from the ""the fastest-moving recession ever to hit"", brought on by the coronavirus crisis.
Martin's Fianna Fail party was forced to join forces with its foes Fine Gael, after a surprise election surge for leftist Irish nationalists Sinn Fein left neither of the traditional centrist parties with enough support to govern on its own. They and are joined in coalition by the environmentalist Greens.
Under a novel agreement, Martin is expected to step aside half way through the five-year term to allow Fine Gael's leader, outgoing Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, to return to the post.
""There is no question what our most urgent work is. There is no community, no part of our country which has escaped untouched"" by coronavirus), Martin told a special sitting of lawmakers, held in Dublin's large Convention Centre as the houses of parliament are too small for social distancing.
To overcome the recession ""we must act with urgency and ambition,"" said Martin, close to tears as he thanked his family who were unable to travel from his native Cork due to coronavirus restrictions due to be eased on Monday.
He was elected by 93 votes to 63 after also securing support from some independent members of parliament.
The appointment represented a turnaround for Fianna Fail and Martin, who was a member of the government that signed up to an EU/IMF bailout a decade ago and led to an unprecedented 2011 electoral collapse just after he took over as leader.
The 59-year-old former history teacher, who has held several senior ministries including health, trade, foreign affairs and education, faces another economic crisis with 26% of the country either temporarily or permanently unemployed.
The jobless rate was just 4.8% when the election was fought in very different circumstances in February. The main issue then was over how to allot the spoils of what was Europe's fastest growing economy. 
Instead Martin will oversee a stimulus package next month for the sectors hardest hit by the coronavirus lockdown. 
The new coalition will also split Irish politics along more explicitly ideological lines than in the past, with Sinn Fein taking over as the main opposition. Though Fianna Fail and Fine Gael emerged from opposite sides in civil war in the 1920s, they have mainly pushed similar centrist agendas for decades.
Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army that fought an insurgency against British rule of Northern Ireland, shocked the political establishment in February by securing the most votes with a call for more generous social programmes. It has 37 seats in the 160-seat parliament, the same number as Fianna Fail and two more than Fine Gael.

""You will no longer get it all your own way,"" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald told the two parties.

Police have been holding wildcat protests everyday in towns and cities across France at government attempts to change their practices and punish officers suspected of racism. 
Police unions accuse the government of scapegoating them for deep-rooted social ills in an attempt to quell public anger after the killing of George Floyd unleashed protests in France as anger at police violence and racism swept the world.
Many among the women protesting outside the Paris police headquarters were wives and partners of officers. One carried a message for Interior Minister Christophe Castaner: ""Respect our police.""
Castaner infuriated police this month when he acknowledged there were cases of racism in the force and proposed punishing any officer guilty of ""proven suspicions of racism"".

Britain left the bloc on Jan. 31. A transition period, during which Britain remains in the European single market and customs union, expires on Dec. 31 and pressure is mounting to agree a free trade deal before then.
With the two sides still far apart, a round of ""intensified negotiations"" is due to start next week.
""He (Johnson) said the UK would negotiate constructively but equally would be ready to leave the transition period on Australia terms if agreement could not be reached,"" Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement.

Australia does not have a comprehensive trade agreement with the EU. Much of EU-Australia trade follows default World Trade Organisation rules, though specific agreements are in place for certain goods.

Iran was one of the worst hit countries early in the pandemic, and since restrictions to stem its spread were gradually lifted from mid-April, cases have increased again, with the death toll topping 100 a day in the past nine days for the first time in two months. 
Some 2,456 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, taking the total to 220,180, Health Ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state television. She said 125 people had died, bringing the total to 10,364.
Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi told the Iran's Young Journalists Club semi-official news website that in one province, 120 people had been infected after attending a wedding party. He did not identify the province.
Launching the ""#I wear mask"" campaign, he pleaded with citizens, especially young Iranians, to take the disease seriously.
""In our country, every 33 seconds, one person is infected with the coronavirus, and every 13 minutes, one person dies from it,"" he said.
“I desperately - and in a friendly way - plead with people to cooperate in observing medical protocols for their own sake and that of others,” Harirchi said.
Wearing a face covering to avoid spreading the virus is not mandatory in Iran and the guidance is widely flouted.
Harirchi said on television that wearing masks reduced the risk of the spread of the virus by 85 percent.
State TV on Friday aired interviews with several patients in hospitals who said they contracted the virus after attending wedding parties, wakes and other gatherings

The director of Cinema Organization of Iran Hossein Entezami said 18,000 people went to movie theatres when they reopened on Friday.

The mural, which shows a veiled female figure staring mournfully downwards, was found at a farmhouse in central Italy earlier this month, nearly a one-and-a-half years after it was removed.
Two of those arrested are under formal investigation on suspicion of theft. The other four are suspected of concealing theft, the source said.
It is thought the thieves used portable grinders to remove the fire-exit door on which the mural was painted before carrying it off in a van, Italian media reported when the artwork was discovered.
The Bataclan, one of Paris' best-known rock venues, was stormed by militants during a concert in November 2015, as part of coordinated attacks around the city that killed 130 people.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has thrown his support behind the chief minister of the Borneon state of Sabah as candidate to lead the country, a statement from Mahathir said on Saturday.
Mahathir said supporters and allies had unanimously agreed at a meeting on Thursday to nominate Shafie Apdal, among the early leaders who opposed the government of Najib Razak which Mahathir ousted in 2018, as next prime minister.
""I fully support this proposal,"" Mahathir said. ""The important thing is that we have a solid stand for the people to know our position."" Malaysia's next national elections are due by September 2023 but there has been speculation of an earlier snap poll. 
Thursday's meeting also agreed to propose Mahathir's former deputy-turned-rival Anwar Ibrahim, and his son Mukhriz Mahathir, as deputy prime ministers.
Malaysia's opposition has been scrambling in recent weeks to muster a credible candidate to spearhead its challenge to Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's administration, but was unable to decide between Mahathir or Anwar.
The veteran politicians had joined hands in 2018 to oust the then prime minister Najib, with Anwar becoming Mahathir's successor in waiting.
Muhyiddin was unexpectedly made prime minister in March after a week of political turmoil punctuated by Mahathir's shock resignation.

Mahathir has pushed for a confidence vote in parliament in Muhyiddin's leadership and said he would seek to oust him for bringing back to power a graft-tainted party rejected by voters in an historic election two years ago.

Ethiopia, which is building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) which worries its downstream neighbours Egypt and Sudan, said it would fill the reservoir in a few weeks, as planned, providing enough time for talks to be concluded.
Tortuous negotiations over the years have left the two nations and their neighbour Sudan short of an agreement to regulate how Ethiopia will operate the dam and fill its reservoir, while protecting Egypt's scarce water supplies from the Nile river.
Ethiopia's water minister, Seleshi Bekele, said that consensus had been reached to finalise a deal within two to three weeks, a day after leaders from the three countries and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who chairs the African Union, held an online summit. 
Billene Seyoum, a spokeswoman for Ethiopia's prime minister, said that in Friday's agreement there was ""no divergence from Ethiopia's original position of filling the dam."" 
The Egyptian presidency said in a statement after the summit that Ethiopia will not fill the dam unilaterally.
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is being built about 15 km (9 miles) from the border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, the source of most of the Nile's waters. 
Ethiopia says the $4 billion hydropower project, which will have an installed capacity of 6,450 megawatts, is essential to its economic development. 
Ethiopia's Prime Minister's Office said that the three countries agreed that the Nile and the Grand Renaissance Dam ""are African issues that must be given African solutions."" 
Friday's round of talks brokered by the African Union, is the latest attempt to move forward negotiations which have repeatedly stalled due to technical and political disagreements. They also signal an intention to solve the issue without foreign intervention. 
Ethiopia's statement said the African Union, and not the U.N. Security Council, will assist the countries in the negotiations and provide technical support.
Cairo had appealed to the Council in a last-ditch diplomatic move aimed at stopping Ethiopia from filling the dam. The Council was expected to hold a public meeting on Monday to discuss the issue.

KABUL (Reuters) - A bomb attached to a vehicle killed two members of Afghanistan's independent human rights commission in Kabul on Saturday, the group said, as violence in the country rises despite a U.S.-brokered peace process.
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) said in a statement that 24-year-old donor coordinator Fatima Khalil and 41-year-old driver Ahmad Jawed Folad were killed by an explosive device while in an AIHRC vehicle on the way to its office on Saturday. 
""It is intolerable, assassinating human rights defenders is a war crime in the context of armed conflict,"" the AIHRC said, adding that staff had previously been the target of attacks.
Kabul's police spokesman confirmed that two people died in a blast early on Saturday.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack. A Taliban spokesman denied the group was involved.
It comes at a sensitive time amidst heightened violence around Afghanistan, including growing attacks against officials in urban centres.
The United States and other foreign players are trying to usher the insurgent Taliban and the Afghan government towards peace talks after the United States signed a troop withdrawal deal in February with the militant group to pave the way to ending more than 18 years of war.
Negotiations were expected to begin soon after progress was made on a dispute over the release of a controversial group of Taliban prisoners, Reuters reported on Friday.
However, a diplomatic source in Kabul said rising violence could hamper the peace process, and that foreign players were trying to appeal to the Taliban to reduce attacks. 
The United Nations and foreign powers, including the United Kingdom and Turkey, condemned Saturday's attack.
""There can be no justification for attacks against human rights defenders. Immediate investigation needed with perpetrators held to account,"" the UN mission to Afghanistan said on Twitter.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Outrage at the death of a father-son duo in the custody of Indian police earlier this week mounted on Saturday, with thousands on social media comparing the incident to the death of George Floyd in the United States.
J Jayaraj, 59, and Bennicks Immanuel, 31, were subjected to a brutal thrashing, which resulted in rectal bleeding and eventual death, according to a letter to government officials written by Jayaraj's wife J Selvarani. The letter, based on eyewitness testimony and reviewed by Reuters, seeks action against the police officers involved. 
Police in Sathankulam, a town located 50 km (31 miles) south of the port city of Thoothukudi in southern Tamil Nadu state, said in a first information report (FIR) reviewed by Reuters that Jayaraj and Bennicks were picked up on Friday, June 19 for breaching coronavirus lockdown rules. 
Bennicks died on Monday after complaining of breathlessness and Jayaraj died Tuesday, Chief Minister Edappadi Palaniswami, who oversees the police in the state, said in a statement on Wednesday. Two policemen involved in the incident had been suspended, he added.
""We will take action over this incident as per the law,"" Palaniswami said.
Hundreds of thousands of tweets were sent out using the hashtag #JusticeforJayarajandBennix, that was among the top Twitter topics trending in India on Friday and among the top 30 trending globally, with celebrities and politicians condemning police action.
""The George Floyds of India are far too many,"" tweeted Jignesh Mevani, a lawmaker in India's western Gujarat state.
""Will Indians march on streets in thousands, like America?,"" Mevani asked his nearly 750,000 Twitter followers, referring to events following the death in police custody on May 25 of George Floyd, a Black man.
Nearly 15 cases of custodial violence and torture were reported in every day on average, with 9 people dying in judicial or police custody every 24 hours, according to the latest annual report by India's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) for the year 2017/18.
The NHRC said in its report that some custodial deaths were reported after considerable delay or not reported at all, adding violence in custody was so rampant ""that it has become almost routine"".

1507,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 27, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Hong Kong police refuse permission for march to mark handover,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong police department on Saturday denied permission for an annual march in the former British colony on July 1 to mark the anniversary of the city's 1997 return to China, the organizer and the police said in separate statements.
In a notice to the organizer, Civil Human Rights Front, the police cited the city's current rules limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people due to the coronavirus pandemic, saying public assemblies and demonstrations are not exempted.
The notice, posted on the front's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, also cited violent incidents that took place after public assemblies and rallies organized by the group over the past 12 months.
""Upon risk assessment, police considered that the public meetings and procession are high-risk activities,"" the local police department said in a separate post on the department's Facebook page. 
The move comes ahead of a three-day meeting from Sunday of China's parliament, which is expected to enact new national security legislation on the eve of the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule.
China says the national security law, which has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists, will target only a small group of troublemakers and people who abide by the legislation have no reason to worry.
China took back control of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.
In recent years, the anniversary of the handover has been marked by deepening despondency about what many residents saw as increasing meddling by the mainland and the erosion of freedoms.
On Friday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, but he did not name any of those targeted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday Washington was imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, but he did not name any of those targeted.
The move comes ahead of a three-day meeting of China's parliament from Sunday expected to enact new national security legislation for Hong Kong that has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists. 
The U.S. visa restrictions apply to ""current and former"" Chinese Communist Party officials ""believed to be responsible for, or complicit in, undermining Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy,"" Pompeo said, without naming them.
Last month, President Donald Trump responded to China's plans by saying he was initiating a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial center since its handover by Britain in 1997.
Pompeo's announcement represents the first concrete U.S. step in response to China's moves, but Bonnie Glaser, an Asia expert at Washington’s Center for Strategic and International Studies, said visa restrictions were largely symbolic and the fact that no names were given could lessen their impact.
A State Department spokeswoman said relatives of designees could also be barred. A Bloomberg columnist quoted a department official as saying the number of officials targeted was ""in the single digits.""
Chinese embassy spokeswoman Fang Hong said China ""opposes the U.S. side's wrongful decisions,"" and added that China's legislation targeted only ""a very narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardize national security.""
""We urge the U.S. to immediately correct its mistakes, withdraw the decisions and stop interfering in China's domestic affairs,"" she said.
Wall Street's major indexes tumbled on Friday after a Wall Street Journal article said U.S. ""meddling"" on issues like Hong Kong and Taiwan could jeopardize Chinese purchases under a Phase 1 trade deal Trump agreed with China in January, spooking investors already worried about a surge in coronavirus cases.
Pompeo's announcement comes at a time of intensified U.S. rhetoric against Beijing as Trump campaigns for re-election. Opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward China, especially over the coronavirus, which began there.
""President Trump promised to punish the Chinese Communist Party officials who were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong's freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that,"" Pompeo said.
He accused China of pressuring local authorities to arrest pro-democracy activists and disqualify electoral candidates, and added: ""The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns.""
Pompeo said last week Washington would treat Hong Kong as a Chinese city rather than an autonomous one to the extent that China treated the territory as a Chinese city. He said Hong Kong elections due in September would show China's intentions.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate approved a bill that would impose mandatory sanctions on people or companies that back efforts to restrict Hong Kong's autonomy. It includes secondary sanctions on banks that do business with anyone backing any crackdown on the territory's autonomy.

A Hong Kong government spokesman called the legislation unacceptable, China's official Xinhua news agency said.

BRUSSELS/CHICAGO (Reuters) - European Union countries failed to settle on Friday on a final ""safe list"" of countries whose residents could travel to the bloc from July, with the United States, Brazil and Russia set to be excluded.
Ambassadors from the 27 EU members convened from Friday afternoon to establish criteria for granting quarantine-free access from next Wednesday.
A redrawn text of 10-20 countries was put to them, but many said they needed to consult first with their governments, diplomats said. The list did not include the United States, Brazil or Russia, one diplomat said. 
Discussions were continuing overnight, with the EU countries expected to give informal replies by Saturday evening, people familiar with the matter said.
U.S. passengers may be allowed to travel if they meet certain conditions such as passing temperature checks, two U.S. officials said.
The European Commission had advised that the bloc first lift internal border controls and then gradually open up to outsiders. However, the first step has not gone according to plan. 
Greece is mandating COVID-19 tests for arrivals from a range of EU countries, including France, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, with self-isolation until results are known.
The Czech Republic has said it will not allow in tourists from Portugal, Sweden and part of Poland.
There is broad agreement that the bloc should only open up to those with a similar or better epidemiological situation, but there are questions about how to assess a country's handling of the epidemic and the reliability of data.
A number of countries, such as Tanzania, Turkmenistan and Laos have no reported cases in the past two weeks, according to EU agency, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Based on ECDC data for the two weeks to Thursday, a range of countries are clearly in a worse situation than the European Union.
They include the United States, Mexico, Brazil and much of Latin America, Russia, South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
Despite pressure from U.S. airlines and unions, the White House has not committed to mandating fresh air travel safety measures in the wake of the pandemic. Discussions between airlines and government officials including Vice President Mike Pence on Friday over temperature checks ended without an agreement.
In a statement, Pence's office said the parties also discussed ""the best path forward for allowing Americans to safely travel internationally again.""
The Commission has suggested the western Balkans countries - Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia - should be admitted.

However, according to the ECDC data, the number of cases in Bosnia and North Macedonia could be too high.

GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - A man stabbed six people including a policeman in the Scottish city of Glasgow on Friday before he was shot dead by police.
An eyewitness told Sky News she had seen several people covered in blood being treated by the emergency services after the incident at a city centre hotel. Armed police arrived within minutes.
Police listed the attacker as the only fatality, despite earlier media reports that he had killed two other people.
Police Scotland Assistant Chief Constable Steve Johnson said the incident had been contained and there was no wider risk to the public. 
""The individual who was shot by armed police has died,"" Police Scotland said in a statement, adding that they were not looking for anyone else. Police said they were not treating the incident as terrorism.
One eyewitness in the hotel described the scene as ""full of blood"".
""I was in my room and I heard loud screams from downstairs,"" a man who gave his name as John told the BBC.
""I got worried and went to check what was going on. When I opened the lift it was all blood.""
Police said all the six wounded were men, including the injured officer who was in a critical but stable condition. The officer was later identified by police as Constable David Whyte.
The hotel, the Park Inn by Radisson, had been used to house asylum seekers during the coronavirus pandemic, although authorities cautioned against speculating about a motive from that.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply saddened by the terrible incident in Glasgow"".
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was the ""toughest of days for Glasgow,"" reiterating a call from police not to gather in crowds this weekend.

Last week, three people were killed in the southern English town of Reading when a man wielding a knife went on the rampage in a park. Police said they were treating that incident as terrorism.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian President Ivan Duque on Friday called Venezuela a public health ""time bomb,"" and said the lack of reliable information about the status of its neighbor's coronavirus outbreak was a worry as his administration tries to control its own infections.
Colombia has long been the top destination for Venezuelans fleeing years of social and economic upheaval in their home country. 
Asked if he was worried about Colombia's lengthy borders with Venezuela and Brazil as a conduit for the virus, even though they are officially closed, Duque told Reuters he was, and said the issue with Venezuela was a lack of information.
""In the case of Venezuela the information is non-existent,"" Duque said in an interview. ""There's not good hospital capacity or good epidemiological capacity, for a long time they haven't had serious vaccination programs."" 
""I think Venezuela is a time bomb from the public health point of view.""
Venezuela has acknowledged just 4,600 coronavirus cases and 39 deaths, while Colombia has reported around 80,600 confirmed cases and more than 2,600 deaths. 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has insisted his country has managed the outbreak better than other Latin American nations and says most cases can be traced to migrants returning from Colombia and Brazil. 
Venezuelan doctors, however, have decried insufficient hospital beds and supplies, limited use of face masks in public spaces, and the use of low-budget hotels to quarantine patients.
Duque's government does not recognize Maduro as his country's rightful leader and regularly accuses him of harboring crime gangs and leftist rebels. 
Colombia last month sent more soldiers to its border with Brazil to stop informal crossings, after sparsely-populated Amazonas province saw a spike in cases.
Brazil has the world's second highest number of coronavirus cases after the United States, registering more than 1.2 million cases and nearly 55,000 deaths. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic.
Duque said in contrast with Venezuela, Brazil and its officials are making efforts to control the virus, however. 
""It must also be emphasized that (Brazil) has much more trustworthy, more credible institutions,"" he said.
""Also regionally we've seen state governors are trying to do more tests, putting in measures, there is a coordinated effort with national authorities.""
Thanks to an economic and social lockdown put in place in late March, Colombia's infection levels are ""much more an ellipse"" than a spike, Duque said.
New cases are concentrated in a handful of municipalities and deaths in those over 60 years old, he said. 
The country, which has boosted its number of intensive care units by 17% since the start of the pandemic, is trying to increase the number of ventilators as well.
""Colombia should get close to 10,000 ventilators, which will translate to a robust capacity in intensive care units,"" he said.
Between spending on social programs and healthcare, government credit guarantees and liquidity efforts by the central bank, the equivalent of 11.3% of gross domestic product is working to fight the coronavirus, Duque said.
Almost 90% of the country's economic activity was ""in the process of recovery,"" he contended.

The finance ministry has said the economy will contract 5.5% this year.

Citing officials briefed on the matter, the Times said the United States determined months ago that a Russian military intelligence unit linked to assassination attempts in Europe had offered rewards for successful attacks last year.
Islamist militants, or armed criminal elements closely associated with them, are believed to have collected some bounty money, the newspaper said.
The White House, the CIA and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined requests from Reuters for comment on the Times report. 
President Donald Trump has been briefed on the intelligence finding, the Times said. It said the White House has yet to authorize any steps against Russia in response to the bounties.
Of the 20 Americans killed in combat in 2019, the Times said, it was not clear which deaths were under suspicion.
After nearly 20 years of fighting the Taliban, the United States is looking for a way to extricate itself from Afghanistan and to achieve peace between the U.S.-backed government and the militant group, which controls swathes of the country.
On Feb. 29, the United States and the Taliban struck a deal that called for a phased U.S. troop withdrawal.
U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan is down to nearly 8,600, well ahead of a schedule agreed with the Taliban, in part because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. and NATO officials said in late May.

The Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO) oversees a network of hundreds of monitoring stations that use seismic, hydroacoustic and other technology to check for a nuclear weapon test anywhere in the world. That technology can, however, be put to other uses as well.
One of its stations scanning the air for radionuclides - telltale radioactive particles that can be carried long distances by the wind - detected unusually high levels of three radionuclides earlier this week: caesium-134, caesium-137 and ruthenium-103.

MANILA/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Filipino lawyer embroiled in a multi-billion dollar fraud at Wirecard, Mark Tolentino, told Reuters that he was surprised to be linked to the German payments firm and that he was the ""victim of a frame-up"". 
Wirecard went bankrupt earlier this week after disclosing that $2.1 billion of cash supposed to be in bank accounts in the Philippines probably didn't exist. The revelation led to the arrest of its former chief executive and has triggered probes in Germany, Brussels and the Philippines as investigators try to determine what happened. 
In a phone interview with Reuters, Tolentino said he opened six bank accounts for a Singapore-based firm but did not know until the scandal broke that they were for Wirecard. He said the accounts never had more than a few hundred euros in them. 
""It seemed that all fingers were pointing to me to be the thief and manipulator of the missing money,"" he said. ""I want to clear my name."" 
""I am a victim of identity theft and fake news and frame up,"" Tolentino added. 
He declined to provide documents or other evidence to show how he had been duped. 
Tolentino, 39, has not been charged with any crime. Philippines Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra told Reuters that Tolentino would be questioned on Monday as part of its investigation.
""He's the first to be invited to shed light on the matter,"" Guevarra said.
The Philippine government has not said what its probe will focus on.
Wirecard declined to comment.
Tolentino said he opened six euro bank accounts in the name of his law firm, MKT Law, at the Bank of the Philippines Islands (BPI) and Banco de Oro Unibank (BDO) on behalf of Citadelle Corporate.
Singapore company records show Citadelle Corporate is a business administration company based in Singapore.
A Citadelle employee declined to comment by phone and an email address on the company's website was not active.
BPI and BDO both say Wirecard was not a client of theirs and that documents purporting to show Wirecard had deposited funds with them were false. BPI said it had terminated one of its assistant managers for signing a false certificate of deposit while BDO said it had terminated a marketing officer for fabricating a bank certificate.
Tolentino spent ten months in President Rodrigo Duterte’s administration as an assistant secretary at the transport ministry before being sacked in 2018 for discussing a government project with the president's sister.
In a statement from May 2018, the transport ministry said it, ""welcomes and strongly supports the decision of the President to terminate the services of Mr. Tolentino as Assistant Secretary for Railways due to questionable dealings and unfairly involving the first family with matters regarding the Mindanao Railway Project.”
Tolentino said he did not discuss a government project with the president's sister and his dismissal was political.

Since leaving government, he has returned to legal practice and also teaches business law at a local university. He described himself as an experienced litigation and trial attorney on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.

The South American country has done better than regional neighbors Brazil, Chile and Peru in controlling the pandemic overall. But it has seen a worrying recent spike in COVID-19 cases in the densely populated Argentine capital and surrounding Buenos Aires province.
Overall cases in the country have risen fivefold since late May, hitting over 50,000 on Thursday when there were 2,606 new confirmed daily cases. The death toll stands at over 1,150.
Fernandez said restrictions on movement in Buenos Aires that had previously eased would be tightened again next week due to the rise in infections. Lockdown measures were initially imposed on March 20 and previously extended until June 28.
Fernandez said the new tougher measures in Buenos Aires would last until July 17.
""We need to gain time to guarantee that our health system is ready and can serve everyone,"" Fernandez said. ""The quarantine is a remedy for the pandemic, the only one we know of."" 
As the grains producing country has looked to revive stalled economic growth, others regions have seen restrictions largely lifted. The area around Buenos Aires, where the vast majority of cases are focused, had also seen some easing.
Fernandez urged people not to get angry at the lockdown, but rather at the disease, as he looked to head off discontent over the economic impact the health crisis has had on businesses, with forecasts of a near 10% economic contraction this year. 
""The economy is deteriorating, but the economy will recover. What unfortunately we are not going to recover are those thousand Argentines who have left us,"" he said.

""We know perfectly well that these decisions have an economic consequence,"" he added. ""I am not a fool. I listen fully to the problems of those who have a business, as well as independent and autonomous workers.""

Amnesty said it checked Radi's phone and alleged that authorities had snooped on him using spyware developed by cyber security company NSO Group.
Moroccan authorities said in a statement carried by state media that Amnesty had not contacted them, and said the report served business competitors in the intelligence market.
They asked Amnesty to give them hard evidence of wrongdoing “in order to take necessary measures to defend citizens’ rights.”
Radi, a critic of Morocco’s human rights record, was questioned by police on Thursday for what the prosecutor said were suspicions he received funds linked to foreign intelligence services.
Radi declined to comment on the questioning because of the confidential character of the probe but he described the accusation as “ridiculous.”

In March, Radi was handed a suspended four-month prison term on the charge of insulting a judge on Twitter.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The treatment of migrant workers in Canada by some farmers is disgraceful and the federal government is seeking to fix the problem, the country's health minister told a parliamentary committee on Friday, as farms battle COVID-19 outbreaks among their employees.
Outbreaks of coronavirus infections have killed three people and infected hundreds more on farms in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, in recent weeks.
Health Minister Patty Hajdu said she had heard stories about the treatment of migrant workers that ""would curl your hair,"" and the way some farms treat them now is ""a national disgrace.""
Hajdu added that she was working with Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough ""on how to reform the temporary foreign worker program"" but gave no details on what those reforms might look like. 
Canadian farmers rely on some 60,000 temporary foreign workers, predominantly from Latin America and the Caribbean to plant and harvest crops. Many live in crowded bunkhouses where the virus can spread quickly. 
""All the PPE (personal protective equipment) in the world will not protect you if you are sleeping in a bunkhouse that is housing 12 to 15 people that may not have any ability for distancing, certainly no private washrooms or kitchen,"" Hajdu said when asked whether Canada would consider providing migrant workers with PPE upon their arrival in Canada.
Migrant farm workers are considered a vulnerable population and need to be supported should they fall ill, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam told reporters on Thursday. 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has also said Canada must do more to protect migrant farm workers, who are considered essential workers.

Earlier this week, an Ontario official said the province would allow some people who have tested positive for COVID-19 but do not have symptoms to immediately return to work, provided precautions were in place.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - When the 60-person Arena Cinelounge in Los Angeles opens again for the first time in months, more than a dozen seats will be filled by cardboard cutouts of James Dean, Charlie Chaplin and other Hollywood icons.
The seating arrangement, designed to encourage social distancing among the 15 real-life patrons who will be allowed into each screening, is one of the new safety measures theaters are putting in place to reduce the chance of coronavirus spread. 
""We're going above and beyond to make sure that everything is spotless and that audiences feel comfortable and safe being with us for two to three hours,"" owner Christian Meoli said.
It is unclear, however, when Meoli and other theater operators will be able to welcome back guests. 
While about 780 indoor cinemas have reopened around the country, officials in Los Angeles County, the largest moviegoing market in the United States, have not yet given a green light, voicing concern about a rise in coronavirus cases. New York City, the country's No. 2 movie market, also has not set a date for cinema reopenings.
The theater business has been devastated by the coronavirus shutdowns that began in mid-March, laying off tens of thousands of employees and borrowing funds to stay afloat. 
The industry is hoping for mass openings in July, when nationwide chains AMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC), Cinemark and Cineworld's Regal Cinemas are scheduled to be back in business. All plan safeguards including limited attendance, extra cleaning and face masks for guests and workers.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co has said it will roll out action epic ""Mulan"" on July 24. AT&T Inc's Warner Bros. had been set to follow with director Christopher Nolan's thriller ""Tenet"" on July 31, but the studio postponed the debut until Aug. 12.
More shuffling of the schedule could come, depending on the progress of the coronavirus pandemic.
Currently, the first widely released film on Hollywood's schedule is ""Unhinged,"" a road rage drama starring Russell Crowe, set to debut on July 10.
Crowe said he was encouraged to hear reports that moviegoers have been longing to head back to cinemas, especially for thrillers.
""They wanted to be back in that place, in that safe place, in that room, where all the craziness is just happening on the screen, not necessarily in their own lives,"" Crowe said in an interview.
In Los Angeles, movie fans had mixed opinions about heading back to theaters.
""I'm a big cinema-goer, so for me, it would be just to make sure that social distancing is in place"" along with other steps such as pre-packaging of concessions, said Sean Thomas, an accountant visiting from Chicago. ""That would make me feel comfortable.""
Others were not so eager.

""You can watch movies at home, so I don't think that's super essential,"" said screenwriter Matt Solsberg.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A white off-duty police officer was found guilty of assault in a 2016 attack on a Black man, a Canadian judge ruled in a livestreamed hearing on Friday.
Michael Theriault, a Toronto police officer, and his brother Christian Theriault, who was not from the police department, were charged with aggravated assault and obstruction of justice after the pair violently attacked Dafonte Miller in Whitby, Ontario, 50 km (30 miles) east of Toronto, using their fists and a pipe.
Miller, who was 19 at the time, lost his left eye as a result of the attack, which has drawn attention for its racial overtones and prompted questions about police brutality.
In recent weeks, police brutality against people of color has been gaining widespread attention in Canada, including an alleged attack on Chief Allan Adams, an indigenous leader in Alberta.
The brothers argued that they were acting in self-defense, after they allegedly found Miller attempting to steal their parents' car.
Ontario Superior Court Justice Joseph Di Luca said although it was not his job to conduct an inquiry into race and policing, he was ""mindful of the need to carefully consider the radicalized context from which this case arises,"" local media reported.
Christian Theriault was found not guilty of aggravated assault. Both brothers were found not guilty of obstruction of justice.
The court is scheduled to return on July 15 to discuss a sentencing hearing.

PARIS/OTTAWA (Reuters) - France said on Friday it would download the black boxes from a Ukrainian airliner downed by an Iranian missile in January, easing a stand-off over where they should be read.
France's BEA crash investigation agency said it was acting at the request of Iran, which remains responsible under global rules for conducting a formal accident probe after acknowledging that the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 was downed by its forces.
The Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down on Jan. 8 by an Iranian ground-to-air missile, killing 176 people in what Tehran termed a ""disastrous mistake"" at a time of heightened tensions with the United States. 
Work on repairing and downloading the cockpit voice and data recorders will begin on July 20, the BEA said.
Aviation authorities in Canada, 57 of whose citizens died on board, said they would send a team to Paris to participate.
Iran's envoy to the United Nations aviation agency told Reuters earlier this month that the country's Air Accident Investigation Board had asked the BEA to read the black boxes, though this was followed by conflicting ministerial statements.
Friday's statement suggests Western and Iranian officials will jointly witness the technical work at the BEA, though one person following the case did not rule out last-minute changes.
Under UN guidelines, U.S. and Ukrainian accident investigators are accredited to the investigation, but there was no immediate confirmation of whether they would travel to France.
The BEA, which has a laboratory on the outskirts of Paris, has a history of assisting with some of the most sensitive probes when tensions are high between parties directly involved.

In 1993 the agency analysed black boxes of a U.S.-built Korean airliner downed a decade earlier by the Soviet Union, after a UN agency re-opened the case.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico City's chief of police was shot and injured and two of his bodyguards killed in a dramatic assassination attempt early on Friday that he quickly blamed on one of Mexico's most powerful drug gangs, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG).
The city's public security chief Omar Garcia Harfuch suffered three bullet wounds as he and bodyguards came under heavy fire around dawn in an upscale Mexico City neighborhood, where the attack was captured on security cameras. 
Some three hours later, apparently from his hospital bed, Garcia sent out a message on Twitter blaming his injuries and the death of two bodyguards on a ""cowardly attack"" by the CJNG, a gang notorious as one of the most violent in the country.
A third person, a woman apparently on her way to work, was also killed in the gunfire which ripped through the exclusive Lomas de Chapultepec neighborhood. The area is home to many wealthy people and the location of ambassadorial residences.
Grainy security camera footage broadcast on Mexican television showed a group of heavily armed men in an open-backed truck and an SUV blocking off a road to open fire on Garcia's vehicle.
In separate images, fast-arriving police could be seen shouting and moving towards the high caliber gunfire that rang out for several minutes just after 6.30 a.m. local time/1130 GMT.
Television footage of what was apparently Garcia's armored SUV showed a vehicle riddled with bullets roped off by police.
The shooters fled after the attack and Mexico City attorney general Ernestina Godoy said 12 suspects were later arrested.
Mexico City authorities said they had recovered military-grade long guns from the crime scene.
Led by a former police officer and based in the western state of Jalisco, the CJNG has been blamed for fueling record levels of violence in Mexico during its battles to eliminate rivals for control of drug trafficking and crime rackets.

Friday's attack shocked residents of the western neighborhood that is rarely troubled by the bloodletting that has afflicted many poorer parts of the country.

AYUTTHAYA, Thailand/YANGON (Reuters) - Thailand and Myanmar destroyed 25 tonnes of illicit drugs collectively worth more than $2 billion on Friday, but said the tide of drugs was growing as organised crime gangs boost supply and find new channels to do business.
Southeast Asia's Golden Triangle - where northern Myanmar, Laos and Thailand meet - has long been a hub of illicit drug trafficking. Production is now on an industrial scale.
In Ayutthaya, north of Bangkok, Thai authorities marked International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking with a mass incineration of drugs.
Black-clad police commandoes guarded stacks of boxes of drugs unloaded from trucks, and heroin bricks and bags stuffed with pink methamphetamine pills where thrown into dumpsters for incineration.
Thai counter-narcotics chiefs said coronavirus travel restrictions and checkpoints had helped reduce smuggling activities although the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) says the trade has thrived https://reut.rs/2NzewOl.
Wisanu Prasarthong-osoth, a deputy national police chief, said drugs criminals were becoming creative.
""Our children are making the wrong decision to order narcotic drugs online. And the dealers send to them,"" he said.
Though opium cultivation and heroin refining has declined, methamphetamine production in Myanmar's lawless northern regions has increased, with armed ethnic groups in business with organised crime elements.
Thailand is used mainly as a conduit and distribution point. 
UNODC regional representative Jeremy Douglas said online drug sales was a worrying trend and a methamphetamine oversupply was pushing prices down.
""We are looking now at an increase in drug availability. Very dangerous,"" Douglas said.
Black plumes of smoke filled the sky in Myanmar's biggest city, Yangon, as sacks full of drugs were set ablaze. Firefighters quickly extinguished the flames.

KABUL/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Peace talks between warring Afghan factions are expected to start as soon as they iron out their main differences over the release of the ""most dangerous"" Taliban prisoners, officials and sources from both sides said. 
Despite a major push by the United States, there has been a delay in the intra-Afghan talks as the Afghan government and some key NATO members are uncomfortable about the release of Taliban commanders accused of conducting large-scale attacks that killed civilians in recent years.
An Afghan government source said the prisoner issue had largely been resolved and they would release an alternative set of prisoners with talks expected to start mid-July.
""The Taliban agreed because it was delaying the talks,"" he said, adding the government had also demanded a guarantee from the Taliban that it was no longer holding any Afghan security force prisoners.
A source close to the Taliban said the group was willing to move forward so long as most of the 5,000 prisoners demanded were released. 
""I don't think releasing or not releasing 200 or 300 prisoners will matter in the process, the Taliban can agree for (those) prisoners to remain in Afghan government custody,"" the source said.
Taliban political spokesman Suhail Shaheen could not be reached for comment but has reiterated in recent weeks that the group expects the full terms of their February agreement with the United States, including the release of 5,000 prisoners, to be implemented before talks can start. 
Pakistan, seen as a key regional player in getting the Taliban to peace talks, said it expected negotiations to begin very soon and was optimistic that sticking points, including the prisoner issue, would be resolved.

1537,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>",Car crashes deadlier as drivers speed during lockdowns,"By Lena Masri
LONDON (Reuters) - Coronavirus lockdowns led to huge reductions in traffic and fewer car crashes this spring, but as drivers sped up on quieter roads, the collisions became deadlier in several cities, a Reuters analysis shows.
In New York City, the ratio of fatal crashes to all collisions rose 167% in April from a year ago. The increase was 292% in Chicago and 65% in Boston. Across the ocean, in Madrid, Spain, the rate of fatal collisions was 470% higher.
Even as traffic plummeted across the United States, roads became more lethal, with a 37% increase in fatality rates per miles driven in April, compared to the same month last year, the National Safety Council said this week. Last month, the group said in a statement that the lockdowns and reduced road congestion had created an ""apparent open season on reckless driving."" In Britain, police documented instances of people driving at what they described as exceptionally high speeds of over 130 miles (209 km) per hour.
In the U.S. state of Ohio, researchers found that while average speeds were up only slightly from March 28 to April 19 in Cleveland, Cincinnati and Dayton, the amount of extreme speeding increased dramatically.
""The level of extreme speeding is really shocking,"" said Harvey Miller, professor of geography and director of the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at The Ohio State University. ""What we’re seeing here -- the fact that there's less traffic and more speeding -- I think that's evidence that traffic is a great controller of speed.""
Similar increases in speeding have been reported in Australia, Belgium and Denmark, according to reports compiled by the European Transport Safety Council.
LESSONS LEARNED
The road death toll, to be sure, has fallen as traffic ebbed in many places. In New York City, collisions plummeted in April to 4,103 from 16,808 a year ago, a 76% drop. During the same period fatal collisions decreased from 20 to 13, a smaller 35% decrease. But the number of fatal collisions per 1,000 crashes increased from 1.2 per 1,000 crashes to 3.2 per 1,000 crashes.
""When two vehicles collide at 20 miles per hour, that results in a fender-bender,"" said Joe Cutrufo, a spokesperson for Transportation Alternatives, a group that advocates for safe streets and better biking, walking and public transit options in New York City. ""When two vehicles and a pedestrian collide at 40 miles per hour, that results in a funeral.""
Cutrufo said the lessons learned during lockdowns should be used to rethink street design. Wide streets that look like highways attract fast driving, and more streets should be closed for cars so that people can use that space to safely bike, walk, sit and run.
Police in New York said they were aware of the increased speeds and had deployed additional patrols. Data from traffic analytics company INRIX shows speeds in New York City increased 44% from 28 miles (45 km) per hour in April last year to 41 miles (66 km) per hour this April.
In London, nine people died in traffic collisions in April, about the same as past years, according to data from Transport for London, a government body responsible for the city's transport system. Collision counts are not yet available, but the number of fatalities remained steady even as the number of miles traveled in the British capital declined 69% from February to April, according to data provided by INRIX, which collects information on traffic and speed from fleet trucks, car manufacturers, GPS, loop detectors, parking meters and other sources. 
Andy Cox, a detective superintendent who investigates fatal and serious road collisions for London's Metropolitan Police, has taken to social media to implore drivers to slow down and not risk crashes that could put pressure on Britain's National Health Service.
""They don't think anything will happen to them and they are not considering their fellow road users and the wellbeing of them,"" he told Reuters of drivers who speed. ""It's totally unacceptable. We need to recognize that speed is the biggest factor in fatal collisions and serious, life-changing collisions.""
Speeding offenses increased 187% in London during the lockdown compared to the same period a year ago, Cox said, but extreme speeding offenses increased even more -- by 236%. Police documented speeds of 134 miles (216 km) per hour in a 40-mile-per-hour zone, 110 miles per hour in a 30-mile-per-hour zone and 73 miles per hour in a 20-mile-per-hour zone. 
Across the English Channel, collisions across mainland France fell from 4,234 in April 2019 to 1,099 in April this year, a 74% drop. During the same period, fatalities decreased from 233 to 103, a 56% drop. 
Despite the overall drop in collisions and fatalities, the fatality rate among crashes was 70% higher.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres added his voice to the matter on Wednesday, calling on Israel to abandon annexations of settlements in the West Bank, warning this threatened any chance of negotiated peace with the Palestinians who seek statehood in the territory.
Friday's statement by Michael Lynk, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories, said the EU should back up its warnings against Israeli plans with ""a decisive menu of counter-measures.""
That was a reference to possible economic, trade or other sanctions. The EU has said annexation must not go unchallenged.
Six years after the last round of peace talks with Palestinians collapsed, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set July 1 as the date for the start of cabinet discussions on moving forward on annexation. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan for the region envisages Israel incorporating most of its settlements in the West Bank into ""contiguous Israel territory"", and Palestinian statehood elsewhere under strict conditions. 
Trump has also offered U.S. recognition of Israeli sovereignty over the fertile Jordan Valley along the eastern flank of the West Bank, which was captured in the 1967 Middle East war and is claimed by Palestinians for a future state. 
Palestinians see annexations as an illegal land grab.
On June 23, European lawmakers called for ""commensurate consequences"" if Israel, which has more than 400,000 settlers in the West Bank, went ahead with annexation.
""We have reached a point where resolutions without resolve can no longer contribute to reaching the just and durable peace and human security that Palestinians and Israelis deserve,"" Lynk said. 
However, internal documents and Reuters interviews with more than two dozen diplomats and officials show there is no clear EU strategy on how to stop Israel's plan or how to respond in a meaningful way if annexation goes ahead.

The United Nations Security Council has said settlements violate international law. Israel disputes this, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land.

""If you look at what is happening elsewhere in the world, where people have been coming out of lockdown, I'm afraid what you're also seeing is people taking too many liberties with the guidance, mingling too much, not observing social distancing,"" Johnson said. ""You've got really serious spikes.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Treasury has stepped in to rescue the British Council from the brink of insolvency amid coronavirus woes, but it probably needs a longer-term solution, the chief executive of the country's international cultural and education agency says.
For more than 80 years, the British Council has taught English and run libraries, cultural programmes and arts festivals in all corners of the world, becoming an influential ""soft-power"" extension of UK foreign policy.
In China, large parts of south Asia, Africa and Latin America, its English courses are seen as a gold standard for achieving the fluency needed to live and work in Britain.
But the coronavirus pandemic forced the Council to shut more than 200 examination centres and suspend teaching in much of the world, hammering its finances. Exams and class fees constitute around 60% of its 1.25 billion pound ($1.55 billion) annual revenue.
The Treasury stepped in last week with a 60 million pound loan to tide it over, but with no clarity over how long the pandemic will last the future remains uncertain.
""The 60 million is an intermediate step in a conversation about the longer-term needs of this organisation,"" Ciaran Devane, the Council's chief executive, told Reuters, adding that the terms of the loan were still being worked out. 
""The one year is survivable for most institutions, including our own. The longer-term answer depends to what degree things shift permanently.""
Devane said that if the Council could get through this financial year, a longer-term financial settlement, probably involving an extended loan ""would be critical"".
Post-Brexit, as Britain seeks to exert itself as a stand-alone entity in the world, the Council has a significant role to play in promoting cultural values.
Devane said he saw no lessening of the UK's cultural standing post-Brexit, and the world's desire to learn English is insatiable. But the way the British Council operates may have to change, with more online education and distance teaching.

""The challenge going forward is not just the pandemic, it is how in a world that is more fragmented, where the conversation around values is shifting, how we continue to engage on those issues going forward,"" he said.

Jonty Bravery, who was 17 at the time of the incident and told police he carried out the act because he wanted to be on the television news, pleaded guilty to one count of attempted murder last December. 
The unnamed victim, who was visiting Britain with his family, fell 100 feet (30 metres) after he was targeted by Bravery and was found on a fifth-floor roof. His mother was heard by witnesses screaming: ""Where's my son? Where's my son?""
The boy survived but suffered a bleed to his brain and several fractured bones. Judge Maura McGowan said the boy's life would never be the same again and his parents had been forced to give up their lives to care for him.
""You had intended to kill someone that day. You almost killed that 6-year-old boy,"" she told Bravery. 
Bravery, now 18, who was arrested shortly afterwards, told police he had planned to hurt someone at the museum to be on television. He had researched how to kill people on the internet the previous day and before the incident he had asked a member of the public the location of a tall building. 
The teenager, who has autistic spectrum disorder and a personality disorder, was being held at the high security Broadmoor Hospital but the judge at London's Old Bailey court decided he should be jailed for a minimum of 15 years.
""You may never be released,"" she said. 
In a statement read out by a police officer on their behalf outside court, the victim's parents said he had been able to eat again in January, could speak a little but remained very weak, with many years of physiotherapy ahead of him. 

""He is still in a wheelchair today, wears splints on his left arm and both his legs and spends his days in a corset moulded to his waist sat in his wheelchair,"" they said. ""He is in pain. There are no words to express what we are going through.""

LONDON/LISBON (Reuters) - From the housing blocks of London to the beaches of Portugal, thousands of young people are holding illegal raves and parties across Europe, yearning for contact and bursting with energy after the solitude of the coronavirus lockdown.
While many revellers are simply seeking some fun after months of bans on festivals, clubbing and parties, such mass gatherings have added to fears that a second deadly wave of infections could sweep across Europe.
Police have sometimes struggled to disperse the illegal parties with clashes in London where crowds attacked officers with bottles and set upon patrol cars on Wednesday, leaving 22 police injured.
""We've seen large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families' health, wanting to have large parties,"" London police chief Cressida Dick said.
""It's hot, some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive and some are just plain violent.""
Police in the British capital dispersed several parties overnight. They are also investigating rape, drug offences and stabbings at illegal raves in other cities.
As the exuberance of greater freedom explodes into the European summer after the gloom of the lockdown, parties have also popped up in Germany and France and on the sands of Portugal's Atlantic beaches. 
HIDDEN BEACH PARTY
Thousands gathered in the squares of Portugal's cities of Porto and Braga over the weekend to party in the summer heat.
""Join us on this magical journey in the forest,"" read one message circulating on social media about a gathering on a hidden beach west of Lisbon. ""Let's get together and share some loving, vibes and music.""
In Berlin, a city famous for its nightlife from clubs to outdoor raves, several hundred people have gathered outside at Hasenheide Park in recent weeks to dance into the night.
""I think people are just longing to socially connect,"" Berlin-based DJ Elias Doré said, saying that thousands of young people would normally be dancing under the open skies of European festivals this summer.
Still, events have not always ended peacefully.
On Sunday, French police clashed with festival-goers in Paris and the western city of Nantes as music lovers celebrated the annual ""Fete de la Musique"" on the longest day of the year.
Six police officers were pelted with bottles at a gathering of around 500 people in Berlin's Gleisdreieck Park last weekend, as some resisted the party being broken up.
And a street party in Manchester last weekend attended by around 2,000 people turned violent, with a social media video showing three men and a woman wielding bladed weapons and reports of two men being stabbed. 
London police chief Dick said residents had been terrified by some parties. ""We will be prepared this weekend,"" she said.
    
CORONAVIRUS RISK
Authorities are also concerned that young people who often have lighter symptoms or are asymptomatic could be contracting and spreading the virus without realising it.
And with thousands of anonymous attendees coming in and out of events, proper testing and tracing to prove whether contagion is happening will be virtually impossible, according to Dr. Celso Cunha, a virologist at the University of Lisbon.
""Even if they don't usually get as ill, young people still transmit the virus,"" he said. 
But with most clubs and festivals still shuttered, there is still nowhere for most of Europe's revellers to dance, drink and find love after the rigours of lockdown. 

""I think whatever authorities do, the summer will see many secret and illegal raves everywhere,"" Dore said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam and the Philippines warned of growing insecurity in Southeast Asia at a regional summit on Friday amid concerns that China was stepping up its activity in the disputed South China Sea during the coronavirus pandemic.
Both Hanoi and Manila lodged protests with China in April after Beijing unilaterally declared the creation of new administrative districts on islands in the troubled waterways to which Vietnam and the Philippines also have competing claims.
""Even as our region struggles to contain COVID-19, alarming incidents in the South China Sea occurred,"" Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte told an online meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders on Friday.
""We call on parties to refrain from escalating tensions and abide by responsibilities under international law,"" he said.
China has been pushing its presence in the Exclusive Economic Zones of other countries while claimants are preoccupied tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting the United States to call on China to stop its ""bullying behaviour"" there.
In early April, Vietnam said one of its fishing boats was sunk by a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel. China said that Vietnam's claims in South China sea are illegal and ""doomed to fail"".
In his opening remarks at the ASEAN Summit, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said international institutions and internationl law had been seriously challenged during the global crisis.
""The pandemic is fanning the flames of dormant challenges within the political, economic and social environment of the world and in each region,"" Phuc said.

""While the entire world is stretched thin in the fight against the pandemic, irresponsible acts and acts in violation of international law are still taking place, affecting the environment of security and stability in certain regions, including in our region,"" said Phuc, who made no mention of China in relation to the comments.

1545,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>",Clock ticks on push to resolve Egypt-Ethiopia row over giant Nile dam,"By Aidan Lewis
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is counting on international pressure to unlock a deal it sees as crucial to protecting its scarce water supplies from the Nile river before the expected start-up of a giant dam upstream in Ethiopia in July.
Tortuous, often acrimonious negotiations spanning close to a decade have left the two nations and their neighbour Sudan short of an agreement to regulate how Ethiopia will operate the dam and fill its reservoir.
Though Egypt is unlikely to face any immediate, critical shortages from the dam even without a deal, failure to reach one before the filling process starts could further poison ties and drag out the dispute for years, analysts say.
""There is the threat of worsening relations between Ethiopia and the two downstream countries, and consequently increased regional instability,"" said William Davison, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group.
The latest round of talks left the three countries ""closer than ever to reaching an agreement"", according to a report by Sudan's foreign ministry seen by Reuters.
But it also said the talks, which were suspended last week, had revealed a ""widening gap"" over the key issue of whether any agreement would be legally binding, as Egypt demands.
The stakes for largely arid Egypt are high, for it draws at least 90% of its fresh water from the Nile.
With Ethiopia insisting it will use seasonal rains to begin filling the dam's reservoir next month, Cairo has appealed to the U.N. Security Council in a last-ditch diplomatic move. 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is being built about 15 km (nine miles) from the border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, the source of most of the Nile's waters.
Ethiopia says the $4 billion hydropower project, which will have an installed capacity of 6,450 megawatts, is essential to its economic development. Addis Ababa told the U.N. Security Council in a letter this week that it is ""designed to help extricate our people from abject poverty"".
The letter repeated accusations that Egypt was trying to maintain historic advantages over the Nile and constrict Ethiopia's pursuit of future upstream projects. It argued that Ethiopia had accommodated Egyptian demands to allow recent talks to move forward before Egypt unnecessarily escalated by taking the issue to the Security Council.
Ethiopia's government was not immediately available for comment. 
Egypt says it is focused on securing a fair deal limited to the GERD, and that Ethiopia's talk of righting colonial-era injustice is a ruse meant to distract attention from a bid to impose a fait accompli on its downstream neighbours.
Both accuse each other of trying to sabotage the talks and of blocking independent studies on the impact of the GERD. Egypt requested U.S. mediation last year, leading to talks over four months in Washington that broke down in February. 
""PROGRESS""
The resort to outside mediation came because the two sides had been ""going round in vicious cycles for years"", said an Egyptian official. The stand-off is a chance for the international community to show leadership on the issue of water, and help broker a deal that ""could unlock a lot of cooperation possibilities"", he said. 
Talks this month between water ministers led by Sudan, and observed by the United States, South Africa and the European Union, produced a draft deal that Sudan said made ""significant progress on major technical issues"". 
It listed outstanding technical issues however, including how the dam would operate during ""dry years"" of reduced rainfall, as well as legal issues on whether the agreement and its mechanism for resolving disputes should be binding.
Sudan, for its part, sees benefits from the dam in regulating its Blue Nile waters, but wants guarantees it will be safely and properly operated. 
Like Egypt it is seeking a binding deal before filling starts, but its increasing alignment with Cairo has not proved decisive. 
Technical compromises are still available, said Davison, but ""there's no reason to think that Ethiopia is going to bow to increased international pressure"". 

""We need to move away from diplomatic escalation and instead the parties need to sit themselves once again around the table and stay there until they reach agreement.""

LONDON (Reuters) - London police will crackdown on illegal street parties after officers came under attack for the second night running as they tried to disperse an unauthorised gathering, the capital's police chief said on Friday.
As Britain has begun to ease strict coronavirus lockdown rules, police have had to deal with a number of illegal parties and raves across the country with many people flouting guidelines that only groups of up to six can meet outdoors. 
""It's hot, some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, and some are plain violent,"" London police chief Cressida Dick said.
The events were unlawful and should not be happening, she said, warning: ""We will come and close them down.""
On Wednesday night, 22 officers were hurt and a number of patrol cars were vandalised when trouble broke out at an unauthorised music event in Brixton, south London.
Officers came under attack again on Thursday night from revellers throwing missiles in the Notting Hill area of west London, the scene of one of a number of unlicensed music events, 
""We've seen large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families' health, wanting to have large parties,"" Dick said.
Police will be prepared for further trouble this weekend.
""We know that having months of restrictions people have been frustrated and people will want to come together in gatherings but these illegal raves are obviously unacceptable,"" Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News on Friday.
This month, big protests by anti-racism supporters have taken place in central London and other cities in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and some counter-demonstrations, some of which have turned violent.
About 140 officers had been injured in the last three weeks, Dick said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the violence against the police appalling.
On Thursday, authorities in Bournemouth, a beach town in southern England, declared a ""major incident"" over what they called the irresponsible behaviour of crowds who had ignored public health guidance on coronavirus and badly overstretched local services.
Visitors arrived in large numbers in a spell of hot weather, resulting in gridlock on the roads, anti-social behaviour and alcohol-fuelled fights.

The 40-year-old Norwegian man, who has Iranian heritage, was arrested in October 2018 after a major police operation in which Denmark temporarily closed its international borders. The court did not give the man's name.
For several days in late September, the Norwegian had observed and taken photos of the home of an Iranian exile in Denmark, as well as the streets and roads surrounding the home, Roskilde District Court said in a statement. 
""The court found that the information was collected and passed on to a person working for an Iranian intelligence service, for use by the intelligence service's plans to kill the exile,"" the court said. 
The exile, who was also not named in the statement, is the leader of an Iranian Arab resistance group known as the Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA).
Separately, Danish police have charged three members of ASMLA, including the group's leader, with spying for Saudi intelligence services and financing and supporting terrorism in Iran.
The Norwegian defendant has denied all charges.
The Danish court is expected to announce its sentence later on Friday.

The Anglican Church, a central part of English public life and governance for centuries, is the latest institution to reflect on its role following worldwide protests inspired by the death of George Floyd in police custody in the United States.
Welby, the most senior cleric in the worldwide Anglican communion, which has some 85 million followers in 165 countries, said forgiveness was needed over issues of racial injustice, but that could only come after appropriate action had been taken.
""If you just go round Canterbury Cathedral there are monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey. We are looking at all that. Some will have to come down,"" Welby said in a BBC interview.
Asked to clarify if statues needed to be removed from Canterbury Cathedral, Welby said this was not his decision.
""We're going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context, and seeing if they all should be there,"" he said. ""The question arises, of course it does."" 
Protesters in Bristol, western England, tore down a statue this month honouring Edward Colston, a 17th century merchant and slave trader who used his profits to endow schools and charities in the city that continue to carry his name.
Local authorities in England and Wales run by the main opposition Labour Party have said they will review public statues and monuments. The Bank of England has also said it will check whether it still has any pictures on display of former governors who had links to the slave trade.
Welby defended images of Jesus as northern European - which some campaigners say reinforce ideas of white racial superiority - but said it was now common in Anglican churches worldwide to depict him as sharing worshippers' ethnicity.

""You go into their churches and you don't see a white Jesus. You see a black Jesus, or a Chinese Jesus, or a Middle Eastern Jesus -- which of course is the most accurate -- or a Fijian Jesus.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia can no longer take in Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar, Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said on Friday, citing a struggling economy and dwindling resources as a result of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Muslim-majority Malaysia has long been a favoured destination for Rohingya seeking a better life after fleeing a 2017 military-led crackdown in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh.
But Malaysia, which does not recognise refugee status, has recently turned away boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya, amid rising anger towards foreigners who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and taking up scarce state funds.
""We can no longer take more as our resources and capacity are already stretched, compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic,"" Muhyiddin said in teleconference with other leaders of the 10-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which includes Myanmar. 
""Yet, Malaysia is unfairly expected to do more to accommodate incoming refugees.""
The treatment of Rohingya has been divisive for ASEAN, with its two Muslim-majority members - Malaysia and Indonesia - criticising Buddhist-majority Myanmar and expressing growing frustration with Rohingya arriving on boats operated by people smugglers.
Myanmar denies abuses against members of the minority in Rakhine State, in western Myanmar, but says the Rohingya are not citizens but illegal immigrants from South Asia.
Rohingya have for years boarded boats between November and April, when the seas are calm, to get to Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
Muhyiddin urged the U.N. refugee agency to speed up the resettlement of Rohingya in Malaysia to third countries. The agency says there are more than 100,000 Rohingya in Malaysia though rights groups say the number is higher.
He also called for more efforts to combat the trafficking of Rohingya, who he said were increasingly at risk for exploitation, slavery and recruitment by militants.
""ASEAN must do more to help Myanmar, and Myanmar must also do more to help itself for this crisis to be put behind us,"" he said.
Dozens of Rohingya died and their bodies were thrown overboard from a boat that later landed on a Malaysian island this month with 269 people on board, authorities said. 

On Thursday, nearly 100 Rohingya were rescued by fishermen from a boat adrift off Indonesia.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has accused old rival India of trying to distract the attention of its people by expelling Pakistani diplomats after Indian forces got a ""battering"" at the hands of Chinese troops in a clash on their disputed Himalayan border.
Pakistan is concerned about the tension after the June 15 clash in the Ladakh region, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed, in particular about the possibility Pakistan could get dragged in, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said.
""Things have deteriorated, things are very delicate,"" Qureshi told Reuters in an interview at his ministry in Islamabad late on Thursday.
The three nuclear-armed neighbours all have historic disputes over high-altitude border demarcation in the Himalayas.
For years, confrontation between India and Pakistan has been seen as the most dangerous of the disputes but the violence between Indian and Chinese forces has renewed alarm about theirs too.
Qureshi denounced India's announcement on Tuesday that it would expel half the staff in Pakistan's embassy in New Delhi over spying, saying India was trying to divert attention at home.
""The accusations were baseless,"" he said.
""They have no answers for the battering they got in Ladakh, so to quell the domestic dissent they want to refocus,"" he said.
India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Qureshi said he was concerned that India could try to get Pakistan involved in the regional tensions with a ""false flag operation"" - an incident staged to provide a pretext for action.
He said he feared any Indian ""misadventure"" in Pakistan's territory would prompt Pakistan to respond with force.
Qureshi said Pakistan backed the position of its ally China over Ladakh and he had recently had a call with China's top diplomat, Wang Yi, who had expressed appreciation for that position.
China and Pakistan have long had close diplomatic and economic ties. 

China has pledged about $60 billion for projects in Pakistan central to China's Belt and Road initiative to develop land and sea trade routes across Asia and beyond.

SEUNUDDON, Indonesia (Reuters) - Indonesian fishermen rescued nearly 100 Rohingya refugees, including 79 women and children, in Aceh province after officials said they were planning to push them back out to sea.
Countries around Southeast Asia have grown increasingly reluctant to accept refugee boats as they battle the novel coronavirus, but the Acehnese fishermen told Reuters that rescuing the Rohingya was a moral duty. 
""It is nothing more than a sense of humanity and part of our tradition in the north Aceh fishermen community,"" said local fisherman Hamdani Yacob near the town of Seunuddon in northern Aceh. “We hope that the refugees will be looked after in our village.” 
Authorities in Aceh confirmed the refugees had been taken ashore on Thursday and provided temporary housing. The fishermen had rescued them earlier in the week and they were anchored just off the coast, but officials had said they planned to push them back out to sea with a new boat, gasoline and food.
Local authorities capitulated following protests from the local fishermen.
Images from a beach in the Seunuddon showed people from the local community towing the Rohingya boat to shore and helping to carry emaciated children onto land. 
""If the government is incapable, us the community will help them, because we are human beings and they (the Rohingya refugees) are human too and we have a heart,"" another local fisherman, Syaiful Amri, told Reuters.
Fleeing persecution in Myanmar and refugee camps in Bangladesh, the Rohingya have for years boarded boats between November and April, when the seas are calm, to get to Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
The crisis has worsened this year as regional states have shut their doors amid the coronavirus pandemic, leaving some boats drifting for weeks with hundreds of Rohingya aboard.
Scores of them have died as supplies have run out.
Usman Hamid, the executive director of Amnesty International in Indonesia, praised the decision to bring the refugees to land.

""Today’s disembarkation of Rohingya refugees is a moment of optimism and solidarity. It’s a credit to the community in Aceh who pushed hard and took risks so that these children, women and men could be brought to shore. They have shown the best of humanity,"" he said.

Ardern has urged New Zealanders to travel at home and is considering more holidays to get people out, but operators say they won't make up for the missing foreigners who bring about half of the industry's NZ$16.1 billion (US$10.34 billion) annual income.
Ardern launched the ski season in the South Island winter-sports hub of Queenstown and said the enthusiasm of residents and domestic tourists was a sign of hope but she acknowledged the pain.
""There is no denying that this region, with our borders closed, will feel a significant impact,"" Ardern told reporters.
New Zealand this month declared it was free of community transmission of the coronavirus and lifted all curbs except for the ban on foreign arrivals, which has been in place for about three months.
The Queenstown district used to earn about NZ$3 billion a year and its economy was growing at more than twice the rate of the national economy, Ardern said.
She did not give an estimate for this year's income.
Ardern announced a new NZ$85 million ($55 million)infrastructure package for Queenstown, part of NZ$400 million allocated for affected tourism businesses in the budget unveiled last month.

New Zealand is in talks with Australia on a so-called travel bubble to allow people to move between the two countries, but the idea has not made much progress with new cases of the coronavirus cropping up in Australia.

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Mohammed has spent several weeks sleeping in his cramped trading booth in one of Guangzhou's export centres after being kicked out of his apartment and forced into quarantine in April, but the Tanzanian trader says he is content to be in China.
As Africans in the Chinese metropolis were targeted that month in a coronavirus clampdown that sparked a diplomatic backlash, Guangzhou's Xiaobei neighbourhood - known as ""Little Africa"" - went into lockdown. 
Like many in the community, including those who were evicted from their dwellings, Mohammed said he is trying to return to normal life now that the lockdown has eased.
""It happened, it was bad, but I just want to move on,"" said Mohammed, who trades garments and shoes and like most people Reuters interviewed did not want to provide his full name given the sensitivity of the situation.
Guangzhou is the hub for Africans engaged in trade in China, often small-scale business owners dealing in garments and other consumer goods, and is also a centre for students from the continent.
While Black Africans living in China say they have long experienced discrimination, several said the targeting of their community during the pandemic was deeply unsettling. 
When five Nigerians tested positive for coronavirus in April, after China had shut its borders to foreigners, local government units in Guangzhou singled out Africans for mandatory tests and quarantines, the U.S. consulate in the city said.
Several African countries complained, and the U.S. consulate advised African-Americans to avoid the city. The outcry prompted a meeting between China's foreign ministry, which denied discrimination, and more than 20 African ambassadors and representatives.
The situation eased and the government encouraged foreigners to report instances of discrimination to a 24-hour support hotline. McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) apologised after staff at a Guangzhou branch forced Black customers to leave.
'JUST GUESTS'
All the 20 Africans Reuters spoke with in Guangzhou said they were strongly supportive of the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and elsewhere. Around half said that similar protests were not necessary in China, but six said they would protest if they felt it were possible.
""This is a Communist country and we are just guests here, they would not let us protest,"" said Chris, a Nigerian trader.
With 4,553 registered Africans in Guangzhou in April, the population is one-third its level a year ago, official figures show. About 351,000 Africans entered the city from abroad last year, often traders on short-term visits, but that traffic has almost come to a halt with coronavirus-induced travel bans.
Mercy, a Nigerian working for a small logistics company, said business is one-quarter its normal level.
""There's fewer people in town, and there are fewer flights to Africa, so freight prices are too high,"" she said from her office in a half-lit building where several hair-braiding shops and salons that served the African community were shuttered.
Several traders, however, said they were staying put in China because the current situation means fewer competitors and an advantage when freight fully resumes. 
""China is good,"" said Paur, a Nigerian trader. ""You cannot find African people making these"" he said, gesturing towards bags of clothes in his booth near Xiaobei. 
He said he is still resentful after being evicted from his home in April and sleeping on the streets for four days, but has no plans to leave. 
""The sad thing I realised is that they see me and will always think of the virus,"" said Haman, a student from Niger who said he plans to return home after seven years in China once his course finishes next month.
Many of the Black Africans in the city said they were resigned to racism being part of life outside of Africa.
""If you are Black and you hold an African passport you cannot escape racism, so it doesn't matter wherever you go,"" said Aubrey Tsambatare, a Zimbabwean who works in banking in Guangzhou.

1555,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>",Mexican president slammed after comments on women staying at home,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday suggested the tradition of women staying at home to take care of older family members was key to battling the coronavirus pandemic, sparking criticism his comments were sexist.
This is not the first time the 66-year-old leader has been accused of making tone-deaf comments and lacking empathy towards women.
""People want to change women's role and that is one of the just causes of feminism, but the tradition in Mexico is that daughters are the ones who care the most for parents. We men are more detached,"" Lopez Obrador said.
Whereas seniors in nursing homes in Europe had suffered with the pandemic, Mexico's elders were helped by the custom of being cared for at home, he said, adding that the ""Mexican family is the most important social security institution"" in the country.
""Translating the president's nineteenth century thinking when he says: men are more detached, he means irresponsible; daughters take care of their parents, he's referring to unpaid work; tradition refers to machismo; feminism wants to change roles, true transformation,"" Martha Tagle, a lawmaker with the Citizen's Movement party, said on Twitter.
The hashtag AmloMachista, or sexist AMLO in reference to the president's initials, was trending.
""AmloMachista insists on sending women to be 'caregivers', but we have news for him, we are citizens and we are feminists who will no longer tolerate his presidential misogyny,"" Claudia Castello, who describes herself as a sociologist and feminist, wrote on Twitter.
Lopez Obrador's prickly reaction earlier this year to criticism of his administration over brutal murders of women in Mexico riled feminists and undermined support for him among female voters, helping to fuel protests.
Lopez Obrador has been chastised for not taking the virus seriously enough and pushing for a reopening of the economy too soon.

Mexico has the seventh highest coronavirus death toll in the world with 25,060 deaths and 202,951 cases.

Jordi Martel, 30, was charged with official misconduct for filing two reports with false details about the incident that took place outside a striptease club on Jan. 14, State Attorney Katherine Rundle told a press conference.
Martel and another officer, Jaiver Castano, were fired last week, although Miami Gardens Police Department has not said why they were dismissed, according to the Miami Herald newspaper.
The video of the incident, filmed by a bystander, showed Martel dragging Safiya Satchell, 33, out of her car and subsequently forcing her down on a grass verge by the roadside. 
The video clip showed Martel stunned her twice with a Taser, a weapon that delivers an electric shock. Another officer held Satchell's arm as she struggled to free herself. 
The United States is witnessing widespread protests against racism and police brutality since last month's death of a Black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody after a police officer knelt on his neck nearly for nine minutes.

1557,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 26, 2020 12:18AM ET</span>","As Zimbabwe’s Economy Crumbles, Mugabe’s Successor Courts Unrest","(Bloomberg) -- Zimbabweans celebrated in their tens of thousands when the military ousted Robert Mugabe and installed Emmerson Mnangagwa as president. Two-and-a-half years later, the party is over.
Mnangagwa, 77, came to power promising political reform and a wave of foreign investment, but there’s been little of either. Instead, outside funds are being withheld and painful economic measures have been imposed, with the army deployed to violently quell protests.
Such is the public disquiet that many ruling party leaders, including some with military links, are losing patience with Mnangagwa, four people familiar with the situation said, asking not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the situation. Military leaders took the unprecedented step of calling a press conference this month to say they weren’t planning a coup.
“It could be a preemptive move, it could be the generals saying we are in charge,” said Ringisai Chikohomero, an analyst at the Pretoria-based Institute for Security Studies. The military, he said, are “the guarantors of the regime: They have a clear stake and key interests.”
Mnangagwa’s ascent to the presidency in November 2017 was a remarkable turnaround. Known as the Crocodile for his role in a civil-war era guerrilla group of the same name, he was fired by Mugabe even though he had served in the liberation hero’s cabinet since Zimbabwe won independence from the British in 1980.
The Crocodile
Where once he had been seen as Mugabe’s likely successor, his mistake was to fall out with the nonagenarian’s wife, Grace. She was becoming increasingly powerful and threatening to usurp the military leaders and veteran politicians who had supported Mugabe during his nearly four decades of rule.
For the army, Mnangagwa represented continuity. Among them, “there was the thinking that the Mnangagwa regime would bring about some stability while Mugabe was seen as basically running a Ponzi scheme,” Chikohomero said. “The opportunities for patronage did not materialize.”
Now, inflation has surged to 786%, foreign currency and fuel are short and while the government has announced about $30 billion of investment in ventures from platinum mines to abattoirs there is little tangible to show for it. A teacher earning the equivalent of $400 a month two years ago now earns a 10th of that due to a series of effective devaluations of the local currency.
International donors refuse to release funds unless steps are taken to rein in security forces used to quash dissent and to scrap laws that stifle the opposition.
Mnangagwa is aware he has to make concessions on political reform and needs to curb the military to win economic support from the international community, one of the people said. Still, he fears doing so as those would anger the party leaders with whom his relations are increasingly strained and could cost him power, the person said.
‘Relentless Attack’
Government spokesman, Nick Mangwana, and presidential spokesman, George Charamba, didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.
Seemingly stuck, the president and his political allies have taken to blaming everyone from exiles linked to Grace Mugabe to evangelist preachers for the country’s plight.
There is “a relentless attack on our currency and the economy in general through exorbitant pricing models by the private sector,” Mnangagwa said June 10 at a meeting of the ruling party’s politburo. “We are fully cognizant that this is a battle being fueled by our political detractors, elite opportunists and malcontents who are bent on pushing a nefarious agenda which they will never win.”
Zimbabwe under Mugabe was originally one of the beacons of independence from colonial rule in Africa. In 1980, as the victorious leader of an army of freedom fighters, he calmed the white minority of what had been Rhodesia and won global acclaim with his independence speech pledging reconciliation. Over the next decade he invested in what became one of Africa’s most educated workforces and led opposition to apartheid in South Africa, becoming an African icon.
An International Monetary Fund program in the 1990s eroded Mugabe’s popularity, putting the country on a downhill path of repression, corruption and economic collapse. A wave of violent seizures of white-owned commercial farms decimated agricultural exports, manufacturing collapsed and inflation in 2008 surged to 500 billion percent, leading to the abolition of the national currency. Diamonds worth billions of U.S. dollars were smuggled out of the country.
Open for Business
Mnangagwa was meant to end all that by restoring relations with international finance institutions, ending international isolation and restarting the economy. He traveled the globe wearing his trademark scarf with the colors of the Zimbabwean flag saying the country was open for business, in a bid to attract investment to some of the world’s biggest platinum and chrome deposits and an agricultural sector that rivaled Virginia for the quality of its tobacco.
“The Mnangagwa regime likes to point to enemies, but it only has itself to blame,” Alex Magaisa, a Zimbabwean law lecturer who helped design the southern African nation’s 2013 constitution, said in his blog. “It had so much goodwill when it started, but it spurned all the opportunities. Now it is living in fear of a coup, real or perceived.”
Mnangagwa’s first significant misstep was in August 2018 when his election victory was marred by allegations of irregularities and at least six people were shot dead by soldiers as they protested. That largely put negotiations to resolve the country’s debt issues on hold and halted significant investment interest.
The violence was followed by the deployment of the military to quell protests over the economic situation in January 2019, when at least 18 people were killed, and there have been occasional flareups since. The coronavirus outbreak and an associated lockdown has seen a significant increase in the presence of Zimbabwe’s military on the streets of the country’s biggest cities, keeping a lid on unrest.
Misery Compounded
An April 2 letter to institutions including the IMF by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube pleading for assistance has yielded just $21 million from the World Bank and African Development Bank. Zimbabwe has not kept up with payments on its $8 billion in foreign debt. Meanwhile, the worst drought in 40 years and a rare cyclone in the east of the country have compounded the misery.
Even as the situation worsens, change may not be imminent.
Coups are rare in southern Africa. In 1997, South African and Batswana troops invaded Lesotho with the backing of the Southern African Development Community after the military took power there. In Zimbabwe’s case, neighbors largely turned a blind eye to the military takeover in 2017 given the dire state of the economy, which had seen millions of Zimbabweans flee across the borders.
Mnangagwa’s dilemma is that political reforms are needed to win aid, but they would threaten his position and that of the military by allowing the opposition to compete in elections on an even footing. The Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front has ruled since independence and every election since 2000 has been marred by allegations of rigging and violence.
He needs to implement “quite dramatic reforms that signal a clean break with the Mugabe era,” said Derek Matyszak, an independent governance consultant in Harare, the capital, adding: “I don’t see any solution to the problem.”

JAKARTA/SHAH ALAM, Malaysia (Reuters) - With no sign of the global coronavirus threat easing anytime soon, protective masks are fast becoming fashion accessories for Indonesians and Malaysians keen to add some style and humour to healthwear essentials. 
Bespoke masks are catching on in Indonesia, with customers ordering designs with their own faces printed on reusable neoprene material, some with smiling faces, or big red lips, like the one made for 46-year-old Heni Kusmijati.
""When people see us, they seem to be wondering why we are smiling and laughing,"" he said.
A Jakarta print shop added masks to its services after its sales slumped due to the coronavirus, which has infected more than 50,000 Indonesians and killed 2,620.
Customers place orders online and upload their pictures. Masks take 30 minutes to produce and each cost 50,000 rupiah ($3.50), income that has kept Nicholas Septian Sugandi's business afloat. 
""At the beginning, we were sceptical,"" he said of making masks. ""But later, the demand surged, and it helps us to recover the business loss.""
There are similar ideas around Southeast Asia, like an out-of-work Filipino special effects artist now making horror masks https://reut.rs/3dwNhPg, and a Thai single mother who designs face shields https://reut.rs/2Nuwbac with prints of cartoon and movie characters.
Batik designs are popular in Malaysia, where mask-wearing is not mandatory but is often requested by business establishments. Malaysia has reported nearly 8,600 COVID-19 cases and 121 deaths.
Malaysian textile designer Hafiz Drahman has masks made from soft cotton that include optional pockets for adding filters, crafted from his stocks of cloth decorated using wax and dye, an ancient tradition.

""I began to see a new opportunity in making batik face masks because at that time, we were instructed to wear face masks for personal safety,"" Hafiz said in his workshop in Shah Alam city.

(Reuters) - Colorado Governor Jared Polis on Thursday appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the 2019 death of an unarmed Black man who died days after he was subdued by three policemen and injected with a powerful sedative.
Polis said the state's attorney general, Phil Weiser, will probe the death of Elijah McClain, who died following an encounter with police who applied a carotid neckhold on him. During the incident, paramedics injected him with ketamine and he lapsed into a coma from which he never recovered.
It is one of a series of recent cases of African Americans and Latinos in the United States dying at the hands of police officers, most notably the case of George Floyd who died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer last month.
In Tucson, a coroner's report and an internal police investigation found ""physical restraint"" was a factor in the death of a Latino man who died in police custody in April. Three Tucson police officers, two white and one Black, have resigned over that death.
In the Colorado case, Adams County District Attorney Dave Young said in November there was insufficient evidence for him to charge the officers with any crimes.
McClain, 23, was approached by officers on reports of a man acting erratically in the city of Aurora on Aug. 24, 2019, although he was not suspected of committing a crime, Young said.
Young said on Thursday McClain's death was ""tragic and unnecessary,"" but defended his decision not to prosecute the officers. An autopsy said the cause of death was undetermined and the pathologist was unable to conclude the officers' actions caused the death, Young said in a statement.
The lawyer for the McClain family, Mari Newman, said she has called for an independent investigation since last fall.
""It is time for a responsible adult to step in, and I am glad that the governor is showing leadership,"" she said.

The state attorney general, Weiser, said in a statement McClain ""should be alive today"" and vowed to seek justice for his family. ""Our investigation will be thorough, guided by the facts, and worthy of public trust and confidence in the criminal justice system,"" he said.

KENT, England (Reuters) - Five-year-old Tony Hudgell has raised more than 1 million pounds ($1.24 million) for the London hospital that saved his life by walking 10 km on his new prosthetic legs after being inspired by Captain Tom's record-breaking challenge.
Tony suffered near-fatal abuse from his birth parents when he was a baby that resulted in the amputation of his legs.
His adoptive mother Paula Hudgell said he received a set of new limbs in February, and from walking barely a step a month ago he could now power through hundreds of metres every day.
The challenge had been ""really fun"", Tony said, and although hard to begin with, it had got easier day by day. He said he felt ""really good"" to have achieved his goal of walking 10 km (6.2 miles) in June with days to spare.
Hudgell said Tony was fighting for his life when she first met him in Evelina London Children's Hospital when he was four months old. 
""He'd had all his limbs broken, he'd had blood trauma to the face, sepsis, multi-organ failure, and they never expected him to survive,"" she said at the family's home in Kent, southeast England. ""We took him home (...) he was broken, shutdown, a tiny, tiny underweight little boy.""
Hudgell and her husband adopted Tony in 2016. ""We didn't want him to go anywhere else, he was our little boy by then,"" she said.
Consultant Michail Kokkinakis said Tony's determination and the support of his family had helped him cope with multiple operations.
""I have seen him thriving, I have seen him becoming this very confident and bright young boy he is today,"" he said. 
""He's a huge inspiration to us all.""
Tony took on his challenge after seeing Tom Moore, 95 years his senior, walking 100 laps of his garden using a walking frame, raising 33 million pounds.
His initial target of 500 pounds had now passed an ""absolutely incredible"" 1 million, his mum said.
She said Tony's was now fast and confident on his new legs. ""(It) is incredible to think just three and half weeks ago he could barely take a few steps.""
Deciding on his next challenge was a ""hard question"" Tony said, but longer term he is set on becoming a policeman. ""I want to handcuff bad people and robbers,"" he said.

NEW YORK/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it has quit a voluntary United Nations arrangement that aimed to protect hospitals and humanitarian aid deliveries in Syria from being hit by the warring parties.
Russia made the decision following an internal U.N. inquiry in April found it was ""highly probable"" the Syrian government or its allies carried out attacks on three healthcare facilities, a school and a refuge for children in northwest Syria last year.
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia accused ""various 'opposition groups' and terrorists through their proxies"" of abusing the humanitarian deconfliction process. Russia believed the United Nations should give any relevant information to Syrian authorities, he said. 
""We do not see withdrawal as a threat to the humanitarian workers on the ground if information provided is accurate and trustworthy,"" Nebenzia told Reuters. 
Russia has provided military support to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the civil war, which erupted after Assad cracked down on pro-democracy protesters in 2011. 
Russia and Syria have said their forces are not targeting civilians or civilian infrastructure and have long-questioned the sources used by the United Nations to verify attacks.
Under the U.N. deconfliction arrangement, the locations of U.N. supported facilities and other humanitarian sites like hospitals and health centers had been shared with the warring parties in a bid to protect them. However, the United Nations has questioned whether it made them a target. 
In a note to aid groups, seen by Reuters, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) confirmed Russia's withdrawal. 
""The United Nations is concerned about the withdrawal of the Russian Federation from the notification mechanism and is examining the implications of this decision for humanitarian personnel and operations in Syria,"" the U.N. note said. 
The United Nations said in the note that it would discuss the situation further with Russia. It also said all parties - whether they participated in the deconfliction arrangement or not - were still bound by international humanitarian law. 

""If Russia thinks this will help them escape accountability for war crimes, they're dead wrong,"" said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. ""We and other groups will continue to investigate and document the deliberate bombings of hospitals and other grave crimes in Syria.""

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces raided a headquarters belonging to a powerful Iran-backed militia in southern Baghdad late on Thursday and detained more than a dozen members of the group, government officials and paramilitary sources said.
The raid was the most brazen action by Iraqi forces against a major Iran-backed militia group in years and targeted the Kataib Hezbollah faction, which U.S. officials have accused of firing rockets at bases hosting U.S. troops and other facilities in Iraq.
Iraqi government officials and paramilitary sources then gave contradicting versions of what followed.
The paramilitary sources and one government official said those detained were transferred shortly afterwards to the security branch of Iraq's paramilitary umbrella grouping, the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF).
A second government official denied any such transfer and said the militiamen were still in the custody of other security services. The sources gave different numbers for those detained. A PMF official said it was 19. A government official said it was 23.
The raid was the first sign that the government of Iraq's new prime minister, Mustafa al-Kadhimi, intends to make good on pledges to take tough action against militia groups that have targeted U.S. installations.
It took place after a number of rocket attacks near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and other U.S. military sites in the country in recent weeks. 
But the incident also highlighted how difficult it could be to take on the militias. A senior PMF official said after some negotiation, those detained were handed over to paramilitary security forces.
The PMF is an Iraqi state institution. It contains factions loyal to Iran and others that are not, but has been dominated by Iran-aligned militias.
One government official told Reuters three commanders of Kataib Hezbollah had been detained during the raid, carried out by Iraq's elite Counter Terrorism Service. One of those commanders was an Iranian, he said.
A second PMF official said no commanders of Kataib Hezbollah were detained.
A spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Iraqi paramilitary sources denied any of those detained had been handed over to the U.S. military, after a government official said three had been.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran especially on Iraqi soil have been high for at least a year.
It nearly spilled into regional conflict in January after the United States killed Iran's military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike at Baghdad airport.
Both Tehran and Washington supported Kadhimi in becoming prime minister in May.

The law aims to tackle separatism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, although it is unclear what activities would constitute such crimes and what the punishment would be. 
Wong has rallied support for the pro-democracy movement overseas, meeting politicians from the United States, Europe and elsewhere, drawing the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a ""black hand"" of foreign forces.
""I will probably be the prime target of the new law. But what makes me fear is not my potential imprisonment, but the gloomy fact that the new law will be a threat over the city’s future and not just my personal life,"" Wong told Reuters.
""Journalists, human rights groups, NGOs, and expats may fall prey to the new law since all dissenting voices can be charged with inciting subversion, like the situation in China."" 
The draft law has alarmed foreign governments and Hong Kong democracy activists, who are concerned that Beijing is eroding the high degree of autonomy granted to the former British colony when it was returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China says the national security law will target only a small group of troublemakers and people who abide by the legislation have no reason to worry. 
The top decision-making body of China's parliament has scheduled a meeting for June 28-30 and the law, which will pave the way for the biggest change to the city's way of life since its handover in 1997, is expected to be enacted then. 
One of the most globally recognised faces in Hong Kong's democracy movement, Wong, 23, began his activism during secondary school when he led a hunger strike against a national education system and later became one of the protest leaders for the 2014 pro-democracy Umbrella Movement.

""I call on the world to stand with Hong Kong and urge China to pull back this evil law,"" Wong said.

1565,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 09:41PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Support dips for Hong Kong democracy protests as national security law looms - poll,"By Carol Mang and Yanni Chow
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Support for year-long pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong has slipped, now getting the backing of a slim majority, as the city braces for the imposition of Beijing-drafted national security legislation, a survey conducted for Reuters showed.
Protests escalated last June over a since-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of defendants to mainland China. They later morphed into a push for greater democracy, often involving violent clashes with the police.
The protests have resumed, but with far fewer participants, since China announced plans for the security law, which has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists in Hong Kong.
The survey conducted by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute between June 15-18 showed the legislation is opposed by a majority in the financial centre. (Graphic: Do you support of oppose Beijing's move to impose a security law in HK? - https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-PROTESTS/yxmpjlkedpr/HongKong-Protests-5.jpg) 
But the poll also showed support for protests dropping to 51% from 58% in a previous poll conducted for Reuters in March, while opposition to them rose to 34% from 28%.
""It may be psychological, because Hong Kong people see Beijing is getting more hardline,"" said Ming Sing, associate professor of social sciences at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
""If you keep insisting (on the demands) it’s impractical.""
Events on the ground also point to a loss in momentum, with most demonstrations in recent weeks attended only by hundreds and ending quickly. Police, citing coronavirus restrictions, have not given permission for rallies recently and have arrested large numbers of those who turned up anyway.
Pro-democracy labour unions and a student group last week failed to garner enough support to hold strikes against the proposed security legislation.
(Graphic: How much do you support or oppose the protest movement? - https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-PROTESTS/oakveaqeovr/HongKong-Protests-3.jpg)
The shift in backing for the protests has occurred mainly at the extremes, with those who strongly support them dropping to 34% from 40% and those who strongly oppose them rising to 28% from 21%. The number of those who ""somewhat"" support or oppose the protests remained stable.
The particular demands of the movement have also seen a drop in support. The request for an independent commission of inquiry to look into how police handled the demonstrations saw a 10 percentage points drop from March to 66%.
Universal suffrage, another key demand, was backed by 61%, down from 68%. The resignation of Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam was supported by 57% versus 63% three months ago. 
(Graphic: Should the HK government accede to the following demands by the protesters? - https://graphics.reuters.com/HONGKONG-PROTESTS/oakpeaqoopr/HongKong-Protests-Poll.jpg)
Opposition to the demands rose to 21% from 15%.
Samson Yuen, assistant professor in the political science department at Lingnan University, said support for the protesters' demands was ""still high"" but could have dropped because the security law has overtaken the protests as the main topic in the public discourse.
""Who would still talk about (protest) demands when the national security law is coming?,"" said Yuen.
Lam's office and China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, which comes under the State Council, or cabinet, did not respond to requests for comment.
For the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, 1,002 respondents were randomly surveyed by telephone. The results were weighted according to the latest population figures.
OPPOSITION TO SECURITY LAW
The poll was conducted when Beijing's intention to introduce legislation against terrorism, subversion, separatism and foreign interference was known but few details were available.
While the draft of the new law is yet to be finalised, key features of the legislation have since been released, revealing that Communist Party central authorities will have overarching powers over its enforcement, including final interpretation rights.
The poll showed 49% of respondents strongly opposed Beijing's move, with 7% ""somewhat"" opposing it. Support for the legislation added up to 34%, with the rest indifferent or undecided.
""I object to the law because the (Beijing) government is interfering in Hong Kong’s business,"" said engineer Charles Lo, 29, who participated in the survey. ""It will also suppress our freedom of speech and hinder the democracy movement.""
The law has stoked fears that Beijing is further eroding extensive autonomy promised to the territory when Britain handed it back to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula in 1997.
Hong Kong and Beijing authorities have repeatedly said the legislation would only target a small number of ""troublemakers"", while rights and freedoms would be preserved. They say it will bring stability to a city rattled by the protests.
""Before June last year, I didn’t think Hong Kong needed national security laws because we were so peaceful and safe, but now I think it's necessary,"" said another survey respondent, Hui, a retiree in her 50s.
The poll also showed that support for the idea of Hong Kong independence, which is anathema to Beijing and is expected to be a focal point in the looming legislation, remained relatively unchanged at 21%. Opposition to the idea grew to 60% from 56%.

1566,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>",Timeline: Threats and stalemate one year after Trump last met North Korea's Kim,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - Nearly one year after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last met, North Korea has returned to conducting short-range missile tests and issuing harsh rhetoric, while Washington shows little interest in easing sanctions.
The two leaders' last meeting - at the Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas - did little to break the deadlock in denuclearisation talks.
This has led to bouts of increased tension, though Trump - who once derided Kim as “Little Rocket Man” - has largely downplayed Pyongyang’s actions.
Here is a timeline of those developments:
June 12, 2018: A summit in Singapore represented the first time a sitting American president met with a North Korean leader, but the statement that came out of the meeting was light on specifics, opting instead for general commitments.
Since the summit, North Korea has shown no tangible signs of a willingness to abandon its nuclear weapons, and experts have said it is believed to have continued development of its arsenal. Washington, at the same time, has sought to keep sanctions intact, leading North Korea to accuse the United States of clinging to hostile policies.
Feb. 28, 2019: A second summit between Trump and Kim in Vietnam collapsed over sanctions relief, raising questions about the future of denuclearisation diplomacy.
June 30, 2019: Trump and Kim then met again on the border between North and South Korea and agreed to restart negotiations, but working-level nuclear talks in Sweden in October broke off.
Dec. 3, 2019: Raising tensions at year-end, Pyongyang warned Washington of a “Christmas gift” after Kim gave the United States until 2020 to propose new concessions in nuclear talks. Beyond a warning from Kim that the world would soon see a “new strategic weapon,” however, the deadline passed uneventfully.
March 2020: North Korea launched a series of short-range missiles, its first such tests of the year. This drew U.S. and Chinese appeals for Pyongyang to return to talks, but there were no signs that any discussions materialized.
April/May 2020: Kim’s disappearance from public sight led to several weeks of fevered speculation about his health, fuelling concerns in Washington and elsewhere about stability on the Korean Peninsula. The situation calmed in early May when state media said Kim had attended the completion of a fertilizer plant.
May 28, 2020: The U.S. Justice Department accused North Korea’s state-owned bank of evading U.S. sanctions laws and charged 28 North Korean and five Chinese citizens in its largest crackdown on North Korea sanctions violations.
June 16, 2020: North Korea blew up a liaison office in Kaesong used for joint talks after threatening action if defectors continued with a campaign sending propaganda leaflets into the North.
June 24, 2020: State media announced that Kim had decided to suspend military action plans that North Korea had threatened to carry out against the South.

June 25, 2020: Marking 70 years since the beginning of the 1950-1953 Korean War, North Korea's foreign ministry released a report defending the country's nuclear weapons programme and vowing to ""never shrink from this road we have chosen."" State media, however, did not report any of the anti-U.S. mass rallies that have often been held on that anniversary in the past.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 09:05PM ET</span>",Mexican president makes economic case for risky Trump visit,"By Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Thursday said an upcoming meeting with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump was a matter of economic necessity even as diplomats questioned the wisdom of making his first foreign visit to a man widely reviled by Mexicans.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will visit Trump in Washington to usher in a new trade deal four years after his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto was pilloried for hosting the American during the 2016 U.S. presidential election race.
Mexico sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. marketplace and receives billions of dollars in remittances from some 35 million people of Mexican origin in the United States. Trump has used both as leverage to pressure Mexico to curb illegal immigration.
Lopez Obrador, who has suggested the meeting could take place in early July, has striven to stay on good terms.
""It's a relationship of friendship, and it's an indispensable economic and commercial relationship,"" Lopez Obrador told a regular news conference. ""That's what my journey to the United States is about.""
Lopez Obrador, who has yet to travel outside Mexico since taking office 19 months ago, proposed the idea of a June or July meeting with Trump two months ago but later suggested it would be difficult in person.
That changed this week when Trump announced he was expecting to meet the Mexican president soon.
The thought of him sharing a stage with Trump, who tarred Mexican migrants as rapists and drug runners in his 2015-16 election campaign and vowed to make Mexico pay for his planned border wall, stirs unease among Mexican diplomats.
Agustin Gutierrez, the husband of Lopez Obrador's ambassador to Washington, Martha Barcena, and himself a former Mexican ambassador, said in an opinion piece on Thursday the visit risked repeating the ""disaster"" of Pena Nieto's 2016 encounter.
""What will happen if the press asks Trump, sitting next to the Mexican president in the Oval Office, if Mexico will pay for the wall?"" Gutierrez wrote in newspaper Milenio.
ELECTORAL BENEFIT 
Critics say the planned get-together will also give Trump a platform to burnish his credentials with Hispanic voters for his November re-election bid.
""I don't think it will help Trump a lot, but I think he will certainly use it,"" said Andres Rozental, a former Mexican deputy foreign minister.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to stay neutral in the U.S. election and says his visit has nothing to do with it.
He wants to celebrate the July 1 start of the United States-Canada-Mexico Agreement trade deal, and thank Trump for U.S. medical support during the coronavirus pandemic.
Mexico's government hopes Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will join the meeting, but it is not clear he will.
A Canadian government source said Trudeau would look at any invitation and make health and safety the primary consideration in taking any decision to attend during the pandemic. 
Under federal health rules, Trudeau currently faces 14 days in quarantine upon returning to Canada if he leaves the country.
Lopez Obrador's trip looks unlikely to prove popular at home.
A June 20 online survey by polling firm Consulta Mitofsky showed 68% of Mexicans had a negative view of Trump. The Mexican president evidently felt that not meeting Trump was the riskier of the two options, said Roy Campos, head of Mitofsky.

Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, Economy Minister Graciela Marquez and presidential chief of staff Alfonso Romo will join Lopez Obrador, who is flying commercial even though there are currently no direct flights to Washington due to the pandemic.

Eva Leal was getting a ride home from work in her nephew's vehicle on Tuesday when an officer stopped them and ordered them to pay a fine for violating a quarantine in place to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Leal asked the officer to show documents demonstrating the legal basis of the fine, and began filming the exchange, members of the lawyer's family told Reuters. The officer pulled Leal to the ground by her hair, they said.
The now-viral video shows a female officer pinning Leal down and attempting to handcuff her while accusing Leal of taking her pistol. Family members said the weapon was in fact taken by another National Guard officer.
Venezuela's information ministry and the state prosecutors office did not reply to requests for comment.
A military tribunal charged Leal, who was hospitalized and received four stitches in her forehead, with ""attacking the sentinel."" 
After being held in custody for two days, she was released on the condition that she return to court when summoned.
Her lawyer, Luis Lecuna, told reporters she would return to court if needed, without providing additional details.
""She did not commit any crime,"" said Joel Garcia a human rights activist, via Twitter. ""This is a way of disguising the barbaric act that was committed against her."" 
Venezuelan troops and police have been routinely accused by rights groups of arbitrarily detaining protesters and opposition leaders as well as staging confrontations to justify executions of accused criminals.
Rights groups have also criticized Maduro for reliance on military tribunals, which are typically used for members of the military, to try civilians.
Maduro's allies say opposition militants have used violence against troops and says the government prosecutes officials who violate human rights.

Lawmakers from Ireland's two dominant centre-right parties agreed to govern together for the first time in a deal that will put the Greens at the centre of policymaking and end a political stalemate triggered by an inconclusive election in February.
Fianna Fail's Micheál Martin would become prime minister for the first half of a five-year term in a parliament that would be broadly split down left-right lines for the first time with the pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein taking over as the main opposition. 
Votes from grassroot members of each party will be counted on Friday with the Greens requiring two-thirds support, a higher bar than the larger parties. Three of its 12 members of parliament did not back the deal, setting up a tight vote. 
""We went into the election saying 'want Green, vote Green', and the people who voted do think we should go into government,"" leader Eamon Ryan, one of the Greens who lost his seat a decade ago when the party was wiped out following its first and only term in government, told national broadcaster RTE this week.
Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Fine Gael, who is due to return to the role in December 2022 under a novel rotation agreement between the historic rivals who emerged from opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war, has warned the country will be headed for a political crisis if the deal is rejected.
That could mean a new election that would be complicated by coronavirus restrictions, attempts to form an alternative coalition or even Varadkar being re-elected for a matter of hours or days to pass important outstanding legislation.

Ireland currently cannot pass any new laws until a prime minister is appointed and in turn selects the final members needed to constitute the upper house.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's corruption investigation targeting President Jair Bolsonaro's eldest son will move to a special Rio de Janeiro court, the state court said on Thursday, opening the door to efforts to throw out evidence in the trial.
Senator Flavio Bolsonaro was a state legislator at the time the crime was allegedly committed and thus should have had immunity from trial by a lower court judge, the court said.
The court voted 2-1 to take the case away from lower court Judge Flavio Itabaiana, who last week ordered the arrest of the senator's former aide. Fabricio Queiroz, the aide, was sought for questioning about 1.2 million reais ($230,000) in bank transactions in an alleged scheme to embezzle the salaries of phantom employees in the Rio state assembly. 
Queiroz had disappeared from public view until police detained him last week at a house owned by a Bolsonaro family lawyer outside of Sao Paulo.
The arrest threatened to undermine the president's promises of cleaner politics, while ratcheting up his tensions with the judiciary, but the change of court may slow the investigation.
His lawyer Luciana Pires said his defense will now seek to annul rulings by the lower court judge and invalidate all evidence turned up since the start of the case.
The senator has denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a political attack on his family.

The case has hung like a dark cloud over Bolsonaro's presidency, raising awkward questions about his and his son's political past in the rough-and-tumble world of Rio politics. Before becoming president, Bolsonaro represented the state as a federal lawmaker for nearly three decades.

Bin Laden, who masterminded the 9/11 attacks on the United States, was killed in a raid on his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad after eluding detection for nearly 10 years.
Pakistan was not aware of the operation, which involved U.S. helicopters flying deep into the country from Afghanistan.
""I will never forget how we Pakistanis were embarrassed when the Americans came into Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden, martyred him,"" Khan said in his speech while recounting the lows of the relationship between Islamabad and Washington.
Opposition leader Khawaja Asif, the foreign minister in the last government, was among those who objected to the remark. He described bin Laden as the ""ultimate terrorist"".
""He destroyed my nation, and he (Khan) is calling him a martyr,"" Asif said in his reply on the floor of the house.
Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, whose Pakistan Peoples Party was in power when bin Laden was killed, accused the prime minister of appeasing violent extremism. 
The government's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Khan's remarks and the opposition leaders' criticism.
Khan's speech came as the country's foreign office hit out at a U.S. State Department report that accused Pakistan of continuing to be a safe haven for ""regionally focused terrorist groups"".

WASHINGTON/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Three days of White House meetings between aides to U.S. President Donald Trump on whether to give Israel a green light to annex parts of the occupied West Bank have ended without any final decision, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday.
The high-level discussions centered on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plan to extend Israeli sovereignty over Jewish settlements in the territory, which has drawn condemnation from the Palestinians, U.S. Arab allies and other foreign governments.
With Netanyahu's cabinet due to begin formal annexation deliberations on Wednesday, the still-unclear U.S. position suggested the Trump administration wants to move cautiously.
""There is as yet no final decision on the next steps for implementing the Trump plan,” one of the officials told Reuters, referring to the president's Israeli-Palestinian peace blueprint that could provide a basis for Netanyahu's annexation moves.
Trump, who has hewed to a heavily pro-Israel policy, participated in the discussions, the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Another U.S. official said further ""fact-finding"" would be needed before a U.S. determination.
Under Trump’s peace proposal unveiled in January and met with widespread skepticism, the United States would recognize the settlements - built on land the Palestinians seek for a state - as part of Israel.
The proposal would create a Palestinian state but impose strict conditions. Palestinian leaders have dismissed the initiative and it has gone nowhere.
Netanyahu hopes for U.S. approval for his project of extending sovereignty over settlements and the Jordan Valley. Most countries view Israel's settlements as illegal.
This week's meetings included Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other aides. On Wednesday, Pompeo said that any decision on annexation was ""for Israelis to make.""
Among the main options under U.S. consideration is a gradual process in which Israel would initially declare sovereignty over several settlements close to Jerusalem instead of the 30% of the West Bank envisaged in Netanyahu’s original plan, according to a person close to matter.
The Trump administration has not closed the door to a larger annexation. But Kushner is concerned that allowing Israel to move too fast could further alienate the Palestinians.

There are also worries about opposition from Jordan, one of only two countries that have a peace treaty with Israel, and from Gulf states that have quietly expanded engagement with Israel. Washington also wants Israel’s unity government, divided on the issue, to reach a consensus.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States called on Russia and China on Thursday to provide more humanitarian aid to their ally Venezuela in its fight against the growing COVID-19 epidemic. 
Venezuela, which has so far reported 4,048 cases of COVID-19 and 35 deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO), has jailed doctors and journalists for trying to expose the true extent of infections, Special Representative Elliott Abrams told a diplomatic event organised by the U.S. mission to the United Nations in Geneva.
""We do think the numbers are tragically a good deal higher,"" Abrams added. 
Referring to China and Russia, he said: ""We would like to see them contribute more on the humanitarian side. There has been, I believe, some contribution of goods with respect to COVID-19 by Russia and China. 
""But the scale, the dollar amount of this aid, is really quite low in comparison to the needs,"" he said.
The OPEC member's economy is reeling from a six-year recession and a prolonged political crisis that has driven at least 4.5 million Venezuelans to flee abroad.
Abrams said opposition leader Juan Guaido and his interim government - recognised by more than 50 countries - would soon provide $20 million in assets to the Pan-American Health Organisation - the WHO's regional office - and other aid groups.
Abrams said the government of President Nicolas Maduro holds 450 political prisoners and has sought to usurp institutions, including the Supreme Court.
""The Supreme Court is now completely subservient to the regime,"" he said.
Abrams reiterated a U.S. offer of March 31 for a power-sharing deal under which it would begin lifting sanctions - including against Venezuela's oil sector - if the opposition and members of Maduro's Socialist Party form an interim government without him. 
""That framework is not an ultimatum, it is not a take it or leave it. It is a proposal that clarifies the conditions under which U.S. sanctions would be lifted and provide a starting point for Venezuelans to discuss a pathway forward,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed legislation on Thursday that would impose mandatory sanctions on individuals or companies that back efforts by China to restrict Hong Kong's autonomy, pushing back against Beijing's new security law for the city.
The measure also includes secondary sanctions on banks that do business with anyone found to be backing any crackdown on the territory's autonomy, potentially cutting them off from American counterparts and limiting access to U.S. dollar transactions.
The ""Hong Kong Autonomy Act"" passed by unanimous consent. To become law, it must also pass the House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump.
Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, a lead sponsor, said in the Senate the legislation would send a clear message to Beijing that there would be consequences if it acts to undermine Hong Kong's autonomy.
""This could be our last opportunity to stay Beijing's hand before it destroys what is left of freedom in the city,"" said Republican Senator Josh Hawley, another sponsor.
The bill almost passed last week, Van Hollen said, but was blocked by Republican Senator Kevin Cramer - who had co-sponsored it - at the request of the Trump administration, which made a late request for technical corrections. 
The delay underscored how complicated it can be to pass legislation pushing back on China, as the administration pursues a trade deal with Beijing and the two powerful countries grapple for international influence and clash over human rights.
U.S.-China relations have reached their lowest point in years since the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China, hit the United States hard.

China's moves to impose the security legislation prompted Trump to initiate a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed Hong Kong to remain a global financial center.

Art critic and lower house deputy Vittorio Sgarbi has had a long political career mainly in former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, and is known for his publicity stunts and foul-mouthed outbursts on television talk shows.
He has been convicted many times for slander and at Thursday's parliamentary sitting he took aim at the judiciary, one of his favourite targets, comparing some prosecutors to mobsters.
He was called to order by the acting speaker but continued to shout insults towards her and another female lawmaker, before ushers carried him out of the chamber by his arms and legs to chants of ""shame"" from other parliamentarians.

The acting speaker Mara Carfagna told the house she was ordering Sgarbi's ejection because of his ""unrepeatable words"" towards her and the other lawmaker, a former prosecutor who had criticised Sgarbi's words on the judiciary.
Sgarbi has boasted of having sex in parliament with lawmakers and actresses, and ahead of the 2018 election he published a video of himself on the toilet with his trousers around his ankles while insulting his adversary Luigi Di Maio, then leader of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement.
Lower House Speaker Roberto Fico said after Thursday's episode that Sgarbi's ""sexist behaviour was indecent and unworthy.""

The declaration came after visitors arrived in very large numbers in a spell of hot weather, resulting in gridlock on the roads, illegal overnight camping, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour and alcohol-fuelled fights.
""We are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last 24-48 hours,"" said Council Leader Vikki Slade in a statement.
""The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.""
Social distancing measures have been in place in Britain since March to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, although the rules are due to be significantly relaxed from July 4.
With pubs still closed, many people have been heading to parks and beaches to meet friends and drink alcohol, in some cases ignoring advice to keep 2 metres apart.
In Bournemouth, roads were obstructed by illegal parking, crews were abused as they attempted to empty overflowing bins and 33 tonnes of waste had to be removed from the stretch of coastline in and around the town on Thursday morning.
The emergency response will involve extra police patrols, security to protect rubbish collectors, additional parking enforcement, evictions of unauthorised campers and signage on approach roads warning people not to come.

""We strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area,"" said Sam de Reya of the local police force.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States and European Union need a shared understanding of China to resist it, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday, calling Beijing a threat and accusing it of stealing European know-how to develop its economy.
Pompeo said he had accepted a proposal by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to create a formal U.S.-EU dialogue on China and would travel to Europe soon to host the first session.
""There is a transatlantic awakening to the truth of what's happening,"" Pompeo told a think-tank event via video link. ""This isn't the United States confronting China, this is the world confronting China,"" he said.
Borrell raised the idea of a U.S.-EU dialogue earlier this month at the end of a video call between Pompeo and EU foreign ministers. While details are thin, Pompeo said it would be run by senior officials and would be open-ended.
Two EU diplomats said the dialogue could be a forum for tackling issues such as how to combat what the West says is Chinese disinformation, rather than forging a common trade policy.
However, while the EU shares many of Washington's concerns about what it says are predatory Chinese trade practices to dominate strategic industries, Brussels wants to tread a middle path between China and the United States.
The EU, the world's biggest trading bloc, held talks with Chinese leaders on Monday and sees Beijing as a partner in fighting climate change as well as an economic rival.
Pompeo said the EU needed to act against China, whom he accused of stealing intellectual property in Europe and abusing the rules-based trading system, to protect its economies, not as a favour for the United States.
""They have access to our capital markets in ways we don't have access to theirs,"" he said of China's financial system.

Pompeo added that the new U.S.-EU dialogue would share information on China. While he said there would be differing opinions in the committee, he hoped it would be ""a catalyst for action"", although he did not go into details.

It was not clear who had carried out the kidnapping, which took place as the aid workers distributed food in the village of Bossey Bangou on Wednesday, said an APIS representative and a local security official.
Jihadist groups with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda have been expanding their presence in the arid Sahel region of West Africa, and attacks on civilians and armed forces have increased significantly over the last two years.

David Afanador, 39, had already been suspended from the New York Police Department soon after the arrest. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Afanador was arrested at a police precinct station house, the NYPD said in a statement. 
The NYPD has banned its officers from using chokeholds since 1993, warning they can be deadly. Earlier this month, as part of a package of police reform bills spurred by the nationwide protests against police violence, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed legislation making it a crime for officers to use chokeholds and similar neck restraints.
The forceful arrest on the Rockaway Beach boardwalk in Queens on Sunday was captured on police body-cam videos, which were released by the NYPD, and cellphone videos recorded by bystanders.
The videos show officers restraining the man on his stomach and one officer, Afanador, wrapping his arm around the man's neck. 
The man was arrested for being ""disorderly"" and was hospitalized after briefly falling unconscious in the officer's grip, according to his lawyers at Queens Defenders. 
The man, along with two others, could be seen cursing and insulting Afanador and his colleagues for several minutes prior to the arrest.
Scrutiny of the police has intensified across the country in the wake of the death on May 25 of George Floyd, a Black man, during an arrest in Minneapolis. 

Video showed a white officer with his knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes, giving rise ever since to some of the largest, most sustained nationwide protests seen in the United States in decades.

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 25, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Polish presidential vote puts government's reforms on the line,"By Alicja Ptak and Alan Charlish
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poles vote on Sunday in a closely-fought presidential election critical to the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government's hopes of implementing its conservative agenda, including judicial reforms the European Union says undermine democracy.
The vote had been due to take place on May 10 but was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Poles will now have the option of voting by postal ballot in Sunday's hastily rescheduled election to avoid having to visit polling stations.
With the COVID-19 death toll in Poland much lower than in most of western Europe - around 1,400 people have died, in a population of 38 million - the campaign has focused largely on PiS's socially conservative agenda, including its opposition to gay rights.
PiS has painted its candidate, the incumbent Andrzej Duda, 48, as a guardian of the party's generous welfare programmes and its traditional family values, which it says are under attack from the liberal West.
""As long as I live, I promise to defend our family, our Polish family model. I will not allow any experiments to take place here, particularly those involving children,"" Duda told supporters in his conservative heartland in southern Poland.
PiS opposes allowing gay couples to adopt children or to marry.
Opinion polls put President Duda on around 40% and his nearest rival, Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, 48, on just under 30%. But Duda's lead has been narrowing and he needs to win more than 50% to avoid a second round on July 12.
Some polls show Trzaskowski, candidate of the centrist Civic Platform (PO), winning the runoff.
A victory for Trzaskowski would put Poland on a path towards repairing its tense relations with the EU, which has launched unprecedented rule of law proceedings against the country.
It would also raise questions over the nationalists' fragile parliamentary coalition.
Under Polish law, the president can veto legislation and PiS does not have enough seats in the legislature to overturn it.
MISSING BALLOTS
In Poland's first election allowing postal votes on a large scale, some Poles abroad said they were having trouble registering or had not received ballot papers in the post.
Iwona Bereza, 46, who has lived in Britain for eight years at the same address, said the new system rejected her postal ballot application, citing problems with her residence. The foreign ministry said it was working on fixing glitches.
Trzaskowski has galvanised many centrist voters with a promise to thwart PiS's ambitions which he says erode democracy.
However, he has been careful to reassure voters he supports the generous social spending policies many say allowed PiS last year to win a second four-year parliamentary term.
""Some in our society had the impression they had been left on the sidelines... Our political opponents made a good diagnosis, that nobody should be left behind,"" Trzaskowski told supporters in May.
Duda is keen to contrast the rising wages Poland has seen during his tenure with what he says were tougher times under the previous pro-business PO government.
""For the Polish economy they were worse than coronavirus,"" he told supporters on Sunday.

Eleven candidates in total are running for president.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) will ground a third of its 434 pilots on suspicion that they hold ""dubious"" licences and flying certificates, a company spokesman said on Thursday, prompting concern from international safety and transport bodies. 
An inquiry into a crash in Karachi last month in which 97 people were killed pointed to the pilots not following procedures, while a government minister said the voice recorder suggested the pilots were distracted by a conversation about the novel coronavirus.
""We've been told that an investigation conducted by the civil aviation authority has found that about 150 of our pilots have dubious licenses,"" company spokesman Abdullah H. Khan told Reuters.
All of the pilots under investigation would be grounded, he said.
""We are following reports from Pakistan regarding fake pilot licences, which are concerning and represent a serious lapse in the licensing and safety oversight by the aviation regulator,"" a spokesman for the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said, adding that the global airlines body was seeking more information.
The European Union Aviation Safety Agency said it was aware of the reports containing serious allegations. ""We are investigating the matter but cannot comment further at this stage,"" a spokeswoman said.
Pakistan's investigations into pilots' qualifications began after a 2018 crash in which it was found that the test date on the license of the pilot involved had been a holiday - suggesting it was fake as testing could not have taken place on that day.
Another pilot had been out of the country on the date stamped on his flying certificate, Khan said.
PIA has a fleet of 31 aircraft that fly domestic and international routes.

Successive governments have tried to overhaul the loss-making carrier over the years but with little sign of success.

MADRID (Reuters) - In a political U-turn that could bode well for Spain's recovery policies after the coronavirus crisis, the main conservative opposition party lent support in parliament to the minority government's decree outlining ""new normal"" safety measures.
The lower house approved the decree by 265-77 votes and 5 abstentions, with 88 votes of the opposition People's Party (PP).
In a highly volatile political environment after four elections in four years, PP had pursued an aggressive strategy of weakening the fragile leftist coalition government which took over in January.
The government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez struggled to approve various extensions of a state of emergency and the phasing out of the COVID-19 lockdown in the past two months, with the PP either abstaining or voting against since April.
""Our party will support a decree to get out of this brutal crisis of the coronavirus and to prevent any new outbreaks and to take economic and social measures so that Spain can get out of this problem as soon as possible,"" PP leader Pablo Casado said on Thursday before the vote.
Among other measures, the so-called new normalcy decree makes the wearing of masks compulsory in spaces where a safe 1.5 metre distance between people cannot be respected.
But generally the government has had to rely mainly on small regional parties to approve legislation, which could prove even more difficult when it has to legislate on post-pandemic spending and revenues to help the battered economy.
""We will always be there for the important issues. We will continue to propose agreements. It is Sanchez who has not called Casado for a month and a half,"" conservative lawmaker Pablo Montesinos told Reuters.

Opinion polls show Sanchez with the same support as in the last election, around 28%, but support for the PP has risen significantly to 26%.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China has deployed large numbers of troops and weapons along a disputed Himalayan border in violation of bilateral agreements, India's foreign ministry said on Thursday, accusing Beijing of escalating tensions and triggering a deadly clash last week.
""At the heart of the matter is that since early May the Chinese side had been amassing a large contingent of troops and armaments along the LAC,"" ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said in a briefing in New Delhi, referring to the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border.
""This is not in accordance with the provisions of our various bilateral agreements,"" he said, including a 1993 treaty that dictates that both sides will maintain limited border deployments.
China has blamed India for the clash - the deadliest between the two nuclear armed neighbours for at least five decades - and said Indian troops attacked Chinese officers and soldiers.
Responding to the heightened Chinese presence last month, India also deployed a large number of troops along the LAC, Srivastava said, leading to face-offs in the Ladakh region of the Western Himalayas.
On June 15, Indian and Chinese troops brawled for several hours in the Galwan Valley, using stones and sticks with nails embedded in them to beat each other, killing 20 Indian soldiers and injuring at least 76 more. China has not disclosed how many casualties its troops suffered. 
After senior military commanders held parleys this week, both sides have since agreed to disengage their troops on the disputed border.

But in satellite images reviewed by Reuters, China appears to have added new structures near the site of the Galwan Valley clash that India says is on its side of the LAC. These include camouflaged tents or covered structures and a potential new camp under construction with walls or barricades.

Lithuania sees the nuclear power plant, built by Russia's Atomstroyexport near its capital and financed by Moscow with a $10 billion loan, as threat to its safety and national security, something Belarus disagrees with.
""The President's opinion is that negotiations should be finished first,"" Nauseda's spokesman told Reuters in a statement.
Lithuania has a law banning all Belarusian power sales after the power plant gets operational.
The Estonian president's office, which hosted the meeting, said that Nauseda, who is dealing with a reshuffle of his team, ""decided to stay home at the last minute due to internal affairs"".
Lithuania wants all the three countries to sign up to banning sales of Belarusian electricity after the nuclear plant comes online, binning an earlier draft agreement that only pledged to help keep the energy from being sold in Lithuania.
The presidents of Estonia and Latvia said they still backed the preliminary agreement. ""We leave it to our governments to continue the discussions on exact wordings if it needs to be adjusted"", Estonia's Kersti Kaljulaid told reporters.

Belarus expects to have the first of two 1.2 gigawatt VVER 1200 reactors online in July and supply first power in the autumn, according to state news agency Belta.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - As the architect of Sweden's unorthodox response to the coronavirus pandemic, Anders Tegnell has got used to receiving death threats and being urged to resign.
But he says he has no plans to step down or step back and remains convinced that, over time, the anti-lockdown strategy that has seen his country break ranks with much of the world will prove its worth.
""I think a number of countries should have thought twice before taking the very drastic measure of a lockdown,"" he told Reuters in an interview. 
""That's what's experimental, not the Swedish model.""
While most countries have hunkered down behind closed doors, Sweden has relied on voluntary curbs on social contact, keeping most schools, restaurants, bars and businesses open.
Since March, its economy has outpaced the rest of Europe, but at over 5,000 its COVID-19 death toll is jarringly high - many times the combined total of neighbours Denmark, Finland and Norway.
Tegnell's supporters, praising what they consider a forward-thinking approach to an unavoidable calamity, have sculpted his image in soap and wood, and the wave of flowers sent to the 64-year-old, a keen gardener, has been such that his local florist has asked for deliveries to be staggered.
Meanwhile the populist Sweden Democrats have described coronavirus deaths among the elderly as a ""massacre"" and demanded his resignation, and police have investigated multiple death threats against him. 
""HORRIBLE"" DEATH TOLL, BUT...
Tegnell, his hair greying and worry lines creasing his forehead, calls Sweden's death toll ""horrible"" but maintains there is little evidence linking it to the absence of a lockdown, pointing instead to conditions at nursing homes, a decentralised health care system and travel patterns.
A veteran of anti-Ebola health campaigns in Africa, he also argues that his critics have focused too little on the consequences of shutdowns.
""It is fascinating how little we in Sweden have discussed the very negative effects that lockdowns have had in many countries. Domestic abuse... schoolchildren with very serious problems in many other countries,"" he said. 
""The effects of different strategies, lockdowns and other measures, are much more complex than we understand today... This disease is very difficult to understand.""
The death rate among Swedish COVID cases has fallen about 70% from a peak in April and Tegnell says some countries that adopted hard lockdowns, like Britain, Italy and Spain, have suffered more.
For him, it is the actions of his Nordic neighbours that are the more baffling. ""The question is rather whether they had a reason to shut down at all?"" he said.
But his remains the minority view and as Europe gradually reopens for travellers, Swedes have been excluded by many countries, even within the usually tight-knit Nordic countries.
""Their strategy has failed,"" said Allan Randrup Thomsen, professor of virology at the University of Copenhagen, where the death toll per capita is a fifth of Sweden's.

""It's been a decisive factor for their high infection number, that they didn't shut down to the same extent that (Denmark)... did.""

GENEVA/BERLIN (Reuters) - France and Germany expressed political and financial backing for the World Health Organization in its fight against the coronavirus on Thursday, with Berlin saying it would give a record half billion euros in funding and equipment this year.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the agency, criticised by the United States for being slow off the mark in tackling the pandemic, was getting the support it needed and that the talks had been ""very productive"".
""We are getting today all the support we need, politically and financially. Both Germany and France are long-standing friends of WHO and global health,"" Tedros told a news conference at WHO headquarters.
U.S. President Donald Trump said last month that the United States was cutting ties with the ""China-centric"" WHO, but he has still not formally notified the U.N. agency.
The United States is the biggest overall donor to the Geneva-based WHO, contributing more than $400 million in 2019, roughly 15% of its budget.
""Isolated national answers to international problems are doomed to fail,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said.
He announced additional donations of funds and medical equipment to WHO that would bring Germany's total support to 500 million euros ($561 million) this year, the ""highest amount ever"", as it assumes the EU presidency.
""We need a strong, efficient, transparent and accountable WHO today more than ever,"" Spahn said. 
""Germany will do its part to give the WHO the political, financial and technical backing that is needed. This comes with the expectation that remaining challenges are adequately addressed and needed reforms are pushed forward.""
France said it would give 90 million euros to a WHO research centre in Lyon as well as an additional contribution of 50 million euros.
""I truly believe the world needs, more than ever, a multilateral organisation,"" French Health Minister Olivier Veran said. ""I believe the world cannot get rid of partners. We need a global answer (to COVID-19) and only the WHO can provide that answer.""
Infections have been reported in more than 210 countries and territories since the first cases were identified in China in December 2019.
More than 9.47 million people have been reported to have been infected by the coronavirus globally and 482,389​ have died so far, according to a Reuters tally.
""The situation in Western Europe is improving. Of course, in the rest of world the pandemic is on the increase,"" Tedros said.

BLANTYRE (Reuters) - Malawi's opposition alliance claimed victory for its candidate Lazarus Chakwera on Thursday in a re-run of the 2019 presidential election, annulled by courts because of fraud.
The vote on Tuesday came to be regarded as a test of the ability of African courts to fight ballot fraud since Malawi's judiciary infuriated President Peter Mutharika in February by overturning the result of last year's vote.
""With all votes ... tallied, it is now clear that Malawians have resoundingly given (the opposition)...alliance the mandate to govern this country for the next five years,"" a statement from Chakwera's Tonse Alliance said.
""Malawians have at last reclaimed their destiny."" 
A spokesman for Mutharika's alliance did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Malawi's state and private media on Wednesday gave Chakwera a comfortable 55% lead, with nearly three-quarters of votes counted, against Mutharika's 40%.
At a news conference on Thursday, Electoral Commission chairman Chifundo Kachale urged Malawians to wait for the official result, which was taking time to collate because the ballots had to be transported back to head office from locations across the lakeside southern African nation.
A win for Chakwera would be a dramatic reversal of last year's discredited poll that handed the presidency back to the incumbent, who has been in power since 2014.
Electoral officials said voting day on Tuesday was largely peaceful, apart from some sporadic reports of violence in opposition strongholds, and Malawi has remained calm while awaiting the result.

The cancelled result forced a change in the electoral system, swapping a ""first-past-the-post"" for a system in which the winner has to get more than 50% of the vote.

""We are following reports from Pakistan regarding fake pilot licences, which are concerning and represent a serious lapse in the licensing and safety oversight by the aviation regulator,"" an IATA spokesman said, adding that the organisation was seeking more information.
Pakistan's civil aviation authority has found that some 150 of PIA's 434 pilots have ""dubious licences"", the airline said.

An inquiry into a PIA crash that killed 97 people last month has pointed to pilots not following procedures.

The move came little more than a month after Church leaders in Poland announced that they were referring Bishop Edward Janiak to the Vatican for eventual judgement.
The Vatican said the pope had appointed Archbishop Grzegorz Rys of the city of Lodz as apostolic administrator, a temporary post. Janiak will remain bishop of Kalisz while the accusations are investigated.
It was not immediately possible to contact Janiak for comment.
The case came to prominence after a film by brothers Tomasz and Marek Sekielski, purported to show how Janiak failed to take action against priests who were known to have abused children.
The Sekielski brothers released another film last year that suggested that known paedophiles were deliberately shifted between parishes. The film has had more than 23 million views on YouTube. 
Victims of sexual abuse have long called for measures to make it easier to report suspected cover-ups by the Church. 

Poland's Catholic Church, an institution with close ties to the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party, has faced accusations in the past of shielding priests who abuse children.

Despite effective vaccines and treatments that dramatically boosted survival rates when administered early, the outbreak dragged on as first responders struggled to gain access to virus hotspots in Congo's restive eastern borderlands. 
As that outbreak neared its end, another one was declared on June 1 in the western city of Mbandaka, more than 1,000 km (620 miles) away. Genetic testing revealed the two epidemics were not connected. 
""The health ministry intends to capitalise on the lessons learned and the success factors from this long epidemic to assure the most effective response possible in Mbandaka,"" Health Minister Eteni Longondo told reporters. 
There were 3,463 cases confirmed and probable cases recorded over the course of the outbreak in eastern Congo, including 2,277 deaths, Longondo said. 

The largest Ebola outbreak occurred in West Africa from 2013-2016, when more than 11,300 people died from the disease in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

Aoun, a Maronite Christian, was speaking at a meeting that he said was called to protect civil peace but which was boycotted by opponents including Sunni Muslim leader Saad al-Hariri and other ex-prime ministers who said it a waste of time.
The crisis is seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-90 civil war. A 75% decline in the Lebanese pound since October has been reflected in soaring prices and savers have been frozen out of their deposits. 
Aoun's comments referred partly to confrontations in Beirut earlier this month that opened old sectarian faultlines between Shi'ite Muslims and Christians and between Shi'ites and Sunnis.
""We touched the atmosphere of civil war in a worrying way. Movements replete with sectarian tensions were launched in a suspicious manner,"" Aoun said.
Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system requires the president to be a Maronite, the prime minister to be a Sunni and the parliament speaker to be a Shi'ite.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab, appointed in January with backing from Aoun, the powerful Iranian-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, said the exchange rate was the only concern for Lebanese. 
""Lebanese want the central bank to control the dollar exchange rate vis-à-vis the Lebanese pound and to preserve the value of their salaries and savings,"" he told the meeting.

Former prime ministers Hariri, Najib Mikati and Tammam Salam said the real threat to stability may come from the deteriorating economic and financial situation and ""this cannot be solved by large meetings that do not have a clear agenda"".

LONDON (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in authoritarian behaviour by governments around the world, posing a growing threat to democracy, hundreds of former prime ministers, presidents, Nobel laureates and lawmakers have warned.
The virus was first identified in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in December and has since spread around the world, prompting countries across Europe, Asia, the Americas and Africa to step in, many limiting free movement, free speech, public assembly and other civic rights.
""Authoritarian regimes, not surprisingly, are using the crisis to silence critics and tighten their political grip,"" wrote some 500 signatories, including more than 60 former leaders, in an open letter organised by the Stockholm-based Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA). 
""Even some democratically elected governments are fighting the pandemic by amassing emergency powers that restrict human rights and enhance state surveillance without regard to legal constraints (or) parliamentary oversight.""
More than 80 countries have enacted emergency measures, according to the U.S.-based International Center for Non-Profit Law, ranging from curfews and fines for those who breach the rules to extra surveillance, censorship and increased executive powers.
The overall impact has been a dilution of democratic norms, which has implications for political freedom as well as the ability of governments to handle the crisis and future health emergencies, said IDEA's secretary-general.
Among the countries he cited as having introduced authoritarian measures or having fallen short on accountability were the Philippines, Hungary, El Salvador and Turkey.
""There are legitimate reasons to invoke emergency powers. However, it is always problematic when a government uses emergency powers to clamp down on independent media and other fundamental rights,"" said Kevin Casas-Zamora, also a former vice-president and government minister in Costa Rica.
""We want to draw attention to the plight of democracy in the midst of this crisis. It's not protecting democracy for its own sake; it's that democracy has an inherent value in dealing with this pandemic and preparing for the next one.""
The outbreak has already led to the postponement or cancellation of 66 elections worldwide, a third of them national polls, according to IDEA. Nearly 50 countries have imposed some form of restriction on press freedom, 21 of them democracies.
For the signatories, including Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the former president of Brazil, and Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, a fundamental concern is that citizens begin to accept more authoritarian behaviour.

""Democracy is under threat, and people who care about it must summon the will, the discipline, and the solidarity to defend it. At stake are the freedom, health, and dignity of people everywhere,"" they wrote.

SUNNY BEACH, Bulgaria (Reuters) - Sunny Beach, Bulgaria's largest Black Sea resort known for its vibrant night life and packed coastline, is like a ghost town.
After the coronavirus pandemic closed borders, grounded flights and forced people to stay home, just a handful of holiday makers sunbathe among hundreds of unopened umbrellas and untouched sunbeds on its 5 km stretch of golden sand.
""I do not remember anything like that,"" said Rumen Monchev, owner of a seafront hotel. ""If we break even this year, then we will be super good.""
Monchev has cut his prices, invested in screens to separate tables in the dining area and employed a ""COVID-19 sheriff"" to ensure his hotel is a safe place amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Still, out of 160 Hungarians he was expecting last week, only 33 came. 
Tourism accounts for about 12% of Bulgaria's economic output and provides a lifeline for thousands of people in the European Union's poorest member state.
To salvage something from the summer holiday season, the government has offered subsidies for charter flights and slashed concession fees so beach operators can offer cheaper sunbeds while keeping the coasts safe and disinfected.
Bulgaria, which has a relatively low number of coronavirus cases, has opened its borders for leisure travel to most countries in Europe since early June. 
Still, the pandemic has cut planned charter flights to Bulgaria's Black Sea gateways at Varna and Burgas for the season by 35% compared to 2019. A similar drop is expected for regular flights, Tourism Minister Nikolina Angelkova said.
Over 9 million foreign tourists visited Bulgaria last year and Angelkova had been planning for 10% growth in 2020.
""We were expecting the best summer yet. Unfortunately, this is no longer on the agenda,"" she said. ""Let's hope we can kick-start the season from July, spin the wheel and build on that.""
On Thursday, the country registered 128 new cases of the coronavirus, bringing the total to 4,242, including 209 deaths.
For now, about 60-70% of the hotels in the two main Black Sea resorts -- Sunny Beach and Golden Sands -- plan to open in the coming days, betting on the resumption of charter flights from the Netherlands and Germany later this week. 
""I have long stopped even looking at the bookings ... We are all on standby,"" said Teodor Pastarmadzhiev, managing member of the Union of hotel owners in Sunny Beach. 

He hopes leisure travel restrictions will be lifted for key markets like Britain, Russia and Ukraine next month and holiday makers will start arriving en masse in August.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soaring hospital demand for the steroid dexamethasone, which British researchers say significantly reduces mortality among severely ill COVID-19 patients, is outstripping supply of the drug, but hospitals have so far been able to treat patients out of their inventories, according to Vizient Inc, a drug buyer for about half of U.S. hospitals.
Hospitals and other health-care customers advised by Vizient increased orders of the drug by more than 600% after the researchers announced their findings last week. Manufacturers were only able to fill around half of those orders, Vizient said.
""What we're hearing from our members is that they are able to treat the patients who do require dexamethasone - they are treating them and they have product,"" Steven Lucio, vice president of pharmacy solutions at Vizient, said in an interview. ""The concern is, Can the market continue to sustain this?""
Vizient's data shows that hospitals are increasingly putting the drug into use to treat COVID-19 patients, confirming what several U.S. hospitals in hard-hit parts of the country told Reuters last week.
According to Oxford University researchers, dexamethasone reduced death rates by nearly a third among COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical breathing assistance.
The injectable version of dexamethasone has been in shortage in the U.S. since February of last year, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
Still, German drugmaker Fresenius SE (DE:FREG)'s Kabi unit - by far the largest supplier to the U.S. market - says it has good inventory on hand of the steroid and is ramping up production in three of its U.S. factories to meet the surging demand.

""Fresenius Kabi is confident we can meet customers’ needs with COVID-related medicines such as dexamethasone,"" spokesman Matthew Kuhn said in an email.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's army has joined the debate over history and democracy in the Southeast Asian nation by holding a ceremony on the same day that pro-democracy demonstrations were held at memorials to the 1932 revolution that ended centuries of absolute monarchy.
A military statement seen by Reuters on Thursday confirmed that army officials had honoured leaders of a failed 1933 insurrection known as Boworadet Rebellion in a ceremony inside the army headquarters in Bangkok.
The disputes over history come as more Thais are speaking out against a military-dominated political system and as monuments to the 1932 establishment of democracy, including the one celebrating victory over the Boworadet Rebellion, have been mysteriously removed from public spaces.
The military has cited protection of the monarchy as justification for staging coups in 2006 and in 2014. Having led the junta that replaced a democratically-elected government in 2014, former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha remained prime minister following a disputed election last year. 
Historians have commonly described the Boworadet Rebellion - named after a prince who led it - as an attempt to re-establish the absolute monarchy, but the army statement said that it was opposing ""dictatorial"" governance.
Officially a constitutional monarch, King Maha Vajiralongkorn is a powerful figure for whom the constitution commands reverence. Insulting the king is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison. 
The army statement described the establishment of constitutional monarchy and parliament in 1932 as ""a coup that toppled the monarchy"".
""The courage and sacrifice of Prince Boworadet and Phraya Si Sitthisongkhram deserved to be praised for their role in protecting the monarchy with loyalty and for wanting the country to maintain a true democratic system,"" the statement said.
This alternative narrative is product of conservative forces who have been seeking since the late 1950s to recast the role of the king, according to some historians.

""This is an attempt by the army to create a new version of history,"" said Charnvit Kasetsiri, a prominent Thai historian.

GAZA (Reuters) - Vineyard owner Haidar al-Zahar recalls with joy the day in 2005 when Israel removed its settlers and troops from the Gaza Strip, part of a withdrawal that few Palestinians thought they would ever see.
""I felt like a prisoner who suddenly found himself a free man,"" he said.
A decade and a half later he is on the warpath as Israel considers whether to annex its settlements in the occupied West Bank, 40 km (25 miles) away, divided from Gaza by Israel and which Palestinians seek as the heartland of a future state.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set July 1 for the start of cabinet discussions on the move, proposed as part of a U.S. peace plan.
""Israel today has all the power. No one can deny that - they can do whatever they want,"" Zahar, 68, said.
He urged Palestinians to wage ""armed resistance"" to prevent the annexation, saying Israel had evacuated its troops and 8,500 settlers from Gaza in part because of Palestinian attacks at the time.
""Without willing martyrs, nothing will change,"" he said.
Israel, which blockades Gaza citing security concerns, said it withdrew to improve its security and international status in the absence of peace talks.
Israel captured Gaza and the West Bank, along with East Jerusalem, in a 1967 war.
The Palestinians and most countries consider that annexation of the West Bank, where more than 420,000 Jewish settlers live, would be an illegal act, a designation that Israel disputes. 
In Gaza, Zeyad Mhana, a public servant, said Israel has been emboldened by a rift between the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority and Hamas Islamists who took over Gaza in internal fighting in 2007.
""We regret what is happening in the West Bank, but unfortunately it is a result of our division,"" the 46-year-old said.

In the southern Gaza district of Rafah, Mohammad Seidam, 84, said West Bank Palestinians must not give up hope. ""In Gaza they had built gardens, farms and greenhouses and God removed them,"" he said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Twenty-two police officers were hurt during trouble at an unauthorised music event in London overnight where crowds attacked some patrol cars, British authorities said on Thursday.
Parties have been banned during Britain's coronavirus lockdown, though some people have been defying that.
""These are utterly vile scenes,"" said Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel of the disorder in the capital's Brixton area.
Police said they were attacked when responding to residents' complaints about noise, anti-social behaviour and violence.
None of the officers were injured seriously, though two required hospital treatment, police said in a statement. Some police cars were damaged and four people were arrested.
""These gatherings are unlawful, as well as posing a risk to public health and against coronavirus restrictions. The violence shown towards officers is totally unacceptable and we will not tolerate it in any form,"" said police commander Colin Wingrove.
Unverified images on social media showed a crowd - with one person holding an object that looked like a sword - confronting officers and attacking a police car. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify those images.
Patel said the incident was particularly wrong given the recent stabbing at a park in Reading where three people died in what police said was a terrorism incident.
""Just last weekend, the whole country came together to praise our heroic police officers for putting their own lives on the line to keep us safe,"" she said.
British police have issued warnings against holding parties or large gatherings during the lockdown to curb COVID-19. Three people were stabbed and a woman raped after thousands of young people attended a ""rave"" in northern England earlier this month, one of a number of such illegal events to take place recently.

HANOI (Reuters) - Under a pitch-black night sky, a group of Vietnamese farmers planted rice this week in a paddy field on the outskirts of the capital Hanoi using head lamps to illuminate the water-logged ground in front of them.
The farmers of the Tam Thanh commune say they have been forced to work at night in the fields to avoid searing temperatures that they say have got worse over the years.
""Temperature are rising one or two degrees (Celsius) every year,"" said Le Van Ha, 40, who blames the felling of trees in the area for making temperatures more extreme.
Ha, who doesn't want his children to follow his path into agriculture, said he now gets up at 2 a.m. to avoid having to cope with stifling daytime conditions.
Even though working at night has slashed productivity, he says they can keep working much longer by avoiding the heat.
Vietnam reportedly experienced its highest temperature on record last year at 43.4 degrees Celsius (110 Fahrenheit) in Ha Tinh province in central Vietnam.
An official at Vietnam's National Center for Hydro-Meteorological Forecasting said many parts of the country were suffering new heat waves this year, though temperatures so far were below last year's record highs.
Temperatures in northern and central parts of Vietnam ranged between 35C and 40C on Thursday, according to the center.
Another farmer, Thai Hong Ngoc, 50, said planting at night meant that far fewer rice plants wither due to the extreme heat and is grateful that they now have machinery to use for harvesting. 

""If I had to manually harvest crops like before, surely I would just leave it. It's just too hot,"" said Ngoc.

LONDON (Reuters) - Those fighting for Black racial equality in Britain need to put realistic reform over dreams of revolution, said Imarn Ayton, an activist who has had a prominent role in protests that swept London in recent weeks.
The death of George Floyd, who gasped ""I can't breathe"" as a white U.S. police officer kneeled on his neck, has prompted a reassessment of racism and triggered protests across the world.
But within Britain's Black Lives Matter movement there are differing opinions over what to aim for and how to achieve it: some make more radical demands, like abolishing the police and capitalism, while others, like Ayton, favour more gradual reform.
""I want to achieve equality and justice for Black people,"" Ayton, 29, told Reuters in Peckham, south London, where she has lived for 20 years. ""I am very much focused on putting a spotlight on institutionalised racism - that is my main focus.""
Ayton is calling on the government to implement findings of a series of reviews on ethnic injustices including the Lammy Review of 2017. That looked into the treatment of ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system.
More radical in its stated aims is Black Lives Matter UK, which calls itself an ""abolitionist movement"" that does not believe in reforming the police, state or prisons. It says it wants to dismantle capitalism.
BLM UK is one of the more prominent groups using social media to raise funds and organise protests.
""BLM do not believe in reform. I do believe in reform,"" said Ayton. ""We do have to be united but we don't necessarily have to agree on everything. We can have the same objectives but have a different approach.""
BLM UK did not respond to requests for comment sent via email and Twitter.
STATUES TOPPLED
Ayton, recognisable by her striking blond hair, has carried a loudspeaker and led chants at demonstrations across the capital, including from on top of a van.
She said racism affected every walk of British life from policing and politics to healthcare and the media.
""Institutionalised racism is very much alive because of silence and ignorance,"" said Ayton, who is of Jamaican and Nigerian descent.
Britain, she said, had to face its colonial past, otherwise it would haunt society and sow discord for centuries to come.
One step of atonement would be for it to pay reparations for the slave trade, she said, suggesting London could start by paying off the debt of Caribbean countries.
""We appreciate a 'sorry' of course but I don't believe it is enough. I do believe in reparations,"" Ayton said, adding that slave traders were compensated when the trade was abolished but slaves were not.
She would like to see statues of slave traders moved to museums but said there was no reason to remove a statue of Winston Churchill as he had done much for the United Kingdom even though he expressed what are now considered racist views.
So what statues would she like to see?

""I would put up a lot of people who were slaves - they are ultimately heroes,"" Ayton said.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron was surveying a glacier in the French Alps on a visit in February when an aide forwarded a video that had just been posted online, showing his choice for Paris mayor masturbating.
Benjamin Griveaux's campaign was already floundering, a month out from the first round of the election, and his naiveté in falling for a simple sting meant Macron had to choose: back a loyal and trusted ally, or sack him.
""Be there for him,"" Macron told advisers, according to a member of his inner circle. ""And if he decides to press on, circle the wagons.""
Macron has consistently rewarded the early backers of his 2017 bid for the presidency, party insiders say. But within 48 hours, Griveaux had stood down, leaving Macron's hopes of winning the capital in tatters.
Interviews with more than a dozen ministers, presidential aides and party insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity reveal how miscalculations cost him dear, and portray a leader who can put loyalty before competence and fail to judge character.
Macron had hoped that local elections would provide the grassroots base that his young centrist party, LaRem, lacks ahead of his 2022 re-election bid.
And Paris's City Hall, long in the grip of the left, seemed there for the taking.
The capital welcomed the former investment banker into the Elysee Palace with open arms in 2017. One in three Parisian voters backed LaRem in last year's European elections.
And a year ago, before Griveaux's nomination, incumbent Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo was deeply unpopular for her efforts to reduce traffic in the capital, and surveys showed a Macron candidate beating her.
TURNING GOLD TO LEAD
Now, three days before Sunday's nationwide municipal elections, Macron's stand-in candidate, former health minister Agnes Buzyn, is polling more than 20 points behind Hidalgo, seemingly having lost ground since the first round in March.
One disgruntled LaRem lawmaker put it simply: ""We had gold in our hands and we turned it to lead.""
LaRem's campaign crumbled with the sting on Griveaux, but the seeds of defeat had been sown months earlier, with Griveaux's selection.
The 42-year-old was one of the 'Macron Boys', the clique that helped propel the president to power. In July 2019, a LaRem committee picked him over Cedric Villani, an eccentric maths genius known for his spider brooches and silk cravats.
But many saw Griveaux, who served as Macron's first government spokesman, as arrogant and patronising.
When the video was posted - by a Russian protest artist whose girlfriend had lured Griveaux into sending the video - few in the party rallied round him. 
""He wasn't liked. Neither by the public, nor by party members,"" said an official inside LaRem. ""The time has come when you have to say it like it is.""
MATHS MAVERICK
To be sure, Macron's own popularity had slumped during months of anti-government 'yellow vest' protests in early 2019, which were driven by public anger at a leader seen as aloof. It fell again last winter during weeks of demonstrations against pension reforms, and transport strikes.
But Macron's confidant compared the loyalty to Griveaux to an alliance forged in war.
""It's like (French wartime resistance leader) De Gaulle and the Communists: They had nothing in common but, 20 years later, once he was in the Elysee, the General still took calls from those who had been with him in London.""
Macron also underestimated Villani, winner of a Fields Medal, mathematics' equivalent of a Nobel Prize.
Villani had entered politics, and parliament, in 2017 with LaRem but, after being rejected as its mayoral candidate, decided to run as an independent, and ate into Griveaux's support.
Party officials urged Macron to offer Villani an incentive to drop his maverick campaign, reminiscent of Macron's own rise to power, or eject him from the party.
But the president held back, telling a small group of reporters that ""emulation"" was a positive. Socialist and conservative rivals gleefully pointed to the disunity.
Two sources close to Macron said he had believed Villani's bid would naturally fade. 
It was only in January, when Griveaux slipped to third in surveys, with Villani further behind, that Macron summoned the mathematician. Even then, he failed to change Villani's mind.

As one government minister put it: ""We've done almost everything we shouldn't have done. It could end up as a handy guide: 'How to lose an election'.""

SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China appears to have added new structures near the site of a deadly border clash with India in the western Himalayas, fresh satellite pictures show, heightening concerns about further flare-ups between the nuclear-armed neighbours. 
Indian and Chinese military commanders agreed on Monday to step back from a weeks-old standoff at several locations along their disputed border following the June 15 clash in the Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.
The satellite images showing new construction activity in the week following the brutal hand-to-hand combat underline the challenge of disengagement and the risk the accord could still fall apart because of overlapping claims in the arid territory.
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/2Z6f0AZ in an external browser to see an interactive graphic of these satellite images)
The pictures shot on Monday by U.S.-based space technology firm Maxar Technologies (NYSE:MAXR) show what appear to be extensive Chinese structures on a raised river terrace overlooking the Galwan River. 
India says the area where the structures have sprung up are on its side of the poorly defined, undemarcated Line of Actual Control or the de facto border between the two Asian giants. 
China says the whole of Galwan valley, located at about 14,000ft (4,300m), is its territory and blames Indian troops for triggering the clashes. 
The new activity includes camouflaged tents or covered structures against the base of cliff, and a short distance away, a potential new camp under construction with walls or barricades. The camp was not seen in pictures made available to Reuters the previous week. 
Nathan Ruser, a satellite data expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said the buildup suggested there was little sign of de-escalation.
""Satellite imagery from the Galwan Valley on June 22nd shows that 'disengagement' really isn't the word that the (Indian) government should be using,"" he said in a post on Twitter.
On the Indian side, defensive barriers can be seen in the latest images which were not visible in pictures taken in May. An Indian forward post appears to be scaled back compared with images a month ago.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the apparent activity.
India's defence ministry also did not respond to a request for a comment. 
Indian military officials have previously said they will be closely monitoring the planned disengagement process and verify it on the ground.
""There is a trust deficit so far as the Chinese are concerned,"" said former Indian army chief Deepak Kapoor.

""So if they are telling us verbally they are ready to pull back, we will wait to see it on the ground. Until then the armed forces will be on alert.""

PARIS/BERLIN (Reuters) - Western countries hope donors will provide at least $500 million at a Sudan conference to support a cash programme for poor families launched by the struggling transitional government, European diplomats said.
Germany and the United Nations will host the virtual conference in Berlin on Thursday to gather potential donors to help the civilian government struggling with an economic crisis after the ousting of Omar al-Bashir last year.
""The aim in Berlin is to get $500 million in donations for the World Bank's Family Support Fund,"" one European diplomat said, confirming what other diplomats said.
Donations of $500 million would be well below the $8 billion in foreign aid which Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok said last August was needed to turn around an economy in crisis since South Sudan took away most oil output with its secession in 2011 -- before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the global economy. 
It was not clear whether donations for other programmes would be also pledged. The German foreign ministry, hosting the event, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The conference describes participants as “partners” rather than donors, to recognise that Sudan has its own resources and needs political and economic support rather than handouts, the Sudanese government coordinator for the conference has said.
Hamdok, in power in a shaky coalition with the military which deposed Bashir last April after mass protests, plans to launch cash transfers for poor worth $1.9 billion with the help of the World Bank.
The family cash scheme is key to soften the blow of a removal of fuel and other subsidies demanded by Western donors which cost an estimated $3 billion annually.
Inflation topped an annual 100% last month as the government printed money to fund bread and fuel subsidies. Sudan's currency has fallen to 141 to the dollar on the black market compared to 55 at the official rate, due to hard currency shortages.
The conference will also tackle ways to start badly needed debt relief for Sudan, diplomats said.
New financing has been held up by the need to settle decades of arrears to the International Monetary Fund and by Sudan's listing, while under Bashir's rule, by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism disqualifying it from new IMF borrowing.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's prime minister said on Thursday his government would not attend U.S.-mediated talks with Serbia planned for the weekend at the White House after Kosovo's president was formally accused of war crimes.
A special prosecutor's office dealing with Kosovo's 1998-99 uprising against Serbian rule said on Wednesday it had indicted Kosovo President Hashim Thaci at a Hague court for alleged crimes including nearly 100 murders.
Thaci and Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti had been due to meet with a Serbian delegation for the first round of U.S.-brokered negotiations aimed at normalising relations.
""Because of the new developments ... I have to return to Pristina to deal with the situation,"" Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Hoti, who was in Brussels to meet European Union (EU) officials, said he had informed U.S. mediator Richard Grenell.
There was no immediate reaction from Belgrade on whether their delegation would also cancel.
Serbia does not recognise its former breakaway province, which became independent in 2008. They have been holding talks since 2011, with little progress. 
Thaci, a former senior commander in the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), has not responded to Wednesday's indictment in public but has previously denied involvement in any war crimes.
The Hague-based Specialist Chamber was set up in 2015 to handle cases of alleged crimes by the KLA during the war that led to Kosovo’s independence.
Though a Kosovo court, it is financed by the EU and sits in the Netherlands partly to help ensure protection of witnesses.

There was no immediate reaction from the U.S. government to Kosovo's pullout from the talks.

Tan, 39, is currently head of public policy and economics at professional networking site LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), the People's Action Party said in a statement on Thursday. It added he has been a volunteer since 2005.
Tan was previously head of public policy in Southeast Asia for Facebook, which has been at loggerheads with the Singapore government over the online fake news law enacted late last year. 
He made a written submission for the company in early 2018 to a committee studying online falsehoods, saying it did ""not believe that legislation is the best approach to addressing the issue"". 
He also represented Facebook along with its Asia vice president for public policy Simon Milner during a heated public hearing about the law before it was enacted. 
Rights groups are concerned the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) could be used to stifle free speech.
The government has said the law only tackles falsehoods and that legitimate criticism and free speech would not be affected.
Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has called an early election, saying he was satisfied a ballot could be held safely despite criticism that such a move might endanger voters during the coronavirus pandemic.

Thanks to an aggressive, targeted testing programme and a centralised quarantine system, Vietnam has contained infections numbers to a relatively low 352 cases, most of whom have recovered. There have been no reported deaths. 
""There is no story of rushing to open the doors,"" Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc said in a statement posted to the government website on Wednesday.
""Vietnam is not yet ready to welcome back international tourists. Foreign experts, high level workers and investors into Vietnam are welcomed but will be closely monitored.""
Highly skilled foreign experts such as engineers have been allowed to enter Vietnam on special flights and quarantine at hotels in a bid to keep the economy afloat throughout the global pandemic. Phuc said the frequency of such flights should be increased.
For over two months, Vietnam has reported no community transmission of the coronavirus. In early June, Vietnam said it was planning to resume flights to some virus-free countries that had registered no cases of coronavirus for 30 days or more.
Other Southeast Asian countries with slowing infections are considering travel bubble arrangements in the months ahead, such as Malaysia and Thailand, to include countries such as China, South Korea and Japan. 

Thailand has been 31 days without a domestic transmission and will allow entry of some short-term business travellers and medical tourists from next month.

(Reuters) - The chief of police in Tucson, Arizona on Wednesday offered to resign after he released a video showing the death of a Latino man who said ""he could not breathe"" as police handcuffed him and placed him face down on his stomach.
Carlos Ingram-Lopez, 27, died on April 21, police restraining him in a ""prone position"" with his hands behind his back for about 12 minutes, police chief Chris Magnus told a news briefing. 
The video showed Ingram-Lopez repeatedly asking for water, crying out, moaning and breathing heavily until he eventually falls silent.
Three police officers resigned over the incident, Magnus said. An investigation found they committed multiple policy violations during the incident, Magnus said, adding that he had offered his own resignation. 
A source said Tucson's city manager had yet to accept Magnus' resignation
""The involved officers did not live up to our department's high standards,"" Magnus said.
The video was released following weeks of protests demanding police departments be overhauled, defunded or dismantled to stop officers killing unarmed people of color. The protests were sparked by the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
Police reported Ingram-Lopez died from a sudden cardiac arrest with acute cocaine intoxication and an enlarged heart, according to the Pima County Medical Examiner's report.
Ingram-Lopez had committed domestic violence against a ""significant other"" two days before his grandmother called police around 1 a.m. on April 21 and told them he was ""drunk and yelling,"" Magnus said.
Ingram-Lopez was acting in a ""highly erratic manner"" when he was taken into custody, and officers handcuffed him inside the garage of the family home, Magnus said. Officers performed CPR and used Narcan to try to revive him after he became unresponsive, Magnus said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Seventy years after the Korean War began, prospects for a peace treaty to officially end the conflict appear as distant as ever, as the two Koreas held low-key commemorations on Thursday amid heightened tension on the peninsula.
The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving U.S.-led U.N. forces technically still at war with North Korea. 
South Korean leaders in 1953 opposed the idea of a truce that left the peninsula divided and were not signatories to the armistice.
South Korean veterans of the war were due gather to commemorate the anniversary, including at one event where U.S. President Donald Trump and other international leaders were expected to deliver video messages.
North Korea's ruling party newspaper ran a front-page commentary calling for people to follow in the footsteps of those who fought to defend the nation.
""Several decades have passed, but the danger of war has never left this soil,"" the newspaper said, blaming ""hostile forces"" for seeking to crush North Korea.
Two years ago, a flurry of diplomacy and summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the presidents of the United States, South Korea, and China raised hopes that even if the North's nuclear arsenal was undiminished, the parties might agree to officially end the technical state of war.
Those hopes have been dashed, however, with North Korea accusing the United States and South Korea of clinging to hostile policies, and Washington pressing Pyongyang to abandon its growing arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
A series of follow-up meetings and working-level talks failed to close the gap between the two old enemies, and North Korea has taken an increasingly confrontational tone, resuming short-range missile launches, blowing up an inter-Korean liaison office and severing communication hotlines with South Korea.
On Wednesday, North Korea said it had decided to suspend plans for unspecified military action against South Korea, but warned it to ""think and behave wisely"".
Historians have estimated the war may have caused as many as 1 million military deaths and killed several million civilians. Thousands of families were divided with little contact as the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) cut the peninsula in two.
""The unresolved state of the Korean War has had devastating consequences for Koreans, from the separation of thousands of families to the extreme militarization of the Korean Peninsula,"" said Christine Ahn, international coordinator for WomenCrossDMZ, a group that advocates for peace in Korea.
Despite misgivings from many in the United States, South Korean officials are pushing more forcefully for an end to the armistice arrangement, saying that it appreciates the role of the United Nations Command, South Korea's alliance with the United States should evolve with the times.

""It is time for Korea to take centre stage in maintaining its own peace and security, by ending the current state of armistice and establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula,"" South Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young said on Wednesday.

The area surrounding the popular Huatulco beach resort in the southern state of Oaxaca was hardest hit by the 7.4 magnitude quake, but the shaking could be felt as far away as Mexico City, where tall buildings swayed and thousands of people raced into the streets.
Roughly 30 buildings in the capital were damaged, and in a northern neighborhood that was hard hit by a 2017 earthquake, some residents had to evacuate their homes.
""This apartment has always been my home. It's where I was born, where I grew up, where I have all my memories,"" Aura Preisser told Reuters while removing her belongings from the building, which was cordoned off by authorities. ""If I lost it, I would lose not only my home, but a large part of my heart.""
In Oaxaca, crews of workers cleared the roads cluttered with debris from the earthquake, while residents of humble communities searched for their belongings among the rubble.
""Everything was damaged, the whole house was taken away. Everything we have done in our lives is gone,"" said Vicente Romero in the town of La Crucecita, on the Pacific coast, showing the damage to his home as neighbors cleared debris.
Educational centers and historical sites, including four archaeological zones, suffered damage, according to a statement from the Oaxaca state government, which put the death toll at 10 people.

In a post on Twitter, Oaxaca Governor Alejandro Murat said 117 municipalities and more than 5,000 homes had been affected by the earthquake.

Incumbent Prime Minister Khurelsukh Ukhnaa will lead the next government, the 17th since Mongolia's democratic revolution put an end to Communist rule in 1990. 
The opposition Democrats are set to take 11 seats, a small improvement from the nine secured in 2016. Turnout stood at 73%, though some polling stations were cut off as a result of heavy rainstorms. 
Mongolia is a parliamentary democracy, with the party with the most seats entitled to form a government and choose the prime minister. However, it also elects a president who can veto government legislation. 
The MPP is descended from the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party, which ran the country during its Communist era from 1921 to 1990. 
According to a survey published in May by the Sant Maral Foundation, a Mongolian polling group, unemployment and widening income disparities were the biggest concerns ahead of the election, with the country struggling to figure out how to share its vast mineral wealth.
But the poll showed strong public support for the government's handling of the coronavirus, with 49% of people polled saying it was their biggest success.
Mongolia shut its borders early, closed schools and universities and restricted transportation routes from its capital Ulaanbaatar to other regions. It has so far seen a total of 215 coronavirus cases, with no deaths.
Boldsaikhan Sambuu, a political scientist with the Zorig Foundation, a Mongolian think tank, said the MPP benefited from its handling of COVID-19 and its strong leadership. 
But its victory could also be attributed to the first-past-the-post electoral system, which gave it a vast majority of seats with 40% of the total vote, he said.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Three white men arrested last month in the slaying of a Black man who was gunned down as he jogged through a suburban neighborhood in Georgia four months ago were indicted on Wednesday on murder and other charges.
Video footage showing the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, in the coastal Georgia town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) emerged on social media and went viral in May, some 10 weeks after his death, stoking public outrage at the lack of arrests at that time.
Days later, the two men seen confronting Arbery in the video, former police officer George McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34, were taken into custody and charged with murder. William ""Roddie"" Bryan Jr., 50, who videotaped the Feb. 23 shooting, was later arrested and also charged with murder.
On Wednesday, a grand jury returned a nine-count indictment against all three men, charging each with malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment, the indictment shows. The three remain jailed without bond.
The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery was involved in a string of neighborhood burglaries when they spotted him running in the street and said they chased him down in their pickup truck to make a citizen's arrest.
Bryan's attorney Kevin Gough, issued a statement on Wednesday insisting his client was merely ""a witness to the tragic shooting death"" and had fully cooperated with investigators from the start.
The indictment supersedes charging documents already filed against the three men and spares prosecutors the legal hurdle of having to prove to a judge they have sufficient evidence to proceed to trial.
Lee Merritt, an attorney representing Arbery's family, said the charges carry a possible death sentence, but prosecutors haven't decided whether to seek capital punishment.
The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether grounds exist for federal hate-crimes charges.

A bill newly passed by the Georgia legislature allowing for stiffer sentences when a victim is shown to have been targeted because of race is not retroactive and cannot be applied in the Arbery case, Merritt said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - When a major earthquake struck Mexico on Tuesday, panic swept through the coastal city of Juchitan as residents feared that much of what they had struggled to rebuild after a devastating 2017 temblor would return to rubble.
Tuesday's 7.4-magnitude quake near the Pacific coast killed at least seven people and injured more than 20, rocking remote mountain villages. It was felt as far away as Mexico City but reverberated with special resonance in humid Juchitan.
When the ground began to tremble, school teacher Eunice Pineda ran into the middle of the street with her mother.
Their home emerged largely unscathed from the 2017 earthquake, which damaged historic buildings and killed dozens of people in the city.
But on Tuesday morning, the ground was shaking so violently that Pineda feared the building would crumble and covered her mother's eyes, she told Reuters.
""'Don't look!'"" the 26-year-old recalled saying. ""'Our house is going to fall ... The house of all our memories.'""
The house stood firm, and the city lost no buildings, even though the epicenter was only about 116 miles (187 km) away. But many in Juchitan, a city with deep indigenous roots in the southern state of Oaxaca, feared the worst.
Civil protection authorities found about 30 to 40 people in a state of nervous shock as they made their rounds, said William Lopez, a local official.
""Many people still haven't recovered from 2017,"" he said. 
Juchitan sits on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a vibrant indigenous Zapotec region whose colorful traditional dress inspired artist Frida Kahlo's signature aesthetic. 
After the 2017 quake, many people who lost their homes slept under plastic tarps in the rainy season, said Juan Mario Perez, who works at an indigenous community radio station and helped to rebuild the town. Aftershocks jolted Juchitan for weeks. 
Nearly three years on, many are still fighting to get assistance or materials. Some went home to live in precarious conditions, having only built a room or two, Perez said.
The city estimates 40% to 50% of reconstruction is complete, said Lopez. After the latest quake, only two structures are in danger of collapse, both badly damaged in 2017, he added.
Juchitan has made progress. Its market, where women in its famously matriarchal society peddle handicrafts and local dishes, reopened last year.
But anxiety ran high after Tuesday's tremor. Some people slept on their patios, a traditional way to beat the heat on muggy summer evenings - and a precaution against unsteady ground.
During the quake, optometrist Zurisadai Ortiz said she was distraught thinking about her grandmother, who lives just across the street but is too frail to flee the house without assistance.
Ortiz, 24, slept in a room reinforced after the 2017 quake at her grandmother's house Tuesday night. She felt better, but she still does not trust the earth beneath her.

""Our lives can change in minutes, in seconds,"" she said.

Fahrettin Altun, the Turkish presidency's communications director, said on Twitter that Erdogan and Trump had made great efforts to mend ties between the two countries and that Trump ""has done a lot more listening to a key NATO ally than some of the previous administrations.""
In his book, Bolton wrote that Erdogan gave Trump a memo saying Turkish state lender Halkbank (IS:HALKB), under investigation by the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York for violating Iranian sanctions, was innocent.
""Trump then told Erdogan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District prosecutors were not his people, but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people,"" Bolton wrote.
Geoffrey Berman was forced to step down as U.S. Attorney for the district last weekend. The office has also been investigating Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph Giuliani.
""Recent publication of a book authored by a high-level former U.S. official includes misleading, one-sided and manipulative presentations of our leader President Erdogan’s conversations with the US President Donald Trump,"" Altun's Twitter post said.
The Halkbank case has been one strain between Ankara and Washington, which in recent years have also been at odds for various reasons including policy differences in Syria and Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defence systems.
Altun said Erdogan advocates for Turkey's priorities at every opportunity ""both publicly and privately"", including the Halkbank issue.

U.S. prosecutors accused Halkbank and its executives of using money servicers and front companies in Iran, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates from 2012 to 2016 to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran. A status conference is scheduled in the case for June 30.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday it was up to Israel to decide whether to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to do despite international opposition.
Senior aides to U.S. President Donald Trump met for a second day to discuss whether to give Netanyahu the green light for annexation, which has drawn condemnation from the Palestinians, U.S. Arab allies and other foreign governments.
Despite that, Pompeo - speaking to reporters ahead of Netanyahu's July 1 target date - said extending Israeli sovereignty was a decision ""for Israelis to make.""
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel to abandon plans to annex parts of the West Bank, warning this threatened prospects for peace with the Palestinians. [nL1N2E10T5] 
Under Trump’s peace proposal unveiled in January and met with widespread skepticism, the United States would recognize the Jewish settlements - built on land the Palestinians seek for a state - as part of Israel. 
The proposal would create a Palestinian state but impose strict conditions. Palestinian leaders have dismissed the initiative and it has gone nowhere.
Netanyahu intends to launch his project of extending sovereignty over settlements and the Jordan Valley, hoping for U.S. approval. Most countries view Israel's settlements as illegal, and the Palestinians have voiced outrage at annexation. 
While criticizing Palestinian leaders for rejecting Trump's ""vision for peace,"" Pompeo did not provide any signs of where the administration stands on the specifics of Netanyahu's plan.
Pompeo was at the White House to join the discussions, and Trump could also take part, a U.S. official said.
Among the main options under U.S. consideration is a gradual, step-by-step process in which Israel would initially declare sovereignty over several settlements close to Jerusalem instead of the 30% of the West Bank envisaged in Netanyahu’s original plan, according to a person close to matter.
The Trump administration has not closed the door to a larger annexation.
But Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser is concerned that allowing Israel to move too fast could kill hopes of drawing the Palestinians into talks on the peace plan he mostly authored, the source said.

There are also concerns about opposition from Jordan, one of only two countries that have a peace treaty with Israel, and from Gulf states that have quietly expanded engagement with Israel. Washington has also made clear it wants Israel’s unity government, divided on the issue, to reach a consensus.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia and China will be isolated at the United Nations if they continue down the ""road to dystopia"" by blocking a U.S. bid to extend a weapons ban on Iran, U.S. Iran envoy Brian Hook told Reuters ahead of his formal pitch of the embargo to the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.
The 13-year-old arms restrictions on Iran are due to expire in October under the terms of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Russia and China have signaled they oppose extending the embargo.
While Washington has long argued that the embargo should not be lifted, the international community has been waiting for it to formally push the measure. Hook and U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft made the case for why the 15-member council should support a draft resolution extending the embargo behind closed doors on Wednesday. 
""We see a widening gap between Russia and China and the international community,"" Hook said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday evening.
""Russia and China were isolated at the (International Atomic Energy Agency) last week and they will be isolated in the Security Council if they continue down this road to dystopia,"" Hook said.
The IAEA's 35-nation board of governors on Friday called on Iran to allow the U.N. nuclear watchdog access to two sites suspected of nuclear weapons activities, and to cooperate fully. Iranian allies Russia and China opposed that move but could not block it, whereas at the Security Council they have veto powers.
A council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, Britain or France to pass.
""There is no possibility for its adoption,"" said a Chinese diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, after Hook and Craft briefed council envoys. ""The U.S. draft resolution is in essence a continuation of the U.S. maximum pressure policy [on Iran] and it has no value or basis for discussion.""
Earlier this month, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called on Russia and China to resist Washington's push, pledging to ""increase our defense capabilities as we have been doing so even under sanctions.""
'CLEAR LIMITS'
""Extending the arms embargo is the right and necessary thing to do and every member of the Security Council knows this whether they say this publicly or not,"" Hook said.
""The embargo has not prevented all Iranian weapons transfers, but the export and import bans have been effective at establishing clear limits on Iran's behavior,"" he argued. 
The United States circulated the draft resolution on Monday after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reported to the council earlier this month that cruise missiles used in several attacks on oil facilities and an international airport in Saudi Arabia last year were of ""Iranian origin.""
If the United States is unsuccessful in extending the embargo, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under a process agreed in the 2015 nuclear deal, even though the United States quit the accord in 2018.
Such a move would kill the nuclear deal, touted by the United States and others in 2015 as a way to suspend Tehran's suspected drive to develop nuclear weapons, and diplomats say Washington would face a tough battle in the council. 
The United States argues it can trigger the sanctions because a U.N. resolution enshrining the 2015 nuclear deal still names Washington as a participant.
Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions. 
Rouhani said on Wednesday that Tehran would be open to talks with the United States if Washington apologizes for quitting the nuclear deal and compensates Tehran. 

""We are happy to engage in conversations with them when the time is right but the conditions that suggest somehow we give a bunch of money to the Iranians so they can foment terror around the world is simply ludicrous,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday.

The U.S. military's Southern Command on Tuesday said the missile destroyer Nitze conducted a ""freedom of navigation"" operation off Venezuela's coast. The Southern Command said the vessel sailed in an area outside Venezuela's territorial waters - which extend some 12 nautical miles from its coasts - but within an area the Venezuelan government ""falsely claims to have control over.""
Padrino said Venezuela was ""not offended"" by the act by the country's longtime foe. The United States has imposed sanctions on the OPEC nation's oil sector as part of its effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse and has been accused by Washington of corruption and human rights violations. 
""It is an empty victory,"" Padrino said in a speech broadcast on state television, adding that the ship reached 30 miles from the Venezuelan coast. ""It is a childish act."" 
In a statement, U.S. Army Col. and Southern Command spokesperson Amanda Azubuike said the Navy's freedom of navigation operations were intended to preserve maritime navigation and access rights around the world. 
""This region is no different, and we will continue to exercise our right to contest excessive claims,"" Azubuike said. 
Washington's campaign of sanctions and diplomatic pressure have not succeeded in forcing Maduro from power. While President Donald Trump has stated that ""all options are on the table"" to remove him, U.S. officials have made clear there is little appetite for military force. 

Padrino said that any U.S. military ships that entered Venezuela's territorial waters would be met with an ""overwhelming"" response from the South American country's armed forces.

The state-owned Malawi Broadcasting Corporation and private media all had Chakwera with 55% or more, with President Peter Mutharika at 40%.
At a news conference late on Wednesday, Electoral Commission chairman Chifundo Kachale urged Malawians to be patient and await the official results, which he said were taking time because they wanted to get ""a credible record.""
""We are doing it manually. We'll use records from district tally centres and district commissioners, not social media. Our appeal to Malawians is to be patient,"" Kachale said.
If Chakwera does win, it would mean a dramatic reversal of the previous discredited result which handed the presidency to Mutharika. Some in the main city Blantyre and other parts of the country were already erupting into celebration.
Tuesday's vote has been seen as a test of the ability of African courts to tackle ballot fraud and restrain presidential power, ever since Malawi's judiciary infuriated Mutharika in February by overturning the result of last year's poll. His disputed win also triggered months of street protests. 
Mutharika has complained of violence in opposition strongholds in central Malawi, and questioned whether the result would be credible. His party have lodged a complaint about violence in opposition strongholds in central Malawi, but it is not clear if they will dispute the result if he loses.

Duda's visit appeared aimed at boosting his re-election campaign - Poland's nationwide presidential vote is on Sunday. The nationalist Polish leader has emerged as one of Trump's preferred foreign partners. The two have met one-on-one at least five times.
A defense agreement would send more U.S. troops to Poland, bolstering defense cooperation between the two NATO allies and acting as a further counterweight against Russian aggression.
""I think it sends a strong message to Russia,"" Trump told a news conference with Duda in the White House Rose Garden, where he criticized other European countries for buying Russian energy. 
The two leaders spoke after meeting in the Oval Office.
Duda said it was an honor to discuss next steps in relations at the White House. ""Today we are entering another stage, namely there is a possibility of further increase in American troops in our country,"" he said.
Trump said he might move U.S. troops from Germany to Poland. The Republican president wants to take thousands of U.S. forces out of Germany because he says the United States bears too much of a financial burden for the deployment and criticizes the government in Berlin for buying Russian energy.
""We're going to be reducing our forces in Germany. Some will be coming home and some will be going to other places, but Poland would be one of those other places,"" Trump said at the news conference.
CRITICIZING GERMANY
""Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars to purchase energy from Russia. And through the pipeline. And I'm saying what's that all about? You're spending billions of dollars to Russia, then we're supposed to defend you from Russia. So I think it's... very bad,"" Trump said.
Washington objects to the Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which would double the amount of gas piped directly from Russia to Germany and reduce the amount piped in Ukraine. 
Critics have accused Duda and Trump of calling the visit just before the Polish election in order to improve the right-leaning Duda’s chances of winning, as his lead in opinion polls has dropped in recent weeks.
Duda's campaign has focused on rallying his conservative base with attacks on what he calls lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ""ideology,"" while promising to protect popular social benefit programs for families and pensioners that have transformed life for many poorer Poles.
The U.S. Army already has an area support group in the region that can be tailored to increase the number of U.S. soldiers in Poland.
According to Polish media reports, the United States could offer 2,000 soldiers to Poland, 1,000 more than initially agreed in June 2019. Those additional troops would include the U.S. Army V Corps from Kentucky and F-16s from Germany.
Another official with knowledge of the talks told Reuters that moving the V Corps to Poland was under discussion and that Poland could get more than the 1,000 troops agreed to last year, but would not say if 2,000 would be sent.

Trump also told the news conference that the United States and Poland were discussing a project to construct a nuclear-powered plant in Poland.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa's last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, has withdrawn from a U.S. seminar about minority rights because he did not want to embarrass himself or his hosts in the current charged racial climate, his foundation said on Sunday.
De Klerk, who was the head of South Africa's white minority government until 1994, was scheduled to speak on July 1 at an American Bar Association (ABA) virtual event on issues such as minority rights, racism and the rule of law.
But his participation unleashed a barrage of criticism from South African opposition parties and activists who called on ABA to cancel De Klerk's attendance given his role in the apartheid-era security apparatus.
""The allegation that De Klerk was involved in gross violations of human rights is baseless,"" the F.W. de Klerk foundation said in a statement.
""However, it appears unacceptable in the current super-heated racial climate that any leader from South Africa's troubled past should be permitted to retain the slightest vestige of honour,"" it said.
In a follow-up statement, ABA confirmed the panel was cancelled at midday on Saturday.
The death of Black man George Floyd under the knee of a U.S. police officer last month has triggered a wave of anti-racism protests around the world.
""At a time like this where the whole world is crying out for recognition and demanding that value be placed on our lives, on Black lives, we think that ABA erred in inviting someone like De Klerk,"" said Lukhanyo Calata.
He is the son of Fort Calata, who was killed along with three other anti-apartheid activists by South African police in 1985 in an incident known as ""The Cradock Four"".
De Klerk's foundation defended his legacy of helping South Africa's transition from white minority rule to non-racial constitutional democracy and for being the only world leader to dismantle an existing nuclear arsenal.
But, almost thirty years after apartheid's demise, De Klerk's role remains highly contested in South Africa, one of the world's most unequal societies where class and race issues constantly bubble under the surface.

Earlier this year De Klerk, an octogenarian who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with South Africa's first democratically elected president Nelson Mandela, also faced a backlash when he told the national broadcaster he did not believe apartheid was a crime against humanity, as declared by the United Nations.

In the vote late on Tuesday, 48 members of parliament backed the proposed initiative by the government to revise an article of the 2019 law that criminalised homosexuality. Twenty-four voted against, while 25 abstained. 
The bill still needs the backing of the upper house, which is expected on Thursday when the Senate votes on it.
The government did not say why it decided to reverse the law punishing gay sex. 
Prime Minister Julien Nkoghe Bekale, who initiated the bill, said he had religious convictions, tolerance and respect for human life. ""As I am against the death penalty, I am also against the stigmatisation of homosexuals. Congratulations to the parliamentarians for having changed mentalities and being able to adapt to the times,"" he tweeted on Wednesday.
Sylvia Bongo, Gabon's First Lady, also backed the move, saying in an online post that parliament had restored a fundamental human right for its citizens: that of loving, freely, without being condemned. 
The decision has sharply divided opinion, and sparked intense debate on social media in the central African nation, and within the dominant ruling Gabonese Democratic Party (PDG).
On Wednesday afternoon, four protesters against the law were briefly detained by police in front of the Senate.
""My attachment to the constitution, and to our ancestral values do not command me to authorise or encourage such practices,"" said PDG lawmaker Blaise Louembe, who voted against the law. 
""Forty-eight lawmakers have shaken an entire nation and its customs and traditions,"" another lawmaker who voted against the revision, told Reuters. 
Gabon had been one of 73 countries or jurisdictions worldwide that criminalises sex between men and sex between women. In Gabon, convictions drew punishments of at least six months' imprisonment and a fine of 5 million FCFA ($8,715), according to London-based rights group Human Dignity Trust.

Riot police used tear gas to disperse dozens who rallied in front of the city hall in Budva and also in front of the Interior Ministry's headquarters in Podgorica. 
The dispute in Budva began on June 17 when the mayor loyal to the pro-Serb opposition refused to hand over power to the ruling coalition despite losing his majority in the local assembly.
Prime Minister Dusko Markovic said police were enforcing the law. 
""If there's no room for reason, the state will solve this in 15 minutes,"" Markovic told parliament.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court on Wednesday ordered the release of three journalists and three others to be remanded while they stand trial on charges of revealing state secrets in their coverage of the deaths of Turkish intelligence officers in Libya, a lawyer said.
The eight defendants in the case, six of whom have been in jail since early March pending the trial, are accused of revealing the identities of two members of the National Intelligence Agency (MIT).
Turkey has provided military support and training in Libya to the internationally recognised Government of National Accord, helping it fight off a 14-month assault on the capital Tripoli by eastern Libyan forces led by Khalifa Haftar.
The charges against the seven journalists in the case centre on articles and social media posts published shortly after President Tayyip Erdogan said in February that Turkey had ""several martyrs"" in Libya.
The eighth defendant, a municipal worker in the western Turkish town of Akhisar, is accused of supplying pictures to the journalists of the funeral of one of the dead intelligence officers.
The court ruled on Wednesday that defendants Baris Terkoglu, from OdaTV website, as well Ferhat Celik and Aydin Keser, both from Yeni Yasam newspaper, should be released, lawyer Celal Ulgen said.
""It is deeply disappointing and incomprehensible that all six were not released,"" said Milena Buyum, Turkey campaigner for Amnesty International, on Twitter. The next hearing is scheduled for Sept. 9.
According to the indictment, Murat Agirel, a reporter for Yeni Cag newspaper, was the first to reveal the identities of the intelligence officers, sharing names and photos on Twitter and referencing Erdogan's comments.
The indictment accuses the defendants of revealing information related to state security, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years, by revealing the missions as well as the identities of MIT members. 
They are also accused of revealing documents and information related to intelligence activities, which carries a sentence of up to 10 years. The defendants deny the accusations, saying they were doing their jobs as journalists.
The independence of the judiciary and pressure on journalists have been debated in Turkey, especially since a crackdown after an attempted coup in 2016.
Critics say the government used the crackdown as pretext to quash dissent, while Erdogan and his AK Party say the measures are necessary given the security risks Turkey faces and that courts make independent decisions.

Opponents say the reform, which would place prosecutors under the government's authority rather than the courts, undermines the independence of the judiciary. 
On the second day of protests, crowds of mostly young men chanted and squared up to security forces on the streets around parliament, before being pushed back by armed officers in jeeps. 
The proposal was put forward by a member of ex-president Joseph Kabila's PPRD party, but has faced opposition from the UDPS party of President Felix Tshisekedi.
""We will fight to the end to protect the independence of the judicial system,"" said protester and UDPS supporter Jean Kabamba, whose head was wrapped in a Congolese flag.
The tension and frustration felt by Tshisekedi's party long predates the current events, said Fred Bauma from the Congo Research Group at New York University. The proposed law ""is just a trigger,"" he told Reuters.
Tshisekedi took power last year, but his presidency has been hampered by an awkward power-sharing deal with Kabila, whose allies control a majority of ministries and seats in parliament.

The recent trial of Tshisekedi's former chief of staff on embezzlement charges pointed to other cracks in the ruling elite. Vital Kamerhe backed Tshisekedi in his successful election campaign in return for his support in the 2023 race. On Saturday, he was sentenced to 20 years hard labour.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canadian prosecutors dropped charges against an indigenous chief who was tackled and punched by police during an incident over an expired license plate, his lawyer said on Wednesday.
Chief Allan Adam of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation alleged this month that Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) beat him in March outside a casino in Fort McMurray, Alberta. He was then charged with resisting arrest and assaulting police, charges that the prosecution dropped in court earlier in the day, Adam's lawyer Brian Beresh said. 
RCMP dashboard video released publicly showed Adam being tackled to the ground and punched once in the face. Earlier, Adam had accused police of harassment, refused orders to stay in his truck multiple times, and at one point, assumed a fighting stance toward police.
""I'm overwhelmed that the charges have been withdrawn,"" Adam said at a news conference, where he called for Canadian policing reforms. ""My wife and I knew we didn't do nothing wrong. It was just for an expired license plate.""
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called the video ""shocking"" and said police discrimination must end. 
Beresh said that the officer who arrested Adam remains on duty. The officer faces a trial on separate charges including assault and mischief from a 2019 incident, he said.
The RCMP, which previously reviewed the video, has said the use of force was reasonable. An independent Alberta agency has begun an investigation.
In a statement, RCMP's Alberta division said that it fulfilled its role of gathering evidence to support charges. It said police comments are limited due to the ongoing independent investigation.

There have been global protests since the death in Minneapolis of a Black man in police custody last month. Two recent deaths in New Brunswick (NYSE:BC) involving police have amplified allegations by indigenous people of mistreatment by Canadian police.

KABUL/KUNDUZ, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Public concern over an escalation in Taliban violence has made it harder to open peace negotiations with the Islamist insurgents, the head of Kabul's negotiating team, Abdullah Abdullah, said on Wednesday.
The comments by the country's former chief executive followed a week during which the government said hundreds of security force personnel had been killed in Taliban attacks.
Abdullah, chairman of the High Council for National Reconciliation, said the rising violence had made ""the political environment very difficult"" in which to begin talks with the Taliban.
""It makes the people extremely concerned,"" he said in an online discussion sponsored by the U.S. Institute of Peace. ""That puts our seriousness in pursuit of the peace process to the test.""
The Taliban deny intensifying attacks.
The insurgents, fighting to reintroduce strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster from power, signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in February designed to lead to peace negotiations with the Afghan government.
Violence fell sharply following the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr last month, triggering hopes the talks could begin.
However, the past week has been alarming for Afghan officials, with more than 400 Taliban attacks nationwide killing 291 security force members, Javid Faisal, spokesman for the government’s National Security Council, said on Monday.
“The Taliban's actions are inconsistent with their rhetoric on peace,” he said.
The main hurdle for the launch of peace talks was disagreement over the release of several hundred Taliban prisoners involved in high-profile attacks against civilians. [nL4N2DW2D8
Afghan officials say they believe the Taliban have intensified their attacks to push the government to release those prisoners and gain the upper hand in negotiations.
A senior government official said the talks, which could have started this month, likely would be delayed because of the spike in attacks.
The northeastern province of Takhar had been hit particularly hard in the last few days, with attacks on security checkpoints and an explosion at a religious school in which seven students died.
Nevertheless, peacemaking efforts were continuing. The U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, met in recent days with the Taliban’s deputy leader Mullah Baradar in the Qatari capital Doha.

LONDON (Reuters) - Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's institute said on Wednesday that China's newfound global clout means the West faces a ""light Cold War"" or at least big power rivalry with the People's Republic.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly confronted China over trade and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, though Beijing has cast Washington's fears over its clout as anti-Chinese hysteria.
The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change said polling showed that China is considered to be a force for bad in the world by more than half of people in the United States, Britain and France, Blair's institute said.
China's economic and military rise over the past 40 years is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union which ended the Cold War. 
""We are now dealing not with a rising China but a risen China and this rise is both inevitable and right,"" Blair, who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007, said in the research.
""Given the deep economic links between China and the West, Cold War analogies are misleading and dangerous,"" said Blair who will speak at a virtual Reuters Newsmaker event on Thursday. https://t.co/3PKjJoKxLK?amp=1
China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy's, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms it has become the world's second-largest economy.
It is now the global leader in a range of 21st Century technologies such as artificial intelligence, regenerative medicine and conductive polymers.
Blair said China's leadership had moved to a much more combative posture globally while consolidating power in the hands of the Communist Party at home. 
The United States is likely to try to contain China's rise, for example by countering it in the South China Sea, or there could even be global or Asian geopolitical contest, his institute said.
Less likely, it said, were cooperation, a full Cold War or a military conflict.
To cope with the ""risen China"", the West should seek to cooperate, compete and, when necessary, confront Beijing.
""The USA, Europe and our Asian allies should stand together so that any partnership with China comes from a position of strength,"" Blair said.

""We will have to live with the reality that we will in some areas have to be prepared to confront China where its actions conflict with the reasonable interests and values of the wider international community,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged Israel on Wednesday to abandon plans to annex settlements in the occupied West Bank, warning this threatened prospects for peace with the Palestinians. 
""If implemented, annexation would constitute a most serious violation of international law, grievously harm the prospect of a two-state solution and undercut the possibilities of a renewal of negotiations,"" Guterres told the U.N. Security Council. 
""I call on the Israeli Government to abandon its annexation plans,"" he said. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet is preparing to start discussions on July 1 on annexation of the West Bank, territory Israel captured in a 1967 war and that Palestinians seek for a state. 
Palestinians vehemently oppose the annexation plan, as do most world powers. Palestinian leaders have also completely rejected a peace proposal unveiled in January by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which Washington would recognize Jewish settlements as part of Israel.
""Should Israel decide to extend its sovereignty, it will be doing so with respect to areas over which it has always maintained a legitimate, historical and legal claim,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told the council. 
Senior aides to Trump began discussions on Tuesday on whether to give Netanyahu a green light for his annexation plan. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that extending Israeli sovereignty was a decision ""for Israelis to make."" 
""I understand that many of you have concerns,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft told the council. ""At the same time, we ask that you also hold the Palestinian leadership accountable for acts they are responsible for.""

Guterres called on the Middle East Quartet of mediators - the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations - ""to take up our mandated mediation role and find a mutually agreeable framework for the parties to re-engage, without preconditions, with us and other key states.""

Speaking at a press conference at the State Department, Pompeo said the ships delivered around 1.5 million barrels of Iranian gasoline and related components, and warned any mariners against doing business with the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose ouster Washington wants.
""As a result of today’s sanctions, these captains’ assets will be blocked. Their careers and prospects will suffer from this designation,"" Pompeo said in a statement later. ""Mariners who are considering work with Iran and Venezuela should understand that aiding these oppressive regimes is simply not worth the risk,"" he said.
The Trump administration, which is seeking both to block Iran's energy trade and bring down Maduro, has threatened reprisals and warned ports, shipping companies and insurers against facilitating the tankers.
The OPEC member's exports are hovering near their lowest levels in more than 70 years and the economy has collapsed, but Maduro has held on - to the frustration of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Iran has since April sent five tankers totalling about 1.5 million barrels to the leftist government of fuel-starved Venezuela, though the shipments have done little to alleviate hours-long lines at gas stations.

""We want the prime minister of Canada, Trudeau, to take part as well,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular morning news conference.
The Canadian government had no immediate comment. Trump on Tuesday said a meeting was likely. A White House official said planning was under way but that a specific date had not yet been set. 
Lopez Obrador in April floated the idea of meeting Trump, but had recently talked down the prospect of an in-person encounter, suggesting they might talk via videoconference.
Some Mexican officials are privately skeptical about the benefits of a meeting with Trump, who is widely disliked in Mexico due to broadsides he fired off in his presidential campaign, calling Mexican migrants rapists and drug traffickers.
The Mexican opposition and even some inside the ruling party have criticized Lopez Obrador for yielding to Trump on migration and security after the U.S. president threatened to slap trade tariffs on Mexico if it did not tighten up its border.
The latest developments came after Trump on Tuesday visited the border wall his government is building and thanked the Mexican leader for deploying more than 20,000 soldiers to prevent immigrants from other countries from crossing into U.S. territory. 
He called Lopez Obrador ""a really great guy,"" and said he expected the Mexican leader to visit the White House ""pretty soon.""
Critics in Mexico see such comments as patronizing and feel a summit puts Lopez Obrador at risk of appearing overly obedient to Trump's demands.
Jorge Castaneda, a former foreign minister of Mexico, called the planned trip a ""dumb idea"" in a recent interview with Reuters and warned that it could additionally be seen as favoring the U.S. president in an election year. 
Lopez Obrador said he wanted the meeting to be about the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal taking effect between the three countries on July 1.
""As it's going to be in Washington, we're waiting for the U.S. government to invite the Canadian government,"" he said. ""And that Canada is in agreement. In any case, we will attend.""

The meeting would not take place on July 1, but could come ""immediately after,"" Lopez Obrador said.

Taiwan's early and effective response has kept the pandemic at bay, with just 446 infections and seven deaths, the majority of cases being imported and having already recovered.
Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said Japan had notified them on Tuesday that the woman, who arrived on the island as a student in late February, tested positive after returning to Japan on June 20, though she was asymptomatic.
More than 100 people who had contact with her in Taiwan have been placed under quarantine, it added.

Taiwan effectively closed its borders to most foreigners in mid-March, and has been extremely cautious about reopening them in case of a second wave of infections.

Life in Taiwan has generally carried on as normal with none of the lockdowns seen in other parts of the world, though the government has encouraged social distancing and face masks are widely worn in public.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Survivors from a boat crammed with over 300 Rohingya Muslim refugees told Malaysian authorities that dozens of their people perished and their bodies were thrown in the sea during a tortuous four-month voyage.
The head of the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) described the ordeal suffered by Rohingya whose damaged boat had made land on the Malaysian island of Langkawi on June 8, with 269 people aboard. 
More than 300 Rohingya had been transferred to this boat from a larger ""motherboat"" half-way through a voyage that began close to the Myanmar-Bangladesh border back in February, MMEA Director General Mohd Zubil Bin Mat Som told a news conference on Wednesday.
""But some died at sea. They were thrown overboard,"" he said, later telling Reuters that those that perished had fallen sick, without elaborating further. 
The fate of close to 500 Rohingya who had remained on ""Motherboat 1"" after the transfer at sea was unknown as authorities have been unable to track the vessel's location, he said. 
The Rohingya had risked the perilous sea journey having lost hope of making a better life in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, where many had found sanctuary after fleeing their homes in Myanmar following a military crackdown in 2017. 
Mainly Muslim Malaysia is home to the second largest number of Rohingya refugees after Bangladesh. 
But in recent weeks, the Southeast Asian country has turned away at least two boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya and undocumented migrants, amid heightened public anger towards foreigners who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and burdening state resources. 
Mohd Zubil said the Rohingya survivors, who have since been detained, had paid traffickers about 2,500 ringgit ($585) up front for the voyage, with a pledge to pay an additional 11,000-13,000 ringgit once they found jobs in Malaysia. 
Most of them were women promised for marriage to Rohingya men in Malaysia, he said. 

Mohd Zubil declined to comment on whether a decision had been made to push the detainees back out to sea once their boat is repaired, a reported proposal that has been criticised by human rights groups.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium will further ease coronavirus lockdown restrictions on July 1, allowing swimming pools, theme parks and party venues to reopen, Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes said on Wednesday, although social distancing measures will remain.
Belgians will be allowed to go to the cinema or theatre again while respecting social distancing rules, and up to 200 people will be allowed to attend indoor events such as religious services, she said.
Up to 400 people will be allowed to attend gatherings outside, including demonstrations, but are not supposed to move around while doing so.
Belgians will be able to meet as many as 15 friends a week - an increase from 10 currently. Social distancing and hygiene measures must be clearly respected. Wearing a mask in public is recommended and may become mandatory if necessary.
""We are still not safe from a rebound of the epidemic,"" Wilmes told a news conference after a meeting of the country's national security council.
""This summer will have a peculiar taste,"" she added.
Large gatherings such as music festivals remain banned and nightclubs will stay closed until at least the end of August.
On July 21, Belgium's national day, the traditional military parade and firework displays will be adapted and there will be no garden party in the royal park.
Wilmes said the July 21 public holiday would be a time to honour healthcare workers and COVID-19 victims.

Belgium, where the European Union and NATO have their headquarters, imposed a lockdown on March 18 due to COVID-19, which has so far claimed 9,722 lives, one of the world's highest fatality figures per capita.

Wong Kwong Yu, also GOME's former chairman, was arrested in 2008 and jailed in 2010, after being sentenced to 14 years for illegal business dealings, insider trading and corporate bribery. Wong, who is also known as Huang Guangyu, was scheduled to be released in February next year after his sentence was shortened. 
The Beijing No.1 Intermediate People's Court decided to release him on parole until Feb. 16 next year, according to a statement posted on the official Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account of the Beijing high court. It gave no further details.
GOME did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
Shares in Hong Kong-listed GOME Retail had jumped 17.4% after local media reported that he had been released earlier in the day, while subsidiary GOME Finance Technology surged 47.3%. 
Wong, who built GOME Electronics into China's biggest appliance retailer, was ranked by the Forbes Rich List as China's richest man with a wealth of 18.1 billion yuan in 2006. By 2019, he had dropped to 280th place on the list, which estimated that his wealth had fallen to 9.4 billion yuan ($1.3 billion). 
Local media have reported that Wong had continued to exchange ideas with GOME's company executives via letters during his imprisonment. 
Like many brick-and-mortar retailers, GOME has been trying to navigate the growing popularity of online shopping. Earlier this year, GOME Retail announced that it had formed strategic partnerships with and received investment from e-commerce platforms  Pinduoduo  (NASDAQ:PDD) and JD (NASDAQ:JD).com.($1 = 7.0729 Chinese yuan renminbi)

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Any Israeli move to annex parts of the West Bank would be ""fatal"" for Middle East peace hopes and must be prevented, if necessary with countermeasures, more than 1,000 lawmakers from across Europe said in a letter to European governments.
The June 23 letter, signed by 1,080 lawmakers from 25 countries and made public on Wednesday, raises parliamentary concerns about U.S. President Donald Trump's Israeli-Palestinian peace plan. The signatories said annexation would break international law.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set July 1 as the date for the start of cabinet discussions on moving forward on annexation, in line with Trump's plan that envisages Israeli sovereignty over 30% of the West Bank and Palestinian statehood under strict conditions. 
""Such a move (annexation) will be fatal to the prospects of Israeli-Palestinian peace and will challenge the most basic norms guiding international relations,"" the letter said.
""Acquisition of territory by force has no place in 2020,"" said the lawmakers, who included members of parliament from Hungary and the Czech Republic, two countries sympathetic to Israel and to Trump's Jan. 28 peace plan.
The plan offers U.S. recognition of Israel's settlements dotted across the West Bank, and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley -- land captured in the 1967 Middle East war and claimed by Palestinians for a future state. 
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and the Palestinians see annexations as an illegal land grab.
The United Nations Security Council has said settlements violate international law. Israel disputes this, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land.
The European lawmakers called for ""commensurate consequences"" if Israel, which has more than 400,000 settlers in the West Bank, went ahead with annexation -- a reference to possible economic, trade or other sanctions.
""Failure to adequately respond would encourage other states with territorial claims,"" the letter said.
Netanyahu has dismissed criticism of the annexation plans. He says that extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank will bring peace closer once critics of the move recognise that hundreds of thousands of settlers in the area will remain under any future deal.

Internal documents and Reuters interviews with more than two dozen diplomats and officials showed there is no clear EU strategy on how to stop Israel's plan or how to respond in a meaningful way if annexation goes ahead.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Pakistan accused old foe India on Wednesday of funding militant groups, a day after the nuclear-armed neighbours said they would expel half the other's embassy staff for the first time in nearly two decades.
Tuesday's announcement of planned expulsions followed weeks of accusations and counter-accusations including espionage and the harassment of rival diplomats as relations plummet.
""India has fomented terrorism inside Pakistan by providing training, financial and material support to terrorist groups,"" Aisha Farooqi, spokeswoman for Pakistan's foreign ministry, said in a statement, following a failed attempt to blacklist an Indian citizen at the United Nations for allegedly providing funding to banned militant groups. 
A spokesman for India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but India has frequently levelled identical accusations at Pakistan. 
Rajeev Bhatia, a fellow at Mumbai-based think tank Gateway House and a veteran Indian diplomat, said the planned ""deep cut"" in embassy staff was significant.
""It's indicative of the dismal condition of the bilateral relationship,"" he said.
Former officials in both countries said the move could eventually lead to the closure of the embassies altogether.
""I see a further downsizing embassy strengths of the two countries in the coming months,"" said Brahma Chellaney, a political analyst at the New Delhi-based Center for Policy Research and a former Indian national security adviser.
""India is even ready to cut diplomatic ties if things continue the way they are.""
In August 2019, Pakistan suspended almost all trade and transport ties with India after New Delhi revoked autonomy and statehood for its portion of the Himalayan Kashmir region - territory also claimed by Islamabad. 
With the latest expulsions, relations are now at an all-time low, outside of the three major wars the two countries have fought since independence from colonial power Britain in 1947, said Asif Yasin Malik, a retired Pakistani general and former defence secretary. 
""They are as bad as they can be,"" he said. ""It is possible we will break diplomatic relations altogether.""

German state bans compatriots from virus-hit town,"BERLIN (Reuters) - At least one German state banned compatriots from two districts that entered a new lockdown due to a coronavirus outbreak, and Austria issued a travel warning, causing anger tinged with resignation among locals.
The roughly 640,000 residents of Guetersloh and Warendorf on Wednesday became the first in Germany to revert to the strict curbs that had been gradually lifted since April, after more than 1,500 workers at the north-west districts' Toennies meatpacking plant tested positive for the virus. 
Bavaria ordered its hotels and B&Bs not to accept guests from Guetersloh. Daily newspaper Bild said seaside state Mecklenburg-Vorpommern would also not welcome tourists from the affected areas, and that Usedom, a Baltic island, would expel them.
Austria warned against travel to the whole state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), putting it in the same category as the epicentre of Italy's outbreak in Lombardy.
NRW premier Armin Laschet urged his regional counterparts to allow in holidaymakers who had tested negative for the virus. ""One thing is not acceptable - people from Guetersloh should not be stigmatized,"" he told the state assembly.
In the town, residents queued up to get tested, hoping for a passport to travel. ""We want to travel to Bavaria on Saturday and it is a condition that you bring a negative corona test,"" said Andreas Tollmann.
Another resident, Manfred Kersting, said he and his family would normally be in Greece now.
""We were thinking that everything was under control..,"" he told Reuters. ""But I should also say that in some measure we have ourselves to blame. We want ultra-cheap meat and are fully aware that it can't be produced at such prices... And this is the result.""
In Wildeshausen in northern Germany, a poultry slaughterhouse was to test its more than 1,000 employees after registering 23 positive coronavirus cases, a local authority spokesman told NDR television.
Epidemiologists say the proximity in which employees work and live in meat plants, plus low temperatures and a damp atmosphere may be factors in exacerbating the risk of the disease spreading.

""In two months I think we'll have a problem if we don't switch on all the alarm sensors now,"" said virologist Christian Drosten, an advisor to Chancellor Angela Merkel.

BEIRUT/AMMAN (Reuters) - Just last year, President Bashar al-Assad seemed on the brink of crowning military victories by easing his diplomatic isolation and recovering more of Syria without a bullet being fired.
Not only had U.S.-allied Kurds invited government forces back to the northeast, but businessmen from the once hostile United Arab Emirates visited Damascus to scout out investment opportunities and regional trade had started to pick up.
Thanks to intervention from Russia and Iran on his behalf, nearly all of Syria's main cities and towns are under government control, with rebels who fought since 2011 to overthrow Assad now confined to a patch of territory near the Turkish frontier.
But today, the mood in Damascus is gloomy.
Assad's hopes of rehabilitation have been put on ice by new U.S. sanctions that will likely scare off all but his closest friends and deter the investment he needs to deliver on promised reconstruction.
The economy, already ravaged by a decade of war, is in deep trouble, hit not only by sanctions but also by the fallout of a financial meltdown in neighbouring Lebanon that has choked off dollars.
While sanctions alone seem unlikely to bring down Assad, experts say they will make it harder for him to consolidate gains and rebuild patronage networks in loyalist areas that paid a heavy price in battle.
With Syria split in three, heavily sanctioned and governed by a pariah, comparisons are being drawn with Iraq in the years between Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled him.
""The cascading effect of the sanctions could undermine Assad's ability to re-extend or maintain control over much of the country. I don't think it will overthrow him in the near-term, but it will restrict his ability to maintain control,"" said David Lesch, a Syria expert and Middle East History professor at Trinity University in Texas.
NO ""MAGIC WAND"" 
The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people and forced more than 11 million from their homes, around half the pre-war population. The once productive economy has suffered hundreds of billions of dollars of destruction.
As Assad steadily recovered ground, Syrians in government areas had been hoping for better times.
But their already battered purchasing power has been demolished this year by a collapse in the Syrian pound. The currency, steady at around 500 to the dollar for several years, began falling last year and hit a low of 3,000 this month.
Assad is counting on the allies that saved him in battle - Russia and Iran - to help him again. But with both sanctioned themselves, neither has the wherewithal to offer the investment Damascus had hoped would flow from countries such as the UAE, China and India, which now run the risk of U.S. sanctions if they deal with Syria.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem told a Damacus news conference on Tuesday the aim of the new U.S. sanctions imposed in a law called the Caesar Act was to create hunger and instability.
Syria could depend on its friends and allies, he said: ""This needs a bit of patience. It's been a week since Caesar was passed. No one has a magic wand to say Russia has to give this or Iran that.""
Syria's allies in an Iran-backed alliance known as the resistance axis are looking for ways around the sanctions, a regional official told Reuters. Iran has provided Syria with credit lines and oil during the war. ""The resistance axis will work on opening gaps,"" the official said.
UNDER PRESSURE
Washington, which once armed some of Assad's enemies, says the goal is to hold Damascus to account for war crimes and deter it from pressing the war. The sanctions exempt humanitarian aid.
Washington will this summer apply ""unprecedented political and economic pressure on the Assad regime to return to the political process"", U.S. special envoy for Syria Joel Rayburn has said. Sanctions are not Washington's only tool.
Though President Donald Trump last year ordered U.S. forces to withdraw, they remain in the east, denying Assad control of oil fields and farmland and providing a security umbrella for a Kurdish-led autonomous zone. Turkish forces in the northwest also obstruct Assad's recovery of the last rebel stronghold.
Assad's grasp over some recovered areas is shaky, including the south which is still restive two years after the defeat of rebels. The dire economy recently triggered protests in Sweida, a loyalist area in the south. 
The financial problems led the state to seize vast assets held by Assad's cousin Rami Makhlouf, formerly a pillar of the ruling elite.
""Assad's strategy and the promise he has been selling to his supporters has always been that we have to win this war militarily ... and be patient and then eventually the Americans and Europeans are going to tire and sanctions would be lifted or eased,"" Aron Lund, a fellow at The Century Foundation, said.

""If poverty turns to extreme poverty and hunger turns to famine over time and the patronage network ... starts to weaken and wither away, we could start to see different threats rising that could be really, really severe for Assad.""

BELFAST (Reuters) - Almost a year after the British parliament voted to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland, one of the last regions in Western Europe with a ban, women there face gaps in provision due to renewed local political roadblocks.
The region's socially conservative health minister Robin Swann has declined to order the health service to provide abortions, commission information campaigns, and also declined to introduce emergency telemedicine measures offered in the rest of the United Kingdom during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Non-government groups and some medical professionals have stepped in to provide information and some services - 129 abortions took place from April 1 when the law changed to May 22, versus eight in the previous two years when terminations were allowed only if a woman's life was at risk.
But the full range of services allowed under the law are not yet available, forcing some women to continue to travel to England or Ireland.
Politicians in the regional mandatory coalition government between pro-British unionists and Irish nationalists are divided - and the British parliament insists that any outcome must include the level of provision required by United Nations Human Rights law - leaving the route to a possible resolution unclear.
""I am gutted by what has been happening since the laws changed in April,"" said Ashleigh Topley, 33, an activist who challenged abortion restrictions through the courts after being denied a termination in 2014 when her daughter suffered a fatal foetal abnormality. 
""I should have not been as naive to think it was a done deal.""
Opponents, including leading Northern Irish politicians, say Britain's parliament went too far last July when it voted to legalise abortion in Northern Ireland and create one of the most liberal abortion regimes in Europe, with abortion without restriction up to 12 weeks. 
""DUCKING OBLIGATIONS""
Health Minister Swann, a unionist who describes himself as ""pro-life"", says he wants Northern Ireland's power-sharing government to be involved in taking action which falls under his department's remit.
In an official letter addressing concerns seen by Reuters, Swann wrote: ""Until such times the commissioning of abortion services has been agreed by the Executive and consulted upon, service will not be widely available."" 
However, Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of the Irish nationalist Sinn Fein party has said the health minister must implement the regulations.
Swann's department declined to comment.
The lack of guidance and training for medical professionals is proving problematic. The Alliance for Choice activist group says it has been contacted by a pro-choice doctor seeking guidance from them in the absence of official information.
A junior doctor working in obstetrics and gynaecology, who does not want to provide abortion services and spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, said he also wants clarity: ""A lack of meaningful conscientious objection to abortion would be extremely disappointing.""
For women seeking an abortion, the hurdle is finding information, with pro- and anti-abortion groups offering advice online in the absence of a state-funded public campaign. 
As a result some women seeking abortion have unwittingly ended up on the premises of anti-abortion groups, said Breedagh Hughes, a former midwife and member of the Northern Ireland abortion and contraceptive task-force.
Some pro-abortion groups are helping women source abortion pills on the Internet, bypassing a requirement to attend a doctor in person, but the NGOs helping them find interim services implemented at a handful of sites by staff whose normal responsibilities are on hold due to COVID-19 fear this capacity is likely to disappear once COVID-19 restrictions ease.

""If the health minister continues to duck his obligations, when the impact of COVID subsides on normal sexual and reproductive services, then women will be sent back to England, to come back home bleeding and in pain,"" Hughes said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. labour agency appealed to governments on Wednesday to support tens of millions of migrant workers forced to return to their homelands due to the coronavirus pandemic only to face unemployment and poverty.
Governments should include returning workers, many of whom had lost jobs overnight, in their social protection measures and reintegrate them into national labour markets, the International Labour Organization said in a report.
""This is a potential crisis within a crisis,"" Manuela Tomei, director of the ILO's conditions of work and equality department, told a news conference. 
There are an estimated 164 million migrant workers worldwide, nearly half of them women, accounting for 4.7% of the global labour force, according to the ILO. Many work in health care, transport, domestic work and agriculture.
Their remittances are key for their families and economies back home, Tomei said, citing a report from the World Bank that a $100 billion drop in remittances was forecast by year-end. 
Nearly a million migrant workers have returned to South Asia alone, said Michelle Leighton, chief of labour migration at ILO. 
They include 500,000 Nepalese who returned from India, more than 250,000 Bangladeshis from the Middle East, 130,000 Indonesians, 100,000 Burmese and 50,000 Filipinos, mostly seafarers, ILO figures show.
Ethiopia expects from 200,000-500,000 migrants to return by year-end, Leighton added.
""There are serious problems with their eligibility for social protection, when they come back, for instance they are not able to take their social security entitlement and that is a function of the need for cooperation between the sending and receiving countries,"" Leighton said.
Large numbers of migrant workers in the Gulf are affected by job losses, with more than 90,000 believed to have left Kuwait since April, said Ryszard Cholewinski of ILO's Beirut office.

But not all left jobless in the Gulf want to repatriate, he said, adding that the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have relaxed restrictions on changing employers.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union (EU) hopes to reopen borders for outsiders from July, but will review individual nations' COVID-19 situation fortnightly, according to diplomats and a document laying out criteria that could keep Americans and Russians out. 
The 27-nation bloc is eager to restart tourism, which has taken a massive hit during the coronavirus pandemic, but fears of second spikes have so far only allowed for partial and patchy reopening of borders with multiple health and security curbs.
Draft recommendations from the EU's current presidency Croatia, seen by Reuters, suggest allowing non-EU nationals in from countries with stable or decreasing infections, and those with a ""comparable or better epidemiological situation"" than Europe.
That epidemiological criteria is defined as between 16-20 new cases of infection reported over 14 days per 100,000 people. 
Nations would also be assessed for their records on testing, contact-tracing and treatment, reliability of data, and reciprocal travel arrangements for EU residents, according to the document, to be debated by envoys in Brussels on Wednesday.
Based on the latest update by the bloc's European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases the proposed methodology could rule out travellers from the United States and Mexico, most of South America, South Africa, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, among others.
The United States, where President Donald Trump banned European visitors at the start of the crisis, has by far the highest number of deaths and cases in the world. [nL4N2AY3AS]
EU diplomats stressed, however, that the travel criteria could still change and that the recommendations will be non-binding. 
""It seems there is a lot of wishful thinking in these recommendations. They are also causing much controversy. July 1 may slip and many countries may go their own way in any case,"" a diplomat said of the proposal by the European Commission.
The proposal, aimed at promoting a coordinated approach, would cover Europe's Schengen zone of normally-invisible borders that brings together most EU states as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein. 

A major achievement of post-World War Two European integration, it has suffered a major setback in recent months as countries brought back border controls to contain the virus.

Yemen’s Saudi-backed government and the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) have agreed on a ceasefire and they will begin talks in Saudi Arabia on implementing a peace deal, the coalition said earlier this week.
The government, based in the southern port of Aden, and the separatists are nominal allies in the Saudi-led coalition, which has been at war against the Iran-aligned Houthis that have controlled north Yemen since 2014.
However, the STC declared self-rule in April, and the two sides have been fighting in Aden and other southern regions, complicating U.N. efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire to the overall conflict.
As part of the deal, a coalition's joint force will deploy to monitor the ceasefire in Abyan province where the fighting has raged over the past six months, along with the neighbouring oil-producing region of Shabwa. 
Troops from the joint force arrived on Wednesday in Abyan, the Saudi-owned television channel al-Arabiya reported, adding that both sides are committed to the ceasefire.
Saudi Arabia is trying to reunite its coalition's factions as violence escalates in the north of the country, with the Houthi group firing ballistic missiles on Riyadh for the first time since the COVID-19 unilateral truce ended last month.
Tensions escalated between the STC and the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi since last week when the separatists seized control of Socotra, a Yemeni island in the Arabian Sea, deposing its governor and driving out forces of the government.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - The pilots of a Pakistan airliner that crashed last month, killing 97 people, were distracted as they talked about the coronavirus pandemic throughout the flight before an abortive landing bid, an initial inquiry report showed on Wednesday.
Presenting the report in parliament, Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said both the pilots and officials at air traffic control did not follow set procedures, leading to the crash. 
The pilots were not ""focused"" because of the coronavirus pandemic, he added, though the aircraft had no technical fault. 
""Unfortunately...the discussion throughout was about corona,"" Khan said, referring to exchanges between the pilot and co-pilot on the cockpit voice recorder that he said showed they were not focused on their tasks.
""Corona was dominant over their mind. Their family was affected, and they were discussing corona.""
The aircraft suffered no technical flaw, Khan said. 
""The unfortunate plane was 100% fit to fly. It had no technical fault at all. The captain and the co-pilot were experienced and medically fit to fly the plane.""
The inquiry report showed the pilot had not mentioned any technical fault during the final approach, Khan added, although the aircraft was flying at 7,220 feet (2,200 m) when 10 miles (16 km) distant from the runway.
""The plane should have been at an altitude of 2,500 feet,"" he said, or the equivalent of 762 m.
Khan added that air traffic control drew the pilot's attention to the irregularity, and advised against landing, urging another go-around instead.
""But, despite this, the pilot ignored the controller's instruction,"" the minister said.
""When they were in landing position, they were warned by the controllers, but he said, 'I'll manage'… and then they started discussing corona again."" 
The Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320 (PA:AIR) from the eastern city of Lahore crashed on May 22 in a residential part of the southern city of Karachi, coming down about a kilometre (0.6 mile) short of the runway on its second attempt to land.
Its flight data recorder showed the landing gear was raised after having been lowered in preparation for landing, Khan said.
""When the aircraft was at 10 nautical miles, the landing gear was lowered,"" he said. ""But it is beyond comprehension that at 5 nautical miles the landing gear was raised again.""

Khan added, ""The last words from the pilot were, 'Oh God, oh God, oh God.'""

Pubs, restaurants and hairdressers will have to keep a record of customers for 21 days to assist the state health service's test and trace operation, which aims to identify and contain any local flare ups of COVID-19 and stop a second wave of infections.
Live performances, including drama, comedy and music, will also not be allowed, the government said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday pubs, restaurants and hotels could reopen in England on July 4, easing the coronavirus lockdown that has all but shut the economy.
He also reduced social distancing from 2 metres to 1 metre, a change that will allow many more pubs and restaurants to reopen. 
The British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) said 75% of pubs in England – 28,000 in total – would be able to reopen. Under 2 metre social distancing rules, only a third of England's pubs – 12,500 – would have been able to reopen.
""As an industry we will be doing everything we can to ensure both our customers and staff are safe in our pubs,"" BBPA Chief Executive Emma McClarkin said.
""We do have significant concerns over the collection and storage of personal customer data when visiting the pub.""
Business Minister Alok Sharma said he would consult with the industry on data regulation, noting that restaurants and hairdressers already kept information when people made bookings. 

""We what to work with the sector, we want to work with trade unions, to make sure we get this absolutely right and I'll be doing that later on this week,"" he told LBC radio on Wednesday.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India reported 16,000 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, its highest daily increase since the outbreak began, and the government called in the army to manage new treatment centres with thousands of additional hospital beds in New Delhi.
At more than 456,000 confirmed coronavirus cases so far, India is the fourth worst hit country in the world, behind the United States, Brazil and Russia, according to a Reuters tally. 
Cases are expected to keep rising as state governments ease restrictions in place since lockdown was first imposed in late March.
New Delhi, the sprawling capital of more than 20 million people, also recorded its highest single-day increase on Wednesday, with more than 3,900 cases. Local government data showed that of the roughly 13,400 beds allocated to COVID-19 patients in the city, around 6,200 were occupied.
The federal home ministry said the city would have around 20,000 additional beds available by next week at temporary facilities run by army doctors and nurses.
These include a 10,000 bed facility hosted at a religious centre and railway coaches turned into wards. 
""Armed Forces personnel have been detailed for providing medical care and attention to COVID-19 patients housed in the Railway coaches in Delhi,"" Home Minister Amit Shah said. 
The city government estimates it will have 550,000 COVID-19 cases by the end of July, and will require 150,000 beds by then.
Delhi's Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said that a new federal government order to take every positive patient to an assessment centre as opposed to evaluating them at home was stretching already limited resources.

""Our ambulance system, our medical system is under pressure now. Today, we are having to take patients in buses,"" Sisodia said, adding that he had written to the federal home ministry. ""This (rule) is creating chaos in New Delhi.""

Taiwan said earlier this month it would set up a dedicated office to help those thinking of leaving Hong Kong as Beijing tightens its grip on the former British colony, including planned new national security legislation.
The new office begins operations on the sensitive date of July 1, the day Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of continued, wide-ranging freedoms under China's ""one country, two systems"" formula.
Taiwan largely closed its borders in mid-March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, meaning anyone who wished to come to the island from Hong Kong would have found it very difficult.
In a statement, Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said that from Monday, Hong Kong people who wish to travel to Taiwan for ""special humanitarian considerations"" would be allowed to apply to be let in, though they will have to prove before they come they do not have the coronavirus.
They will also have to complete 14 days of quarantine, as do all arrivals into Taiwan.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has condemned Taipei's government for offering to help people from Hong Kong, which was hit by months of sometimes violent anti-China, pro-democracy unrest before coronavirus curbs were introduced. China denies meddling in Hong Kong's affairs.
Taiwan has been extremely successful at controlling the spread of the virus, thanks to early and effective prevention work, and has never gone into complete lockdown, unlike other countries around the world.

The epidemic command centre said in a separate statement that from Thursday it will also re-allow some passengers to transit via Taipei's main international airport, though they will not be allowed to leave the airport and will be kept separate from other passengers.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Christmas ballet season is in jeopardy unless the government steps in to help dance companies ride out the coronavirus crisis, the artistic director of one of the country's top ballet corps said.
The most stringent lockdown in peacetime history has left theatres, opera houses and ballet companies without an audience for months, while top ballerinas, used to up to 8 hours of traiusning per day, have struggled to leap and twirl at home.
The English National Ballet, which recently moved to a new 93,000 square foot Bauhaus-style headquarters in east London, said it urgently needed state support to ensure the performing arts industry could survive.
""We have no income,"" Tamara Rojo, 46, a prima ballerina who became artistic director of English National Ballet, told Reuters. ""The creative industries and the performing arts bring billions to the economy, so we are not asking for help forever - just to get back to normal.
""Unless something happens soon, there will be no Christmas shows - Christmas will have to be cancelled,"" said Rojo, a Spanish dancer who was famous for her dazzling fouettes.
The English National Ballet has furloughed 87% of its staff and asked people to take pay cuts of 20%.
With a 2-metre coronavirus social distancing rule, a 2,500-seat theatre can hold just 600 people. With a 1-metre rule, it can hold 900 people. At both levels, any production would be unprofitable.
""Performing to a very reduced audience doesn't make financial sense, so unless there is support from government to do so it is going to be very difficult to have live performances for families at Christmas time,"" said Rojo, who hopes to have a production of Nutcracker in December.
Rojo said the government should extend the furlough and job retention scheme for workers to prevent staff cuts across the industry, look at theatre tax relief and recapitalise the sector.
""We have used all of our capital, all of our reserves to survive this long,"" said Rojo, who has been leading free ballet classes from her kitchen during the lockdown.
""It takes between 6 and 8 hours a day of training and rehearsal to be at your peak performance,"" Rojo said. ""But there is only so much you can do in your kitchen.""
She hopes to bring dancers back on July 6, but it will take 12 weeks for them to regain their strength.

Rojo had been planning to choreograph her first production - an adaptation of Raymonda.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's appetite for salmon and other seafood has crashed this month, after a resurgence in coronavirus infections in Beijing was traced to chopping boards for imported salmon in a wholesale food market in the capital. 
Exporters all the way to Europe are feeling the pinch as the virus scare prompts supermarkets and e-commerce players such as Taobao, JD.com and Meituan in China, the world's top consumer of frozen and fresh seafood, to slash salmon sales.
""I have cleaned out frozen fish from the refrigerator at home and won't buy more,"" said Ma Xuan, a government employee.
""I will wait till the origin of this new wave of virus is clear,"" the 40-year-old said. ""Maybe I overreacted, but who knows? I don't want to risk the health of my family."" 
 Alibaba 's (N:BABA) Taobao and JD.com (HK:9618) (O:JD) have cut imported salmon sales in Beijing, Reuters checks show, while food delivery giant  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690) said it has pulled all salmon products from its platform nationally. 
Meituan Grocery said it had stepped up examination of raw and fresh products, adding searches for Japanese cuisine and seafood on the Meituan app had plummeted across China since June 12, a day after the recent Beijing market outbreak started.
Ele.me, Alibaba's food delivery arm, has also halted sales of all imported seafood in Beijing.
JD.com and Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment.
Panic about the virus has extended to other farm products like beef and mutton, forcing some grocers to pull them from shelves.
China's soybean buyers have asked exporters to guarantee their cargoes are not contaminated, while overseas meat and fruit suppliers said China's customs had asked them to sign declarations ensuring the safety of their shipments. 
'HOPE IS LIKE A SOAP BUBBLE'
Sushi and hotpot restaurants in Beijing that saw business pick up after virus-related curbs were eased in April are once again struggling amid the renewed worries. 
Barron Qin, owner of a fish hotpot restaurant called Yufu Yuzai, said customers had been lining up everyday but now the restaurant was half empty despite not serving salmon.
""My hope is like a soap bubble, burst by the new round of the outbreak,"" he said. 
More than 250 people have been infected in Beijing in the past two weeks, the city's worst outbreak since the virus first emerged in the central city of Wuhan in late 2019.
""Seafood consumption in June will collapse due to public panic that seafood may be the culprit for the second wave of virus,"" said Dan Wang, an Economist Intelligence Unit analyst.
She expects China's seafood imports to drop 3% this year.
China imported 4.44 million tonnes of seafood last year, worth 106 billion yuan ($15 billion), from suppliers including Russia, Peru and Vietnam, customs data shows.

Norway's Bravo Seafood said its exports to China initially looked promising, but the Beijing cases had changed everything despite Chinese and Norwegian authorities concluding salmon from Norway was not the source of the coronavirus.
""We have not even sent one piece of salmon to China since June 13,"" Bravo's Asia sales director Chen Qiao said. 

""No one dares to buy salmon now no matter the origin. We expect minimal sales to China in the next one to two months.""

BURNLEY, England (Reuters) - At the peak of Britain's coronavirus outbreak in April when hundreds were dying each day from COVID-19, Kirsty Anderson was rushed to hospital to give birth to her baby son who had not been due to arrive for another three months.
Just two hours after she went into labour, baby Theo was born weighing just 2lb 4oz (1 kg) at the intensive care unit at Burnley General Hospital's maternity wing in northern England.
Father Leon Stubbs, 35, was only allowed to see Kirsty 20 minutes beforehand and after Theo's birth, they had just an hour together before he had to go home.
In the weeks following the stressful events in the early hours of April 20, the parents then had to take turns to visit their son as he grew stronger in an incubator.
It was during this time that a Reuters photographer took a picture of tiny Theo with his limbs outstretched being handed to his mother by a nurse wearing gloves and mask, an image that featured prominently in British newspapers and on online news sites globally.
It was an absolutely horrendous time, Kirsty, 33, recalled, and due to COVID-19 the family could not see him together.
But this week, Theo - now weighing in at 6lb 4oz - was finally allowed to go home to meet his older brother, 16-month-old Arlo, for the first time in person.
""He's fabulous, he's done so well,"" Kirsty told Reuters as she was leaving the hospital with Theo and Leon. ""Amazing, absolutely amazing - I just can't wait for his brother to see him.""
As staff who had looked after Theo waved them farewell, a tearful Kirsty paid tribute to what they had done for her. 

""I can't thank them enough,"" she said. ""They're here to sort the babies out but they get you through it as well. I honestly don't have enough words to thank them, they're amazing.""

The confrontation between arch foes Tehran and Washington has worsened since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
Iran has refused to hold any talks with the United States, which is trying to force Tehran to negotiate a new deal, unless Washington lifts sanctions on Tehran and returns to the original agreement. 
In a tweet in early June, Trump repeated Washington's call for a new deal with Tehran aimed at putting stricter limits on Tehran's nuclear work, curbs its ballistic missile program and ends its decades of regional proxy wars.
""We have no problem with talks with the U.S., but only if Washington fulfils its obligations under the nuclear deal, apologies and compensates Tehran for its withdrawal from the 2015 deal,"" Rouhani said in a televised speech.
""But we know these calls for talks with Tehran are just words and lies,"" he added.
In retaliation for Washington's 'maximum pressure' policy, Iran has gradually scaled back its nuclear commitments, a process Tehran says is reversible if the European parties to the pact carry out their promises to shield Iran's economy from U.S. penalties.
""The Europeans have failed to fulfil their promises. They should carry out their obligations,"" Rouhani said.
Rouhani also blasted a resolution by the U.N. nuclear watchdog passed on Friday that called on Iran to stop denying the agency access to two suspected former sites and to cooperate fully with it. 

""Iran is ready to cooperate with the (International Atomic Energy Agency) IAEA under law,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin will review a spectacular Red Square military parade later on Wednesday on the eve of a nationwide vote that could extend his rule until 2036, a patriotic display critics say is designed to lift his lower than usual ratings.
The parade, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union's World War Two victory over the Nazis, was postponed from May 9 because of the novel coronavirus outbreak and critics say it is irresponsible to go ahead with it now.
The Kremlin has dismissed that however, saying new daily infections, though still in the thousands, are on the wane, especially in the Russian capital, the original epicentre of the outbreak, and that all safety precautions will be taken. 
Opening a military cathedral on Monday, Putin said the Soviet wartime victory remained a touchstone for modern Russia, calling it a sacred memory.
""It's always with us and gives us strength, strength to serve our country and moral messages which we do not have the right to resile from and will never do so,"" said Putin.
The results of a survey released by state pollster VTsIOM on Tuesday showed that 95% of Russians regarded the 1945 Soviet victory as the most important event of the 20th century for Russia.
The vote from June 25 until July 1 on constitutional changes, including an amendment that would allow Putin two more six-year terms as president if re-elected. Current constitutional limits bar him from seeking re-election when his mandate ends in 2024.
Experts from state pollster VTsIOM have forecast that 67-71% of voters will endorse the changes. Kremlin critics say the vote is a sham they fear will be falsified.
Putin's approval rating is 59%, according to Levada, an independent pollster whose research the Kremlin has said it is not inclined to trust. Though high by most countries' standards, it is at its lowest since 1999.
Polls show people's willingness to protest has risen as lower oil prices and a prolonged lockdown have battered the economy, unemployment has risen, and a Kremlin plan to reverse years of falling real wages has been knocked off course.
More than 14,000 troops, over 200 armoured vehicles and 75 aircraft will take part in Wednesday's parade, as well as representatives from 13 other countries.
Sergei Aleksashenko, an economist who has been critical of Putin, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station on Tuesday that the Russian leader was determined to hold the parade despite the pandemic.

""Vladimir Putin believes that the parade is a reaffirmation of his greatness, the greatness of the country and of our historical memory,"" said Aleksashenko.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo's new coronavirus cases climbed to 55 on Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, the highest tally in 1-1/2 months after a cluster of infections was found at an unnamed office in the Japanese capital.
The metropolis, with a population of 14 million, has sought to keep new cases below 20 a day after Japan lifted a state of emergency on May 25. Tokyo has said it could re-impose restrictions if the figure crept up to 50 or more - something that last happened on May 5.
Speaking before the latest figure was reported, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike had warned of a ""large number"" on Wednesday as more positive test results followed a cluster of seven infections previously found at the office.
""Clusters in the workplace have become a big problem lately"" as people have emerged from the capital's 'Stay Home' initiative, she told reporters earlier. 
""Businesses like eateries are taking steps to create partitions and such, but it's difficult to see what kind of precautions are being taken at offices,"" Koike said.
""The latest case tells us that offices can become clusters too, so we'd like everyone to think again about what a new normal for the workplace should look like.""
Koike said that in addition to the latest results from the office, more than 10 cases emerged from group testing in Shinjuku - an area known for its nightlife - on Wednesday.
Still, Tokyo - like the rest of Japan - has been spared the kind of explosive outbreak seen elsewhere, with some 5,800 coronavirus cases and 323 deaths so far. 

In all of Japan, about 18,000 have tested positive and 965 have died so far from the COVID-19 illness. Globally, more than 9.26 million people have tested positive and some 475,880 have died.

Vietnam and its neighbours have for years been involved in disputes over fishing in the resource-rich South China Sea, most of which is claimed by China. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan have overlapping claims. 
Malaysia usually turned away Vietnamese boats found fishing in its waters but will now arrest them after higher numbers were tracked following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in mid-March, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) director general Mohd Zubil Mat Som said. 
Coastguard officials would also fire warning shots towards Vietnamese boats which carried out dangerous manoeuvres to escape or failed to comply with the MMEA's directives, he said. 
""They have been a constant thorn in our side and we want them out,"" he told a news conference, adding that authorities were also seeking higher penalties for those charged.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Since March 19, the MMEA has recorded 88 cases involving Vietnamese boats, Mohd Zubil said.
Authorities have also detained a Thailand-registered tanker suspected of supplying fuel, food and other items to Vietnamese fishing vessels last week, he added.

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Unwanted for public spaces elsewhere in Taiwan, some 200 statues of the late autocratic leader Chiang Kai-shek stand in the quiet sanctuary of a park surrounding his mausoleum in the north of the island.
Chiang Kai-shek was lauded in life as an anti-communist hero, especially in the United States, and there are still more than 1,000 Chiang statues in public places around Taiwan. But attitudes towards him on the proudly democratic island have become more conflicted.
Chiang's defeated Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil in 1949.
During the Cold War, he was backed strongly by the United States, and some Taiwanese still view him positively for standing up to Mao Zedong's communism.
But, many others revile him as a despot who imprisoned and killed opponents during a reign of terror. When he died in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo took over and began tentative steps towards more political openness.
Yvon Lin, 36, a Taipei city councillor for the small New Power Party, which supports Taiwan's formal independence, said the question of what to do with statues of the Chiangs was problematical as they were such polarising figures.
""Taiwan is quite special in that around half of people really support what the two Chiangs did in the past, so if we want to get rid of the symbols of authoritarianism these people could come out and protest,"" Lin told Reuters.
In the past few years some statues have been daubed with paint, often around the anniversary of a 1947 anti-government uprising, generally seen as the start of Chiang's ""white terror"" campaign against dissent in Taiwan.
His Nationalists took control of the island from Japan in 1945 at the end of World War Two.
Nowadays, at the mausoleum in Taoyuan, outside Taipei, tourists pose for pictures as they gather round the statues depicting Chiang in various roles, from kindly father figure, to wise scholar, to military commander. 
Just as the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a debate in Western countries over what to do with statues of people connected with the slave trade, Taiwan has also been coming to terms with a checkered history.
Under 2017's Act on Promoting Transitional Justice, symbols of Taiwan's authoritarian era are supposed to be removed, renamed or ""handled in other ways"". 
Yet enforcement is not specified, leaving local governments to make their own decisions.
Taiwan independence protesters threw red paid on Chiang's sarcophagus at the mausoleum two years ago, something visitor Lin He-sheng expressed regret about.

""I don't think there's a need to be like that with someone who has died,"" Lin told Reuters at the statue park. ""You should look at his positive side. A person is not necessarily only about the negative.""
