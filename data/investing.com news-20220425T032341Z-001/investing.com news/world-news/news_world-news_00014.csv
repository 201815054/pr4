While many were trying to guard their property, about 800 people had been evacuated since the rains began on Monday, said Interior Minister Arsen Avakov who was visiting the disaster zone with Prime Minister Denys Shmygal.
About 5,000 houses in 187 villages remained flooded as of Wednesday morning, according to an emergency service report. 
Footage from a regional administration and on social media showed raging mountain rivers, a partially-submerged village, and fields and roads covered by water. 
Calling it the most powerful flooding in many years, the interior ministry said in a statement that four helicopters, one airplane and 150 soldiers had been sent to the zone.

BURNLEY, England (Reuters) - At the peak of Britain's coronavirus outbreak in April when hundreds were dying each day from COVID-19, Kirsty Anderson was rushed to hospital to give birth to her baby son who had not been due to arrive for another three months.
Just two hours after she went into labour, baby Theo was born weighing just 2lb 4oz (1 kg) at the intensive care unit at Burnley General Hospital's maternity wing in northern England.
Father Leon Stubbs, 35, was only allowed to see Kirsty 20 minutes beforehand and after Theo's birth, they had just an hour together before he had to go home.
In the weeks following the stressful events in the early hours of April 20, the parents then had to take turns to visit their son as he grew stronger in an incubator.
It was during this time that a Reuters photographer took a picture of tiny Theo with his limbs outstretched being handed to his mother by a nurse wearing gloves and mask, an image that featured prominently in British newspapers and on online news sites globally.
It was an absolutely horrendous time, Kirsty, 33, recalled, and due to COVID-19 the family could not see him together.
But this week, Theo - now weighing in at 6lb 4oz - was finally allowed to go home to meet his older brother, 16-month-old Arlo, for the first time in person.
""He's fabulous, he's done so well,"" Kirsty told Reuters as she was leaving the hospital with Theo and Leon. ""Amazing, absolutely amazing - I just can't wait for his brother to see him.""
As staff who had looked after Theo waved them farewell, a tearful Kirsty paid tribute to what they had done for her. 

""I can't thank them enough,"" she said. ""They're here to sort the babies out but they get you through it as well. I honestly don't have enough words to thank them, they're amazing.""

The confrontation between arch foes Tehran and Washington has worsened since 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
Iran has refused to hold any talks with the United States, which is trying to force Tehran to negotiate a new deal, unless Washington lifts sanctions on Tehran and returns to the original agreement. 
In a tweet in early June, Trump repeated Washington's call for a new deal with Tehran aimed at putting stricter limits on Tehran's nuclear work, curbs its ballistic missile program and ends its decades of regional proxy wars.
""We have no problem with talks with the U.S., but only if Washington fulfils its obligations under the nuclear deal, apologies and compensates Tehran for its withdrawal from the 2015 deal,"" Rouhani said in a televised speech.
""But we know these calls for talks with Tehran are just words and lies,"" he added.
In retaliation for Washington's 'maximum pressure' policy, Iran has gradually scaled back its nuclear commitments, a process Tehran says is reversible if the European parties to the pact carry out their promises to shield Iran's economy from U.S. penalties.
""The Europeans have failed to fulfil their promises. They should carry out their obligations,"" Rouhani said.
Rouhani also blasted a resolution by the U.N. nuclear watchdog passed on Friday that called on Iran to stop denying the agency access to two suspected former sites and to cooperate fully with it. 

""Iran is ready to cooperate with the (International Atomic Energy Agency) IAEA under law,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin will review a spectacular Red Square military parade later on Wednesday on the eve of a nationwide vote that could extend his rule until 2036, a patriotic display critics say is designed to lift his lower than usual ratings.
The parade, to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union's World War Two victory over the Nazis, was postponed from May 9 because of the novel coronavirus outbreak and critics say it is irresponsible to go ahead with it now.
The Kremlin has dismissed that however, saying new daily infections, though still in the thousands, are on the wane, especially in the Russian capital, the original epicentre of the outbreak, and that all safety precautions will be taken. 
Opening a military cathedral on Monday, Putin said the Soviet wartime victory remained a touchstone for modern Russia, calling it a sacred memory.
""It's always with us and gives us strength, strength to serve our country and moral messages which we do not have the right to resile from and will never do so,"" said Putin.
The results of a survey released by state pollster VTsIOM on Tuesday showed that 95% of Russians regarded the 1945 Soviet victory as the most important event of the 20th century for Russia.
The vote from June 25 until July 1 on constitutional changes, including an amendment that would allow Putin two more six-year terms as president if re-elected. Current constitutional limits bar him from seeking re-election when his mandate ends in 2024.
Experts from state pollster VTsIOM have forecast that 67-71% of voters will endorse the changes. Kremlin critics say the vote is a sham they fear will be falsified.
Putin's approval rating is 59%, according to Levada, an independent pollster whose research the Kremlin has said it is not inclined to trust. Though high by most countries' standards, it is at its lowest since 1999.
Polls show people's willingness to protest has risen as lower oil prices and a prolonged lockdown have battered the economy, unemployment has risen, and a Kremlin plan to reverse years of falling real wages has been knocked off course.
More than 14,000 troops, over 200 armoured vehicles and 75 aircraft will take part in Wednesday's parade, as well as representatives from 13 other countries.
Sergei Aleksashenko, an economist who has been critical of Putin, told the Ekho Moskvy radio station on Tuesday that the Russian leader was determined to hold the parade despite the pandemic.

""Vladimir Putin believes that the parade is a reaffirmation of his greatness, the greatness of the country and of our historical memory,"" said Aleksashenko.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo's new coronavirus cases climbed to 55 on Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, the highest tally in 1-1/2 months after a cluster of infections was found at an unnamed office in the Japanese capital.
The metropolis, with a population of 14 million, has sought to keep new cases below 20 a day after Japan lifted a state of emergency on May 25. Tokyo has said it could re-impose restrictions if the figure crept up to 50 or more - something that last happened on May 5.
Speaking before the latest figure was reported, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike had warned of a ""large number"" on Wednesday as more positive test results followed a cluster of seven infections previously found at the office.
""Clusters in the workplace have become a big problem lately"" as people have emerged from the capital's 'Stay Home' initiative, she told reporters earlier. 
""Businesses like eateries are taking steps to create partitions and such, but it's difficult to see what kind of precautions are being taken at offices,"" Koike said.
""The latest case tells us that offices can become clusters too, so we'd like everyone to think again about what a new normal for the workplace should look like.""
Koike said that in addition to the latest results from the office, more than 10 cases emerged from group testing in Shinjuku - an area known for its nightlife - on Wednesday.
Still, Tokyo - like the rest of Japan - has been spared the kind of explosive outbreak seen elsewhere, with some 5,800 coronavirus cases and 323 deaths so far. 

In all of Japan, about 18,000 have tested positive and 965 have died so far from the COVID-19 illness. Globally, more than 9.26 million people have tested positive and some 475,880 have died.

Vietnam and its neighbours have for years been involved in disputes over fishing in the resource-rich South China Sea, most of which is claimed by China. Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Taiwan have overlapping claims. 
Malaysia usually turned away Vietnamese boats found fishing in its waters but will now arrest them after higher numbers were tracked following the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in mid-March, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency (MMEA) director general Mohd Zubil Mat Som said. 
Coastguard officials would also fire warning shots towards Vietnamese boats which carried out dangerous manoeuvres to escape or failed to comply with the MMEA's directives, he said. 
""They have been a constant thorn in our side and we want them out,"" he told a news conference, adding that authorities were also seeking higher penalties for those charged.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Since March 19, the MMEA has recorded 88 cases involving Vietnamese boats, Mohd Zubil said.
Authorities have also detained a Thailand-registered tanker suspected of supplying fuel, food and other items to Vietnamese fishing vessels last week, he added.

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Unwanted for public spaces elsewhere in Taiwan, some 200 statues of the late autocratic leader Chiang Kai-shek stand in the quiet sanctuary of a park surrounding his mausoleum in the north of the island.
Chiang Kai-shek was lauded in life as an anti-communist hero, especially in the United States, and there are still more than 1,000 Chiang statues in public places around Taiwan. But attitudes towards him on the proudly democratic island have become more conflicted.
Chiang's defeated Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil in 1949.
During the Cold War, he was backed strongly by the United States, and some Taiwanese still view him positively for standing up to Mao Zedong's communism.
But, many others revile him as a despot who imprisoned and killed opponents during a reign of terror. When he died in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo took over and began tentative steps towards more political openness.
Yvon Lin, 36, a Taipei city councillor for the small New Power Party, which supports Taiwan's formal independence, said the question of what to do with statues of the Chiangs was problematical as they were such polarising figures.
""Taiwan is quite special in that around half of people really support what the two Chiangs did in the past, so if we want to get rid of the symbols of authoritarianism these people could come out and protest,"" Lin told Reuters.
In the past few years some statues have been daubed with paint, often around the anniversary of a 1947 anti-government uprising, generally seen as the start of Chiang's ""white terror"" campaign against dissent in Taiwan.
His Nationalists took control of the island from Japan in 1945 at the end of World War Two.
Nowadays, at the mausoleum in Taoyuan, outside Taipei, tourists pose for pictures as they gather round the statues depicting Chiang in various roles, from kindly father figure, to wise scholar, to military commander. 
Just as the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a debate in Western countries over what to do with statues of people connected with the slave trade, Taiwan has also been coming to terms with a checkered history.
Under 2017's Act on Promoting Transitional Justice, symbols of Taiwan's authoritarian era are supposed to be removed, renamed or ""handled in other ways"". 
Yet enforcement is not specified, leaving local governments to make their own decisions.
Taiwan independence protesters threw red paid on Chiang's sarcophagus at the mausoleum two years ago, something visitor Lin He-sheng expressed regret about.

""I don't think there's a need to be like that with someone who has died,"" Lin told Reuters at the statue park. ""You should look at his positive side. A person is not necessarily only about the negative.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Political activists from several groups across Thailand staged peaceful protests around the country on Wednesday to mark the anniversary of the 1932 revolt which ended the absolute monarchy in the country.
The demonstrations come as more Thais are speaking out against a military-dominated political system and as monuments to the establishment of democracy have been disappearing https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-democracy-monuments/in-thailand-its-statues-of-democracy-leaders-that-are-disappearing-idUSKBN23V024 from public spaces.
The 1932 revolt, led by a group of civilian bureaucrats and military officers known as the People's Party, has in recent years emerged as a symbolic date for pro-democracy groups.
Thailand was under military rule for five years until an election last year that kept former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha in power in a vote that opposition parties said was rigged. Prayuth and Thai courts reject claims the election was manipulated.
At one of the protests at Bangkok's Democracy Monument, 30-40 activists played a large-screen video re-enacting the speech made by People's Party leaders after they toppled the government of King Prajadhipok and ushered in Thailand's first constitution.
""Eighty-eight years ago today around dawn, the People's Party seized power and changed the system of governance to a democracy,"" said pro-democracy activist Anon Nampa.
At another protest planned at parliament, another group of activists will demand amendments to the current constitution written by the recent junta.
""We want to use the revolt anniversary to make our point about the problematic nature of the current constitution drafted by the military,"" said Anusorn Unno of the Committee Campaigning for a People's Constitution.
Police say they are monitoring protests in at least 12 provinces. Thailand has banned large public gatherings during the coronavirus emergency, but authorities did not block the demonstrations. 
In remarks on Tuesday, Prayuth did not directly address the protests, but he told people ""don’t violate the monarchy and don’t violate the law.""

While Thailand is officially a constitutional monarchy, King Maha Vajiralongkorn wields immense power and insulting him is a crime punishable by up to 15 years in prison.

Lee Hsien Yang, the son of Singapore's modern-day founder, Lee Kuan Yew, has been embroiled in a bitter dispute with his brother over his late father's house. He told Reuters he had joined the new Progress Singapore Party (PSP). 
Lee has criticised his brother Lee Hsien Loong's People's Action Party (PAP), which their father founded and which has governed the city-state since its independence in 1965.
Last year, Hsien Yang said that the PAP had ""lost its way"" and that he ""supported the principles and values of the Progress Singapore Party.""
The PSP is led by Tan Cheng Bock, a former PAP lawmaker who shot to prominence by nearly defeating a candidate backed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in the 2011 presidential race.
""We will see,"" Lee Hsien Yang replied when asked whether he would stand as a candidate. 
PSP said on Twitter that it welcomed Lee Hsien Yang as a member.

""It's time for change,"" it added.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A public rift between the heirs of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's modern day founder, has shot to the fore with the prospect of his two sons squaring off at a July 10 general election.
Lee Hsien Yang on Wednesday formally joined a new opposition party competing against his brother Lee Hsien Loong's People's Action Party, which has ruled the city-state since its independence since 1965.
The move comes amid a long-standing and bitter dispute between the siblings centred around what to do with their late father's house - demolish it, or let the government decide whether to make it a heritage landmark.
On one side of the dispute stands the eldest son, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, 68, who believes the government must decide what should be done.
On the other are his siblings - Lee Hsien Yang and his sister Lee Wei Ling.
They say their father's will stated the house should eventually be demolished after his death and they have accused Prime Minister Lee of wanting to preserve the house to build his own political capital.
""His popularity is inextricably linked to Lee Kuan Yew's legacy,"" they said in a 2017 statement.
Prime Minister Lee has said his father was prepared to consider alternatives for the property if the government decided to gazette the site and that he has recused himself from government discussions on the matter.
Lee Hsien Yang last year said the PAP had ""lost its way"" and threw his support behind the newly-formed Progress Singapore Party, led by a former PAP lawmaker.
While he officially joined the party on Wednesday, he has not confirmed if he will run as a candidate in the upcoming poll. The deadline for nominations is June 30. 
THE HOUSE, MORE THAN JUST A HOME?
Lee Kuan Yew, popularly known as LKY, moved into the five-bedroom house at 38 Oxley Road in 1945. He led the country for three decades and it was from his home that his People's Action Party, which has governed since independence and never seen its vote share drop below 60%, was conceived.
A government panel set up to consider the future of the house said in a 2018 report that a future government should make the final decision. It laid out three options: preserving the house as a national monument, preserving part of it, or demolishing it.
The historic property was valued by estate agents at about S$24 million ($17 million) in 2017.
The family insists the feud is not about the money.
WHO OWNS IT?
The house is owned by the younger brother, Hsien Yang, and his unmarried sister, Wei Ling, lives there. Nothing can happen to the house until she chooses to move out.
Prime Minister Lee says his father bequeathed the property to him, and he later sold it to Hsien Yang at a fair market valuation. The proceeds were donated to charity.
WHAT DID LKY WANT?
LKY, who died in 2015, stated publicly that he wanted the house to be demolished as he did not like the idea of tourists visiting it and that it would cost a lot to preserve.
He also said so in his will, but added that if that could not happen, then he wanted it closed to everyone, except family and descendants.
Lee Hsien Yang's wife, lawyer Lee Suet Fern, was earlier this year found guilty by a disciplinary tribunal of professional misconduct over her involvement in preparing his will.
Lee Suet Fern said she disagreed with the tribunal's findings and would fight the allegations in court.

LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - One of three officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in a hail of gunfire when drug investigators burst into her home in Louisville, Kentucky, three months ago was dismissed from the police department on Tuesday.
Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed on March 13 after the officers entered her apartment bearing a ""no-knock"" arrest warrant. 
In a termination notice issued after an administrative hearing, Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder wrote that detective Brett Hankison ""displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life"" when he ""wantonly and blindly fired"" 10 rounds into Taylor's home.
Schroeder said the gunshots were fired through a patio door and window covered with material obscuring Hankison's line of sight, preventing him from knowing whether anyone was inside the apartment, let alone whether they posed a threat. Some of the rounds he fired flew into the unit next door, the chief wrote.
Two other officers involved in the raid remain on administrative reassignment. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three.
The notice also said Hankison, who joined the department in 2003, was disciplined in 2019 for reckless conduct that injured an innocent person. 
Taylor's slaying, which returned to prominence following the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, has become a rallying cry in nationwide protests against police brutality and racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.
In the immediate aftermath of the Taylor killing, police said the officers had knocked on the door before forcing entry and were shot at by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. One officer was struck in the leg, and all three returned fire, hitting Taylor at least eight times, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.

Walker was charged with attempted murder and assault, but prosecutors later dropped the charges, the Courier-Journal reported.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has decided to suspend military action plans against South Korea, the official KCNA news agency reported on Wednesday, as a report suggested North Korean troops were taking down loudspeakers recently reinstalled at the fortified border.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un presided over a video conference meeting of the ruling party's Central Military Commission on Tuesday, where members ""took stock of the prevailing situation"" before deciding to suspend the military plans, the report said, without elaborating.
The committee also discussed documents outlining measures for ""further bolstering the war deterrent of the country,"" KCNA reported.
Political tensions between the rival Koreas have been rising over Pyongyang's objections to plans by defector-led groups in the South to send propaganda leaflets into the North.
North Korea claims the moves violate an agreement between the two aimed at preventing military confrontation, and accused the defectors of insulting the dignity of North Korea's supreme leadership.
North Korea's military was seen removing about 10 loudspeakers near the demilitarised zone (DMZ) on Wednesday, just days after they were seen reinstalling around 20 of the devices, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported, citing unnamed military sources. About 40 such systems were taken down after the two Koreas signed an accord in 2018 to cease ""all hostile acts"".
A spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North, said it is monitoring the situation and had no change in its stance that inter-Korean agreements should be kept.
ROLLERCOASTER OF TENSIONS
Kim Jong Un's decision to suspend the unspecified military actions may represent a reprieve from weeks of increasingly provocative moves by North Korea.
In recent weeks, the North blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border and declared an end to dialogue with the South.
Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned last week of retaliatory measures against South Korea that could involve the military, without elaborating.
The General Staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA) later said it had been studying an ""action plan"" that included sending troops into joint tourism and economic zones, reoccupying border guard posts that had been abandoned under the 2018 pact, taking steps to ""turn the front line into a fortress,"" and supporting plans for the North to send its own propaganda leaflets into the South.
Jenny Town, with the U.S.-based North Korea-monitoring website 38 North, said anti-South Korea rhetoric from the North over the past week had left room for flexibility, but it was still unclear where the latest moves will lead.
""Overall, it doesn’t appear that the North has necessarily wanted to be overly provocative,"" she said. ""While it seems set on reversing the measures taken in the inter-Korean agreements -in a dramatic fashion - so far, the rhetoric has already been milder since the demolition of the liaison office.""

The KCNA report sent shares of South Korea's defence-related firms, which have risen during the heightened tensions, into a tailspin early on Wednesday. Victek Co Ltd, Speco and Firstec Co Ltd tumbled more than 20% each, while the benchmark KOSPI and junior KOSDAQ was trading up 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively, as of 0032 GMT.

The annual Lowy Institute Poll also found rising support for Australia's security alliance with the United States, up six points to 78% this year, even though U.S. President Donald Trump was unpopular with Australians.
""Trust in our largest trading partner - China - has declined precipitously. Confidence in China's leader Xi Jinping, has fallen even further,"" wrote Lowy Institute executive director Michael Fullilove.
In total, 94 percent of respondents thought the Australian government should work to reduce its economic reliance on China by diversifying its trade.
Amid the novel coronavirus pandemic, Australians were less trusting of most countries around the world, and only half of Australians said they felt safe.
Diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Canberra have worsened since Australia called for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the new coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan. 
China has banned some Australian beef imports and imposed tariffs on Australian barley. It has also urged Chinese students and tourists to avoid Australia.
While Australians believed the U.S. alliance was important for Australia's security, Fullilove said ""trust in the United States has stagnated, and few Australians have confidence in President Trump"". 
Fifty-one percent of respondents trusted the United States to act responsibly in the world, steady with last year and down from 61% in 2017.
The survey found 55% rated Australia's relationship with the United States as more important than the relationship with China, compared to 40% who chose China.

The number of Australians who saw China as an economic partner fell to 55% in 2020, significantly down from a reading of 82% in 2018.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Over half the member states of the International Criminal Court defended the world's only permanent war crimes tribunal on Tuesday in a diplomatic response to a U.S. threat of sanctions against its employees earlier this month.
A joint statement drafted by Costa Rica and Switzerland was backed by 67 out of 123 of the ICC's members, the first effort to show a united front among members from all continents.
""We reconfirm our unwavering support for the court as an independent and impartial judicial institution,"" it said. The ICC was an ""integral part"" of the international judicial order and ""a central institution in the fight against impunity"". 
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration says it opposes the ICC because it fears what it calls politically motivated prosecutions of the United States and ally Israel.
Trump signed an executive order two weeks ago authorising the blocking of assets and travel restrictions against ICC employees involved in an investigation into alleged war crimes in Afghanistan by U.S. forces.
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians by Taliban insurgents, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and, to a lesser extent, by U.S. forces and the CIA. The ICC investigation was given the go-ahead in March.
In announcing Trump's executive order, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""We cannot, we will not stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court."" 
Richard Dicker, international justice director at Human Rights Watch, said the joint statement ""sends the crucial message that ICC member states ""have the court’s back"" and ""will not be cowed in their commitment to seeing justice.""
“This statement is highly significant because ICC member states globally, including key U.S. allies, are speaking up.""
The ICC is a court of last resort, stepping in only when a state is unable or unwilling to prosecute grave crimes.

(Reuters) - The wife of a Canadian arrested in Beijing after Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was detained in Vancouver asked on Tuesday that the Canadian justice minister consider intervening in the Chinese executive's extradition case and releasing her.
    Michael Kovrig, 48, who was arrested by Chinese authorities in December 2018, was formally charged last week with espionage. His arrest, like that of Canadian businessman Michael Spavor around the same time, is widely believed to be in retaliation for Meng's arrest on U.S. fraud charges.
    Kovrig's wife, Vina Nadjibulla, who lives in Toronto, has been fighting for his release since his arrest but went public this week for the first time. 
    ""The situation keeps getting more and more dire for Michael,"" she said in an interview with Reuters. ""He is completely cut off and isolated. We believe this is the moment to consider all options. We are running out of time.""
    Nadjibulla said legal experts had determined the Canadian justice minister had the authority to stop the extradition process at any point if it was in the national interest, not only once the court proceedings have concluded.
    ""Options that will terminate the extradition process are within the rule of law,"" Nadjibulla said. ""And that could open up space for resolution to the situation of the two Michaels."" 
    The Canadian Justice Department said it recognized the toll the “arbitrary detentions” continued to take on Kovrig, Spavor and their families.
But as a matter of policy, the minister’s authority has been delegated until the judge rules on the extradition, a spokesman said. The minister must then decide whether to order the subject's surrender or discharge.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 08:47PM ET</span>","In Thailand, it's statues of democracy leaders that are disappearing","By Panu Wongcha-um and Panarat Thepgumpanat
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Certain historical statues have been disappearing in Thailand, but they are not effigies of colonialists or slave owners torn down by protesters.
Instead, Thailand's vanishing monuments celebrated leaders of the 1932 revolution that ended absolute monarchy in Thailand, who were once officially honoured as national heroes and symbols of democracy.
Reuters has identified at least six sites memorialising the People's Party that led the revolution which have been removed or renamed in the past year.
In most cases it is not known who took the statues down, although a military official said one was removed for new landscaping.
Two army camps named after 1932 leaders were rechristened on the orders of the office of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, according to an item published without comment in the Royal Gazette.
Officials in the military, government and the palace declined to answer questions submitted by Reuters regarding the removal of statues and renaming of military camps.
Some historians say the missing monuments reflect an ideological battle over Thailand's history.
On one side is military-royalist conservatives whose supporters idealize traditional culture, with loyalty to the monarchy and King Maha Vajiralongkorn seen as the highest virtue.
On the other are populist parties, activists and academics who have risen to prominence in the last two decades, culminating in two military coups that ousted elected populist governments in 2006 and 2014.
In recent years, the conservatives have been in the ascendancy. Elections last year kept coup leader Prayuth in power through a vote that opposition parties said was rigged - an accusation that he and Thailand's courts deny.
Since the election and last year's elaborate coronation of King Vajiralongkorn, a major People's Party monument in Bangkok and at least three prominent statues of People's Party leaders at military sites have been removed, and a museum commemorating the revolution in the northern city of Chiang Rai was renamed.
Months after King Vajiralongkorn took the throne, a plaque marking the spot where the 1932 coup was proclaimed was replaced with one bearing a royalist slogan. No explanation for the change was given.
A representative of the National Defence Studies Institute – where a statue of 1932 revolutionary Plaek Phibunsongkram disappeared in January from the front of its headquarters – said on condition of anonymity that it had been moved for landscaping outside and could not say when or if it would be returned.
PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTION
Thailand officially has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932, and its traditional culture is deeply invested in the monarchy as a unifying – and for some, semi-divine – institution.
The king remains powerful and the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the current monarch's father, was widely revered during his 70-year reign until his death in 2016.
Tradition mandates all Thais prostrate themselves before the king and his immediate family, and insulting the monarchy is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
In recent years, successive military leaders including Prayuth have portrayed their critics as potential threats to the monarchy.
But since last year's disputed election, demonstrations against military dominance have increasingly identified with the 1932 revolution, said Chatri Prakitnonthakan, an architectural historian at Silpakorn University.
Wednesday is the 88th anniversary of the revolution, and pro-democracy activists plan to defy coronavirus bans on gatherings to protest what they say is the subversion of the principles of democracy by the military.
""We want to commemorate the 1932 revolt,"" said activist Anon Nampa, who is organizing a pre-dawn protest at Bangkok’s Democracy Monument, the largest and most prominent remaining symbol of the 1932 revolt.
""I think the young generations are looking back at that era and draw parallels about today, about how power is being abused.""

In remarks on Tuesday, Prayuth did not directly address the protests, but he told people ""don't violate the monarchy and don't violate the law.""

18,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 08:30PM ET</span>",Former Haitian death squad leader arrested after U.S. deportation,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Former Haitian death squad leader Emmanuel ""Toto"" Constant was taken into police custody immediately upon his arrival in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday after his deportation from the United States.
Wearing a black jacket and a white face mask, Constant was arrested by police on the tarmac of Port-au-Prince's international airport upon arriving back in Haiti after 26 years in the United States and whisked away.
""Emmanuel 'Toto' Constant is at the disposition of the justice system for the acts of which he is accused,"" the Justice Ministry said in a statement.
Constant founded a paramilitary group in Haiti in the early 1990s that he says was aimed at upholding peace after the overthrow of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide but that rights activists say murdered and tortured thousands of the leftist leader's supporters.
Constant, who made no comment to reporters upon his arrival on Tuesday, has said in the past he was being used as a scapegoat for rights abuses committed under military rule.
He fled Haiti in 1994 when Aristide was restored to power, becoming a real estate agent in New York’s borough of Queens. He was convicted in 2008 of mortgage fraud and larceny and served more than a decade in a U.S. prison.
A U.S. court in 2007 also found him “liable for torture, attempted extrajudicial killing and crimes against humanity” in Haiti and ordered him to pay $19 million to three women who say they were raped and had their breasts slashed by his men. 
Constant was released from prison into U.S. immigration custody in April. Human rights campaigners on Tuesday warned that the case was a test of the floundering justice system in Haiti, the western hemisphere's poorest country.
Constant himself was convicted in absentia in the 2000s for his role in a 1994 massacre of slum residents in Gonaives, only for that conviction to be later overturned on a technicality.

Abraham Weintraub announced his departure last week, after he became a target of a Supreme Court probe following the publication of a videotape of a cabinet meeting in which he called its judges ""bums"" who should be jailed.
Right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro sought an honorable exit for Weintraub, a fervent ideological defender, nominating him to be an executive director at the World Bank in Washington. The former minister flew to the United States on Friday, and his resignation became effective Saturday in the official gazette. 
Most Brazilians must spend two weeks outside their country before entering the United States due to COVID-19 quarantine rules, leading to questions about whether Weintraub had used a diplomatic passport.
Lucas Furtado, a prosecutor with the federal audit court, requested authorization to investigate whether Weintraub was on an official government trip to the United States, funded with taxpayer money.
Adding to the uncertainty, Brazil's government on Tuesday rectified Weintraub's resignation notice, saying it occurred on Friday - which would have meant he was no longer a minister when he traveled.
""Was he running away from someone?"" House Speaker Rodrigo Maia asked in a news conference. ""It would be the first time in history that someone says he is in exile and has the support of the government. It is usually the other way around.""
The Education Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In a Twitter post on Monday, Weintraub thanked everyone who helped him ""reach the United States safely.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army responded to Israeli strikes on southern, central and eastern Syria in which two soldiers were killed, the army said on Tuesday in what military defectors and intelligence sources said was a wave of raids that targeted Iranian bases. 
The army said Israeli jets hit an army outpost in Salamiya and another in Sabura towns in Hama province only hours after missiles struck other military installations in Deir al Zor province along the border with Iraq and in southern Syria near the border with Jordan.
Earlier an army statement said several attacks occurred simultaneously, one at a military outpost in Kabajib, east of Deir Zor province and in the vicinity of the town of Sukhna in the nearby eastern desert. A third strike hit a military installation farther south in the town of Salkhad, near the southern city of Sweida. Two soldiers died and four were wounded.
The bases are in zones in eastern and southern Syria which Israel had hit in recent months and which are believed to have a strong presence of Iranian-backed militias.
A senior Syrian military defector and a regional intelligence source said an Iranian arms depot near the city of Salamiya was set on fire after it was repeatedly bombed while a command centre in the town of Sabura run by Iranian militias was also severely damaged.
The Israeli army declined to comment. 
Regional intelligence sources say Israel’s strikes on Syria are part of a shadow war approved by Washington and part of the anti-Iran policy that has undermined in the last two years Iran’s extensive military power without triggering a major increase in hostilities.
Israel has acknowledged conducting many raids inside Syria since the start of the civil war in 2011. Israeli defence officials have said in recent weeks Israel would step up its campaign against Iran in Syria where, with the help of its proxy militias, Tehran has expanded its presence.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake of magnitude 7.4 struck southern Mexico's Pacific coast on Tuesday, killing at least four people and cutting off isolated villages, and causing tremors hundreds of miles away in Mexico City.
The fatalities were near the quake's epicenter in Oaxaca, a mountainous state known for its coffee, mescal and Spanish colonial architecture. 
Rockfalls blocked the winding mountain roads between the state capital of Oaxaca city and the coast. A clinic and other buildings in hill villages near the epicenter were severely damaged, images on social media showed.
The dead included a worker from state oil company Pemex, who suffered a bad fall, Mexico's civil protection agency said. Pemex was forced to briefly shutter the country's biggest oil refinery in Oaxaca.
Buildings hundreds of miles away in Mexico City shook strongly and people ran out into the streets when an early warning seismic alarm sounded. Two people were injured and more than 30 buildings in the capital suffered damage, officials said.
Videos on social media showed water that apparently came from rooftop pools cascading down residential buildings.
Several old churches in Oaxaca were damaged, including one with a dome at risk of collapse, the protection agency said. 
Miguel Candelaria, 30, was working at his computer in his family home in the Oaxaca town of Juchitan when the ground began to tremble. He ran outside with relatives, but they had to stop in the middle of the street as the pavement buckled and rocked. 
""We couldn't walk... the street was like chewing gum,"" said Candelaria, 30.
Quakes of magnitudes over 7 are major earthquakes capable of widespread, heavy damage. A 7.1 magnitude earthquake that struck central Mexico in 2017 killed 355 people in the capital and the surrounding states. 
The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had warned that the Pacific coasts of Mexico and Central and South America faced a possible tsunami but later said the danger had passed.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the epicenter of Tuesday's quake was located 69 km (43 miles) northeast of the town of Pochutla.
It was very shallow, only 26 km (16 miles) below the earth's surface, which would have amplified the shaking.
Near to the epicenter, Magdalena Castellanos Fermin was in the village of Santiago Astata when the quake struck, sending large rocks tumbling down from the hillside and alarming residents, she told Reuters by telephone.

""It was really intense, really strong,"" she said.

Diplomats from the 27-nation EU in Brussels are scheduled to discuss the criteria for lifting a curb on non-essential travel to the bloc as of July 1. One of the criteria up for discussion is “reciprocity,” which would mean Americans wouldn’t be allowed into the bloc starting next month because Europeans are still barred for health reasons from traveling to the U.S.
Europe is trying to revive domestic economies as the summer tourist season gets underway while guarding against a second wave of infections. The restrictions were introduced in mid-March for 30 days and extended three times through June as Europe battled to contain the coronavirus.
The New York Times reported the potential restriction on U.S. travelers earlier on Tuesday.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, recommended on June 11 that member-country governments draw up a common list of countries outside the bloc from which visitors would be allowed as of July 1 based on “objective criteria” and comparable epidemiological situations.
The EU diplomats may also continue their discussions on Friday this week as they seek to agree on the specific criteria for easing the travel restrictions.

In a post on its website, the Southern Command said the USS Nitze, a missile destroyer, sailed in an area outside Venezuela's territorial waters - which extend some 12 nautical miles from its coasts - but within an area the Venezuelan government ""falsely claims to have control over."" 
The move comes after the Trump administration in April said it was deploying more U.S. military assets to the Caribbean in part to disrupt alleged narcotics shipments by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a socialist viewed as illegitimate by the United States and dozens of other mostly Western countries.
With U.S. sanctions on its key oil industry leaving Venezuela increasingly isolated, Maduro last month turned to Iran - another country under heavy U.S. sanctions - for fuel shipments. Washington said it was considering a response to those shipments but took no military action. 
On Monday, the Iranian-flagged cargo ship Golsan docked in the Venezuelan port of La Guaira carrying what Iran's Embassy in Caracas said was food to supply the South American nation's first Iranian supermarket. There was no indication that the Golsan and Nitze confronted each other.
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor its armed forces' press office immediately responded to requests for comment. 
Although President Donald Trump has insisted that all options are on the table to oust Maduro, U.S. officials have made clear there is little appetite for military force.

KINGSTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - A massive plume of Saharan dust has shrouded swathes of the Caribbean, turning blue skies into a milky-brown haze and sparking health warnings across the region as air quality fell to unhealthy levels.
Strong warm winds over the Sahara desert typically whip up sand at this time of year and carry it thousands of miles across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. This year, the dust is the most dense in a half a century, according to several meteorologists. The thick smog has sharply reduced visibility.
Jamaica's Blue Mountains, usually a prominent sight towering over Kingston, were hidden behind an oppressive white cloud. 
""I’m not sure if it’s sneaking in through the vents, because the air inside doesn’t feel the same,"" said Sarue Thomas, 31, from her office in Kingston, where temperatures exceeded 30 degrees Celsius and the air was stiflingly thick.
""This is something that we’ve not ever seen before,” said Thomas, adding that her three-year-old son had developed a dry cough.
""It's the worst I've seen since we've kept records,"" said Evan Thompson, director of the meteorological service division in Jamaica.
""We are seeing a much thicker mass of dust particles suspended. It is a lot more distinct and noticeable.""
The dust cloud moved into the eastern Caribbean at the weekend and by Tuesday had smothered Hispaniola, Jamaica, Puerto Rico and eastern Cuba, continuing its advance up and westward toward Central America and southern United States.
Officials across the region warned locals to remain at home when possible and wear a face mask, especially if they already had a respiratory condition, as the dust was a powerful irritant and could contain pathogens as well as minerals.
“The use of a face mask is recommended in this situation, in addition to already being necessary for prevention of COVID-19,” said Cuba’s top weather man, Jose Rubiera, on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
""Those with asthma and people with allergies should be careful and stay at home.""

The Saharan dust typically ""helps build beaches in the Caribbean and fertilizes soils in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)"" in addition to affecting air quality, according to NASA, which has captured satellite images of the plume.

Dorothy Semu, vice chair of the Wazalendo Alliance for Transparency and Change (ACT Wazalendo), one of the fastest growing opposition parties, said Kabwe and the others had been arrested in Kilwa district, southern Tanzania, as they attended an internal meeting.
""This is a perfectly legitimate activity ... In a clear act of repression and attempted intimidation, the police interrupted the event and proceeded to arrest peaceful and law-abiding ACT Wazalendo members,"" Semu said in a statement. 
The police could not be reached for comment. 
President John Magufuli, who is expected to run for a second and final five-year term, dissolved parliament last week ahead of the election.
Kabwe was found guilty a month ago of sedition and incitement after being found to have falsely alleged that around 100 people had been killed in his home region in 2018 in clashes between herders and police. 
He was released without sentencing on condition that he refrain from saying or writing anything potentially seditious for one year. Kabwe had pleaded 'not guilty' and his lawyers said they would appeal. [nL8N2DB2WR]
The government also revoked the licence of the opposition-leaning newspaper Tanzania Daima, alleging violations of journalistic ethics and laws including spreading false information.
An official at the Department of Information said the newspaper had received 10 warnings, but he did not elaborate on the alleged breaches. He said the paper had 30 days to appeal, or could apply for a new licence. 
The paper's editor, Martin Malera, said it had been questioned for publishing a story in which a bishop urged opposition parties to demand a free electoral body, called for independent candidates to be allowed to stand, and urged the public to wear white as a sign of political protest.

In a statement the Croatian Public Health Institute said Plenkovic did not have to self-isolate as the risk of infection was low because he only briefly met Djokovic and was not in a close contact with him. 
Three other players who played in Djokovic's Adria Tour exhibition tournament in the Balkan region have also tested positive. 
Plenkovic attended the tournament in the northern Adriatic town of Zadar on Saturday, a day before it was cancelled after Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria said he tested positive for the novel coronavirus. 
Croatia's Borna Coric and Viktor Troicki also tested positive as well as Djokovic's fitness coach Marco Panichi and Dimitrov's coach Christian Groh.
On Monday, Plenkovic tested negative for COVID-19 but calls from opposition politicians for him to self-isolate grew stronger on Tuesday after Djokovic, whom he had met briefly, tested positive.
Plenkovic, who was on an election campaign trip in the town of Zapresic handshaking and hugging his fans, said he was not worried because his meeting with Djokovic lasted about three minutes and could not be described as a close contact.
""Under the definition of close contact this was not the close contact and everything is normal,"" Plenkovic told reporters.

The Indian ministry said in a statement posted on Twitter that as ""we move from controlled and managed aviation evacuation of our citizens in different parts of the world and foreign nationals from India, we are now looking at the possibility of establishing bilateral arrangements.""
The U.S. Transportation Department issued an order Monday to require Indian air carriers to apply for authorization prior to conducting charter flights beginning in 30 days.
The department sought ""to restore a level playing field for U.S. airlines"" under the U.S.-India Air Transport Agreement. The Indian government, citing the coronavirus, has banned all scheduled services and failed to approve U.S. carriers for charter operations, it added.
The Indian ministry added it is considering the ""prospect of establishing individual bilateral bubbles, India-US, India-France, India-Germany, India-UK."" It added that ""final decisions pursuant to negotiations are expected to be taken soon.""
The U.S. government said Air India has been operating what it calls ""repatriation"" charter flights between India and the United States in both directions since May 7.
Air India is advertising flights ""that would constitute a rate of 53% of the scheduled services it operated before the onset of the current public health emergency,"" the department said. ""The charters go beyond true repatriations, and it appears that Air India may be using repatriation charters as a way of circumventing the GoI-imposed prohibition of scheduled services,"" the department said, declining to comment on Tuesday on the statement from the Indian government.
The Indian ministry said U.S., French and German authorities and others had sought permission for their carriers to participate ""in the transportation of passengers along the lines being conducted by Air India.""
The ministry noted the Air India flights are ""increasingly carrying Indians and citizens of other countries outbound to countries where they are normally resident.""
Airlines for America, a group representing major U.S. carriers including Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), United Airlines (O:UAL) and American Airlines (O:AAL), said in a statement it supported ""the Department of Transportation's actions to ensure U.S. airlines have a fair and equal opportunity to compete in the U.S.-Indian market.""

Health Minister Kiril Ananiev on Monday ordered Bulgarians to resume wearing masks again at all indoor public venues after the Balkan country last week recorded its highest weekly rise in novel coronavirus cases.
""All persons who were without protective face masks in the church at the Rila Monastery during the prime minister's visit will be fined,"" the health ministry told Reuters in an email.
As well as Borissov, journalists, photographers and camera people who accompanied him into the church without masks will also be fined, the ministry said.
It did not say whether clergy who failed to wear masks inside the church would also be penalised.
The Eastern Orthodox Rila Monastery, which nestles in the Rila mountains south of Sofia and is more than 1,000 years old, is famed for its colourful frescos and is one of Bulgaria's top tourist attractions.
Bulgaria has weathered the COVID-19 pandemic relatively well due to rigorous lockdown restrictions including the compulsory wearing of face masks in public places.
It had begun to relax the measures this month, but last week it reported 606 new COVID-19, bringing the total to 3,984, with 207 deaths, prompting Ananiev's decision to reimpose the mask requirement at indoor public venues, including trains and buses.
On Monday Chief State Health Inspector Angel Kunchev said Borissov's ruling centre-right GERB party and the opposition Socialist Party would each be fined 3,000 levs for failing to enforce social distancing at recent large-scale events they organised.

33,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",Videos of alleged police misconduct went viral. Then what happened?,"By Ted Hesson, Mimi Dwyer and Andy Sullivan
(Reuters) - Some U.S. authorities have moved with unusual speed to fire, suspend or charge police officers caught on video hitting and pushing peaceful protesters and targeting them with pepper spray during nationwide protests in recent weeks, a Reuters review of 44 videos recorded during the demonstrations found.
Police investigations into alleged officer misconduct rarely result in discipline, law enforcement experts said. And it is not uncommon for fired officers to be reinstated through arbitration or to be hired by other police agencies. Nationwide data on police discipline is limited, the experts said.
The videos reviewed by Reuters were shot during demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by police officers in Minneapolis on May 25. While hundreds of such videos have been shared recently on social media platforms, Reuters focused on 44 that were widely circulated online. Nearly all the videos were shot by protesters or bystanders.
Two of the incidents Reuters examined - in Atlanta and Louisville, Kentucky - have led to police officers or chiefs losing their jobs. Local district attorneys have pressed charges against six officers in Atlanta, two officers in Buffalo, New York, one officer in New York City and one officer in Philadelphia, the review found.
In all, police departments said they were investigating or reviewing the incidents shown in 35 of the videos, a tally that includes the videos that led to officers being fired or charged with crimes. Officers were put on desk duty, modified duty or given paid leave in at least six instances.
(For an interactive version of this story, with video, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/3erXv4z)
The fact that the incidents were captured on video appears to have increased the likelihood of officers being charged with a crime, which is a rare occurrence, according to Christy Lopez, who worked in the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice from 2010 to 2017. Lopez led the team that investigated the police department in Ferguson, Missouri, after the 2014 killing of an unarmed Black teenager by a white police officer.
“I have been reviewing written accounts of incidents like this for decades, and often it is only when there is a video that there is any chance of accountability, or even attention, regardless of how blatant the police misconduct is,” said Lopez, now a professor at Georgetown Law. “There is no question that video prompts action.”
The incident that sparked the protests – Floyd’s death at the hands of the police – was captured by a bystander on a cellphone video that lasted more than 10 minutes. Such footage can be more valuable for investigations and prosecutions than officer-worn body cameras, which provide a limited field of view, according to Seth Stoughton, a law professor at the University of South Carolina and a former police officer.
Body-worn cameras can malfunction, he said, and officers sometimes fail to activate them before an incident. Beyond that, people who view any type of videos may disagree about the facts and what they mean.
Floyd's death led to protests in Minneapolis that spread to cities and towns in all 50 states. While most of the protests have been peaceful, some led to violence and looting. Thousands of people were arrested across the country, including in New York, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and other cities.
Four Minneapolis police officers have been fired and charged in connection with the incident, including Derek Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd's neck, killing him. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter. The other three officers have been charged with aiding and abetting murder and manslaughter. None of the officers have been asked to enter a plea yet, according to the state attorney general’s office.
Nationwide data on federal and state prosecutions related to police use of force or other misconduct is limited, according to experts. Even less is known about the number of instances where prosecutors considered charges, but did not press them.
Rachel Harmon, director of the Center for Criminal Justice at the University of Virginia School of Law, said video creates “a more even playing field” when it comes to determining what happened during incidents between police and the public.
She also said it humanizes people who are subject to alleged police misconduct, which can make the viewer “more sympathetic to that person’s suffering, even if that person is imperfect.” Public opinion polls show Americans’ views on racism and police misconduct have shifted dramatically in recent weeks compared with earlier surveys.
In one New York City case, New York Police Department (NYPD) officer Vincent D’Andraia was charged with assault, menacing, and harassment for throwing a protester to the ground. He has pleaded not guilty. A supervisor was also disciplined and reassigned. In two other New York City cases, two officers were referred for discipline, with one suspended without pay and one reassigned.
The NYPD officer who was suspended was shown on video pulling down the face mask of a protester who had his hands raised, then spraying that protester with what appeared to be pepper spray. The officer who was reassigned was seen opening the passenger side door of a moving police vehicle so that it struck a protester.
NYPD only identified the officer who was charged. Police Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch said in a written statement to Reuters that each officer was “entitled to due process and a full and impartial investigation of the incident, not summary judgment based on a few seconds of video.”
The 44 videos reviewed by Reuters show police pushing protesters to the ground, throwing or shooting projectiles at them, and striking them with batons or fists.
Ashley Heiberger, a retired officer from the Bethlehem Police Department in Pennsylvania, said the videos likely do not include all the information needed to judge an officer’s behavior. Heiberger now works as an independent consultant advising police departments on policies, training, accountability and the use of force.
“It’s not really possible to watch a video and make a determination about whether it suggests misconduct without knowing the context,” Heiberger said. “If you just see an officer applying force to a subject, you have no idea why he’s doing that and the totality of circumstances.”
The videos involved at least 27 local law enforcement agencies, as well as the U.S. Park Police and the District of Columbia and Kentucky National Guard forces.
Officers have only been publicly identified in six of the 44 videos reviewed by Reuters.
The footage appears to show at least 80 officers involved in the incidents, according to an estimate by the news agency. In some cases, particularly in instances where protesters were shot with bean bag rounds and rubber bullets or sprayed with tear gas, it was unclear how many officers may have been involved based on the video footage.
“BOLOGNA STRONG”
Two former law enforcement officers who reviewed the videos for Reuters said that at least some of the officers appeared to be acting inappropriately or that the nature of the incidents suggested the need for further investigation.
Former NYPD detectives John Baeza and Joseph Guida, who work together and typically serve as expert witnesses in cases on behalf of alleged victims of police misconduct, reviewed the videos and found roughly half appeared to show inappropriate behavior. The other cases lacked context or did not show the intent of the officers, they said.
The city of Atlanta’s response to a May 30 altercation involving its police force stands out among the incidents reviewed by Reuters because officers were fired soon afterwards.
Body cameras worn by police showed officers breaking a window on a car whose driver and passenger were college students, stunning them with Tasers and pulling them from the vehicle.
Of the six officers allegedly involved, two were fired and four were suspended the following day. On June 10, two more of the officers were fired. Four of the officers were charged with aggravated assault, a felony. The two other officers faced lesser charges.
Susan Hutson, who has been the independent police monitor for the New Orleans Police Department since 2010, said prosecutions of law enforcement for alleged misconduct were rare, and that she was encouraged by the swift move to bring charges in cities such as Atlanta.
Still, she said a prosecution is only one step in the process and does not necessarily mean that an officer will be convicted.
“A lot of times juries don’t want to convict, and courts are sympathetic as well to police officers,” Hutson said. “It can be tough to keep them fired.”
Lance LoRusso, an attorney representing two fired Atlanta officers, Ivory Streeter and Mark Gardner, said his clients did not use excessive force and that the arrests were lawful. The two officers filed a lawsuit that argues they were fired without due process and should be reinstated and receive back pay.
The other officers could not be reached for comment.
Vince Champion, the southeast regional director of the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, which represents all six officers involved, said the district attorney’s office had acted too quickly in charging the officers and that more time was needed to determine whether misconduct occurred.
Heiberger, the former Pennsylvania police officer, said police officers often have additional due process protections in state statutes, city codes and union contracts. He said officers typically must be given information about the allegations and the opportunity to consult with a labor representative. They often get a chance to review the evidence that supports those allegations, he said. Heiberger said use-of-force investigations are serious matters that involve interviews with all parties and the collection of relevant evidence, which is then reviewed.
“While I don't know for certain how the Atlanta Police Department conducts its internal operations, I'm skeptical that the required investigative and adjudicative procedures could be completed in one day,” he said, referencing the quick dismissal of the two officers after the May 30 incident.
The police department and mayor’s office did not respond to requests for comment over the firings and due process concerns.
Local prosecutors in other cities have filed charges, too.
The Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office charged Philadelphia Police Staff Inspector Joseph Bologna with aggravated assault and other crimes on June 5 after he was captured on video striking a college student in the back of the head with a metal baton.
Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said in a written statement announcing the charges that his office was “trying to be fair” and that “accountability has to be equal.”
The local police union in that city has rallied around the accused officer, selling T-shirts that read “Bologna Strong” and cheering him as he left the union headquarters to surrender to authorities on June 8.
Fortunato Perri, an attorney representing Bologna, told Reuters in an email that the officer’s actions were justified.
“In the midst of this deadly pandemic, Inspector Bologna and his fellow officers were spit on, sprayed with urine and other chemicals as well as verbally and physically assaulted,” Perri said. “His use of force to apprehend an individual, who was trying to thwart a lawful arrest during a melee, was lawful and justified.”
Mayor Jim Kenney on May 30 lauded his city’s police force for showing “restraint” during violent protests, saying they were spit on and had urine and “caustic agents” thrown at them.
Reuters could not confirm whether Bologna was directly involved in such incidents. His attorney did not respond to a request for additional details.
One of the best-known videos features a 75-year-old protester in Buffalo, New York, who appeared to be pushed to the ground by two police officers during a June 4 demonstration.
In the video, Martin Gugino, a local activist, lay motionless on the ground as blood seeped from his right ear. Kelly Zarcone, Gugino’s attorney, told reporters afterward that Gugino had a fractured skull and a brain injury. She confirmed the injuries to Reuters and said on June 12 that he was not yet able to walk.
The two officers, who were part of the Buffalo Police Department’s Emergency Response Team, were suspended without pay and arraigned on felony assault charges.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said a day after the incident that he had spoken with Gugino and was thankful he survived.
“You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity,” Cuomo said during a press briefing. “Why, why, why was that necessary? Where was the threat?”
John Evans, president of the Buffalo police officers’ union, told Reuters the charges “should never have been filed,” but did not elaborate. Evans had previously told a local media outlet that the officers were simply following orders. 

(This story corrects paragraph 4 to show six officers have been charged in Atlanta, not four, and removes reference to suspensions as some were fired; corrects paragraph 12 to show the policemen were charged with ""aiding and abetting"" manslaughter and not manslaughter.)

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is due to hold a first round of talks on Wednesday on a U.S. proposal to indefinitely extend an arms embargo on Iran, which is currently set to end in October under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.
The United States circulated a draft resolution on the measure to the 15-member council on Monday, diplomats said, but council veto-powers Russia and China have already signaled their opposition to the move.
Washington has long argued that the arms embargo on Iran should not be lifted. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, Britain or France to pass. 
The U.S. draft would ban the sale, supply or transfer of arms or related materiel by Iran and prohibits countries from selling, supplying or transferring arms or related materiel unless approved by a Security Council committee.
It requires countries to inspect cargo in their territory if they have reasonable grounds to believe the cargo contains banned items and also calls on countries to inspect vessels on the high seas - with the consent of the flag state - for the same reason.
The United States circulated the draft resolution after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reported to the Security Council earlier this month that cruise missiles used in several attacks on oil facilities and an international airport in Saudi Arabia last year were of ""Iranian origin.""
If Washington is unsuccessful in extending the arms embargo, it has threatened to trigger at the Security Council a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under the nuclear deal, even though it quit the accord in 2018. Diplomats say Washington would face a tough, messy battle.

Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai schools are holding rehearsals to prepare students for classes in the coronavirus era, giving lessons in hygiene and social distancing to children as young as three ahead of next week's return.
Schools across Thailand have been modifying classrooms, dining halls and play areas to prepare for a phased return of students, in another step towards normalcy as the country nears one month without a domestic transmission.
Bangkok's Wichutit School has since last week been putting students through a day of drills in hand-washing, playground etiquette and forming orderly lines one metre apart.
On Tuesday, the school of more than 1,600 students invited children age 3 and 4 to put on masks and face shields for mock lessons in classrooms with barriers installed on desks.
They queued for temperature checks and wash basins and were introduced to hand-cleaning techniques and a new lunchtime routine of eating behinds screens.
""This is going to be something new for the kids and they're excited. They've been cooperative because parents also practise the same new normal at home,"" said the school's director, Pornnicha Chatapun.
""It's normal life for them now, and they won't feel weird about it.""
Thailand's return to school is sooner than much of Southeast Asia, owing to its low infection numbers. Of its 3,156 cases, only 58 have died and 3,023 patients have recovered.
That compares to nearly 48,000 cases in Indonesia and close to 32,000 in the Philippines, whose president has vowed to keep schools shut until a COVID-19 vaccine is available.
Pareeyaporn Deesuer, whose son attends the Wichutit school, said she was reassured by its preparations.

""I was kind of really worried, but once they are back at school there's a sense of relief because of the school's preventive measures,"" she said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Sixty-year-old Marzenna Latawiec is determined to brave the risk of coronavirus and vote in Poland's presidential election on Sunday, but it's not the pandemic or the country's first economic recession in three decades that is firing her up.
The mother of two gay sons from Warsaw wants to turn what she sees as a growing tide of state-sponsored homophobia, which she blames in part on the incumbent President Andrzej Duda.
""I don't care whether [homophobic speech] is cynicism or an expression of regular, pure hatred,"" Latawiec told Reuters. ""I cannot accept that any adult, mature person can speak like this and not face consequences for what the words stir up.""
Amid a pandemic-inspired downturn which has thrown hundreds of thousands of Poles out of work, Duda, 48, has sought to paint himself as the guardian of the government's social programmes that have helped reduce poverty for many Poles, while mobilising his conservative base with attacks on LGBT ""ideology"". 
His challenger in staunchly Catholic Poland is centrist Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, also 48, who has vowed to end hate speech and protect those who face attacks.
Latawiec, an IT specialist who plans to vote for Trzaskowski, believes that in their campaigning, Duda and the nationalist government he supports are ""de facto acquiescing to hate crimes"".
Competing for a second five-year term, Duda said this month that LGBT (lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender) ""ideology"" was more dangerous than communist doctrine, and pledged to ensure public schools are banned from discussing gay rights.
For the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS), such rhetoric is part of a broader agenda aimed at instilling more conservative and patriotic values in public life which it believes are under threat from liberal western influence.
Duda's campaign aides say accusations such as that by Latawiec are false and ignore his calls for respect for all citizens. Duda argues he is simply defending Poland's moral ""backbone"" that is rooted in European Christian civilisation. 
""My parents' generation fought for 40 years to get rid of communist ideology from schools so it couldn't be forced on children, so that the youth would not be brainwashed, indoctrinated,"" he told supporters at a campaign rally.
""They didn't fight for this so that a new ideology would appear which is even more destructive.""
His long-held lead in opinion polls has begun to crumble in recent weeks, however, as voters grow frustrated with Duda's allegiance to PiS, which the European Union says subverts democratic norms through policies such as its court reforms.
NOT LIKE IRELAND
Surveys still showed Duda winning Sunday's first round of voting with around 40% of the vote compared to Trzaskowski's 27%. But the two appear tied in a possible run-off between the top two candidates due on July 12 if no one polls more than half the ballots. 
Duda won 35% and then 52% of votes in two rounds of elections five years ago.
Trzaskowski announced plans last year to launch a legal and psychological support hotline for LGBT people and to ensure schools had specialists who can help LGBT children.
A long-time European Union emissary for his party, the centrist Civic Platform, he entered the election race late, replacing a flagging candidate after the ballot, originally set for May 10, was postponed due to the pandemic.
Trzaskowski, however, has sidestepped questions in the campaign over whether he would support allowing gay marriage, underscoring the sensitivity of the issue in Poland.
Trzaskowski's runner-up in opinion polls, the independent Catholic journalist Szymon Holownia, says he would allow gay civil partnerships, and would limit the participation of state leaders in church events, rife under PiS.
""I don't think Poland will become like Ireland but I would like it to be a tolerant, secular state,"" Holownia, who once studied to become a priest, told Reuters. 
Surveys show Holownia likely to win some 9% of votes on Sunday, but some have suggested he would have a slightly better chance of beating Duda in the July 12 run-off than Trzaskowski.
Earlier this month, Latawiec and a handful of other parents of LGBT children held a protest in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw to call on Duda to change his language. 
Elzbieta Mieszczanska-Blaszczyk, 65, the mother of a lesbian daughter, said later she believed homophobia had been declining in Poland until PiS came to power in 2015. ""What's most important to me is that Duda loses,"" she told Reuters.
Her daughter, Aleksandra Blaszczyk, is thinking of emigrating.

""Wouldn't it be easier to leave and live in a world where being homosexual is like being left-handed?,"" she said.

38,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",China-India border clash stokes contrasting domestic responses,"By Yew Lun Tian and Sanjeev Miglani
BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The skirmish between Chinese and Indian troops over a long-disputed border this month is being treated in New Delhi as the country's worst diplomatic crisis in decades even as it is downplayed by Beijing.
China is already locked in diplomatic combat over a host of disputes, from the United States and Australia to Taiwan and Hong Kong, and its handling of the coronavirus outbreak. It is loath to engage on yet another front - especially one that could push New Delhi closer to Washington, some analysts say. 
The two sides were working to ease tensions, China's foreign ministry said on Tuesday. Chinese media coverage has been scant.
Beijing's response also points to its interest in de-escalating a crisis over a stretch of border that is less politically important than other territorial priorities, such as claims to Taiwan and the South China Sea and its tightening grip on Xinjiang and Hong Kong.
The contrast reflects the differences in two systems of government - India is the world's biggest democracy, while China is ruled by the Communist Party and tightly controls its media - as well as the domestic realities of a dispute that has little political upside for the leaders of either country.
Since the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers in hand-to-hand fighting in the Galwan Valley, in the worst combat losses on the de facto border with China in more than 50 years, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a strident nationalist, has faced heated calls for a strong response.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is under no such public pressure.
""Indians watch everything that China is doing, but most Chinese only have eyes for international issues related to the U.S. or Taiwan,"" said Zhang Jiadong, director of the Center for South Asian Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai.
Both governments would prefer to play down the clash, he said, but information from the remote battlefield leaking into Indian media forces Modi's hand in a way that would not be possible in China.
""The clash happened because troops from both sides have a different understanding of where the line of actual control lies,"" he said.
""This area is a barren hilltop with no economic or geostrategic value. From the Chinese government point of view, it is not worth destabilising bilateral relations over this,” said Zhang.
The border clash did not crack the top 50 searches on China's Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) on Tuesday.
PRESSURE DIFFERENTIAL
In India, opposition leaders, former generals and diplomats have criticised Modi for failing to protect Indian lives and territory. Many have called for boycotts of Chinese goods. The story garners wall-to-wall coverage in domestic media.
The perceived threat from China - which humiliated India in a brief border war in 1962 - has overshadowed India's COVID crisis, in which the number of cases has crossed 400,000 with no sign of a peak.
Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said India stands behind Modi, but he must bear responsibility.
""We stand at historic crossroads. Our government's decisions and actions will have serious bearings on how the future generations perceive us,"" he said.
Such language makes it harder for Modi to compromise without losing face, analysts say. 
Modi rode to power in 2014 vowing to turn India into an economic and military power, but China has pulled further ahead on his watch. Its economy is five times the size of India's, with three times the military spending.

Control Risks said in a note that Modi's administration will likely employ economic measures against China to placate public pressure, instead of risking military conflict with a stronger adversary.

39,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>","Libyan and foreign forces mobilise at Sirte, Arab ministers urge calm","CAIRO/TUNIS (Reuters) - Arab foreign ministers said on Tuesday they wanted to head off a new battle in Libya, where the warring sides are mobilising near the main oil region as their foreign backers threaten an escalation. 
""Libya is passing through a dangerous turn in the course of its conflict,"" Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said in a statement.
Egypt has said its army may directly intervene in Libya and France has said it will not tolerate Turkish involvement there. 
Libya's frontlines have shifted rapidly as Ankara's backing helped the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) to drive the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) from Tripoli and the northwest. 
The LNA, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, has fallen back as far as Sirte, on the central Mediterranean coastline, where airstrikes stopped the GNA advance. 
Both sides are now preparing to battle for Sirte. An LNA source said its commander, Khalifa Haftar, was reinforcing there. 
A senior Turkish official, Yasin Aktay, said on Monday the GNA was making preparations to recapture it and that Egypt's leadership lacked ""the power or guts"" to attempt to stop this. 
The fighting has come at a cost for civilians, who have faced booby-trapped homes, looting and arson as the action moves eastwards.
MAJOR BLOW
The LNA retreat to Sirte last month was a blow to Haftar, whose goal of uniting Libya by force after years of chaos and division hinged on the offensive he launched in April 2019 to capture Tripoli. 
Any further advance by the GNA would give it the chance to take back control over Libya's ""oil crescent"", the region where most of the OPEC member's energy is produced and exported. 
Its military success in recent weeks has depended partly on the support of Turkish drones, which targeted LNA supply lines and troop formations. 
Last month the United States said Russia had flown warplanes to an LNA base and last week it said they were now operating in the vicinity of Sirte. 
However, diplomats say a new battle for the town - the western gateway to Libya's main oil terminals - could still be avoided, particularly if Turkey and Russia can hash out an agreement. 
Russia said on Tuesday it wanted a ceasefire in Libya and denied a United Nations report last month that said it had up to 1,200 mercenaries fighting in the country.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States wants to broaden its main nuclear arms control agreement with Russia to include all their atomic weapons, a U.S. envoy said on Tuesday after talks with Moscow on a new accord.
U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea also said Washington would keep pressing China to join the talks on replacing the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) which expires in February. 
The two sides, who were rivals in the Cold War, agreed to set up technical working groups and to hold further talks, possibly in late July or early August, he said, but gave no details of the working groups.
Washington wants Beijing involved because it says China is secretly racing to increase the size and reach of its nuclear arsenal, but Moscow favours a multilateral accord, possibly including France and Britain, Billingslea said.
""We, the United States, intend and believe ... that the next arms control agreement must cover all nuclear weapons, not just so-called strategic nuclear weapons,"" he told a news conference in Vienna that followed the talks there on Monday.
New START caps the countries' deployed strategic nuclear weapons warheads at 1,550 each, far fewer than the thousands of atomic weapons they possess. 
Last year Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF), with senior officials saying Moscow had deployed ""multiple battalions"" of a cruise missile throughout Russia in violation of the pact and that some had ""the ability to strike critical European targets"".
Russia denied that, saying the missile's range puts it outside the treaty. A more comprehensive agreement would be intended to overcome such disputes and avoid further erosion of the global arms control architecture.
China, whose nuclear arsenal is a fraction the size of the United States' or Russia's, has rejected U.S. attempts to involve them in the negotiations. 
Billingslea posted a picture of Chinese flags at empty seats around the negotiating table before talks began, a move Beijing dismissed as an act of ""performance art"".

Russia said China joining was unrealistic.

41,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 09:01AM ET</span>","Saudi leadership pressures former intelligence official’s family, seeks access to documents","LONDON (Reuters) - As Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman moved to tighten his grip on power over the past few years, detaining senior royals and opponents, one person has eluded him: a former top-ranking intelligence official who was close to a key rival to the throne.
In recent months, the crown prince -- known by the initials MbS -- has increased pressure on relatives of Saad al-Jabri, including detaining his adult children, to try to force his return to the kingdom from exile in Canada, the former intelligence official’s family say. In the crown prince’s sights are documents Jabri has access to that contain sensitive information, according to four people with knowledge of the situation.
Jabri was a long-time aide to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who the crown prince ousted as heir to the throne in a 2017 palace coup that left MbS the de facto ruler of Saudi Arabia, the world's top oil exporter and a key U.S. ally.
Saudi authorities detained bin Nayef and two other senior royals on March 6, the latest in a series of extraordinary measures seen aimed at consolidating MbS’s strength within the ruling Al Saud family and removing perceived threats to his power ahead of an eventual succession upon the king’s death or abdication.
Multiple top Interior Ministry officials were also detained in March, said two of the people with knowledge of the situation - both well-connected Saudis.
Days after bin Nayef’s detention, according to Jabri’s family, Saudi authorities arrested two of his children, 21-year old Omar and 20-year old Sarah, in a dawn raid on the family home in the capital Riyadh. That was followed by the detention of the former intelligence official’s brother in early May, the family said. Three of the people with knowledge of the situation confirmed Jabri’s relatives had been detained.
According to the four people with knowledge of the situation, the crown prince believes he could use the documents in Jabri’s possession against current rivals for the throne. He also fears they contain additional information that could compromise him and his father, the king, the four people said.
The documents include information on bin Nayef’s assets abroad, which also potentially could be useful to MbS in putting pressure on his predecessor, said the two well-connected Saudis and a former regional security official. Jabri also has access to sensitive files relating to the financial dealings of senior royals, including King Salman and MbS, said one of the well-connected Saudi sources, the former regional security official and a diplomat.
The diplomat said some of the information related to land deals and transactions, without elaborating beyond saying that they related to King Salman during his time as governor of Riyadh, a position he held for nearly four decades prior to his 2015 ascension to the throne.
One of the well-connected Saudi sources said the crown prince wants to press charges against bin Nayef relating to allegations of corruption during bin Nayef’s time at the Ministry of Interior. Reuters was unable to determine the details of those allegations.
""They have long wanted Jabri as the right-hand man of MbN,” the person said, referring to bin Nayef.
The Saudi government has not confirmed or publicly commented on the seizure of Jabri's children or his brother, Abdulrahman al-Jabri. The Saudi government media office did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters about the detentions or the reasons behind them.
Jabri’s family and one of the well-connected Saudis said Saudi authorities had accused Jabri of corruption but did not elaborate on the nature of the allegations. The family says the allegations are false.
Saad al-Jabri declined to comment via his son.
Reuters couldn’t determine where bin Nayef and the other two princes are being held and was unable to reach them for comment.
A U.S. official said Washington had raised the issue of detention of the children with the Saudi leadership. The official added that many U.S. government officials had worked directly with Jabri over a long period of time and that he had been “a very, very strong counterterrorism partner.”
A second U.S. official in Washington said the United States was in contact with Jabri’s family in Canada and were “exploring ways to assist.”
“We are deeply concerned by reports of the al Jabri children’s detention and would strongly condemn any unjust persecution of family members whatever the allegations against Saad Al-Jabri may be,” the official said.
Canada was also concerned about the detention of Jabri’s children, said Syrine Khoury, a spokeswoman for Canada’s foreign ministry. She didn’t elaborate on whether Canada was taking specific steps.
“HE HAD ALL THE FILES ON EVERYTHING”
For nearly two decades, Saad al-Jabri had worked closely with bin Nayef, helping to overhaul the kingdom’s intelligence and counterterrorism operations and building close ties with Western officials.
“He had all the files on everything and everybody,"" said the former regional security official. Jabri coordinated relations between Saudi intelligence and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, the former official said. The CIA declined to comment.
When King Salman ascended the throne in January 2015, he appointed Jabri to a cabinet-level position. Bin Nayef became crown prince in April 2015. Jabri's son, Khalid al-Jabri, said that at that time the relationship between his father and MbS was “initially really good” but the relationship soon soured, spurred by opponents close to MbS who alleged that Jabri was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. The family strongly denies it.
Four months later, in August 2015, Jabri learned he had been fired from his post via a state television announcement, said Khalid Al-Jabri, who now lives in Canada along with his father.
Saad al-Jabri became a personal advisor to MbN, a position he held until the royal was deposed as crown prince and removed as head of the interior ministry in June 2017. The two well-connected Saudis and the diplomat described Jabri as fiercely loyal to MbN.
Since 2017, when Jabri moved to Canada, Saudi authorities have made repeated attempts to lure the former intelligence official back to the kingdom, both directly and through interlocutors, Khalid Al-Jabri told Reuters.
He added that his siblings had been barred from leaving Saudi Arabia for more than two years prior to their detention and were questioned by authorities on more than one occasion regarding their father. The crown prince had made an offer in 2017 to Jabri senior to allow the children to travel in exchange for his return, he said.
The family said they don’t know where Jabri’s children are being held and aren’t able to reach them. “Every time we ask people inside (Saudi Arabia), we’ve been told MbS is handling their detention himself. Don’t bother asking for details,” Khalid Al-Jabri said.
LOBBYING WASHINGTON
Jabri’s deep knowledge of some of the kingdom's most sensitive information, coupled with his popularity in Western political circles and among some long-serving Saudi security officials, made him a target, according to his son, the diplomat, the former regional security official and a former Western intelligence source.
The diplomat said Jabri could be perceived as a threat to MbS if U.S. President Donald Trump, who defended strategic defence and energy ties with the kingdom during the global uproar over Khashoggi's death, failed to win re-election. The White House declined to comment.
The family said it is lobbying U.S. lawmakers for help. Senators Marco Rubio and Patrick Leahy have spoken with the family, according to their offices. Members of Congress are concerned that “two young people have disappeared after being seized by Saudi state security forces,” said Tim Rieser, senior foreign policy aide to Democratic Senator Leahy. “It seems that they’re being used as hostages to try and coerce their father to return to Saudi Arabia,” he said.  He added that the Senator’s office is seeking information about their whereabouts and calling for their release.
The crown prince is officially next in line to the throne to his 85-year old father, King Salman. His efforts to diversify the kingdom’s economy away from its heavy reliance on oil and lift social restrictions, including on women, were welcomed by many Western officials and Saudis. But the crown prince has also drawn criticism for attempts to silence dissidents and marginalize rivals. He came under international criticism over the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate, which the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has said the crown prince ordered.
The crown prince has denied ordering Khashoggi’s killing but said he ultimately bears “full responsibility” as the kingdom’s de facto leader.
Saudi watchers and diplomats said that MbS has grown increasingly concerned with his standing, both at home and abroad following the Khashoggi killing. Some members of Saudi Arabia’s ruling family and business elite expressed frustration with his leadership following the largest-ever attack on the kingdom’s oil infrastructure in September, as Reuters previously reported.

There is also discontent at home, where the economy has been struck hard by the coronavirus pandemic and low oil prices, leading to austerity measures. The crown prince nevertheless still has staunch supporters and is popular among young Saudis for opening up the conservative kingdom and pledging to diversify the economy.

KABUL/KUNDUZ, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Increased Taliban attacks are jeopardising the peace process, the Afghan government said on Tuesday after hundreds of security force personnel were killed over the past week by the Islamist insurgents. 
The Taliban, fighting to reintroduce strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster from power, signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in February designed to pave the way for peace talks with the Afghan government.
“Recent attacks by terrorist groups and the Taliban have hurt the peace process and it is condemnable,"" Afghan Presidential Palace spokesman Sediq Sediqqi told a news conference. 
There was a sharp reduction in violence following the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Fitr last month, which officials hoped would pave the way for talks.
However, the past week has been alarming for Afghan officials with more than 400 Taliban attacks nationwide killing 291 security force members, Javid Faisal, spokesman for the government’s National Security Council, said on Monday.
“The Taliban's actions are inconsistent with their rhetoric on peace,” he said.
The main hurdle remaining for the launch of peace talks is disagreement over the release of few hundred Taliban prisoners involved in high-profile attacks against civilians. [nL4N2DW2D8
Afghan officials say they believe the upsurge in violence is because the Taliban want to push the government to release those prisoners and have the upper hand in future talks.
The Taliban deny that they have stepped up attacks.
A senior government official said talks which could have started this month were likely to be delayed once again because of the spike in attacks. 
The northeastern province of Takhar had been hit particularly hard by violence in the last few days, with attacks on security checkpoints and an explosion at a religious school in which seven students died.
Nevertheless, peacemaking efforts were continuing. The U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Afghanistan, Deborah Lyons, met in recent days with the Taliban’s deputy leader Mullah Baradar in the Qatari capital Doha.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Mourners are expected to fill the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church on Tuesday afternoon for the funeral of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man who was shot and killed by police outside an Atlanta fast-food restaurant almost two weeks ago.
While Brooks will be remembered at an invitation-only service, the funeral will be broadcast on the church's internet site, starting about 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT).
Hundreds of mourners filed past his gold-colored casket on Monday at a public viewing at the church steeped in the Black struggle for civil rights. Ebenezer Baptist was where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. preached until his assassination in 1968.
Most mourners on Monday never met Brooks, a 27-year-old father of three, but like Janice Danvers, 67, of Portsmouth, Virginia, wanted to attend Brooks' viewing.
""I think we should all see this,"" Danvers told Reuters. ""Then go out protesting. People need to listen. This is one too many (shootings).""
Brooks' death after being shot twice in the back, with one round piercing his heart, heightened tensions over police brutality and racism in U.S. policing that have raged since the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis in late May.
A prosecutor said Brooks appeared to be running away and was not a threat after running off with a Taser stun gun he had taken from one of the officers during an arrest at Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) restaurant in south Atlanta on June 12. Video shows Brooks appeared to fire the Taser in the direction of the officers.
The Atlanta police officer who shot Brooks, Garrett Rolfe, 27, was fired and charged with murder. A second officer, Devin Brosnan, 26, was placed on administrative duty and charged with aggravated assault. The city's police chief resigned.

The Wendy's restaurant was burned down after the killing.

The 42-year-old died after being pinned to the ground during a traffic check. Questions over his death have resurfaced after the killing of George Floyd in the United States ignited global protests against alleged police brutality.
Chouviat's father said his son had said he could not breathe -- the same words spoken by Floyd -- based on video footage of his arrest in January that was subsequently leaked to French media such as Le Monde and Mediapart.
""He was shouting out, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe, I can't breathe',"" Christian Chouviat told reporters at a news conference organised by the family.
""I am addressing myself directly to President Macron,"" added Chouviat's daughter Sofia. ""We want answers.""
Family members have said autopsy results showed a fracture to Chouviat’s larynx, and they urged Macron to change some methods used by the police when making arrests, to make them less violent.
Officials at the French Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.
A judicial source said Paris prosecutors had opened a manslaughter inquiry into Chouviat’s death. The four police officers involved in Chouviat's arrest are due to be questioned over the incident.
Chouviat’s family expressed anger that the officers had not been suspended.
Denis Jacob, from the Alternative Police trade union, denied the officers had acted illegally, saying that they had had to restrain Chouviat because he had not behaved in a calm manner.
""The judicial authorities must shed all light on the matter,"" he told BFM TV.
Laurent-Franck Lienard, part of the legal team representing the police officers, told LCI television the police had never heard Chouviat say he was having breathing difficulties while they restrained him in January.
The killing of Floyd in May has reignited protests in France against alleged police brutality, with trouble breaking out at demonstrations this month.
Rights groups say accusations of police violence, in particular in deprived suburbs where residents are often of immigrant background, remain largely unaddressed.
Police unions have accused Macron and his government of showing disrespect after Interior Minister Christophe Castaner this month promised ""zero tolerance"" for racism within law enforcement agencies and banned a chokehold used to detain suspects.

Officials in the city of 12.7 million, the epicentre of Russia's outbreak, say new infections have been falling from a peak in May and stood at just over 1,000 on Tuesday. Russia's national case load, the world's third highest, is nearly 600,000. 
The city, which began rapidly relaxing an array of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, on Tuesday allowed restaurants, cafes, libraries, playgrounds and gyms to open properly and for river cruises to resume. 
Moscow's mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said late on Monday that life in the capital had already largely returned to its normal rhythm, but warned that some restrictions remained in force including a ban on mass public events such as protests.
Sobyanin's critics accuse him of rushing to ease the lockdown in time to allow a Red Square military parade on Wednesday and a July 1 nationwide vote that could extend President Vladimir Putin's rule until 2036. 
A brass band played on the roof of one boat cruise passing near the Kremlin's terra-cotta walls, while on another passengers - mostly in medical masks and gloves - waved their hats at people watching from the embankment. 
""It's a beautiful sunny day today,"" said Olga Kacheva, the Radisson Flotilla's deputy marketing director. ""We're starting up again after three months on standby."" 

Authorities have urged residents to continue wearing masks and gloves and to observe social distancing rules. But on Tuesday the streets were bustling and many people were ignoring those guidelines.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Vexed by annexation: The battle inside the EU over Israel,"By Robin Emmott, Luke Baker, John Irish and Maayan Lubell
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Two months before Donald Trump unveiled his Middle East peace plan on Jan. 28, Luxembourg's foreign minister was certain the U.S. president would break with the European Union and recognise Israeli sovereignty over Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank.
Jean Asselborn wrote to his EU colleagues on Dec. 1 to warn that a lasting, two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians was being ""dismantled piece by piece, day after day"", according to the letter, reviewed by Reuters. 
In an assertive move for Luxembourg, a country of just 626,000 people but a founder member of the European Union, Asselborn urged the bloc to ""speak with a strong and unified voice"" and defend a world ""where the rule of law prevails, not the rule of the strongest"".
Trump's highly contested plan duly offered U.S. recognition of Israel’s settlements dotted across the West Bank, and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley -- land captured in the 1967 Middle East war and claimed by Palestinians for their own future state. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has set July 1 as the date to begin moving forward on the annexation.
The United Nations Security Council has said that settlements violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which has been ratified by 192 nations and stipulates that a country cannot ""deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies"". Israel disputes this, citing biblical, historical and political connections to the land.
Trump has reversed decades of U.S.-led diplomacy by backing Israeli annexation, with a White House statement arguing that his plan ""creates a path to prosperity, security, and dignity for all involved"". European Union officials fear an Israeli unilateral move will undermine years of peace-making efforts.   
""The prospect of a viable two-state solution is the only way forward to ensure peace,"" Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, the EU representative to the West Bank and Gaza, told Reuters.
However, a Reuters examination based on internal documents and interviews with more than two dozen diplomats and officials shows there is no clear EU strategy either on how to stop Israel's plan or to respond in a meaningful way if annexation goes ahead.
Where once the European Union spoke with unanimity on Middle East peace, with bigger nations like France and Britain able to dominate discussion, such unity has proved hard to maintain over the past decade as smaller countries became more assertive and Israel successfully forged strong ties with newer member states, EU diplomats said. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office declined requests for comment on efforts to secure backing within Europe for annexation. An Israeli official familiar with the issue said Europe and Israel shared many partnerships in various fields and that it was important not to undermine them. ""In our view, partners should not threaten each other or speak above each other's heads,"" the official said.
A senior EU diplomat, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, acknowledged that the bloc will almost certainly fail to reach the unanimity required for joint action should annexation take place. 
""It's hell in the EU to try to get a common position on this,"" the diplomat said.   
   
GUILT
With possible annexation looming, a group of at least eight smaller EU states, led by Luxembourg, is attempting to take on Netanyahu, seeing itself as the conscience of Europe and emphasizing the need to stand up for international law in part because the bloc is itself bound together by laws.
Standing with Luxembourg are Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Malta and Finland, EU diplomats say.
While most are diplomatic minnows, they have equal say in the EU's consensus-based, decision-making councils. In Middle East policy, they feel the weight of history far less than Europe's most powerful nation, Germany, which still carries the burden of guilt over the Nazi crimes of World War Two.
Ranged against Luxembourg and its allies are countries including Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Greece, Latvia, Cyprus and Poland, all of which, to one extent or another, have shown themselves ready to defend Israel's interests, according to diplomats, cables and meeting minutes detailing the diplomatic discussions among the EU's 27 governments in Brussels.
Internal EU minutes from meetings on May 6 and May 13, when EU envoys discussed Asselborn's call to action, highlight the split. 
""No unilateral steps,"" the Czech envoy told the May 13 gathering, ruling out the prospect of the EU adopting punitive measures should Israel press ahead with annexation. Hungary then blocked any attempt to draw up a joint statement for a meeting of EU foreign ministers on May 15.
Of the bigger EU states, France, with the largest Jewish and Arab populations in Europe, and Spain have largely aligned with Luxembourg, but they maintain a lower profile in discussions, four EU diplomats said. Both countries have spoken out publicly against annexation, but have not said how they might respond.
Denmark and the Netherlands sit in the middle along with Germany and Italy, critical of Israel at times but not overtly pro-Palestinian. One senior EU diplomat said Berlin was against annexation and if Israel proceeded with its plan, it would come ""at a price"". However, the diplomat said EU economic sanctions were simply too sensitive for Berlin to consider. ""Germany will not push for that.""
Asselborn, 71, who has served as Luxembourg's foreign minister since mid-2004, said the issue of annexation went beyond the Middle East.
""We cannot cut international law into pieces. There are principles that need to be upheld,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview.
""You're speaking to a Luxembourger. I can tell you, our country is a small country, but we were occupied twice in the 20th century. Without respect for international law, we would no longer exist,"" he said.   
   
LEVERAGE 
The European Union is Israel's largest trading partner, with nearly a third of Israel's exports going to the bloc. Belgium is among the countries that feels the EU could use this leverage, and has asked the European Commission, the EU's executive, to draw up a list of possible punitive measures on Israel, including on trade, an EU diplomat said.
Amongst possible countermeasures being discussed in private in Brussels are suspending Israel's privileged EU trade agreement, banning imports from settlements, and cutting Israel out of scientific research and student exchange programmes, EU diplomats say.
In his December letter to other EU ministers, Asselborn suggested nations should consider a unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state – something only Sweden has done to date.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in February that annexation ""if implemented, could not pass unchallenged"". However, the lack of consensus means he has been unable to flesh out what any such challenge might contain.
By contrast, the EU agreed swiftly in 2014 to impose hefty economic sanctions targeting Russia's financial, energy and defence sectors when Moscow seized the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine – land that Russia still holds.
""Big countries never had a problem imposing counter measures against Russia over Crimea's annexation, so why can they not do it on Israel? We need coherence,"" Simon Moutquin, a Belgian Green lawmaker, told Reuters.   
EU diplomats, officials and experts point to a strong presence of pro-Israel advocates in Brussels, with at least 10 lobby groups opening offices in the city over the past 17 years as Israel looked to bolster its international image in the wake of the second Palestinian intifada and three wars in Gaza. Israel's own diplomats are also viewed as extremely efficient.
""The Israelis are very active in Brussels,"" said European parliamentarian Antonio Lopez-Isturiz White, a Spaniard who chairs the assembly's delegation with Israel.
Perhaps the most significant relationship Israel has forged over the past decade is that with Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, EU diplomats say. Through Hungary, Israel's ties have improved with the Visegrad Group, an alliance combining Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland, which carries its own weight within the EU.
In Orban, Netanyahu has found an ally prepared to block statements or actions critical of Israel, even in the face of heavy pressure from other European capitals, EU diplomats say. Thanks in part to his blocking tactics, the EU has not been able to agree to a legally binding position on the Middle East peace process since 2016. 

""Hungary ... will continue to oppose unilateral and unjust international political approaches against Israel,"" Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on June 10, as Germany’s foreign minister flew for talks to Jerusalem to warn against annexation.

48,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 07:36AM ET</span>","In West Bank, Israeli settler leaders complicate annexation plan","By Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
ITAMAR, West Bank (Reuters) - Jewish settler leaders who resist the creation of a Palestinian state are complicating Israel's plans to annex scores of settlements in the occupied West Bank under U.S. President Donald Trump's peace blueprint. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is due next month to discuss the annexation plan, under which Israel would apply sovereignty over 30% of the West Bank - in areas where most of its about 130 settlements are located. 
The plan is opposed by the Palestinians, who seek a state in all of the West Bank, as well as in the Gaza Strip, with East Jerusalem as a capital. Most world powers agree.
The plan also faces resistance from settler leaders who oppose Trump's calls for a future Palestinian state that would envelop at least 15 Jewish settlements - despite U.S. guarantees of protection for, and access to, the future ""enclaves"".
""We're talking about strangling a community,"" said Hananel Elkayam, mayor of Itamar settlement, one of the 15 named in the plan.
In misgivings echoed in the other 14, Elkayam predicted residents would be unable to commute to jobs through territory that would be in a new Palestinian state, would by denied construction and would be at greater risk of attack than now. 
""I would tell (Trump): Thanks very much for the plan, thanks very much for the great affection for the Jewish people (but) we'll set our own destiny,"" Elkayam said.
KEEPING DOOR TO DIPLOMACY OPEN 
U.S. officials will this week discuss whether to give Israel the green light for annexation moves seen by the Palestinians and many other countries as illegal land-grabs.
Israel's West Bank settlements were built by successive governments on land captured in a 1967 war. More than 400,000 Israelis now live there, with another 200,000 in East Jerusalem, which was also taken in 1967.
A Direct Poll survey last week found 56.8% of settlers support the Trump plan, more than the Israeli average.
Elkayam and other settler leaders say that backing is for annexation - on condition that plans for Palestinian statehood are scrapped.
Israeli and U.S. officials want to be seen as keeping a door open to diplomacy. Where that door might lead worries Yochai Damri, head of a regional council that includes four of the 15 listed settlements.
Damri sees Palestinian statehood becoming more likely if the Republican president is defeated by Democrat Joe Biden in November's U.S. election, and if, or when, Netanyahu is succeeded by centrist Benny Gantz, the Israeli premier's partner in a fragile unity government.

The Trump plan says residents of the future enclaves can stay put ""unless they choose otherwise"". Damri and other settlers hear in that a hint that they should quit to make way for Palestinian territorial contiguity.

HTS is a jihadist group that controls parts of Syria's northwest, a rebel-held area still at war with Damascus. Formerly known as the Nusra Front, it has been designated a terrorist group by the United States, Turkey and others.
Tauqir Sharif, a relief worker with the group Live Updates From Syria (LUFS), was captured in Atmeh, a town north of Idlib province near the Turkish border, according to activists in the area.
""LUFS team member...was kidnapped tonight around 9.30PM by HTS and taken to an unknown location,"" the group wrote in an Instagram post.
On its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, LUFS describes itself as a Muslim Western charity supporting displaced people in Syria.
The motive for his seizure was not immediately clear.
Sharif has been living in Syria since 2013, according to a LUFS post on YouTube.
Syria's northwest is home to a mix of Islamist militant and opposition groups, many of which have fled other parts of Syria as President Bashar al-Assad, with Russian backing, has seized back territory during the roughly nine-year-old war.
The area is also populated by hundreds of thousands of internally displaced persons that rely heavily on humanitarian assistance.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will hold general elections next month after its prime minister opted to go ahead with a vote that opposition parties and rights groups have criticised as opportunistic and unsafe because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
WHEN?
The election is to be held on July 10, and candidates have to submit nomination papers on June 30. 
The next general election could have been held as late as April 2021. But Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Tuesday it was not clear when the pandemic would end and his government needed a fresh mandate to steer Singapore through the social and economic challenges it posed.
WHAT PRECAUTIONS WILL BE TAKEN?
Lee said the virus situation in the city-state, which has recorded some of Asia's highest infection rates, fuelled by outbreaks in migrant workers' dormitories, had stabilised and he was satisfied an election could be held safely. 
Authorities have outlined safety measures such as temperature screening and social distancing at polling stations, rubber gloves for handling ballot papers, and specific voting times for seniors. Rules for sick or quarantined voters have yet to be finalised, but Singapore has said it will not allow mail-in ballots. 
Singapore will not allow physical rallies as it now limits public gatherings to five people.
WHO ELSE HAS VOTED DURING THE PANDEMIC?
South Korea held parliamentary elections in April with stringent safety measures, and saw its highest turnout since 1992. Nearly 3,000 virus patients were allowed to vote by mail or in person, using special booths, while more than 13,000 in self-quarantine cast ballots after polls closed.
Primary elections have been held in several U.S. states ahead of a planned Nov. 3 election, while Serbia recently headed to the polls in Europe's first post-lockdown election.
WHO IS CONTESTING?
Lee's People's Action Party, which has won every election since Singapore's independence in 1965 and has never seen its vote share drop below 60%, is expected to win comfortably.
The main opposition Workers' Party is likely to pose the stiffest challenge, but holds only six of parliament's 89 elected seats. 
The new Progress Singapore Party, led by former PAP lawmaker and presidential candidate Tan Cheng Bock, could cause an upset in a few seats, and has won backing from the prime minister's estranged brother.
WHAT'S AT STAKE?
The election is seen as a litmus test for Singapore's new generation of leaders, with Lee, a scion of the city-state's founding family, planning to step down in the coming years.
While surveys show government satisfaction is high, people are most concerned about living costs and the gap between rich and poor in the wealthy city-state, a recent poll by BlackBox Research showed.
Even small shifts in support for the ruling party can spur policy changes that affect many international firms based in the Asian business hub.
After its worst result in 2011, although it still secured 60% of the vote, the PAP accelerated foreign labour curbs to allay citizens' unease about immigration levels and the impact on job prospects and property prices.
CRITICISMS?
Some opposition parties have opposed holding an election during the pandemic as detrimental to public health and distracting from government efforts to combat the virus.
Rights groups have long criticised Singapore's electoral process for favouring the ruling party. Special virus-related measures to limit physical campaigning and rallies threaten to further disadvantage smaller parties, ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights said last week.

The Elections Department said it was committed to ensuring ""free and fair"" elections and was providing alternatives for political parties and candidates to reach voters via additional television broadcasts and livestreaming.

Whelan will therefore not appeal his espionage conviction but will instead hold consultations with Western diplomats about the merits of asking President Vladimir Putin to pardon him, the lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, was quoted as saying.
Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, was detained by agents from Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28, 2018. 
Russia says Whelan, 50, was caught with a computer flash drive containing classified information.
Whelan, who pleaded not guilty, said he was set up in a sting operation and had thought the drive, given to him by a Russian acquaintance, contained holiday photos.
""Today we met him (Whelan) in the detention facility and after a discussion it was decided not to appeal the verdict because he doesn't believe in Russian justice,"" Interfax quoted Zherebenkov as saying.
""He hopes that he will be swapped for Russians in the near future who have been convicted in the United States.""
Zherebenkov has previously said he believes Moscow wants to exchange Whelan for two Russians held in U.S. prisons - arms dealer Viktor Bout and a pilot named Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was convicted of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine.
Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday the Kremlin had noted Whelan's decision not to appeal his conviction, but declined to comment further.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week after the court sentenced Whelan to 16 years in jail that the verdict had caused outrage in Washington. The U.S. ambassador to Moscow, John Sullivan, called his trial ""a mockery of justice"".

52,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 23, 2020 06:36AM ET</span>",Generation COVID: The Spanish learners lost to lockdown,"By Sonya Dowsett
MADRID (Reuters) - Out of 31 pupils in one of Madrid teacher Clara Mijares' online classes last month, eight were missing. Two had not been seen for some time, she said, adding that this is a fairly typical ratio these days for her lockdown sessions for 12 to 16-year-olds.
Some of those who had made it to that pastoral meeting of El Espinillo secondary school in Madrid kept their webcams disabled. They were in no rush to answer when she asked how they were doing. 
""Don't just say 'good,'"" she coaxed the screen of 13-year-olds. ""Use another word."" Eventually, more considered responses trickled through her speaker: Tired. Bored. Haven't left home for exercise. Prefer to stay indoors.
""The charm of being in a class has been lost,"" Mijares said. 
In recent months it's a scene played out in homes worldwide, as United Nations data suggests over 1.5 billion children were affected by school closures to curb the spread of COVID-19. From Shanghai to California, students have been kept out of classrooms, and attendance at online sessions has thinned. 
But as the school year comes to an end and countries count the cost of the lost learning, Spanish government data points to a particularly damaging consequence of the isolation caused by the pandemic: The disenfranchisement of ever more young people, particularly those on low incomes, such as the children of those who are caring for the vulnerable.
Spain has had more than 260,000 cases of COVID-19 according to a Reuters tally - the second-highest total in Europe after the United Kingdom. But unlike other countries including Britain, in Spain all schools closed during lockdown. There was no skeleton service for children of key personnel like health workers.
Since March, all educational centres including primary, secondary and universities have been closed, leaving 9.5 million students learning from home. Most schools will not open for all pupils until the new academic year starts in September. 
In Spain, school drop-out rates were already the highest in the European Union - 17.3% in 2019. Now, the government estimates up to 12% of school children have dropped out of distance-learning during the 14-week lockdown - nearly one million pupils. 
Mijares' school serves a working-class district - pupils range from white-collar households to families on state aid, says headmistress Toni Garcia. As the lockdown dragged on, Mijares realised she would have to find different ways to reach students, including making landline calls to them.
""I spoke to families who said they were overwhelmed by all the assignments and all the emails,"" she said, sitting in her brother's old bedroom which she has converted into her office since moving back in with her parents during lockdown.
""One of my tasks has been to call and explain how to read and send an email from a mobile phone."" 
In lockdown, limited access to the internet creates a social barrier. According to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) from 2015, more than 90% of disadvantaged students in countries such as Canada, Korea and Australia had internet access. But disadvantaged students in Spain were nearly 14% less likely than rich ones to get online. That gap was even wider in the United States and Russia, where fewer than one in five disadvantaged students had internet access. 
Spain's low-income learners are already faring worse than many in Europe. The financial crisis of 2008-2014 laid off over 2 million workers and even today, despite years of strong economic growth, the country has the EU's second-highest unemployment rate after Greece. There are 2.2 million children at risk of poverty and exclusion in Spain - over a quarter of the total child population, according to calculations by humanitarian group Save the Children. 
The income difference between the richest fifth of Spain's population and the poorest - a measure of inequality - is among the highest in Europe and has grown over the last decade, according to the European Anti-Poverty Network. The widening gulf poses crucial questions for economic growth and social stability.
""It's the most worrying fact about Spain - the very high percentage of (early school) leavers,"" Olivier De Schutter, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, told Reuters.
""The role the school should normally play - as a force for social mobility and a way to equalise chances in life - is much more difficult to play if you close down the school,"" he said. Continued disruption may increase the gap, he said.
The government said physical presence in classrooms will be the general standard when schools reopen. It is keen for all children to be able to return to the classroom because of the role schools play in eliminating inequality, said education ministry spokeswoman Mar Hedo. 
""EVERYTHING IS WEIGHING ON ME""
The school closures have left many struggling. Single mother Saida Juarez, 50, works as a care home assistant in Vallecas, a suburb of Madrid. When the pandemic struck, she isolated herself from her two sons within her flat to cut the risk of infecting them.
For 10 weeks, she had no physical contact with either of the boys, who are 16 and 10. 
The children have work sent to them by email which they receive by mobile phone. When they've finished, they take photos which they send back for marking. Juarez has not been able to help them with their schoolwork.
""I couldn't go near them,"" she said, speaking in the living room of her flat. 
Her eldest son Gabriel, who attends a different school than the one Mijares teaches at, enters his final year of compulsory education next year and hopes eventually to join the police. Since lockdown he has been looking after his younger brother, Matias, while his mother works from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.
At first when Juarez came home, she would shower, douse herself in liquid sanitiser and go to the kitchen to prepare meals for the boys, she said. She spent the rest of the evening in her room, communicating with them by phone.
""I was scared that I was bringing the virus home,"" she said. ""It was so hard and painful not to have contact.""
Later that month, she fell ill herself, was bed-ridden for 10 days and stayed off work for around a month, self-isolating in her bedroom. The health service asked her to stay at home and checked her regularly by phone. Weeks later, she was tested for COVID-19 and the result came back negative. 
Gabriel did the shopping and cooking during that time and helped Matias with his schoolwork, as well as doing his own. He misses school, he said, because it's harder to ask teachers for help. He emailed his teachers, but their answers came more slowly than they would in class. 
There are times, Gabriel said, when he gets up and has to make breakfast, put the house in order, take their pet dog out and only then get to his school work. ""I get up tired and it's like everything is weighing on me,"" he said, sitting with his brother and friends in masks at the dining room table where he studies.
When Spaniards were first allowed out of their houses for exercise in early May, Gabriel said he met a friend who came to help him with his studies. But after so long without contact, he didn't know what to say or how to act.
""It's going to be hard to go back to interacting with people because I've been so long without speaking to anyone.""
""HOW DOES THIS WORK?""
According to government statistics, public investment in education in Spain has fallen since 2009 to 4.23% of GDP in 2018 - a cut of around 3 billion euros. Since schools shut down, the fact that the most vulnerable families do not have computing resources has added to the difficulty. 
In a child support centre in Madrid in mid-May, care assistant Turia was one of those who came to collect a tablet - one of 1,000 such devices donated in a Madrid council scheme. 
Turia, who declined to give her second name, said she works from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. as an assistant to an elderly person with Alzheimer's and helps her two children with their school work when she gets home. She photographs the completed work and sends it back to the teachers.
There are over 1 million children in school in Madrid, where the severe poverty rate had more than doubled in a decade to 7.8 percent in 2017, according to a U.N. report from February. The minimum salary in Spain is 950 euros per month, but social security benefits, administered regionally, are around half that. 
Madrid's scheme provides just 400 euros a month for a single person, the lowest in the country, government figures show. At the same time Spain is one of the most expensive countries in Europe for fixed broadband, according to a 2020 study by the European Commission. 
The education ministry said it is giving more equipment to schools and working to train teachers, students and their families how to use them. But that does not help with internet access charges, and many poorer households are far behind on technical know-how, teachers say and studies show. 
About a half-dozen families came to Madrid's child support centre that day to pick up tablets. Most said they had only a cellphone and many were not confident about using the technology.

As Turia took the computer from the worker distributing the tablets, she asked: ""How does this work?""

BEIJING (Reuters) - The U.S. and Chinese militaries must keep communication channels open and take steps to prevent conflict even as ties worsen, an influential Chinese government think tank said on Tuesday, with one adviser suggesting an invitation to a major U.S. drill.
Relations between the two largest economies have nosedived in recent months as they argue over everything from trade to the coronavirus, with China also angered by U.S. military activity in the disputed South China Sea and near Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
In a report, China's National Institute for South China Seas, struck a more moderate tone than recent denunciations of Washington by Beijing, warning that worsening military ties would boost the possibility of armed conflict or crisis.
The Trump administration has said it is in a ""great-power competition"" with China and has steadily increased the number of soldiers stationed in the Asia-Pacific region to 375,000, including 60% of its Navy ships, the report said. 
""Stable military relations ... must become the stabilising factor in bilateral relations,"" institute head Wu Shicun told a media briefing.
The report urged both sides to keep open channels of communication, such as a hotline set up in 2008 between their defence departments. 
Government adviser Zhu Feng, the dean of the Institute of International Studies at Nanjing University, said communication was important to prevent misjudgement.
""If we don't communicate, the China-U.S. relationship will become very childish,"" he said at the conference.
""We are both mature big powers and must not handle bilateral relations by criticising and attacking each other in an emotional way.""
Since the formation of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in 2018 after a major restructuring, he said, it has had almost no contact with its Chinese counterpart. 
Zhu urged Washington to invite China to join RIMPAC, the world's largest multilateral maritime warfare exercise, as an ""acquaintance-building measure"" for soldiers from both sides.
The United States disinvited China in 2018 as punishment for activities in the South China Sea.
Last month, Taiwan's defence minister said it was also ""seeking an opportunity"" to participate.

Guetersloh is the first area in Germany to go back into lockdown after the authorities began gradually lifting restrictive measures at the end of April.
State premier Armin Laschet, who had led calls for Germany to ease lockdown measures, said bars, museums, galleries, cinemas, sports halls, gyms and swimming pools in Guetersloh would be closed, and picnics and barbeques prohibited.
About 360,000 people live in Guetersloh.
""This is a limited measure of caution. We will lift the measure as soon as possible, when we have certainty about the safety of the infection,"" Laschet told a news conference. ""It is a preventative measure.""
More than 1,500 workers at a meat processing plant in Guetersloh had tested positive for the coronavirus, plus some of their family members and 24 people who had no connection to the plant, he said.
Laschet is a leading contender to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel when her fourth term in office expires next year. Further outbreaks of the virus in his state, Germany's most populous, could damage his chances.
Earlier on Tuesday, the head of the Robert Koch Institute for public health, Lothar Wieler, said the coronavirus reproduction rate in Germany is currently estimated at 2.76, probably mainly due to local outbreaks.
A reproduction rate, or 'R', of 2.76 means that 100 people who contracted the virus infect, on average, 276 others.
Wieler said Germany is at risk of a second coronavirus wave but added he was optimistic it could be prevented.

Zuma is being tried on 16 charges relating to a $2 billion arms deal with French defence firm Thales in 1999, when Zuma was deputy president.
The charges were reinstated in March 2018, a month after the ruling African National Congress (ANC) party kicked him out of office after a presidency marked by graft allegations and sovereign credit rating downgrades. 
The former leader, in power between 2009 and 2018, rejects all allegations as a politically motivated witch-hunt. But the case is a rare example of an African judicial system seeking to prosecute a former leader for alleged wrongdoing. 
Zuma wore a dark grey suit at the court in Pietermaritzburg and looked tense, frequently clicking his jaw.
Much of Tuesday's pre-trial hearing was focused on fixing a date for the trial to continue after multiple efforts by Zuma to cancel or delay it. 
Judge Dhaya Pillay did not set a date for the trial proper to start. She adjourned the proceedings until Sept. 8.
The court in November rejected Zuma's application for a permanent stay of prosecution, and in February issued an arrest warrant for him.
Zuma is accused of accepting 500,000 rand ($34,000) annually from Thales from 1999, in exchange for protecting the company from an investigation into the deal.
Thales, known as Thompson-CSF at the time, has said it had no knowledge of any transgressions by any of its employees in relation to the award of the contracts.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will head to the polls on July 10 after its prime minister said he was satisfied a ballot could be held safely despite criticism that such a move might endanger voters during the coronavirus pandemic.
The tiny city-state, which has one of Asia's highest tallies of COVID-19, largely fuelled by mass outbreaks in migrant workers' dormitories, eased strict lockdown rules last week that had been in place for more than two months. 
""I have decided to hold the general election now,"" Lee Hsien Loong said in an address to the nation.
""We are still in the midst of COVID-19, so it will not be a normal election campaign,"" Lee added, saying he was satisfied the election could be carried out safely and that parties could campaign effectively.
June 30 has been set as the nomination day for candidates. 
The government was required to call an election by April, 2021, but there had been persistent speculation that Lee would call a vote sooner.
Lee, whose party has comfortably won every election in Singapore since its independence in 1965, said the virus situation had stabilised but challenges lay ahead and his government needed a fresh mandate.
Some opposition parties have said holding a vote during the pandemic could hit public health and distract from government efforts to tackle the virus. 
South Korea held elections in April, while several U.S. states have held primaries ahead of a planned Nov. 3 election and Serbia recently voted in Europe's first post-lockdown ballot.
Rights groups, such as ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights, have long criticised Singapore's electoral process for favouring the ruling party.
Last week the group said virus-related measures that limit physical campaigning and rallies could further disadvantage smaller parties.
Singapore's elections department says it is committed to holding a ""free and fair"" vote, providing alternatives for political parties to reach out to voters, through additional television broadcasts and live-streaming venues.  
Having won plaudits for its early containment efforts, Singapore imposed one of the world's strictest lockdowns to tackle a surge in imported cases and outbreaks in cramped workers' dormitories.

China's air force has buzzed Taiwan at least eight times in the past two weeks, Taiwan's military says, sending fighters and bombers into Taiwan's air defence identification zone where they have been warned off by patrolling Taiwanese jets.
""China is very big, and has never given up the use of force to deal with Taiwan. China has always, with such a serious epidemic, sent their aircraft and ships around Taiwan, really disturbing Taiwan,"" Su said, adding that Taiwan only wants to be a ""contributor to regional peace"".
""At this time it seems a second wave is happening in China's Beijing. China, as a large country, should put its national strength into looking after people, reducing the impact of the epidemic and safeguarding regional peace. That would be better.""
A new cluster of infections linked to a sprawling wholesale food centre erupted almost two weeks ago in the Chinese capital, a city of more than 20 million people. The new coronavirus was first reported in China's Wuhan late last year.
China claims Taiwan as its own territory, and has previously said its drills near the island are routine and designed to show its determination to protect its sovereignty. Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan becoming independent.

China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, who it accuses of being a separatist intent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese military commanders have agreed to disengage forces facing off over a disputed stretch of border where a clash last week left 20 Indian soldiers dead, an Indian government source in New Delhi said on Tuesday.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the two sides had agreed to take measures to ease tensions.
""There was a mutual consensus to disengage,"" the Indian source said, commenting on the outcome of a meeting between commanders on border on Monday that lasted almost 11 hours. 
China's Zhao described recent media reports of 40 Chinese casualties in the clash as ""fake news"". 
China has not disclosed how many casualties its side suffered in the brutal fighting on June 15, when soldiers beat each other with rocks and wooden sticks embedded with nails, while observing a long-held protocol to avoid using firearms.
Troops from the nuclear-armed neighbours have been facing-off in several areas in the Ladakh region in the western Himalayas since last month, and the clash in the Galwan valley last week was the deadliest in more than five decades.
Yet, the Indian source said Monday's parley on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the de facto border, was conducted in a ""cordial, positive and constructive atmosphere."" 
""Modalities for disengagement from all friction areas in Eastern Ladakh were discussed and will be taken forward by both the sides,"" the Indian source said.
In previous rounds of talks, China had asked India to stop all construction work in what it says is Chinese territory.

For its part, India has been pushing China to withdraw its troops back to where they were in April.

MAGELANG, Indonesia (Reuters) - When the coronavirus pandemic forced his school on Indonesia's Java island to shut, teacher Henrikus Suroto knew he could not rely on hosting online lessons for pupils living in remote areas lacking internet access or even a phone signal. 
Instead, to ensure they could keep studying, the 57-year-old elementary school teacher decided to go to them - spending about six hours a day traveling by motorbike and on foot to reach a handful of remote communities in the hilly Magelang area of Central Java. 
""I'm a teacher, it is my responsibility to do this. I must accompany and teach my students,"" said Suroto, whose only complaint is that it becomes particularly difficult trudging up and down steep valleys in the rain.
In the rural district where he works, many of the households are not setup to use technology, as is the case in large parts of the sprawling archipelago of more than 260 million people. 
Indonesia has around 60 million households, but only about one in six had an internet connection in mid-2019, according to the Association of Internet Service Providers Indonesia (APJII). 
""Well, I do not know what the internet is and other sophisticated devices that are often used nowadays,"" said Martinus Kartijo, the father of one of the pupils. 
Meanwhile, Arnasih, a mother of another pupil, appreciates the influence Suroto has on the children. 
""The children listen and obey orders from their teachers, compared to their parents,"" she said. 
For their part, students say they welcome the face-to-face meetings with Suroto, who takes precautions such as wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing for lessons. 

""Studying at home sometimes can be difficult, sometimes is easy, but if Mr Suroto is there all subjects become easy,"" saidAlbertus Jonas Wiratama, a third-grade student.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is reinstalling loudspeakers blaring propaganda across the border in its latest step away from inter-Korean peace agreements, prompting the South's military to explore similar moves, a South Korean military source said on Tuesday. 
Tension between the two Koreas has risen in recent weeks after the North blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border, declared an end to dialogue and threatened military action. 
North Korea's military was seen putting up loudspeakers near the demilitarised zone (DMZ). Such systems were taken down after the two Koreas signed an accord in 2018 to cease ""all hostile acts,"" the military official said. 
""We're also considering reinstalling our own loudspeakers,"" he said. ""But the North hasn't begun any broadcast yet, and we're just getting ready to be able to counteract at any time."" 
A spokeswoman at Seoul's defence ministry declined to confirm North Korea's moves but reiterated at a regular briefing that Pyongyang would ""have to pay for the consequences"" if it continues to defy joint efforts to foster peace.
The two countries have for decades pumped out propaganda from huge banks of speakers as a form of psychological warfare. The South aired a blend of news, Korean pop songs and criticism of the northern regime, while the North blasted the South and praised its own socialist system.
Commercial satellite imagery of the liaison office site on Monday showed that the building remained standing, but had been heavily damaged.
Analysts at U.S.-based 38 North, which tracks North Korea, said last week that the explosion ""was clearly not a controlled detonation, as the building was not levelled and there was significant collateral damage to the adjacent buildings.""
The North began taking its recent actions as it denounced North Korean defectors in the South sending propaganda leaflets across the border. 
Several defector-led groups have regularly sent flyers, food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news, usually by balloon or in bottles in rivers.
One group, led by Park Sang-hak, who fled the isolated state in 2000, said on Tuesday it flew 20 balloons containing 500,000 leaflets, 500 booklets on South Korea and 2,000 $1 bills. 
South Korea's government has pursued legal action to stop such activities, citing safety concerns for residents in border towns, but controversy remains over whether it violates the country's protections for freedom of expression. 
Seoul's Unification Ministry handling inter-Korean affairs issued a statement vowing a stern response to the leaflet launches by Park's group. 

Pyongyang's state media said on Monday angry North Koreans have also prepared some 12 million leaflets to be sent back.

The Saudi-led coalition battling the group for five years said it had intercepted a ballistic missile fired by the Houthis towards Riyadh, the Saudi capital, on Tuesday.
A Reuters witness in Riyadh heard two loud blasts and saw billows of smoke in the sky over the city close to dawn.
Violence between the two sides has surged after the expiry last month of a six-week ceasefire prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, with the Houthis launching missiles and drones towards Saudi cities and the coalition responding with air strikes.
Al Masirah said the Houthi's military spokesman would make an announcement in the next few hours. 
Coalition spokesman Turki al-Malki said its forces had intercepted and destroyed a Houthi missile launched at Riyadh in a ""deliberate hostile action designed to target civilians"".
In a statement on Saudi state news agency SPA, he said the coalition had intercepted on Tuesday three Houthi missiles fired towards the southern border cities of Najran and Jizan, as well as several armed drones launched towards the kingdom late on Monday.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The conflict is largely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

""Negotiations over the cost of hosting (American troops) have not started yet,"" Defence Minister Taro Kono told a regular news conference on Tuesday. ""The Japanese government has not received any request from the United States with regard to this issue.""
The current agreement that covers the 54,000 U.S. troops stationed in Japan expires in March 2021.
Kono was asked about a Kyodo News report citing Bolton's upcoming book ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir"", in which he writes that he relayed Trump's request to a senior Japanese government official for the $8 billion payment during a trip to Japan last July. The memoir is due for publication on Tuesday.
Asked whether he thought the current cost of hosting the U.S. military was appropriate, Kono said: ""The Japan-U.S. alliance is a public asset that contributes to this region's peace and stability. An arrangement that is lucrative for one side won't last long.""
Kono said he could not comment specifically on what Bolton had written since he had been unsuccessful so far in getting a copy of the book.

Bolton's reported claim is in line with a Foreign Policy report last year that Trump sought a quadrupling of annual payments to around $8 billion as part of his efforts to push its allies to hike their defence spending.

Lam said that, as chief executive, she would instead appoint a panel of judges for all courts based on recommendations from a judicial body. 
""When one day there is national security cases, the responsibility to assign which judge on that list to handle a case still lies on the judiciary of Hong Kong,"" Lam told reporters on Tuesday. ""The Executive is not responsible for that.""
The planned national security law has stoked fears among democracy activists in Hong Kong and some foreign governments that Beijing is further eroding extensive autonomy promised when Britain handed it back to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula in 1997.
The city's common law-based legal system is widely seen as the bedrock of that formula, underpinning its status as a global financial hub. 
China says the national security law, which is expected to be passed next week, will target only a small group of troublemakers as it tackles separatism, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong.
However, the full details of the legislation have not been made public and Lam acknowledged on Tuesday she also is yet to view the entire document. 
Reports in Chinese state media over the weekend had suggested Lam could select judges for related cases, triggering alarm among some lawyers who called it a serious challenge to Hong Kong's coveted judicial independence.
Critics have also raised concerns that the law will exclude foreign judges, commonly used in Hong Kong, from presiding over national security cases. The fear is that could leave judges more favourable to Beijing to handle those cases.
""In the released details of the legislation, the problem concerning nationality of judges handling national security cases is not yet mentioned,"" Lam said. 

The top decision-making body of China's parliament has scheduled another meeting for June 28-30 and the law, which will pave the way for the biggest change to the city's way of life, is expected to be enacted then.

State prosecutors in the state of Oaxaca said the bodies of 13 men and two women were identified as victims of the attacks over Sunday night and Monday morning in the municipality of San Mateo del Mar, east of the Pacific port of Salina Cruz.
The San Mateo del Mar municipal government said in a statement that the attack was orchestrated by at least six armed people with the support of a suspected local crime boss.
In a separate statement, Oaxaca state prosecutors said investigations are under way into what sparked the violence in Huazantlan del Rio, a local village of Ikoots indigenous origin. Officials are still investigating whether the attackers had guns.
The two women killed had been protesting against abuses by one of the suspected attackers, who described himself as a representative of Huazantlan del Rio, the municipal government said.
The conflict stemmed from road blocks organized in recent weeks by people claiming to represent Huazantlan del Rio authorities who wanted to stir up trouble for their own ends, the municipal government said, without giving more details.
The attackers tortured and burned alive a number of their victims, the municipal government said. Photos of some of the victims' partly burned corpses were published on social media. One of the dead men appeared to have been beaten with bricks.
A state official said the photos were genuine.
No arrests have yet been made, the official added.
San Mateo del Mar lies on a coastal spit, and the area has suffered from territorial disputes and conflict over rights of way for many years, according to the state official.

The area around the isthmus of Tehuantepec has also become known in recent years for land disputes over infrastructure projects.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it will start treating four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies, alleging they are mouthpieces for Beijing, in a move that is likely to further sour already fraught ties between the world's top two economies.
David Stilwell, the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, told reporters the designation would affect China Central Television, the China News Service, the People's Daily and the Global Times, and reflected their real status as ""propaganda outlets"" under the control of the Chinese Communist Party.
""The Communist Party does not just exercise operational control over these propaganda entities, but it has full editorial control over their content,"" Stilwell said in a teleconference with reporters.
China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""This is a very absurd decision,"" Global Times editor-in-Chief Hu Xijin said on Twitter. ""China-US relation is so tense that market-oriented media like the Global Times has been affected. It is regrettable.""
The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.
Plans for the new media outlet designations were first reported by Reuters earlier this month.
U.S.-China relations are at their lowest ebb in years as President Donald Trump takes a tough line on China ahead of his Nov. 3 re-election bid. The world's top two economies are also at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China's increasing encroachment into Hong Kong. 
In February the State Department declared five other Chinese outlets as foreign embassies, a designation that requires the outlets to inform the U.S. State Department of their personnel rosters and real-estate holdings.
In March, Washington also said it was slashing the number of journalists allowed to work at U.S. offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160 due to Beijing's ""long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.""
In response, China expelled about a dozen American correspondents with the New York Times, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.
Stilwell said Monday's action was not intended to reduce journalistic activity by foreign media outlets and that the United States remained committed to press freedom. 
During the briefing, Stilwell and State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus declined to take a question from Reuters on how U.S. allies in Asia had reacted to a memoir by Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, saying it was not the intended subject of the briefing.
Ortagus asked that a Reuters reporter's line be muted when he again pursued the question on Bolton.
In response to a follow-up question, Stilwell said he was too busy to pay attention to the book.
The book, excerpts of which have already been widely circulated, says Trump solicited President Xi Jinping's help to win re-election and details meetings between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, including how their second summit in Vietnam fell apart.

Trump has said Bolton is disgruntled and a liar.

""These charges are politically motivated and completely groundless,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Chinese prosecutors announced the charges on Friday against former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, who were arrested in late 2018.
The two men were detained shortly after Canadian police detained Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, on a U.S. warrant.
Canada - which says it cannot interfere in the extradition process - has so far asked allies to put pressure on Beijing to free the two men, but dismisses talk of sanctions.
Kovrig's wife, Vina Nadjibulla, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp that Ottawa could be doing more for her husband, saying words were no longer enough.
""He has been confined to a single cell this entire time. He has not gone outside, he has not seen a tree or had fresh air to breathe for 560 days,"" said Nadjibulla.
She said she had obtained a legal opinion in Canada that confirmed Justice Minister David Lametti could formally end the extradition process against Meng. 
She did not give details and Lametti's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau thanked Pompeo and nations that recently denounced China's treatment of the two men, saying it was important for like-minded nations to show solidarity.
He also dismissed a suggestion that Ottawa try to exchange Meng for the two detained men, saying that would weaken Canada's values and the justice system.

Trudeau said the two cases were clearly linked. Earlier in the day, China said they were unrelated and repeated calls for Meng's release.

74,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 10:02PM ET</span>",Trump says he would only meet Venezuela's Maduro to discuss exit,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday walked back comments that he would consider meeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying he would only do so to discuss Maduro's departure from office.
In an interview published on Sunday, Trump said he would consider meeting Maduro and played down his earlier decision to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate leader.
The Republican president changed tack in a tweet on Monday. ""My Admin has always stood on the side of FREEDOM and LIBERTY and against the oppressive Maduro regime! I would only meet with Maduro to discuss one thing: a peaceful exit from power!"" Trump said.
Trump told the news site Axios on Friday, however, that he was open to a meeting, a move that would upend his ""maximum pressure"" campaign aimed at ousting Maduro, a socialist who has presided over a deep economic crisis in the South American nation.
""I would maybe think about that. ... Maduro would like to meet. And I’m never opposed to meetings,"" Trump said. ""But at this moment, I’ve turned them down.""
Maduro told Venezuelan state news site AVN on Monday that he would be open to meeting with Trump. 
""I am willing to talk respectfully with President Donald Trump. In the same way that I spoke with Biden, I could speak with Trump,"" Maduro said, citing a brief 2015 meeting with then-U.S. Vice President Joe Biden following the inauguration of Brazil's president at the time, Dilma Rousseff.
Trump expressed an openness in 2018 to meeting Maduro, who had also made overtures for talks, but nothing materialized and the United States instead ratcheted up the pressure.
Trump's comments to Axios were possibly the clearest sign yet of what some U.S. officials have privately said is growing frustration over his administration’s failure to unseat Maduro through sanctions and diplomacy.
The United States and most other Western countries have recognized Guaido as the OPEC nation's interim president since January 2019, regarding Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham.
The White House said on Monday that Trump continued to recognize Guaido as the leader of Venezuela.

""Nothing has changed,"" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told a news briefing, adding that he ""has not lost confidence at all"" in Guaido.

BLANTYRE (Reuters) - Malawians vote on Tuesday in a re-run of a discredited poll that has become a test case for the ability of African courts to tackle vote fraud and restrain presidential power.
Malawi's judiciary infuriated President Peter Mutharika, in power since 2014, when it overturned his narrow election victory in February on the basis of ""systematic and grave"" irregularities. 
The supreme court upheld the decision last month, which Mutharika, 79, called a ""coup"" in a campaign rally on Saturday in the northern district of Rumphi.
The ruling echoed one by a Kenyan court in 2017, which cancelled President Uhuru Kenyatta's election win. Both were remarkable on a continent in which judges often serve as a rubber stamp to executive power.
The vote looks too close to call, not least because Malawi has since ditched its ""first-past-the-post"" system so the winner has to get more than 50%. 
In the May 2019 poll, Mutharika got 38.57%, 3 percentage points more than opposition leader Lazarus Chakwera, and less than 10 points ahead of a third candidate, Deputy President Saulos Chilima.
The 47-year-old Chilima has bowed out and backed Chakwera, 64, which would give them a majority if they can combine their previous votes.
Mutharika's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party is in an alliance with the southern African nation's ex-ruling party, the United Democratic Front, which got less than 5% last time.
Lying on a lake at the southern tip of the Great Rift Valley, about half of Malawi's predominantly farming population live in poverty. Its main exports are tobacco and tea.
""I must continue what I started ... to end poverty and develop Malawi,"" Mutharika said on Saturday. ""I'll build roads, I'll put food on the table.""
The former law professor has revamped Malawi's roads and boosted electricity while also taming inflation. Yet critics accuse him of doing little to tackle corruption.
Chakwera has made graft a central pillar of his campaigns.
""Hospitals will be blessed with drugs, schools will get desks and teachers paid in cash, not arrears. We are going to forge a Malawi ... for every Malawian,"" Chakwera said on Saturday.
COVID-19 restrictions will make it tricky for foreign observers. Yet, as Nigeria's ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo who frequently heads African delegations to oversee elections, pointed out in South Africa's Daily Maverick, those observers failed to detect the fraud last time.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 07:17PM ET</span>",U.S. officials to meet this week on Israel annexation plan,"By Steve Holland and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials will gather this week to discuss whether to give Israel a green light for its plan to annex Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's target date of July 1 approaches.
A senior administration official said on Monday that the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, will be in Washington to meet officials including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, senior White House adviser Jared Kushner and Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz. President Donald Trump could also join in.
Under Trump’s Middle East peace proposal, unveiled in January, it is envisaged that the United States would recognize the Jewish settlements - built on land that the Palestinians seek for a state - as part of Israel.
The proposal would create a Palestinian state as part of a broader peace plan, but impose strict conditions on it. Palestinian leaders have dismissed the initiative entirely.
Encouraged by Trump's push, Netanyahu has set July 1 as the date to launch his project of extending sovereignty over the settlements and the Jordan Valley, hoping for a green light from Washington. Most countries view Israel's settlements on occupied land as illegal, and Palestinian leaders have voiced outrage at the prospect of annexation.
""Ultimately, as the team approaches this thought of annexation, the main thing going through our heads is, 'Does this in fact help advance the cause of peace?' And therefore that is what will help drive a lot of the discussion,"" the official said.
LIMITED ANNEXATION FIRST?
Among the main options expected to be considered is a step-by-step process in which Israel would initially declare sovereignty over several settlements close to Jerusalem instead of the 30% of the West Bank envisaged in Netanyahu’s original plan, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The source said the Trump administration has not closed the door to a larger annexation, but fears that allowing Israel to move too fast could kill any hopes of eventually drawing the Palestinians to sit down to discuss Trump's peace plan.
There are also concerns about opposition to annexation from Jordan, one of only two countries that have a peace treaty with Israel, as well from Gulf states that have quietly expanded engagement with Israel in recent years.
Washington has also made clear it wants Israel’s unity government, which has been divided on the issue, to reach a consensus before going ahead with any actions, the source said. Defense Minister Benny Gantz, head of the Blue and White Party, has so far been reluctant to back Likud-leader Netanyahu’s plan.

Berkowitz has been fielding calls about the Trump plan from European and Arab nations, but the U.S. side has privately expressed frustration that they are not offering constructive ideas on how to amend it, a source familiar with the issue said.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto, Canada's most-populous city and financial capital, will allow businesses to reopen starting on Wednesday, joining other regions in the province of Ontario in ending a three-month pandemic lockdown, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Monday.
Malls and restaurants in Toronto, along with Peel Region, which includes some of the city's densely populated suburbs, will be able to open their patios, according to the government's plan.
Ontario, Canada's largest province by population, started gradually reopening its economy this month, but Toronto was left off the initial list.
Ford said the government would continue to monitor health trends and consult daily with the province's medical experts, and asked people to stay vigilant.
""It can turn and bite us in the backside in about a heartbeat,"" Ford said.
Downtown Toronto is home to some of Canada's biggest banks and insurers, and many of them have agreed to allow their staff to work from home until at least September, Toronto Mayor John Tory said last month.
Canadian provinces imposed lockdowns in March to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has killed 8,430 people in Canada and infected 101,337, according to the latest government data. Toronto has recorded more than 1,000 deaths.
Windsor-Essex, in southwestern Ontario near the Michigan border, is the only health region still in Phase 1 of the three-phase reopening, where an outbreak is hitting migrant workers on farms. 
Ford said the province began sending mobile testing units to the largest farms and food-processing plants on Saturday, but blamed Windsor-Essex's continued closure on farmers who will not get their workers tested.
""Farmers just aren't cooperating,"" Ford said, adding the province cannot force anyone to get tested. ""We'll give it another shot ... but then we're going to have to pull out other tools.""

Separately, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pushed back on Monday against pressure from airlines to reopen the nation's borders.

Britain has been incrementally reopening its shuttered economy as the number of COVID-19 deaths and cases declines, having been one of the worst-hit countries during the pandemic.
The latest stage is scheduled for July 4, and will see some higher-risk venues like those in the arts and cultural sector allowed to open their doors, albeit with rules to maintain social distancing.
""The more we open up, the more important it is that everyone follows the social distancing guidelines. We will not hesitate to reverse these steps if it is necessary to stop the virus running out of control,"" a source in Johnson's office said.
Johnson is due to speak before parliament on Tuesday afternoon.
He will also announce the findings of a review into whether to relax the current rule that people must maintain a distance of two metres at all times to prevent the spread of the virus. 
Johnson has faced lobbying from businesses and political pressure in his own party to drop the two-metre rule.

Finance minister Rishi Sunak has acknowledged that relaxing the rule would make a huge difference to many businesses. Pubs restaurants and other hospitality businesses have called for the distance to be reduced to one metre - the minimum recommended by the World Health Organisation.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.S. envoy to nuclear arms control talks with Russia on Monday taunted China for refusing to attend, posting a picture of Chinese flags placed at empty seats around the table, which Beijing dismissed as an act of ""performance art.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to include China in talks to replace New START, the flagship nuclear arms treaty between the United States and Russia, which expires in February. China, a nuclear power with an arsenal a fraction the size of those of the Cold War-era superpowers, has repeatedly declined.
""China is a no-show,"" U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea said on Twitter around the time he arrived for the talks in a palace adjoining Austria's Foreign Ministry.
""Beijing still hiding behind #GreatWallofSecrecy on its crash nuclear build-up, and so many other things. We will proceed with #Russia, notwithstanding,"" he added.
His post (https://twitter.com/USArmsControl/status/1274956212723802113?s=20) included a picture of Chinese flags at empty seats around the negotiating table, with no explanation for how they were placed there when China was never due to attend.
The director general of the arms control department at China's Foreign Ministry, Fu Cong, responded (https://twitter.com/FuCong17/status/1274976022237044738?s=20): ""What an odd scene! Displaying Chinese National Flags on a negotiating table without China's consent! Good luck on the extension of the New START! Wonder how LOW you can go?""
China's mission to the United Nations in Vienna posted a screenshot of Billingslea's picture with the comment ""US performance art?""
Russia, for its part, posted pictures (https://twitter.com/mission_rf/status/1275028953300860929) of the talks after they started, with seats filled and no Chinese flags. Austria's Foreign Ministry, which hosted the talks, declined to comment.
The talks in Vienna are on issues including a possible replacement for the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), which caps U.S. and Russian deployed strategic nuclear weapons warheads at 1,550 each. That replaced the original Cold War-era START treaty signed in 1991 six months before the Soviet Union collapsed.
China has around 300 warheads in total, roughly the same as France, and many times less than the thousands possessed by Washington and Moscow, according to the Stockholm International Peace Institute.
Trump, who has clashed with China on a range of issues, has repeatedly called for Beijing to join talks on a replacement for New START. China has rejected those calls.
""First round of Vienna talks very positive,"" Billingslea said (https://twitter.com/USArmsControl/status/1275169664432082945?s=20) on Twitter hours after he and his Russian interlocutor, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov, left the venue.

""Detailed discussions on full-range of nuclear topics. Technical working groups launched. Agreement in principle on second round.""

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's indigenous leaders have been lobbying lawmakers to pass a bill to declare swathes of virgin Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest off limits to outsiders, but they fear opposition by the oil industry may scupper a rare opportunity to secure a vote this week.
With concerns growing that the coronavirus pandemic could devastate remote communities, Congress is considering whether to fast track a bill to better protect a string of indigenous territories near the border with Ecuador and Brazil.
""Until now, high risk extractive activities have been allowed in these territories,"" Jorge Pérez, president of the Regional Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Amazon, told Reuters in a statement.
""This reform will guarantee the lives and human rights of the Uncontacted Peoples,"" Perez said, referring to an estimated 7,000 people in some 20 groups in the Peruvian Amazon who have very little or no interaction with the outside world.
Preserving indigenous territories in Peru and Ecuador is seen as critical to the wider Amazon ecosystem, which scientists warn is approaching catastrophic tipping points due to climate change and accelerating deforestation in Brazil. [nL1N2D32PI]
While President Martin Vizcarra's centrist government opposes to the proposed law, political analysts and legislators say Peru's fragmented Congress has a populist hue after January elections and could pass the bill.
Indigenous leaders met with Vizcarra on Friday in anticipation that Congress could vote as early as this Thursday.
But Lesly Lazo, president of the Congressional justice commission, cast doubt on whether the bill would pass this week since her commission may decide to subject it to further review.
""I do not think there is a rush,"" said Lazo, who belongs to the centrist Popular Action party.
Indigenous leaders fear the momentum to pass the bill quickly may fade as the country emerges from the most acute phase of the pandemic.
Peru's oil industry - including state-owned firm Perupetro - has warned lawmakers against passing the amendment, which aims to close loopholes in a framework adopted in 2006 to protect indigenous peoples threatened by mining, logging and fossil fuel extraction.
Felipe Cantuarias, president of the Peruvian Hydrocarbon Society industry lobby group, said the bill would disrupt production and throw exploration contracts into doubt.
""We are asking Congress to please debate the issue and understand that this is not solved by withdrawing private investment, because then we all lose: the country loses, the regions lose,"" Cantuarias told Reuters.

LONDON (Reuters) - Venezuela's rival leaders, President Nicolás Maduro and his western-backed opponent Juan Guaido, began a legal tug-of-war on Monday over $1 billion of the country's gold stashed deep under the Bank of England in London. 
In a High Court hearing due to last four days, the Venezuelan central bank (BCV), controlled by Maduro's government, is seeking an order to force the Bank of England to release the bullion that, like many countries, it stores there for safe keeping.
Lawyers representing the BCV say selling the gold, which amounts to around 15% of Venezuela's foreign currency reserves, would fund the response to the coronavirus and bolster a health system gutted by six years of economic crisis.
Guaido's lawyers meanwhile say the bullion is his to control as the British government, along with around 60 others around the world, recognise him as leader after claims Maduro rigged Venezuela's last presidential election two years ago.
Monday's start of the hearing saw the two legal teams lock horns over who is recognised as the legitimate leader.
BCV representative Nick Vineall QC argued a statement by the UK government in February 2019 that Guaido was interim president had been carefully nuanced and that diplomatic action since then had shown that Maduro was still seen as in charge.
He gave examples of how economic sanctions had referred to Maduro and how Maduro's embassy staff had received correspondence on Queen Elizabeth II's birthday last June.
Guaido's designated representative to the UK, Vanessa Neumann, a former London socialite who once dated Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger, had meanwhile been told that while she would be received in London, she would not receive a diplomatic visa, diplomatic immunity or have access to Venezuela's diplomatic properties there.
""As far as western Europe is concerned for the most part... there are full diplomatic relations with the Maduro government,"" Vineall said.
Andrew Fulton, Guaido's representative in the London case on Monday responded by saying that the UK's statement in February 2019 had been clear. 
""Those two words 'now recognise' put that issue beyond doubt,"" Fulton said. ""That is of absolutely critical importance,"" he added.
The Bank of England has yet to comment on the case.
It holds roughly 400,000 bars of gold worth more than 200 billion pounds ($250 billion) in its vaults under the City of London and is the second largest keeper of gold in the world after the New York Federal Reserve, according to its website.
The dispute over Venezuela's gold began in May 2018 when Maduro secured re-election in a vote the opposition coalition boycotted and called a sham. Afterwards, Boris Johnson, then the British foreign minister, said: ""We may have to tighten the economic screw on Venezuela.""
Concerned by mounting U.S. sanctions against the Maduro government, the BCV subsequently told the BOE it wanted to bring home 14 tonnes of gold it had stored there.
Around the year’s end, Calixto Ortega, the BCV president, travelled to London to discuss the move with BOE officials, according to Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing the BCV. 
In its latest claim, the BCV has changed tack. It says that the funds from a sale would be funnelled into the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and be used to buy medicine and equipment to combat the COVID-19 crisis.
The opposition alleges Maduro wants to use the gold to pay off his foreign allies, which his lawyers deny. Over the past two years, Maduro’s government has removed some 30 tonnes from its reserves in Venezuela to sell abroad for much-needed hard currency, according to people familiar with the operations and the bank’s own data.

After meeting Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic, whose ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party won a landslide victory in general elections on Sunday, Lajcak said that the future agreement should ""solve all issues and be mutually acceptable"".
Serbia is a candidate to join the EU, but the bloc says Belgrade must first resolve its relationship with Kosovo, a former Serbian province that declared independence in 2008, which Belgrade does not recognise.
Talks between them stalled in November 2018 when Kosovo imposed 100% import tarrifs on Serbian goods.
""We are proposing a comprehensive deal that would solve all issues once and for all,"" Lajcak told a news conference, speaking through an interpreter. 
Other conditions for Serbia's EU membership include reforming the judiciary, improving rule of law and rooting out corruption and organised crime. 
""Serbia is a part of Europe, your problems are our problems, your solutions are our solutions,"" Lajcak said.
On June 6, Kosovo removed all trade barriers, paving the way for the resumption of talks. But Kosovo remains adamant it wants full recognition of its independence by Belgrade.
""We are entering these talks in good faith,"" Vucic said. 
Authorities in Pristina have opposed Lajcak's involvement in the talks as his native Slovakia does not recognise Kosovo's independence. They prefer to see the United States as the main mediator.
Ethnic Albanians account for 90% of the population of Kosovo, where NATO air bombardment helped drive out Serbian forces during a 1999 war. 
Kosovo is recognised by more than 110 countries including the United States, but not by Serbia and its allies Russia and China, which have been blocking Kovoso from joining international organisations, including the United Nations.
Last week, Vucic said he would reject EU membership if Belgrade does not receive concessions in return for recognising Kosovo, and that no solution would be possible without Russia's consent.
Under the auspices of U.S. negotiator Richard Grenell, delegations from Belgrade and Pristina will meet in Washington on June 27 to discuss economic relations.

Calling China a partner and a rival, von der Leyen said Beijing had not followed up on a 2019 deal to allow greater access for European companies in China or drop rules requiring investors to share their know-how in Chinese joint ventures.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic worsened Sino-European ties, the EU found itself caught between China and the United States, needing both and reluctant to alienate either. 
Li expressed optimism about the relationship, according to Chinese state media, saying China and the EU are more partners than competitors. 
But the EU wants to see progress on an investment agreement under negotiation since 2014. 
EU officials say they want to see movement in areas such as autos, biotech and micro-electronics and see Beijing limit subsidies for state-run companies.
Germany has postponed an EU leaders' summit with Xi in September, citing the coronavirus, though diplomats said it was in part because of the impasse in investment negotiations.
HONG KONG
Michel and von der Leyen said they told Li and Xi of their concerns over China's security law for Hong Kong, which democracy activists, diplomats and some businesses say will jeopardise its semi-autonomous status and role as a global financial hub.
China's parliament reacted angrily on Saturday to a resolution by the EU assembly protesting against the security law.
""We also conveyed that China risks very negative consequences if it goes forward with imposing this law,"" von der Leyen said, without giving details. 

""The European Union is in touch with our G7 partners on this topic and we've made our position very clear to the Chinese leadership today and urged them to reconsider.""

Verzilov, publisher of the private Mediazona news outlet, was taken in for questioning by police on Sunday over a political rally last summer and held him for hours. He was attacked by an unknown assailant after he was released. 
Both men were later detained by police and Verzilov was charged with swearing in public, Verzilov's lawyer Leonid Solovyov was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying. 
Writing after his sentencing on Monday, Verzilov accused the police on Twitter of staging the incident to provoke and jail him. 
""The judge just sentenced me to 15 DAYS FOR SWEARING - but in actual fact for a police provocation that included attacking me after being questioned for 13 hours in the Investigative Committee,"" Verzilov said. 
TASS news agency cited a police source as saying Verzilov had planned to stage a prank on Wednesday when Russia marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two with a military parade on Red Square. Verzilov denied this in comments to the BBC's Russian Service. 

Verzilov was one of four Pussy Riot activists who ran onto the pitch wearing police uniforms during the soccer World Cup final in Moscow in 2018, a stunt they said aimed to draw attention to human rights abuses.

""Our countrymen are dying,"" Cabrera, 65, told Reuters in his workshop lined with the large rectangular boxes in San Juan de Lurigancho, one of Lima's poorest neighborhoods.
""It's a pity. Even I could die at any time. The truth hurts but what can we do. This is my job,"" he said from under the face mask he uses to keep the virus at bay.
Peru has about 255,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far, 8,045 of them fatal, making it the second hardest hit country in Latin America after Brazil.
Cabrera works at Eternal Life with his son Wilfredo, his wife Geserela Llanos and about 10 other employees, building and painting the caskets white or brown. Those killed by the pandemic in Peru are mostly from poor areas.
Wilfredo Cabrera said that although Eternal Life clearly needs more staff to handle the increase in business, the pandemic has made hiring difficult.
""You cannot add more staff because it would make the workspace tighter, and the risk of contagion would increase,"" he said, adding that demand has grown from 30 caskets a month to 30 a day.

For decades after World War Two, Austria denied responsibility for crimes committed by the Nazis, arguing that it was their first victim despite the enthusiasm with which many citizens had welcomed annexation by Hitler's Germany in 1938.
The country now recognises that Austrians were perpetrators as well as victims of Nazi crimes but it has not confronted that chapter of its history as openly or directly as Germany.
""Berlin has one. Paris has one. Vienna had none. But the day has finally come today,"" Oskar Deutsch, president of the Jewish Community (IKG), the body officially representing Austria's Jews, said at a ceremony marking the start of construction work.
The new monument, located in a park next to Austria's central bank, will comprise a ring of upright stone slabs around an island of trees, and will name all 64,259 Austrian victims of the Holocaust. It is due to be inaugurated in a year's time.
""Remembering means commemorating the victims of the Shoah. This remembering and our history increase our responsibility, the responsibility daily and together to do everything to ensure that something like this never happens again,"" said Deutsch.
Ironically, the project was first backed in 2018 by a previous coalition government of current Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives and the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which was founded in the 1950s by former Nazis and whose first leader had been an SS officer.
Although the FPO says it has abandoned its anti-Semitic past and now denounces the Holocaust, it has been plagued by racism and anti-Semitism scandals, and the IKG still refuses to deal with party officials. The FPO crashed out of government last year and Kurz now governs in coalition with the Greens.

There are Holocaust memorials in Vienna but the only one naming the Jews who lived in Austria and were murdered is in the city's main synagogue.

Over the weekend, police broke up parties and raves along the shoreline that exceeded a limit of 20 people per gathering. One beach party that spilled out of the parking lot of a restaurant near Lisbon had about 1,000 revellers.
Despite a relatively low coronavirus toll of 39,392 confirmed cases and 1,534 deaths, authorities are worried that several hundred new cases are being found every day in Greater Lisbon.
But the government maintains that the outbreaks are localised and traceable to particular workspaces and crowded neighbourhoods.
""The nucleus of the problem is centred in just 15 neighbourhoods ... we need a stronger effort in these areas,"" Prime Minister Antonio Costa told a news conference after meeting local council leaders in Lisbon.
In these areas, the limit on gatherings will be halved to just 10 people, and commercial spaces with the exception of restaurants will close by 8 p.m., Costa said.
Restaurants will no longer be allowed to serve drinks after the 8 p.m. curfew, and drinking in public spaces outside of licensed esplanades will also be prohibited.
The number of new cases among people aged 10-30 has jumped by around 90% since Portugal eased restrictions on gatherings, according to health ministry data.
A birthday party in the southern Algarve region three weeks ago attended by around a hundred people has led to 76 new cases, authorities said. 

After several European countries limited entry to visitors from Portugal last week, Costa on Friday said it was testing more people than most EU countries, so it was natural still to have a relatively high number of infections.

The government, based in the southern port of Aden, and the separatists are nominal allies in the Saudi-led coalition, which has been at war against the Iran-aligned Houthis that have controlled the capital since 2014.
However, the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC) declared self rule in April, and the two sides have been fighting in the south, complicating U.N. efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire to the overall conflict. 
Tensions escalated over the weekend after the STC seized control of Socotra, a Yemeni island in the Arabian Sea, deposing its governor and driving out forces of the government. 
The two sides have now agreed to a ceasefire in Abyan province along the coast east of Aden, as well as de-escalation of tensions in Socotra and other regions, and the start of talks, a statement from the Saudi-led coalition said. 
""The Coalition calls on all Yemeni political, social and media components and powers to support the parties’ response to convene a meeting in Riyadh, and work diligently to implement the Agreement,"" the statement added. 
The Coalition will deploy observers in Abyan to observe the ceasefire and separation of forces, it said.
Riyadh wants to prevent another front developing among its allies in Yemen’s multifaceted war, which has been locked in military stalemate for years.
More than 100,000 people have been killed, mostly civilians, and millions depend on international food aid in what the United Nations describes as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Police Commissioner Dermot Shea testified on Monday that his officers had been attacked with bricks, knives, trash cans and bottles during recent protests against racial injustice, saying it was some of the ""worst rioting"" in the city for years.
Shea's testimony was part of a series of online public hearings held by New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is investigating the police response to widespread protests following last month's killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.
Last week, scores of protesters testified that New York Police Department officers kicked or shoved them, hit them with night sticks, doused them with pepper spray or cuffed wrists so tightly that hands turned blue.
In his opening statement, Shea called protesting on the streets a ""tradition that is as old as New York"" but said the recent demonstrations were different.
""This was some of the worst rioting that occurred in our city in recent memory,"" he said.
More than 300 officers have been injured since the start of the protests in late May, Shea said, although it was unclear how many injuries were caused by attacks by civilians.
He has promised that officers found to have breached the department's standards in using force against New Yorkers will face consequences.
James opened her investigation in late May at the request of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who had said he was alarmed by ""disturbing violent clashes"" between NYPD officers and protesters. 
Much of the testimony that she has received so far focuses on police using force against protesters, arresting journalists, medics and other so-called ""essential workers,"" and criticism that many officers refused to wear face coverings amid the coronavirus pandemic, James said.

In 17 hours of testimony last week, many protesters, including elected officials, said the protesters were largely peaceful and found themselves being arrested or hurt by the police with minimal provocation.

READING, England (Reuters) - The English town of Reading held a minute's silence on Monday for the victims of a stabbing that killed three people including an American in the latest terrorism-linked attack.
Three people were also hospitalised after a man wielding a five-inch knife went on the rampage in a park on Saturday, randomly stabbing people enjoying a sunny, summer evening.
A Western security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the suspect was a 25-year-old Libyan called Khairi Saadallah. 
Calling the incident terrorism, police said a 25-year-old had been arrested but they were not hunting others. ""What we saw here on Saturday evening in Reading was the actions of one lone individual,"" Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said
Patel later told parliament that the risk from lone attackers was growing, and that if further government action was needed to stop such incidents, she would not hesitate to act.
The Philadelphia Inquirer said one of the dead was U.S. citizen Joe Ritchie-Bennett, 39, who had lived in Britain for 15 years. U.S. ambassador Woody Johnson sent condolences to families of victims. ""To our great sorrow, this includes an American citizen,"" he said on Twitter 
Teacher James Furlong, 36, who was friends with Ritchie-Bennett according to media reports, was also killed. ""He was beautiful, intelligent, honest and fun,"" his parents said.
The third victim has not yet been identified.
ON MI5'S RADAR
The security source told Reuters that Saadallah had come across the radar of Britain's domestic security agency MI5 last year over intelligence he had aspirations to travel for extremist purposes, although his plans then came to nothing.
""The security services have records on thousands of people and rightly so,"" said Patel, adding she was limited in what she could say because the investigation was live.
Shocked residents of Reading, about 40 miles (65 km) west of London, held a minute's silence at 0900 GMT.
The attack was reminiscent of some recent incidents in Britain that authorities also called terrorism.

In February, police shot dead a man, previously jailed for promoting violent Islamist material, who had stabbed two people on a busy street in south London. Last November, another man who had been jailed for terrorism offences stabbed two people to death on London Bridge before he too was shot dead by police.

The attack on the night of June 10 on a military outpost in Kafolo was the deadliest since gunmen from al Qaeda's North African branch stormed the beach resort of Grand Bassam in March 2016, killing 19 people. 
""The head of the commando unit that carried out the attack was arrested yesterday,"" Minister Hamed Bakayoko said at a military ceremony in Abidjan to honour the fallen soldiers. 
""Many of the people who committed the criminal and terrorist act have been arrested,"" he added, without giving details.
On Thursday, the army said it had carried out cleanup operations in the Comoe National Park, close to the border with Burkina Faso. The Kafolo military post is located in the area. 
The army said 27 people were arrested, a militant logistics base was destroyed, and communication equipment were seized.
Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso launched a joint military operation last month called Operation Comoe to tackle the expanding threat from Islamist jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the Sahel region.
Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso have been worst hit by the militant attacks but there are concerns that the attacks could spread to coastal nations if left unchecked.

The incident could help inflame old tensions with former colonial power Denmark less than a year after U.S. President Donald Trump offered to buy the vast island. 
The statue of Hans Egede, a missionary whose arrival in Greenland in 1721 marked the beginning of the island's colonial era, was vandalised in the early hours of Greenland's National Day, police said.
Pictures of the vandalised statue posted on social media drew hundreds of mostly approving comments.
""Inuit are constantly silenced and never given the opportunity to process the traumas that have been passed down for generations,"" Paninnguaq Lind Jensen, who runs a traditional Inuit tattoo shop in Nuuk, wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Greenland, home to only 56,000 people, was a Danish colony until 1953 when it became a formal part of the Nordic kingdom.
In 2009, Greenland was granted broad self-governing autonomy, including the right to declare independence from Denmark.
Few Greenlanders see independence as viable in the short-term given their economic dependence on Denmark, but polls show a majority support it as a long-term goal.

Iran shot down the Ukraine International Airlines flight on Jan. 8 with a ground-to-air missile, killing 176 people, in what Tehran later acknowledged as a “disastrous mistake” by forces on high alert during a confrontation with the United States.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will send the black box of the Ukrainian airplane to France in the coming few days in order to read its information,” Zarif said, according to IRNA.
Zarif made the comments in a phone call with Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne. Canada had 57 citizens on board.
The fate of the cockpit voice and data “black box” recorders was the subject of an international standoff after the plane was shot down, with Ukraine demanding access.
France's BEA air accident investigation agency is known internationally as one of the leading agencies in the world for reading flight recorders, and black boxes have been sent there in other high profile cases of crashes.
The Ukrainian plane was shot down shortly after take-off in Tehran, when Iran's defences were on high alert, hours after Iran fired at U.S. bases in Iraq in retaliation for a U.S. attack that killed an Iranian commander at Baghdad airport.

Iran says the coronavirus crisis has contributed to delays in a probe by its Air Accident Investigation Board. Iran has been sending mixed messages about where the black boxes may be read. Last week, Iran’s Minister of Roads and Urban Development, Mohammad Eslami, said the black boxes will be sent to Ukraine.

A report from the EU statistics office, Eurostat, measured progress towards 17 ""Sustainable Development Goals"" between 2014 and 2019.
On most, there was progress across the 27 member states.
Deaths due to homicide or assault, and the perceived amount of crime, violence and vandalism, were all down. Governments spent more on courts, increasing confidence on the independence of the justice system.
More people were able to meet their basic needs, including medical care and adequate housing. Fewer were smoking or suffering from noise or air pollution, and life expectancy was up.
The gender gap has widened, however.
While women's hourly earnings are slowly catching up with men's, and the number of women in parliaments and occupying senior management positions in major companies has grown considerably, Eurostat said the overall balance was negative.
Inequalities in education and the labour market had risen and many more women than men were still economically inactive because they were caring for children or the elderly.

Eurostat marked the advance in ""Climate action"" as neutral, saying progress towards fighting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions had been mixed over the five years.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese military commanders met on Monday to try to ease tensions at their disputed Himalayan border as the public mood hardened in India for a military and economic riposte following the worst clash in more than five decades.
Major Indian traders called for a boycott of Chinese goods and the state of Maharashtra, home to India's financial capital of Mumbai, put three initial investment proposals from Chinese companies worth 50 billion rupees ($658 million) on hold, just days after signing the agreements.
India said 20 of its soldiers were killed in a clash last Monday with Chinese troops in a major escalation of a weeks-long standoff between the nuclear-armed Asian giants in the western Himalayas.
An Indian government source said commanders met in Moldo, on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border dividing India's Ladakh region from the Chinese held Aksai Chin.
The meeting lasted several hours, with the Indian side pushing China to withdraw its troops back to where they were in April, a second Indian government source said.
China, in previous rounds of talks, had asked India to stop all construction work in what it says is Chinese territory.
Soldiers fought with rocks, metal rods and wooden clubs at the Galwan Valley last Monday after a weeks-long standoff. 
China has not disclosed how many casualties it suffered, though an Indian minister has said around 40 Chinese soldiers may have been killed. 
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing on Monday that the two sides were in communication through diplomatic and military channels. 
Many in India have called for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's nationalist government to show it will not be bullied, remembering their country's humiliation in a brief border war against China in 1962.
Members of an Indian traders' body made a bonfire of Chinese goods at a market in New Delhi, pushing for a nationwide boycott of products made in China.
The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), which represents some 70 million traders, has asked federal and state governments to support a boycott of Chinese goods and cancel government contracts awarded to Chinese companies.
""The entire nation is filled with extreme anger and intensity to give a strong befitting response to China not only militarily but also economically,"" CAIT National General Secretary Praveen Khandelwal wrote in a letter to chief ministers of some Indian states.
In prosperous Maharashtra, the government said it was putting three investment plans, including from Great Wall Motor Co, on hold.
""In the current environment we will wait for the federal government to announce a clear policy regarding these projects,"" industries minister Subhash Desai said. 
China is India's second-biggest trading partner, with bilateral trade worth $87 billion in the fiscal year ending March 2019, and a trade deficit of $53.57 billion in China’s favour, the widest India has with any country.
The editor-in-chief of China's Global Times newspaper warned that the ""nationalists of India need to cool down"".

YANGON (Reuters) - Winding through the city of Yangon and the surrounding countryside, a water pipeline built in the British colonial era is offering visitors cooped up indoors during the pandemic an unusual way to see Myanmar's former capital.
Constructed in 1935, the 70-km (44-mile) metal pipeline distributes water to 4.5 million people, connecting the Gyo Phyu dam on the outskirts of Yangon to the centre of the city. It has survived a 5.8 magnitude earthquake in 2007 and World War Two.
Jochen Meissner, founder of a local travel agency, started arranging walking tours on the pipeline after seeing it could be a new experience for those caught in the city's lockdown.
""All of us are craving...for nature, for fresh air, for some new adventure,"" said Meissner, who is a German national.
Myanmar has reported 290 cases of COVID-19 and six deaths. While slowly easing a lockdown, people are not allowed to gather in groups of more than five in public and social distancing measures are due to stay in place until the end of June. 
Recognising the potential for tourism, Yangon's council has helped hack back overgrown shrubbery around parts of the pipeline, which takes visitors off the beaten track of tourist attractions and through some poorer neighbourhoods.
At times watched by bemused residents, participants during a tour last weekend had to clamber over giant rusty water taps and maintain their balance on the top of the pipeline, which stands some 2.2 metres (7.22 ft) above the ground.

""The pipeline walk is very exciting and relaxing for us to venture on after the long duration of the lockdown,"" said tour participant Kyaw Zin Latt.

MOSCOW/KYIV (Reuters) - The targeting of colonial-era monuments in some Western nations has prompted activists in Russia and Ukraine to reflect on how their own countries dealt with Soviet-era statues and, in some cases, to ask whether it was good enough.
Protesters have toppled or vandalised statues in the United States, Britain, Belgium and elsewhere in recent weeks in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement against racism and police brutality.
Statues to Soviet leaders such as Vladimir Lenin and Josef Stalin became controversial for many after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 because of large-scale human rights abuses committed during decades of Communist rule.
Russia decided to keep many Soviet-era statues in place, while relocating the most contentious to a riverside park in Moscow.
Among those relocated are a statue of Stalin, who sent millions of people to the Gulag, and one of Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Soviet secret police.
Arranged in the park next to neat wooden walkways, the statues were collected from across Moscow after 1991, a period when many streets were renamed and symbols of the communist regime dismantled.
""I think the toppling of the Dzerzhinsky monument was one of the most important things to happen to our country,"" said Alexandra Polivanova, a researcher at the Memorial human rights centre.
""INCOMPLETE""
But with the tomb of Soviet state founder Lenin still retaining pride of place on Moscow's Red Square, and with thousands of Lenin statues still standing across Russia, she believes the process did not go far enough. 
""The events of 1991 turned out to be incomplete,"" Polivanova said. ""Unfortunately, crimes have not been properly denounced either at state level nor at the level of society. Decommunisation has not happened."" 
Ukraine has torn down many more Soviet statues than Russia, especially since 2014, when mass street protests in Kyiv drove President Viktor Yanukovich from power.
Remaining Soviet monuments were then targeted for their association with Yanukovich, who had tried to rebuild closer ties with Moscow, recalled Volodymyr Viatrovych, Chairman of Ukraine's Institute of National Remembrance.
""People started to discuss the communist past, the crimes of the communist regime and why they should never be repeated,"" he said. ""Especially during the winter of 2014, hundreds of Lenin monuments were toppled as symbols of everything Soviet-related.""

A law was later passed banning communist symbols in Ukraine.

PARIS (Reuters) - Boubacar Drame had been helping a mother find her lost daughter in a working class Paris suburb before three police officers approached. One spoke a few words, a second took the 31-year-old Black man to the ground and kneeled across his throat.
Video footage recoded by bystanders shows the two officers using their body weight to pin down and handcuff Drame, who worked as a community mediator in the local town hall at the time of the June 2019 incident. One squeezed his genitals as they bundled him into a vehicle, he said.
""I was powerless,"" Drame said, sitting in the park where the girl went missing. ""They were crushing me, I couldn't do anything. I found it hard to breathe properly. I can't see what their aim was, other than to hurt me.""
The streets of Gennevilliers are far from Minneapolis but the death in May of George Floyd, who died after three officers used their weight to restrain him, has resonated painfully with Drame, who filed a complaint with prosecutors after his arrest.
Drame spoke to Reuters a year after his detention and at a time when anti-racism protests in France and beyond have turned the U.S. Black Lives Matter movement into a global rallying cry.
In France, rights groups say accusations of police violence, in particular in deprived suburbs where residents are often of immigrant background, remain largely unaddressed. Interior Minister Christophe Castaner earlier this month acknowledged that there were cases of racism in the police.
Drame had no idea why he was being detained, other than he matched the profile of a suspect they were hunting, he says. He was released from a police cell without charge after the mayor and local police chief intervened.
The ordeal left Drame psychologically scarred. A doctor ordered him on sick leave for three months. He is still employed at Gennevilliers town hall but does not work as a mediator, his faith in the values he taught to youngsters badly shaken. 
An investigation into the officers' conduct continues, Drame's lawyer said. Paris police said they could not comment on an ongoing investigation.
""I just want to know why they did what they did, and find out whether they recognise that on that day they went too far,"" Drame said.
Once inside the police station, he says the language used by officers left him feeling as if he was being racially discriminated against.
""The police have got to understand that when people denounce abuses, it is not because they are against the police but because they are against injustice and impunity.""

JORDAN VALLEY, West Bank (Reuters) - Amid the barren hills of the Jordan Valley, Palestinian artist Khadeeja Bisharat paints scenes of bulldozers and demolitions, a reflection of fears of what may happen to her isolated Bedouin community if Israel annexes land in the occupied West Bank.
Some 15,000 Palestinians live in tiny pastoral encampments scattered across the Jordan Valley. Israel has pledged to extend its sovereignty over the territory - some 30% of the West Bank - with cabinet-level discussion on the move set to begin July 1.
""This affects our psychological wellbeing, and the children's wellbeing ... Will they allow residents to stay? Will they demolish their houses?"" Bisharat, 37, said from her Bedouin encampment in the northern Jordan Valley.
She says she has tried to express her fear and uncertainty through paintings, among them a watercolour depicting women gathered around a demolished home and a scene of a yellow bulldozer approaching a tin Bedouin shack.
""I try to convey a message of how the occupation impacts us, the violations we are subjected to,"" the mother-of-three said.
Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war. An Israeli military post, near the Jewish settlement of Hamra, looks down on Bisharat's community from a nearby hilltop.
She said she felt surrounded, far from areas under the control of the Palestinian Authority and exposed to Israeli demolition of farm shacks erected by her community.
Israel has cited a lack of proper permits, required in parts of the West Bank under complete Israeli military control, in issuing demolition orders.
Peace Now, an Israeli advocacy group that opposes Israel's settlement policy, says most Palestinian applications for building permission are rejected.
Bisharat's husband, Mahmoud, said their community would be defiant in the face of Israeli annexation.

""Even if it is imposed on us, we will resist with all the means we have.""

Putin, 67, addressed hundreds of soldiers to commemorate Russia's remembrance day following a prayer ceremony led by Patriarch Kirill, head of the Orthodox Church, at the Patriot cathedral, which opened earlier this month. 
""We have gathered here outside the walls of the main cathedral of the Russian armed forces to remember the heroes of the past with deep respect,"" he said. 
The lavishly decorated cathedral, some 55 km (34 miles) west of Moscow, had been due to open in May as part of a sequence of events to commemorate 75 years since the Soviet victory in World War Two, but this was delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The cathedral was originally meant to include a mosaic of Putin and Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu demonstrating their support for Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, but the plan was dropped. The Kremlin said it was too early to celebrate the achievements of Russia's current leadership.
Putin has made enshrining the memory of the Soviet effort in World War Two a centrepiece of his two-decade rule and on Wednesday he will oversee a military parade across Red Square to commemorate the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany. 

The following day Russians will begin casting their ballots in a seven-day vote to approve or reject an array of reforms, including one that could allow Putin to serve two more terms in the Kremlin instead of stepping down in 2024.

Standing in front of dozens of suit jackets in old-fashioned glass cabinets, Latchman keeps still while his chest is measured by shop manager Judith Ekblom Jarrold wearing a plastic face visor.

The kingdom introduced stringent measures in March to halt the spread of the new coronavirus, including 24-hour curfews in most towns and cities, with most people only allowed out for essential shopping or urgent medical reasons.
Saudi Arabia, which has reported more than 157,000 COVID-19 cases and 1,267 deaths, began a phased easing of restrictions on movement and business activity in May and lifted its curfew rules entirely on Sunday.
""As soon as we heard that the curfew is over, we immediately contacted the guys to go out,"" said Hesham Mahros, among a group of Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) motorcycle riders returning to their city centre haunt in the capital Riyadh.
""Life is back once again, it's a different feeling.""

119,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","Threat of Brazil military coup unfounded, retired generals say","By Anthony Boadle
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Calls for Brazil's military to close Congress and the Supreme Court have screamed from banners at marches attended by President Jair Bolsonaro in recent weeks, but retired generals and close observers of the armed forces call it empty talk.
A defender of Brazil's 1964 military coup and the two decades of dictatorship that followed, Bolsonaro has allowed his sons and supporters to fan threats against democratic institutions in part because he has been backed into a corner, analysts say.
As the right-wing populist struggles with a sinking economy, the world's worst coronavirus outbreak outside the United States, and police investigations targeting his family and friends, those anti-democratic outbursts seem likely to continue.
However, three retired generals told Reuters in recent days that there was no risk of a military intervention and expressed concern that the armed forces were being unduly politicized under Bolsonaro, a former army captain disciplined in 1986 for insubordination.
""The idea of ​​putting the armed forces in the middle of a dispute between branches of the state, authorities and political interests is completely out of place,"" said Carlos dos Santos Cruz, a retired army general who served in the cabinet last year until he fell out with Bolsonaro's sons.
""It is a lack of respect for the armed forces,"" he told Reuters.
Bolsonaro himself has insisted he will defend Brazil's constitution. But he has accused courts of abusing their authority and done nothing to stop his most fervent supporters from demanding the military intervene.
His son, Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, said in May that an institutional ""rupture"" was a matter of time. 
The remarks followed a decision by the Supreme Court to investigate a suspected misinformation and intimidation network run by the president's backers on social media that played a large role in his 2018 election. The inquiry could lead an electoral court to question his victory and potentially annul the result.
The threats of democratic rupture are aimed at intimidating rivals, prosecutors, and the Supreme Court, according to political scientist Christian Lynch. But military commanders have publicly dismissed any likelihood of a coup.
""The Supreme Court called Bolsonaro's bluff,"" said Lynch, a professor at Rio de Janeiro State University Social and Political Studies Institute. ""He didn't have the coup card. He was bluffing all along.""
'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'
For retired General Roberto Peternelli, who was elected to Congress in 2018 for the same party that nominated Bolsonaro, the military would simply not obey a presidential order to shut down Congress or the Supreme Court.
""The armed forces totally respect the constitution and such an order would be unconstitutional and illegal,"" said the ex-paratrooper, who commanded the Brazilian army's helicopter fleet, in a telephone interview.
Retired General Paulo Chagas, a former infantry officer, said the president did not have the power to close Congress or the top court and would lose legitimacy if he attempted it.
Some critics say Bolsonaro is already politicizing the military, which worked for decades to establish itself as an apolitical defender of democracy after the human rights abuses of the 1964-1985 dictatorship.
With military brass in a third of Bolsonaro's cabinet posts, including two active duty generals among his closest advisors and retired General Hamilton Mourao as his vice president, the reputation of the armed forces is tied up with the government.
According to a Federal Audit Court investigation, there are now as many as 3,000 military personnel in government jobs.
Chagas, who campaigned for Bolsonaro's election, said he still believes the president is the best man to lead the country, but he suggested active duty officers should refuse or retire from government jobs in order to keep a distance between the military and political spheres.
Paulo Kramer, a University of Brasilia professor who knows many of Bolsonaro's cabinet well, said the generals who are in the cabinet, such as top security advisor Augusto Heleno, remember vividly how the legacy of the 1964 coup stained the reputation of the armed forces.
""This generation of General Mourao and Heleno are vaccinated against any coup attempts. They feel uneasy when the president and his sons make those threats,"" Kramer said.

The ICC, the world’s first permanent war crimes court, said in January last year that prosecutors had failed to prove any case against Gbagbo. 
Prosecutors at the Hague-based court in the Netherlands have appealed the decision mainly on procedural grounds, arguing that there were legal faults with the way the decision was announced and the way evidence was assessed.
They have said they will seek a re-trial for Gbagbo on charges of crimes against humanity for his role in post-election violence in Ivory Coast in 2010-2011.

""The only purpose for doing this is to preserve the health and life of Bulgarian citizens,"" Ananiev said, adding that people should wear masks at shops, sports events, cinemas and theatres. Staying 1.5 metres apart from other people is also compulsory.

122,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 22, 2020 05:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Kremlin hopes big companies and prize draws will boost Putin vote turnout,"By Katya Golubkova, Maria Tsvetkova and Olesya Astakhova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin has asked some Russian companies to mount internal information campaigns to boost turnout in a nationwide vote on constitutional reforms that could allow President Vladimir Putin to keep power until 2036, documents seen by Reuters show.
The documents, sent to at least three large private companies to help them explain the reforms and voting procedures to employees, also show a prize draw will be held near polling stations to attract voters, offering those who vote the chance to win a car or apartment.
Reuters could not ascertain how many companies had received the documents or whether state firms had received the same advice. The Kremlin and the Central Election Commission did not respond to requests for comment.
Though encouraging turnout is legally permissible, the draw will enable companies to check which of their employees has voted, as those who enter the draw will receive a unique QR (quick response) code that means they can be traced.
A high turnout would be likely to improve the already high chances of the constitutional changes being approved in the vote, which is taking place over seven days - from June 25 until July 1 - to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. 
It would also help the Kremlin show there is wide public support for the changes, which include an amendment that would allow Putin two more six-year terms as president if re-elected. Current constitutional limits bar him from seeking re-election when his mandate ends in 2024. 
The Kremlin has said the constitutional reforms are needed to enshrine key rights. 
Authorities have tried to boost turnout before, by laying on free food and entertainment near polling stations.
During Putin's 2018 re-election campaign, voters were encouraged to take polling station selfies in a contest to win modest prizes. Several people told Reuters at the time their bosses had told them to take part to prove they had voted. 
The documents, authenticated by three corporate sources, include a note to companies explaining what they called Project ""Mobilisation in companies 2020"" and a timetable with instructions on how to encourage employees to vote.
In a section entitled ""Additional information on those who did not vote at the polling station on election day,"" the advice to companies is: ""(Send a) reminder of the need to vote (by telephone, SMS or text message)'."" 
""TRICKY QUESTIONS""
One of the documents sent to companies offers talking points for discussions with employees entitled ""Answers to tricky questions"". The first hypothetical question is: 'Is it true that Putin is changing the constitution for himself so that he can remain in power?'""
Part of the suggested response is: ""Putin is doing this for us so that whoever comes after him could not collapse the country like (Mikhail) Gorbachev and (Boris) Yeltsin did."" 
The briefing note also told company bosses to tell staff that Putin had been forced to change his mind about how he conducted a power transition because of global instability. 
""Putin could stay in power without any official title,"" said the document. ""Putin is Russia's national leader.""
Opinion polls suggest the constitutional reforms are likely to be approved, but turnout is important for the Kremlin.
Putin's approval rating is 59%, according to Levada, an independent pollster whose research the Kremlin has said it is not inclined to trust. Though high by most countries' standards, it is at its lowest since 1999. 
Polls show people's willingness to protest has risen as lower oil prices and a prolonged lockdown have battered the economy, unemployment has risen, and a Kremlin plan to reverse years of falling real wages has been knocked off course.
Opposition politician Yevgeny Roizman said the information campaign was a ""show"" intended to boost turnout for Putin, who said on Sunday he was considering seeking re-election if the constitutional changes were approved.
""Without a mass turnout, the show does not have any meaning. It's shameful to take part (in the vote),"" Roizman wrote on Twitter.
Participants in the draw will answer questions about the constitution. Those who answer correctly will have the chance to win prizes. Four officials in different regions confirmed to Reuters the fact that they would be issued with unique QR codes.
During the first six days of early voting, firms will pass back that information to an entity called ""the Project Office"" at the end of each day, the documents say. 
On July 1, the main voting day, information will be relayed back every two hours. 

At least nine of over 80 regions, including Moscow, have announced draws so far. Organisers in three regional capitals - Irkutsk, Buryatia and Tula - told Reuters the idea to hold such draws near polling stations and use QR codes was their own.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A former High Court of Australia judge was found to have sexually harassed six female staff, the court said on Monday, one of the country's most powerful figures to face such recriminations amid a global reset in workplace gender relations.
Dyson Heydon, who served on the country's most powerful court from 2003 to 2013, was found to have harassed six former staff members, known as judges' associates, the court said in a statement following an inquiry lasting several months.
A law firm named in local media as acting for Heydon, Speed & Stacey Lawyers, was not immediately available for comment. The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper quoted the firm denying the allegations on Heydon's behalf.
The court's statement did not give details or the time of the incidents under scrutiny, but said it was told of ""allegations of sexual harassment against a former justice"" in 2019 and immediately ordered an independent investigation.
""The findings are of extreme concern to me, my fellow justices, our chief executive and the staff of the court,"" the court's chief judge, Susan Kiefel, said in the statement.
""We're ashamed that this could have happened at the High Court of Australia,"" Kiefel added. 
In its statement denying the accusations quoted by the Sydney Morning Herald, Speed & Stacey also said Heydon apologised for any offence caused to the women.
""Any allegation of predatory behaviour or breaches of the law is categorically denied by our client,"" the newspaper quoted the law firm as saying.
""Our client says that if any conduct of his has caused offence, that result was inadvertent and unintended, and he apologises for any offence caused,"" it added.
""We have asked the High Court to convey that directly to the associate complainants.""
The court also said it had apologised to the women. It did not mention taking any action against the former judge but said it had accepted six recommendations made by the inquiry, including to ""make clear to associates that their duties do not extend to an obligation to attend social functions"".

ISTANBUL/ANTALYA (Reuters) - Turkey's Mediterranean coasts and historic attractions face a critical week as the government presses to open borders and salvage at least part of a tourist season already battered by the coronavirus pandemic. 
With beaches largely empty and many hotels deciding whether to open, Tourism Minister Mehmet Ersoy told Reuters he hoped the world's sixth-largest destination could attract up to half of last year's 45 million arrivals. 
But much depends on talks to begin flights from Russia, Germany and Britain - also hard hit by the virus - which should reach some conclusions by early next week, he said. 
The stakes are high for Turkey, where a rebound this month in COVID-19 cases has raised concerns in a country where tourism accounts for up to 12% of the economy. Foreign arrivals fell by two thirds in the first five months of the year. 
To convince foreigners and their governments that travel is safe, Ankara launched a ""healthy tourism"" programme including health and hygiene checks, and more than 600 hotels have applied for certification. It is lobbying some 70 countries with a focus on the European Union.
Yet flights are only beginning to trickle in, including from the United States. In the Mediterranean hub of Antalya at the weekend the historic town centre was virtually empty and very few foreign tourists were seen at hotels.
Such hotels ""cannot survive with only Turkish tourists,"" Ersoy said in a Friday interview. ""The next 10 days will be critical as decisions are made on borders ... so far it's not clear how international traffic will start."" 
Asked whether tourism would be halted if foreigners sparked new outbreaks, he said ""we have to watch the numbers"" and decisions would be taken with a separate scientific committee.
Turkey hopes top tourist source Russia - which has the world's third-highest coronavirus cases https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html - will start flights in mid-July. Second-place Germany has a coronavirus travel warning until the end of August but could lift it sooner. 
Since a lockdown was lifted this month, new official cases https://tmsnrt.rs/3e9GWu3 doubled before settling around 1,200 per day. President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey lost some ground. 
'LONGEST RECESSION'
Some $35 billion in tourism revenues helped briefly turn Turkey's current account positive last year. In April, the deficit was $5 billion as revenues disappeared and empty hotel rooms this summer would drive it higher. 
A growing external imbalance will put more pressure on Turkey's lira, which hit a record low last month, and could raise more concerns over Turkey's diminished foreign currency reserves.
""Tourism is probably the sector which will go through the longest recession"" and its seasonal workers face ""a very bad period,"" said Seyfettin Gursel, economist at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University.
Ankara decided to halt state funding that partially covered lost wages of formal employees, including some in tourism. Workers and a union said some hotels have begun training on hygiene and social distancing even while many have held off hiring.

Okan Osman, from Frankfurt, was one of very few tourists to arrive in Antalya, which he said was ""much better and cleaner"" than years past. ""Of course it's difficult for everyone and for the staff, but they seem to have been well trained and everyone is really well prepared.""

Washington says the sanctions, which took effect last week, mark the start of a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure on President Bashar al-Assad to stop the war and agree to a political solution.
The U.S.-led coalition did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from Reuters.
Northeastern Syria is controlled by Kurdish-led militia who have helped the U.S.-led coalition fight Islamic State, driving the jihadists out of swathes of Syrian territory.
Badran Jia Kurd, a vice president of the regional administration, said the sanctions would have an impact on his area which trades with government-held Syria via local merchants and uses the Syrian pound, which has plunged in value.
""They will lead to increase in prices to a very great degree and to weakness in trade activity with the Syrian interior, while on the other hand crossings to Iraq are closed, meaning the region was already living an economic siege,"" Jia Kurd said.
""They told us the self-administration regions will be exempt from the Caesar sanctions but the mechanisms and means to achieve this exemption are being discussed with the international coalition.""
The sanctions are named after a Syrian military photographer who smuggled thousands of photos out of Syria showing mass killings, torture and other crimes.
""We hope there will be international support for our regions given that they are fighting a continuing war against global terrorism,"" Jia Kurd wrote.
The coalition has said the sanctions do not impede humanitarian assistance or hinder ""coalition stabilization activities in northeast Syria"".

The new sanctions allow for the freezing of assets of anyone dealing with Syria, regardless of nationality.

The stone circle at Stonehenge, whose purpose remains unknown to scientists despite decades of research, is one of Britain's most famous landmarks and a draw to tourists and people in search of spiritual connections with nature.
The new discovery, described as ""astonishing"" by a team of archaeologists from multiple universities who took part in the project, shows a circle of shafts, 1.2 miles (2 km) in diameter, surrounding the settlement of Durrington Walls.
The site is located about 2 miles northeast of Stonehenge on Salisbury Plain, and evidence suggests the shafts date back to the same period, some 4,500 years ago.
""This is an unprecedented find of major significance within the UK,"" said Vincent Gaffney, one of the archaeologists leading the project.
""Key researchers on Stonehenge and its landscape have been taken aback by the scale of the structure and the fact that it hadn't been discovered until now so close to Stonehenge,"" he said.
Gaffney said the circle of shafts, each about 10 metres (33 ft) wide and 5 metres deep, demonstrated the desire of Neolithic communities to record their belief systems in ways and at a scale that researchers had never anticipated.
The discovery was made without the need for excavations, using remote sensing technology and sampling.

""I can't emphasise enough the effort that would have gone into digging such large shafts with tools of stone, wood and bone,"" said Gaffney.

Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party (CPP), which has been in power since 1979, holds every seat in the 125-member legislature after the main opposition was dissolved ahead of a 2018 general election, accused of plotting to overthrow the government.
Hun Sen, one of the world's longest-serving leaders after more than three decades in power, said CPP would remain at the helm and no one could challenge it.
""Who has the capability to replace Hun Sen right now? Let's be honest and come out,"" he said. ""There is no one,"" he said after inspecting the construction of a new provincial airport.
""But you are the one who wants it, but maybe you wait until next life. When there is Hun Sen's presence, CPP's presence here, you have to wait for the next life,"" he said in a speech shown live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) was disbanded and 118 members banned for five years in 2017 as part of a broad crackdown on the opposition, civil society and the media ahead of the 2018 election.
Its leader Kem Sokha is charged with treason, accused of conspiring with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen, which he denies.
Hun Sen on Monday said that the CPP's newly built $30 million headquarters in Phnom Penh and its provincial office were signs that the party would lead national politics for a long time to come.

""They are not for two to three years but for the next 50 years, 100 years, you have to remember,"" Hun Sen added.

The annual 10-day festival in the southwestern city of Yulin usually attracts thousands of visitors, many of whom buy dogs for the pot that are on display in cramped cages, but campaigners said the numbers this year have dwindled. 
The government is drawing up new laws to prohibit the wildlife trade and protect pets, and campaigners are hoping that this year will be the last time the festival is held.
""I do hope Yulin will change not only for the sake of the animals but also for the health and safety of its people,"" said Peter Li, China policy specialist with the Humane Society International, an animal rights group.
""Allowing mass gatherings to trade in and consume dog meat in crowded markets and restaurants in the name of a festival poses a significant public health risk,"" he said.
The coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in horseshoe bats before crossing into humans in a market in the city of Wuhan, has forced China to reassess its relationship with animals, and it has vowed to ban the wildlife trade. 
In April, Shenzhen became the first city in China to ban the consumption of dogs, with others expected to follow. 
The agriculture ministry also decided to classify dogs as pets rather than livestock, though it remains unclear how the reclassification will affect Yulin's trade. 
Zhang Qianqian, an animal rights activist who was in Yulin on Saturday, said it was only a matter of time before the dog-meat festival was banned. 
""From what we understand from our conversations with meat sellers, leaders have said the consumption of dog meat won't be allowed in future,"" she said. 

""But banning dog-meat consumption is going to be hard and will take some time.""

The country, which has recorded just 22 deaths from COVID-19, was among the first in the world to end all restrictions after declaring it had no active cases, but has seen a small number of new cases in recent days.
""We are extending the current cruise ship ban which was due to expire on the 30th of June,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a news conference. 
Cargo vessels will still be allowed to load and unload, fishing vessels to unload and resupply, and vessels can come to New Zealand to undertake repairs and refitting, Ardern said, although some quarantine rules would be tightened.
New Zealand reported two new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, both in managed isolation facilities, taking the total number of active cases to nine.
All active cases are people staying in quarantine facilities after entering the country, and there has so far been no evidence of community transmission.
The government has come under pressure after a slip-up allowed two women with coronavirus to move around the country, and Ardern last week called in the military to oversee quarantine facilities.
Ardern further tightened border measures on Monday, saying people in quarantine may need to do multiple virus tests, and they must test negative for coronavirus before leaving the facilities. 
""For a person to meet the low-risk indicator by day 14 to leave isolation or quarantine, they are expressly required to submit to a test and that test must be negative,"" Ardern said at the news conference.

New Zealand has recorded 1,163 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in total.

Duda will be the first foreign leader to visit the White House since the start of the coronavirus pandemic on a trip just four days ahead of Poland's presidential election on June 28, and which was announced unexpectedly last week.
""I can say there will be good news from Washington,"" Krzysztof Szczerski, the president's chief of staff, said on Monday. ""There will be three main topics: first of all, health, secondly, investments and development, and third, security.""
Security topics would cover energy, the Three Seas Initiative and cybersecurity, while health issues on the agenda concerned how to jointly tackle the coronavirus pandemic, he added. 
Duda will also discuss the security concerns of nations in the region, Szczerski said.
Last June, Trump agreed to send 1,000 more troops to Poland. Last week, Reuters reported the project was crumbling amid disputes over funding and where to garrison the troops. 
The report was denied by some Polish government officials and the U.S. envoy to Poland, Georgette Mosbacher.
On Monday, Trump said the United States would cut its troops in Germany by 9,500, to 25,000. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said he hopes some of them will be moved to Poland. 
Duda has said cooperation between the United States and Poland on nuclear energy projects will also figure in his talks.

An ally of Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, Duda has been leading in opinion polls, although some recent surveys have shown he may not win the second round of the vote.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Accounts by former U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton of discussions between leaders of the United States and the two Koreas in his upcoming book are inaccurate and distorted, South Korea said on Monday.
Bolton gives details in the book of conversations before and after three meetings between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, including how their second summit in Vietnam fell apart.
The book, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir"", is scheduled for publication on Tuesday but media outlets have released excerpts.
Reports have cited Bolton as writing that Moon, who is keen to improve relations with North Korea, had raised unrealistic expectations with both Kim and Trump for his own ""unification"" agenda.
""It does not reflect accurate facts and substantially distorts facts,"" South Korea's national security adviser, Chung Eui-yong, said in a statement referring to Bolton's description of top-level consultations.
Chung did not elaborate on specific areas South Korea saw as inaccurate but said the publication set a ""dangerous precedent"".
""Unilaterally publishing consultations made based on mutual trust violates the basic principles of diplomacy and could severely damage future negotiations,"" he said.
Trump and Kim met for the first time in Singapore in June 2018, raising hope for efforts to press North Korea to give up its nuclear programme in exchange for the lifting of sanctions.
But their second summit, in Vietnam in early 2019, collapsed when Trump rejected an offer by Kim to give up North Korea's main nuclear facility in return for lifting some sanctions. 
Bolton reportedly cites Chung as relaying Moon's response to the breakdown as, on the one hand, Trump was right to reject Kim's proposal but on the other, Kim's willingness to dismantle the Yongbyon facility was a ""very meaningful first step"" toward ""irreversible"" denuclearisation. 
Bolton refers to Moon's position as ""schizophrenic"".

Asked about that reference by Bolton, a top official in Moon's office told reporters: ""Perhaps he is in that condition.""

TAICHUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen oversaw the first public test flight of a new locally designed and made advanced jet trainer on Monday, part of her government's plan to boost defences in the face of a growing challenge from China. 
Taiwan's armed forces are mostly equipped by the United States, but Tsai has made development of an advanced home-grown defence industry a priority, especially as China, which claims the island as its own, steps up military modernisation efforts.
The new AT-5 Brave Eagle, made by state-owned Aerospace Industrial Development Corp with a buddget of T$68.6 billion ($2.32 billion), is the first jet made domestically since the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo fighter, rolled out more than three decades ago.
Speaking at an air base in the central city of Taichung, Tsai said the new aircraft disproved naysayers who thought Taiwan lacked the technology and should focus on meeting its defence needs from abroad.
""The new trainer aircraft not only has created more than 2,000 job opportunities, but will also pass on experiences and cultivate a new generation of aerospace industry technical talent,"" she said. 
The single AT-5, flanked by a Ching-kuo fighter, made a 12-minute flight in front of Tsai. Its first official test flight was earlier this month, less than a year after the prototype was unveiled.
The trainer can be equipped with weapons. Taiwan's air force plans on taking 66 units by 2026 to replace aging AT-3 and F-5 training aircraft.
The test flight came amid a stepped-up Chinese military presence near the democratic island. Taiwan says China's air force has flown near it at least seven times in the last two weeks, the latest on Sunday.

Taiwan unveiled its largest defence spending increase in more than a decade last year, and the government is also developing new, domestically-made submarines.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia's ruling conservative party led by President Aleksandar Vucic is set for a landslide win in Sunday's parliamentary election, results projected by Ipsos and CeSID pollsters showed.
The projection shows the Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (SNS) on track to win 62.5% of the votes, while the Socialist party - a junior coalition partner in the outgoing government - is seen coming second with 10.7% of the votes.
The centre-right Serbian Patriotic Alliance led by former water polo player Aleksandar Sapic is seen in third place with 4% of the votes.
A brass band orchestra at the SNS headquarters was playing traditional Serbian music before Vucic proclaimed victory. 
Dozens of smiling people cramped in a small room, hugged each other and few had their faces covered with masks, despite doctors warning to be cautious to avoid spreading of the coronavirus. 
""Tonight people showed enormous trust in our team,"" Vucic told journalists. ""Serbian people have decided what kind of future they want.""
Another Serbian pollster CRTA saw turnout at 48% compared to 56.7% in 2016. The State Election Commission is due to announce preliminary results including turnout later in the evening. 
Turnout was hit by a boycott by some opposition parties, who say the vote will not be free or fair owing to Vucic's grip on the media. 
Florian Bieber, a Balkan expert at Austria's University of Graz, tweeted after seeing results: ""It is a phyrric victory, without opposition in parliament the election is discredited and its rule less legitimate than ever before.""
Voters largely back efforts by Vucic's ruling coalition to push for Serbian membership of the European Union while maintaining strong ties with Russia and China.
But the future government will face increasing EU and U.S. pressure to recognise the independence of Serbia's former province of Kosovo, a move seen as key for regional stability.
Serbia, which has a population of 7.2 million, has reported 12,894 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 261 deaths. It was among the first European countries to start opening its borders on May 22 and all lockdown curbs have since been lifted.
Analysts and pollsters said that health concerns kept some voters at home, especially among higher-risk groups. About 1.2 million people on the electoral list have lived abroad for years and are unlikely to vote.

""If we take into account number of votes (the SNS got)... we are heading to a North Korean or Chinese system,"" said Slobodan Zecevic, a lecturer of international law with the Belgrade-based European University.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said in an interview published on Sunday that he would consider meeting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and played down his earlier decision to recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's legitimate leader.
""I would maybe think about that. ... Maduro would like to meet. And I'm never opposed to meetings,"" Trump told online news site Axios on Friday, a move that would upend his ""maximum pressure"" campaign aimed at ousting the Socialist president.
""But at this moment, I've turned them down,"" Trump added.
Trump had expressed an openness in 2018 to meeting Maduro, who had also made overtures for talks, but nothing materialized and the United States instead ratcheted up the pressure.
But Trump's latest comments were possibly the clearest sign yet of what some U.S. officials have privately said was growing frustration over his administration's failure to unseat Maduro through sanctions and diplomacy.
Trump also indicated flagging confidence in Guaido. The United States and most other Western countries have recognized Guaido as the OPEC nation's interim president since January last year, regarding Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham.
But Maduro has retained the support of the military as well as the backing of Russia, Cuba, China and Iran.
Asked whether he regretted having thrown his weight behind Guaido, Trump was quoted by Axios as initially saying: ""Not particularly,"" but then went on to say: ""I could have lived with it or without it, but I was very firmly against what's going on in Venezuela.""

Trump said that at the point he made his decision, ""I think that I wasn't necessarily in favor, but I said — some people that liked it, some people didn't. I was OK with it. ... I don't think it was very meaningful one way or the other.""

Iran supplied 1.5 million barrels of fuel to Venezuela last month amid a collapse of refinery operations and tightening sanctions by the United States that has made it more difficult for Venezuela to obtain fuel on international markets.
The Iranian-flagged general cargo ship Golsan, owned by Mosakhar Darya Shipping Co, departed on May 15 from Bandar Abbas. Five tankers left for the Caribbean from the same port in March after loading fuel, according to Eikon data.
""The Golsan will arrive carrying food to open the first Iranian supermarket in Venezuela,"" the Iranian Embassy wrote on Saturday via its Twitter account. It did not provide details.
Venezuela's Information Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Iran is expected to dispatch two to three monthly shipments of gasoline to its ally Venezuela, sources close to the matter said, which would help offload the gasoline inventory that Iran accumulates, while helping to alleviate the fuel shortage in Venezuela.
The growing bilateral trade could lead to retaliation by the United States, which has enacted extensive sanctions programs against the two countries.

China suspended poultry imports from a  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN). plant where hundreds of employees tested positive for Covid-19, stoking concerns over the broader implications for U.S. and global meat exports.
All products from the plant in Springdale, Arkansas, where Tyson is based, that are about to arrive in China or have arrived at the country’s ports will be seized by customs. The suspension announced Sunday is an about face from just a few days ago, when Chinese officials said food was unlikely to be responsible for a fresh virus outbreak in Beijing.
The move is a potential new threat to meat plants across the world that have seen slaughter disruptions because of the virus. In the U.S., hundreds of workers have become ill, and dozens have died. There’s also been a recent uptick in infections at facilities in Brazil and Germany.
If China continues to suspend shipments based on coronavirus cases reported at processing plants, it could also threaten to undermine promised agricultural purchases as part of the Washington-Beijing trade deal.
Tyson in a statement Sunday said it was looking into the report and cited that the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there’s no evidence that virus transmission is associated with food. The company late Friday said 13% of its workers tested positive for the virus at plants in northwest Arkansas.
China has backed off from its previous stance linking food to virus cases. A customs official at a briefing on Friday said the country was taking the advice of international organizations that there’s a low risk of imported food transmitting the virus, and no food restrictions would be imposed.
But the move to block the Tyson shipments runs counter to that, and reverts the country back to increasing its scrutiny over imported food. Meanwhile, a German abattoir last week voluntarily halted pork exports to China after workers were found to be infected.
A new outbreak in China had been blamed on imported salmon after the head of a food market where clusters were detected said the virus had been traced to a chopping board used by a fish seller. Fears over whether food can transmit viruses had led salmon to be boycotted in the Asian country.
China’s customs authorities had started testing all shipments of imported meat for the virus, while officials in some major cities were also checking the products at domestic markets. In a statement Thursday, China Customs said all 32,174 samples of imported seafood, meat, vegetables, fruit and other related products had tested negative.
The country’s scrutiny may end up having a big impact on global food shipments. Its surging imports of meat had helped to buoy U.S. and Brazilian producers of poultry, pork and beef, both before the nation’s virus outbreak in January and as global trade has staged a nascent recovery in recent weeks with the country exiting lockdowns.
Through April, U.S. exports of poultry meat and products excluding eggs to China were valued at $152 million, up from only about $7 million in the comparable period in 2019, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed.
But the new outbreak in China was already threatening to derail shipments, and moves by officials to block shipments over virus concerns would compound the problem.
Beijing is the site of a recent jump in new cases in China after a two-month lull. Some residents are back under partial lockdown and transport links are disrupted, with more than 800 flights canceled on Friday.
On Sunday, PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) China said it shut a food plant in the Chinese capital after a case of the virus was confirmed earlier in the week. The company conducted tests on all employees at the plant and quarantined 480 workers, even though they all tested negative, one of its officials, Fan Zhimin, said at a local government briefing. PepsiCo China later said in a WeChat post that none of its beverage plants in the country have reported any cases of the virus.
Meanwhile in the U.S., meat plants have almost returned to pre-virus production levels after outbreaks in April and May forced facilities to shutter.

Many cities in France were holding annual ""Fete de la Musique"" events, which were monitored closely by police to ensure people were complying with social-distancing measures imposed to curb the coronavirus.
BFM TV said police had to move in to disperse crowds from Paris' Canal St Martin, while C News and residents of Nantes broadcast images of police using tear gas on crowds in Nantes.
The event in Nantes also coincided with a demonstration to mark the anniversary of the death of Steve Canico, who died after a clash between police and revellers in June 2019.
Canico's death became a focal point for protests and scrutiny over policing methods in France. The 24-year-old disappeared at a concert where police had clashed with late-night revellers by the riverbank in Nantes, and Canico's body was subsequently found in the Loire River.
Residents of Nantes posted images and videos on Twitter of some demonstrators setting bins on fire. Officials at the Nantes police department could not be immediately reached for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil the latest easing of Britain's coronavirus lockdown on Tuesday when he will also announce the conclusion of a review into whether a two-metre rule on social distancing should be relaxed, his office said.
Britain's economy has been hammered by the lockdown to stop the spread of COVID-19 and although non-essential retailers were allowed to reopen last Monday, many businesses, particularly in the hospitality and leisure sectors, have remained closed.
Some lawmakers in Johnson's party have been vocal in calling for him to drop the two-metre rule saying it was having a devastating impact on the economy which shrank by a quarter over March and April. But the government has been cautious, saying it did not want to risk a second spike in novel coronavirus cases.
Johnson's office said the prime minister would tell parliament on Tuesday which sectors would be allowed to reopen on July 4 under the government's roadmap out of the lockdown. Detailed guidance would be provided to each sector so businesses were ""Covid secure"".
The Sunday Telegraph reported that Johnson would also announce a change to the social distancing guidelines so people would only need to remain one metre apart providing they took additional measures such as wearing a mask.
Britain has one of the highest death tolls in the world from COVID-19, but the number of cases has been steadily falling in recent weeks. The death toll on Sunday of confirmed cases rose by 43 to 42,632, one of the lowest increases since the lockdown was imposed in March.
""The disease is increasingly under control,"" Johnson said on Sunday. ""Of course as we make that progress, it will be possible for us to open up more. On social distancing, watch this space and you won't have very much more to wait now.""
Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were possible mitigations that could allow people to be closer than two metres while limiting the risk of spreading the virus. He said he would not rule out people having to register their details before going to a pub or a restaurant.

A spokeswoman for Johnson said it was important that people followed the social distancing rules as they were eased and they would ""not hesitate"" to put the handbrake on.

Bolsonaro was speaking in Rio de Janeiro at the funeral of paratrooper who died the day before in an accident at an air base. His comments come as his supporters and detractors gathered in cities across the country, in a stark symbol of the polarization in Latin America's largest country.
""Our mission, the mission of the Armed Forces, is to defend the country, it is to defend democracy,"" Bolsonaro said in a video of his comments posted online. He added that ""we are at the service of the will of the Brazilian population.""
Tensions have been growing in Brasilia amid a tense standoff between the president and the Supreme Court, leading some to suggest the military would be forced to pick sides in an eventual worsening of the situation.
Stirred on by his supporters and former generals in his cabinet, Bolsonaro has stoked the tension, saying the military would never remove him from office. The president has grown frustrated by legal cases affecting him and his political backers, while also facing multiple impeachment proposals in Congress that have yet to get off the ground. 
The friction also comes as Brazil has struggled with a worsening coronavirus pandemic. It is set to overtake 50,000 deaths on Sunday after passing 1 million cases on Friday. Brazil now has the second-worst outbreak in the world after the United States.

Sunday also saw marches both for and against the president in various Brazilian cities. In Brasilia, the two opposing groups were separated by police. Some of the anti-Bolsonaro marches also included protests against racism in solidarity with the U.S. Black Lives Matter movement.

READING, England (Reuters) - A stabbing rampage in the southern English town of Reading in which three people were killed and three taken to hospital was an act of terrorism, police said on Sunday, calling the attack in a sunny park an atrocity.
Detectives said a man had run into a park in Reading, about 40 miles (65 km) west of London where locals had been enjoying the evening sun on Saturday, and attacked people with a knife before being tackled by unarmed officers five minutes after they were alerted. 
Police said an unnamed 25-year-old man who had initially been detained on suspicion of murder had since been re-arrested under the Terrorism Act. He remains in police custody.
""The investigation continues to move at a fast pace,"" said Detective Chief Superintendent Kath Barnes, head of the regional counter-terrorism unit.
A Western security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the arrested man was a Libyan called Khairi Saadallah.
The security source said Saadallah had come across the radar of Britain's domestic security agency MI5 last year over intelligence he had aspirations to travel for extremist purposes, although his plans came to nothing. 
He never met the criteria for a full investigation, the source said. 
Initially police and the government had said the attack did not appear to be terrorism. But Britain's most senior counter-terrorism police officer, Neil Basu, said officers had worked through the night and had now declared it to be a terrorist incident. 
""This was an atrocity,"" Basu said. ""From our enquiries undertaken so far, officers have found nothing to suggest that there were any other people involved in the attack, and presently, we are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident.""
'APPALLED AND SICKENED'
While the motivation for the attack was unclear, he said there was no intelligence other crowded places were at risk. 
The victims have not yet been formally identified but a school in a nearby town said one of its teachers, James Furlong, had been killed.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled and sickened"" by the attack and said Britain would change the law if needed to prevent any future incidents.
""If there are lessons we need to learn ... we will learn those lessons and we will not hesitate to take action if necessary,"" he said.
A witness said the attack began in Reading's Forbury Gardens when a man suddenly shouted unintelligibly and then veered towards a group of about eight to 10 friends and began stabbing them. 
""He darted round anti-clockwise the circle, got one, went to another, stabbed the next one, went to another, stabbed the next one,"" Lawrence Wort, 20, told BBC TV. ""He stood up and I saw a massive knife in his hand, probably at least 5 inches (13 cm) minimum.""
The attack took place after a Black Lives Matter rally by anti-racism protesters in the park which concluded three hours earlier but Basu said the two incidents were not related. 
Current coronavirus restrictions mean venues like pubs are closed, so many people in Britain gather in parks in the evenings to meet friends.
The nature of the attack was reminiscent of a number of recent incidents in Britain that authorities considered to be terrorism.
In February, police shot dead a man, previously jailed for promoting violent Islamist material, who had stabbed two people on a busy street in south London. Last November another man who had been jailed for terrorism offences stabbed two people to death on London Bridge before he too was shot dead by police.

Britain also suffered four attacks in 2017, the most deadly of them a suicide bombing at the end of a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester, northern England.

147,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 21, 2020 12:32PM ET</span>","Egyptian high-school pupils, masked and gloved, head into exams","CAIRO (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of Egyptian high-school pupils armed with masks, gloves and hand sanitizers started their final exams on Sunday, despite objections from some parents worried about spreading the coronavirus.
The health ministry was laying on 2,500 ambulances and providing a doctor for each school. Any student with a high temperature is meant to have their exam postponed or sit it in isolation.
The students had their temperatures taken in the morning, before being seated at desks spaced apart from one another.
Nearly 670,000 pupils from state and private schools, and 128,000 from religious schools, were due to sit the exams. They come at a time when Egypt has seen an acceleration of coronavirus cases, with confirmed infections surging to 53,758, including 2,106 deaths. 
Authorities have been gradually easing restrictions on movement, though schools and universities have remained shut since March.
The head of Egypt's doctors' syndicate had called for the exams to be postponed, private newspaper Al-Youm al-Sabaa reported, and some parents expressed concern about their children's safety. 
""Honestly I was worried, and am still worried, because someone in the class might have something (be infected) without having informed the administration on the way in,"" said Ayman Mahmoud, whose two sons were taking exams in Cairo. 
Authorities said they had taken all necessary precautions and the education ministry offered students an option to postpone to the next academic year without any penalty. 
End-of-year exams were cancelled for younger pupils, who submitted online research papers instead. 
As in other countries, many coronavirus cases in Egypt are believed to go unreported. The higher education minister cited a study on June 1 estimating that the actual number of cases could be up to five times higher than the reported figure.

Israel, citing support from U.S. President Donald Trump, has announced plans to extend sovereignty over parts of the West Bank - including the Jordan Valley, which partly borders the Dead Sea. Palestinians have voiced outrage at the proposal. 
The Dead Sea is a popular destination where bathers float in hypersaline waters and use the nutrient-rich mud on their skin. Its shores border Israel, Jordan and the West Bank.
""This place is a blessing for all Palestinians, but if there will be annexation it will be hard for them to reach here. They may need permits,"" said Musa Farah, a lifeguard at one of the small, Israeli-run resorts that dot the Dead Sea's West Bank coast.
Even some owners of Israeli resorts - set up after Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war - are concerned they could lose customers under the annexation plan.
""My business will be very much affected,"" said Dina Dagan, owner of the Biankini Village Resort. ""The Israeli government should know that my business depends on the Palestinians who visit here. This place is open for Jews and Arabs.""
During peace talks - stalled since 2014 - the Palestinians have sought to gain some control over part of the Dead Sea coastline and set up resorts, which they see as a potential boon for their economy.
The Palestinians have long sought a state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. 

Most countries view Israeli settlements in occupied territory as illegal. Israel rejects this.

The protesters, many of them university students and staff, actors and writers, carried placards and made speeches in front of the main building denouncing the planned changes.
""The government has already damaged Hungarian culture a great deal and we have to raise our voice against what they are planning to do now,"" said Jozsef Mate, a theatre fan at the protest. 
A bill introduced in parliament on May 26 would transfer the ownership of the state-run institution, which goes back 155 years, to a private foundation.
The government argues the new structure will make the country's most important institution for training theatre and movie directors and actors more flexible and efficient and help the school access more finances. 
The government has already reshaped Corvinus University, a major school of economics, in such a way and the reorganisation of seven other schools is in progress.
The fact that the universities in question will be governed by a board of trustees ""not only diminishes the state's influence on these schools but completely eliminates it"", Gergely Gulyas, the prime minister's chief of staff, said on Thursday.
But critics say the trustees will be appointed by the government and given the right to appoint the head of the school in a non-transparent manner, without consulting faculty or students.
The institution is ""going to be managed by a foundation, through which the government can exercise total control over the university"", a petition initiated by students says.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban has extended his influence over most walks of life in the central European country during his decade-long rule.

The European Union has long criticised him for policies it says threaten the rule of law by imposing party control over the judiciary, media and academic institutions.

Michael Korenberg, chair of the university's board of governors, quit after a ""deeply hurtful"" incident, UBC vice chair Sandra Cawley said in a statement issued late on Saturday.
""His decision comes after information that was publicized last week about his social media interactions that appeared to support regressive voices online and undermine legitimate protest,"" she said.
Korenberg resigned after The Ubyssey, UBC's student newspaper, reported he had liked a series of tweets from U.S. conservative figures disparaging the Black Lives Matter campaign and Antifa, an umbrella term for primarily leftist anti-authoritarians.
Many Canadian cities have been the sites of anti-racism rallies in recent weeks, on the heels of similar protests in the United States. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau says Canadians need to do more to address ""systemic racism.""
Last week he backed the leader of an opposition party who was ejected from the House of Commons for branding a member of another party a racist. [nL1N2DV17E]

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa's last apartheid president, F.W. de Klerk, has withdrawn from a U.S. seminar about minority rights because he did not want to embarrass himself or his hosts in the current charged racial climate, his foundation said on Sunday.
De Klerk, who was the head of South Africa's white minority government until 1994, was scheduled to speak on July 1 at an American Bar Association (ABA) virtual event on issues such as minority rights, racism and the rule of law.
But his participation unleashed a barrage of criticism from South African opposition parties and activists who called on ABA to cancel De Klerk's attendance given his role in the apartheid-era security apparatus.
""The allegation that De Klerk was involved in gross violations of human rights is baseless,"" the F.W. de Klerk foundation said in a statement.
""However, it appears unacceptable in the current super-heated racial climate that any leader from South Africa's troubled past should be permitted to retain the slightest vestige of honour,"" it said.
ABA confirmed De Klerk would no longer speak at the event.
The death of Black man George Floyd under the knee of a U.S. police officer last month has triggered a wave of anti-racism protests around the world.
""At a time like this where the whole world is crying out for recognition and demanding that value be placed on our lives, on Black lives, we think that ABA erred in inviting someone like De Klerk,"" said Lukhanyo Calata.
He is the son of Fort Calata, who was killed along with three other anti-apartheid activists by South African police in 1985 in an incident known as ""The Cradock Four"".
De Klerk's foundation defended his legacy of helping South Africa's transition from white minority rule to non-racial constitutional democracy and for being the only world leader to dismantle an existing nuclear arsenal.
But, almost thirty years after apartheid's demise, De Klerk's role remains highly contested in South Africa, one of the world's most unequal societies where class and race issues constantly bubble under the surface.

Earlier this year De Klerk, an octogenarian who shared the Nobel Peace Prize with South Africa's first democratically elected president Nelson Mandela, also faced a backlash when he told the national broadcaster he did not believe apartheid was a crime against humanity, as declared by the United Nations.

The draft law has alarmed foreign governments and Hong Kong democracy activists, who are concerned that Beijing is eroding the high degree of autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed over to China in 1997 from British rule.
The National People's Congress Standing Committee, which usually meets every two months, is due to meet from June 28 to 30 in Beijing, Xinhua said.
It did not say whether the Hong Kong national security law was on the agenda.
The Global Times, a tabloid published by the People's Daily, cited ""observers"" as saying the parliamentary body would likely enact the Hong Kong security law by July 1.
Pro-democracy groups rally in Hong Kong every year on July 1, the anniversary of the city's handover to the mainland.
Under China's legislative process, new laws typically require three readings before being passed, but some can pass on the second reading if there is sufficient consensus.
Details of the new law show China will have overarching powers over the enforcement of a new national security law in Hong Kong, in what would be the deepest change to the city's way of life since it returned to Chinese rule.

Russia will hold a nationwide vote from June 25 to July 1 on proposed changes to the constitution, including an amendment that would allow Putin to seek two more six-year terms as president when his current mandate ends in 2024.
Opponents say the reforms are designed to allow Putin to keep power until 2036 and amount to a constitutional coup. The Kremlin says they are needed to strengthen the role of parliament and improve social policy and public administration. 
""I do not rule out the possibility of running for office, if this (option) comes up in the constitution. We'll see,"" Putin was quoted as saying in an interview with state TV that was shown in Russia's far east before airing in western Russia. ""I have not decided anything for myself yet."" 
The changes that Russians will vote on, already approved by parliament and the Constitutional Court, would reset Putin's presidential term tally to zero. He would not be able to seek a new term under current constitutional limits.
The changes are widely expected to be approved in the vote.
Putin, who has been in power for two decades and is now 67, suggested the hunt for a candidate to succeed him could become a distraction if he does not run again.
""If this doesn't happen, then in about two years - and I know this from personal experience - the normal rhythm of work of many parts of government will be replaced by a search for possible successors,"" Interfax news agency cited him as saying.

""We must be working, not looking for successors,"" he said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Panamanian authorities this week finalised the exhumation of 19 bodies in a private cemetery in Panama City as part of a search for victims of the 1989 invasion by the United States, Panamanian judicial authorities said.
The bodies were exhumed from the Jardín de Paz cemetery in the capital, where they were buried 30 years ago after initially being dumped in mass graves during the December 1989 to January 1990 invasion. Some bodies remain unidentified.
The corpses were dug up at a site holding about 100 graves of those died during the U.S. military operation that led to the deaths of at least 500 Panamanians and marked the end of the dictatorship of General Manuel Noriega. 
About 300 civilians died in the assault, according to official estimates. Only 23 American soldiers lost their lives. 
But human rights organizations have long estimated the true number of Panamanian victims could be higher, prompting the government of Juan Carlos Varela to establish a commission to investigate the death toll.
""We have been working for 30 years to make sure (the dead) have some inner peace,"" said Trinidad Ayola, president of an association that has worked with authorities to identify the victims.
A total of 19 corpses have been exhumed, the Public Ministry told Reuters. ""Seventy seven graves have been pending in the field for exhumation,"" it added.
The invasion is an open wound for many Panamanians who each year commemorate the event and have called for Dec. 20 to be declared a day of national mourning.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban militants kidnapped about 60 civilians in central Afghanistan over the past week, officials said on Sunday, with more than half still being held amid efforts by the United States and other foreign powers to start peace talks.
The Taliban took the hostages in the central province of Daikundi after a women escaped a Taliban-controlled village in a neighbouring province, according to the provincial deputy governor, Mohammad Ali Uruzgani.
Some 26, including women and children, had been released and tribal elders were mediating to free the remaining civilians, Uruzgani added. 
A Taliban spokesman denied kidnapping the civilians.
The militants, fighting to re-introduce strict Islamic law after their 2001 ouster from power, signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in February, which was designed to pave the way for peace talks with the Afghan government. 
But violence has ramped up since the agreement and discord over the release of Taliban prisoners has hampered progress on formal talks.
Underscoring the tension, a spokesman for the national security council said the Taliban had killed more than 40 civilians around the country in the past week.
""The Taliban have failed to deliver on promises of reducing violence against the Afghan people and working for peace,"" spokesman Javid Faisal said on Twitter.
The U.N. mission in Afghanistan released a report on Sunday raising concerns about 15 attacks on health workers and health care facilities during the coronavirus pandemic, attributing responsibility for the majority of them to the Taliban. 
The Taliban rejected both the U.N. and government allegations and accused the government of causing civilian casualties in the last week.

ADEN (Reuters) - Southern separatists have seized control of Yemen's island of Socotra in the Arabian Sea, deposing its governor and driving out forces of the Saudi-backed government which condemned the action as coup.
The Southern Transitional Council (STC) declared self rule in the south in April, complicating U.N. efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in a war that has separatists and the government fighting as nominal allies in a Saudi-led coalition against the Houthi group, who control the north. 
On Saturday, the STC announced it had seized government facilities and military bases on the main island of Socotra, a sparsely populated archipelago which sits at the mouth of the Gulf of Aden on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes. 
The government which is led by President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi condemned the action as a ""full-fledged"" coup on the island and accused STC forces of attacking government buildings in ""gang-style behaviour"".
Socotra governor Ramzi Mahroos accused coalition leaders Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates of turning a blind eye. The UAE has previously backed STC forces with air strikes in fighting against the government in the south. 
The coalition's Saudi spokesman and the UAE foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Sources told Reuters last week that Saudi Arabia, which has tried to broker a deal between the STC and Hadi's government, had presented a proposal to end the separatist stand-off, but the STC subsequently denied receiving it.
Riyadh wants to prevent another front developing in Yemen's multifaceted war, which has been locked in military stalemate for years.
The coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government for power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

Socotra, a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its unique fauna and flora, is located in the shipping lane linking Asia to the Europe via the Red sea and Suez Canal.

CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - A shimmering ring of light flashed into view on Sunday in parts of the eastern hemisphere as the moon drifted across the face of the sun in a rare eclipse on the longest day of the year. 
The path of the eclipse spanned East Asia, South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Most locations saw only a partial eclipse, with just a handful witnessing the true ""ring of fire"". 
Unlike in a total eclipse, the moon in an annular, or ring-like, eclipse is unable to completely cover the sun, leaving a thin halo of light at its maximum phase. 
Such an eclipse happens when the moon is farther away in its elliptical orbit around the Earth, appearing smaller as a result. 
Hundreds of skywatchers gathered in an open space in Chiayi in southern Taiwan, one of the locations in Asia where the annular eclipse was visible. 
""I'm more than 50 years old, so it's great that I could see this,"" said retiree Zhuang Yuhui, 56, who travelled to Chiayi from nearby Taichung city. 
""I'm beyond excited.""
In Taipei, groups of people gathered to view the eclipse through tinted glasses and their phones as the sky turned eerily darker. 
""It's an astronomical miracle,"" said Elisa Chen, 29.
Solar eclipses on the summer solstice are rare. The last one was in June 2001. 
But a ""ring of fire"" eclipse that falls exactly in midsummer - whether in the northern or southern hemisphere - is even more uncommon. 
There have been none in at least 100 years, according to Reuters calculations based on NASA data. 
The next one is in 2039, and then in 2392.

He said there were mitigations to allow people to be closer than two metres while limiting the risk of spreading the COVID-19 virus and they would set out details about how businesses could comply.
He said it was possible people would have to register their details before going to a pub or a restaurant.
""I certainly wouldn't rule that out,"" he said.
""The proposals that we will bring forward are how you can safely, safely reduce the two metres with the sort of mitigations we have been talking about,"" he said.
""I get the problems with the two-metre rule of course, ultimately there are problems with the fact that there's a virus and the challenge for the country, for all countries is how to get as much of normal life as possible going again.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Passengers wearing masks and wheeling suitcases arrived at Madrid's main airport on Sunday as Spain opened its borders to most European countries and ended a state of emergency imposed to contain the coronavirus.
Spain's borders are now open to all European Union countries except Portugal, as well as Schengen Area members outside the bloc and Britain in a much-needed boost to the country's tourism industry which accounts for more than 12% of the economy. 
British tourists will be allowed in without having to quarantine, Spain said on Saturday, even though they will still be subject to 14 days isolation upon their return.. 
Spaniards were also allowed to move freely around the country from Sunday and many were expected to visit friends, relatives and second homes in other regions. Since March 14, people have had to remain in their own provinces.
At Madrid's international Adolfo Suarez-Barajas airport there was a palpable sense of relief for passengers, many of whom were making journeys to see loved ones after months apart. 
""My situation is a little complicated because my wife lives in Italy and I live in Spain so we haven't seen each other for four months,"" said Alberto Bos, who was flying to Milan. 
All arriving passengers will have their temperature taken, submit information about where they have come from, and provide their whereabouts in Spain in case they need to be traced.
Spain's border with neighbouring Portugal will reopen on July 1.
""It's very strange because we aren't used to travelling anymore,"" said Italian tourist Martina, who was among the first to arrive in Spain on a flight from Bergamo.
Stickers on the floor of the arrivals hall made sure those waiting for passengers complied with social distancing measures. 
""We will allow British visitors to enter Spain just like the rest of the European Union or Schengen area from 21 June freely and without the need for the quarantine,"" foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told BBC News on Saturday.
But Britain's own quarantine measures, requiring a two-week period of self-isolation for most people entering the country, could put off potential travellers. Britain is due to review its quarantine rule on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced.
Some 1,500 German tourists touched down in Mallorca early last week as part of a pilot scheme to establish a travel corridor between the two areas, ahead of the lifting of restrictions on Sunday.
In his final address during the state of emergency, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez praised Spaniards on Saturday for coming together during one of Europe's strictest lockdowns but warned they should remain vigilant as there could be a second wave. 

Spain, which has recorded more than 245,000 coronavirus cases and over 28,000 deaths, has been easing its lockdown restrictions in recent weeks.

In the first incident, two bombs planted in front of the house of a military official in Wanlaweyn town, 90 km northwest of the capital Mogadishu, exploded late on Saturday, killing four people, including soldiers and civilians.
No group has claimed responsibility. Such attacks are commonplace in Somalia, where Islamist militant organisation al Shabaab have been waging a 12-year campaign to topple the central government. 
""First we heard a blast at the house. The military officer was absent by then. Guards and residents came to find out what caused the blast and then a second blast went off,"" Mohamed Nur, a police officer, told Reuters from Wanlaweyn on Sunday.
In the second incident, three militants in a car carried out a suicide bomb attack at a military checkpoint in Bacadweyn town in central Somalia's Galmudug state on Sunday.
Soldiers shot at the vehicle after its occupants ignored orders to stop. Three soldiers died and two others were wounded, according to Major Abdullahi Ahmed, a military officer in the nearby town of Galkayo.
Al Shabaab, which wants to establish its own rule in Somalia based on its own strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law, could not be reached for comment. 
Residents of Bacadweyn, about 180 km to south east of Galkayo, said they were afraid the attackers belonged al Shabaab.

China has not said anything about any losses in the hand-to-hand combat that took place in the heavily contested Galwan Valley in the western Himalayas, in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and at least 76 injured. 
""If 20 were martyred on our (Indian) side, then there would have been at least double the casualties on their (China) side,"" V.K.Singh, the minister for roads and transport, told TV News24 in an interview broadcast late on Saturday.

China's state controlled Global Times said earlier there had been casualties on the Chinese side but did not elaborate. 
Singh said the Indian side had handed over Chinese troops who had strayed into Indian territory after the violent standoff.
India's defense ministry spokesman Bharat Bhushan Babu refused to comment on Singh's interview.
The nuclear-armed Asian neighbors traded accusations on Saturday that the other had violated their shared de facto border, an area that this week became the site of their deadliest clash in half a century.

The approval rating had fallen to 27% in the paper's previous survey conducted soon after a senior Tokyo prosecutor who was seen close to the premier resigned in late May for gambling during Japan's coronavirus state of emergency.
A drop in voter support below 30% is often seen as a danger sign. 
The Mainichi report on its latest survey does not give specific reasons for the rebound in support, but 55% of those polled welcomed the government's decision on Thursday to lift curbs on domestic travels.
That compares with 32% of those surveyed who said the restrictions should have remained in place. 
Prosecutors on Thursday arrested former justice minister Katsuyuki Kawai, a one-time foreign policy adviser close to Abe, and Kawai's lawmaker wife, Anri, on suspicion of vote-buying in a 2019 upper-house election. 
Although support for Abe's government rebounded, 59% of those surveyed believe Abe has heavy responsibility for the matter.
Abe has apologised to the public over the scandal, saying he felt his responsibility strongly for his appointment of Kawai to the post.
The Mainichi survey also showed that 59% of those polled do not believe the Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled for July and August this year but postponed by one year due to the coronavirus pandemic, can be held next year. Only 21% believe the event can be held in 2021. 

Japan has not suffered the explosive surge of coronavirus infections seen in some other countries, with about 18,000 confirmed cases and 954 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.

After a year of often-violent unrest, anti-government demonstrations have lost momentum due to higher risk of arrest, with recent rallies failing to receive police approval due to coronavirus restrictions on large crowds.
A strike was intended to open a new arena of resistance, but organizers said only 8,943 union members participated in a city-wide poll, falling short of the 60,000 threshold to go ahead, even as 95% of the votes were in favor.
Separately, the Secondary School Students Action Platform said it would not initiate a class boycott, as they fell short of some of their targets for in-person votes.
Voting took place on Saturday and the results were announced around midnight.
The unions represented almost two dozen industries, including aviation, transport, construction, technology and tourism. Most were formed in the past year as pro-democracy activists have spearheaded the biggest push to unionize the laissez-faire, ultra-capitalist finance hub - where collective bargaining rights are not recognized - since Britain handed the city back to China in 1997. 
China on Saturday announced details of the national security legislation, unveiling Beijing will have overarching powers over its enforcement and signaling the deepest change to the city’s way of life since the handover. 
The planned law has alarmed foreign governments as well as democracy activists in Hong Kong, who were already concerned that Beijing was tightening its grip over the semi-autonomous city.

Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong have sought to reassure investors that the law will not erode the city's high degree autonomy, insisting it will target only a minority of ""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security.

READING, England (Reuters) - Three people were killed and another three seriously injured when a man went on a stabbing spree in a park in the southern English town of Reading on Saturday, though police said they were not currently treating the incident as terrorism.
Witnesses said a man went on the rampage at around 1800 GMT in Forbury Gardens, stabbing people at random who had gathered in the park on a sunny summer evening in Reading, which is about 40 miles (65 km) west of London.
A 25-year-old man from Reading was arrested on suspicion of murder, police said, adding that they were not searching for any more suspects. 
""There is no intelligence to suggest that there is any further danger to the public, however we urge people to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious by calling police,"" Detective Chief Superintendent Ian Hunter said.
""This is not currently being treated as a terrorism incident, however officers are keeping an open mind as to the motivation for the incident and are being supported by colleagues from Counter Terrorism Policing South East."" 
A witness who spoke to the BBC, Lawrence Wort, said the attack began when a man suddenly veered toward a group of about eight to 10 friends and began stabbing them, ""so the first three he got so completely out of the blue, he got very badly"".
Wort said the assailant locked eyes with him and the person he was with and started coming toward them, but they ran to safety, at which point the man turned back to attack another group. When everyone started running from the scene, the attacker ran from the park, Wort said.
""My thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading and my thanks to the emergency services on the scene,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.
'DEEPLY SHOCKING'
Video footage posted on Twitter showed paramedics rushing to help at least three people who were bleeding on the ground. Reuters was unable to verify the footage independently.
Matt Rodda, a lawmaker who represents Reading in Britain's parliament, said the park, located in an historic area of the town, was typically busy on a Saturday evening.
""It's used by people to sit and meet with friends and obviously at the moment people have been meeting there, observing social distancing, and just chatting to friends peacefully in a park,"" Rodda told Sky News. 
""This incident happened in that kind of environment so it's really quite deeply shocking for local people."" 
Current coronavirus restrictions mean venues like pubs are closed, so many people in Britain gather in parks in the evenings to meet friends. 
The head of the local council authority in Reading, Jason Brock, said his thoughts were ""with the families of all those who have died or have been injured."" 
The attack in Reading took place at the site of a Black Lives Matter anti-racism protest in the town earlier on Saturday but police said it was not connected.
""There have been some reports that this incident was linked to the Black Lives Matter protest which took place in Reading earlier this afternoon,"" Hunter said. ""I can confirm that this incident is not connected. It occurred around three hours after the protest had concluded.""
Some 36 people were killed in four attacks in Britain blamed by authorities on terrorism in 2017, the most deadly of which occurred at the end of a concert by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in Manchester, northern England, with other attacks at London Bridge and near parliament. 

Last year the government downgraded the national terrorism threat level to ""substantial,"" meaning an attack is likely, from ""severe"".

Tension has been rising after North Korea blew up a joint liaison office and threatened military action over defectors in the South sending anti-North leaflets across the border. 
As state media reported angry North Koreans gearing up for their own ""large-scale"" leaflet campaign, Seoul's Unification Ministry handling cross-border affairs on Saturday urged the plan to be scrapped citing a violation of peace agreements. 
The United Front Department of the North's ruling party, in charge of inter-Korean affairs, rejected the ministry's calls as an ""absurd nonsense."" 
""Given their own wrongdoings, how dare they utter such words as regret and violation?"" the department's spokesman said in a statement carried by state media KCNA. 
""When they are put in our shoes, the South Korean authorities will be able to understand even a bit how disgustedly we looked at them and how offending it was for us."" 
The two Koreas, which are still technically at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty, have waged leaflet campaigns for decades but agreed to cease ""all hostile acts"" in a 2018 peace accord. 
Several defector-led groups have regularly sent back flyers, together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news, usually by balloon over the border or in bottles in rivers.
One of the groups dropped a plan to float hundreds of plastic bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and face masks into the sea near the border on Sunday.

Pyongyang has also used balloons and drones to fly its anti-South leaflets, which in South Korea in the past have been rewarded with stationery if reported to police.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Around a hundred Poles took part in an ""Equality Run"" on Saturday, condemning discrimination against the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community during a presidential election campaign where gay rights have provoked fierce debate.
The run took place as a number of anti-government protests from groups including LGBT rights protestors and feminists took place in Warsaw.
Facing an increasingly tight contest for the June 28 vote, incumbent President Andrzej Duda, an ally of ruling nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), has attempted to rally his conservative base by taking aim at what he calls LGBT ""ideology"". 
PiS has said this is a foreign influence undermining traditional values.
""We need to show that we are everywhere, that we exist, we do sport, we have fun, it's not like we are people with a foreign ideology,"" said 26-year-old office worker Zoska Marcinek before the race.
The runners, some decked out in the rainbow flag of the LGBT community, ran 5 kilometres along the banks of the Vistula river.
Duda has drawn criticism for comparing the push for LGBT rights to Soviet indoctrination. A member of his campaign team said in a television broadcast last Saturday that LGBT people were not equal with ""normal"" people.
Duda has said his words on LGBT ""ideology"" and communism were taken out of context, while his campaign team has rejected accusations of homophobia.
Around 200-300 people gathered at a separate protest called ""People, not an Ideology"" in central Warsaw, brandishing placards with slogans like ""Make Peace, Stop PiS"".
""I am a normal person... like every other person, and I demand equality,"" said 22-year-old student Weronika Tomikowska during the protest.

LGBT rights have been major campaign theme in staunchly Catholic Poland since the main opposition candidate and Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski introduced a sex education programme in city schools over a year ago that includes teaching about LGBT issues.

The move will allow people to remain a metre away from others if they take additional measures to protect themselves, such as wearing a mask, according to the report.

(Reuters) - A 29-year-old woman has been identified as a suspect in setting fire to the Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) restaurant in Atlanta where police shot and killed Rayshard Brooks a week ago, the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department said on Saturday.
Investigators have issued an arrest warrant for Natalie White on suspicion of arson in the first degree, the fire department said in a statement.
She is suspected of involvement in the torching of the restaurant on June 13 as protests erupted after Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer.
Brooks repeatedly referred to a ""Natalie White"" as his girlfriend the night he was killed, according to video footage from the body camera of one of the officers at the scene. 
A representative for the Atlanta Fire Rescue Department declined to comment on whether officials were investigating a relationship between Brooks and the suspected arsonist, saying in an email, ""We are not releasing any additional information at this time."" 
The investigation is ongoing and officials are seeking information on White's whereabouts and any other details about the incident, the fire department's statement said. 
The Wendy's parking lot was the scene of Brooks' death on June 12 when police responded to a 911 call that he had fallen asleep in his car in the drive-through lane.
Caught on video, the encounter seemed friendly at first but when an officer moved to arrest him, Brooks struggled with him and another officer before breaking away across the parking lot with what appeared to be a police Taser in his hand.
A video from the restaurant's cameras showed Brooks turning as he ran and possibly aiming the Taser at the pursuing officers before one of them fired his gun and Brooks fell. 

The officer who shot Brooks, Garrett Rolfe, was charged this week with felony murder and 10 other counts. The second officer, Devin Brosnan, was charged with lesser counts including aggravated assault and violation of his oath.

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday said his country has a legitimate right to intervene in neighbouring Libya and ordered his army to be ready to carry out any mission outside the country, if necessary.
Sisi's comments came amid high tensions over regional rival Turkey's intervention in Libya. He also warned forces loyal to the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli not to cross the current frontline with Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
Turkey's support for the GNA has reversed a 14-month assault on Tripoli by forces loyal to Haftar, which are backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
""Any direct intervention from the Egyptian state has now acquired international legitimacy,"" Sisi told an audience after inspecting military units at an air base near the border with Libya.
He said Egypt has the right to defend itself after receiving ""direct threats"" from ""terrorist militias and mercenaries"" supported by foreign countries, in an apparent reference to some armed groups loyal to the GNA and supported by Turkey.
The main aims of any intervention would include protecting Egypt's 1,200-km (746-mile) western border, helping achieve a ceasefire, and restoring stability and peace in Libya, he said. 
Before his speech, Sisi addressed several air force pilots and special forces personnel at the base, telling them: ""Be prepared to carry out any mission, here inside our borders - or if necessary, outside our borders.""
The UAE and Saudi Arabia expressed support for Egypt's desire to protect its security and borders. There was no immediate reaction from Turkey or the GNA.
Earlier this month, Egypt called for a ceasefire in Libya as part of an initiative which also proposed an elected leadership council for the country. 
While the United States, Russia and the UAE welcomed the plan, Turkey dismissed it as an attempt to save Haftar following his battlefield losses.
On Saturday Sisi said that Egypt has always been reluctant to intervene in Libya and wants a political solution to its conflict, but added that ""the situation now is different"".
""If some people think that they can cross the Sirte-Jufra frontline, this is a red line for us,"" he said before an audience that included some Libyan tribal leaders.
Sisi called on the two warring parties to respect the frontline and return to talks.

He also said Egypt could provide Libyan tribes with training and arms to fight the ""terrorist militias"".

The Seattle Police Department said it was investigating a shooting at 10th Avenue and East Pine inside the Capital Hill Organized Protest (CHOP) area, which has been occupied by activists without any known police presence since June 8, when Seattle police abandoned the East Precinct located there.
The police said they responded to a report of shots fired in Cal Anderson Park at about 2:30 a.m. PDT (0930 GMT) only to learn that two male victims had already been moved to Harborview Medical Center by CHOP medics.
Harborview spokeswoman Susan Gregg confirmed the hospital received two shooting victims from Capital Hill in the early hours and that one, a 19-year-old, died shortly after arrival while the other was in critical condition in intensive care. 
The police said that the suspect or suspects, for which they had no description, had fled and were still at large.
The occupation of the district came as widespread protests against police abuse and injustice took place across the United States after George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died while he was in Minneapolis police custody. A bystander recorded video of the officer who was charged with murder holding a knee on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.
Video footage after the Seattle shooting from Omari Salisbury, a reporter for Converge Media, showed a small group of police entering part of the protest zone on foot, holding riot shields and firearms, as occupants raised their hands and shouted at officers to drop their guns.
The footage, seen by Reuters, also showed people surrounding multiple police cars, which then left the area.

In a statement, the police called the protesters a ""violent crowd that prevented officers safe access to the victims.""

174,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Spain to allow Britons to visit from Sunday without quarantine,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain said on Saturday it would allow in British tourists from Sunday without requiring them to spend two weeks in quarantine, opening up to one of its largest tourism markets after the hit from the coronavirus pandemic.
But as much as Spain wants to welcome British tourists, the UK's current quarantine measures, requiring a two-week period of self-isolation for most people entering the country from abroad, may well put off some potential travellers. 
Britain is due to review its 14-day quarantine rule on June 29, three weeks after it was introduced.
""We will allow British visitors to enter Spain just like the rest of the European Union or Schengen area from 21 June freely and without the need for the quarantine,"" foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya told BBC News.
Spain will end its coronavirus state of emergency, imposed on March 14, on Sunday, and will open its borders to EU and Schengen area countries for a much needed boost to its tourism industry. 
Gonzalez Laya said British travellers would be subject to the same ""triple check"" as other European visitors, which consists of checking their origin, taking their temperature and taking contact details in case they need to be traced. 
""We want to make sure we welcome visitors but do so in safety and security for them as well as for Spaniards,"" she said. 
Spain is still in discussions over whether the UK will similarly lift quarantine measures for Spaniards, she said. But it was opening its borders ""out of respect for the 400,000 British citizens who have second residences in Spain"" and who are ""dying to benefit"" from them. 
A British government spokesman said its position on quarantines for people entering the country remained unchanged.
""International travel corridors remain an option under consideration by the UK government, not established policy,"" the spokesman said. ""Conversations take place regularly with governments around the world on a whole range of issues and we will not be providing any further details at this stage.""
Britons account for more than a fifth of the roughly 80 million tourists Spain receives every year.
Britain, which has reported more than 42,500 deaths from coronavirus, and Spain, with over 28,300, are among the countries hardest hit by COVID-19.
Spain will open its border with Portugal on July 1. 
Earlier on Saturday, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, in his final weekly televised address before the end of the state of emergency, warned Spaniards not to drop their guard because the virus could return.
“Each of us can be a wall in front of the virus or a route of contagion, it depends on each of us,” he said.
Spain, which implemented one of Europe's strictest lockdowns that saw people confined to their homes for nearly two months apart from for trips for food, medicines and essential jobs, has been easing restrictions in recent weeks.

Bedie's candidacy is the latest twist in a turbulent build-up to a vote that is wide open after current President Alassane Ouattara said he would not run again after ten years in power. 
""I am both surprised and happy with the content of your messages asking me to be a candidate in the election,"" Bedie told members of his PDCI-RDA coalition. ""I feel honoured.""
Bedie, 86, was president from 1993-1996. The coalition between his PDCI party and that of Ouattara's RDR, forged in 2005, was meant to dominate for generations and help heal the political rifts that led to civil war three years earlier.
The pact propelled Ouattara to presidential election victories in 2010 and 2015 but collapsed in September 2018 when the parties bickered over whose candidate should be in pole position in 2020. 
The race will be hard to call, say political analysts. Guillaume Soro, the former rebel leader and presidential candidate, was convicted in absentia of embezzlement and sentenced to 20 years in prison in April, a verdict likely to exclude him from the election.
Ouattara said last year that he would run for a third term if his predecessors Bedie and Laurent Gbagbo decided to run, raising concerns of a constitutional crisis given that Ivory Coast has a two-term mandate limit. 

He backed down in March saying he wanted to hand over power to a new generation.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Georgia's capital Tbilisi on Saturday to protest against the government and Russia one year after the brutal dispersal of an anti-Kremlin demonstration.
The protest was the first major gathering in the country since the coronavirus pandemic and organisers placed markers with the face of Russian President Vladimir Putin on the ground to encourage social distancing.
Most participants wore protective masks and organisers distributed sanitizers.
The protest movement erupted last June when a visiting Russian lawmaker was allowed to address the Georgian parliament from the speaker's chair, in Russian, touching a nerve in a country that fought a war with Russia 12 years ago.
The rally outside parliament a year ago descended into violent clashes with police who used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters. More than 240 people were injured, including more than 30 journalists and 80 policemen. Two protesters, including 18-year-old Mako Gomuri, lost eyesight.
""Those who shot me last year are still not punished and today I have even more questions than one year ago,"" said Gomuri, addressing the rally.
Protesters blew horns and held up placards reading ""Together against the occupation!"", referring to Russia's occupation of Georgia's two breakaway regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
At the end of the protest demonstrators waved posters reading ""We will meet at the election"", referring to a parliamentary vote later this year.

LONDON (Reuters) - A leader of Black Lives Matter protests in London demanded a meeting with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Saturday and called on him to replace a political adviser chosen to lead a new commission on racial inequality.
""I have been here every day, I am the person that leads 20,000 people every protest,"" Imarn Ayton, a 29-year-old actress, told Reuters as BLM demonstrators gathered in Hyde Park before their latest march.
""Everyone else seems to be in contact with me, except for Boris, so I would like a conversation.""
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated in British cities, as they have in the United States and around the world, since the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis last month.
Around 2,000 people took part in Saturday's protest in London, a Reuters reporter estimated. Marchers danced and chanted to the beat of drummers as they made their way to Trafalgar Square via parliament.
Demonstrators marched in other British cities including Glasgow where police contained and dispersed a crowd believed to include soccer supporters who posed a risk of causing trouble. 
Ayton said BLM demonstrators would continue to protest until the government met their demands. 
""It's that simple. We protest or you listen,"" she said. ""We want equality - to be treated fairly - that is all that we ask for, and for justice for those who have been harmed.""
Ayton said Johnson's choice as chair of the government's new commission on inequality, Munira Mirza, a Downing Street adviser, did not represent the BLM movement and did not believe that Britain had a problem with institutional racism.
""Munira Mirza must go. She is someone who does not believe in institutional racism, which is exactly why we marched the last two weeks - to abolish institutional racism,"" she said.
Johnson should act immediately on the recommendations of previous inquiries in Britain into racial inequality, Ayton said, adding that the prime minister had at least heard the voice of the protesters.
""I will never know what's in his heart. What I do know is he has responded. So what I want to do is keep that conversation going,"" she said.
Johnson's Downing Street office did not comment on Ayton's demands. 

There were violent clashes in London last weekend after protests by anti-racism supporters and a group made up of military veterans, soccer fans and far-right supporters who said they wanted to protect statues of historical figures from vandalism.

Nasser Aghaei, director of the state-run Iran Airports and Air Navigation Company, said the discounts would go to the top eight airlines providing transit income as well as airlines boosting their flights by 20%.
However, no general cut in fees are planned, IRNA said. Iran is one of many countries to charge so-called overflight fees, which are generally used to fund services such as air traffic control, weather data and aeronautical information.
The planned discounts still have to be approved by the government, Aghaei said.
Before the pandemic, major airlines in January rerouted or cancelled flights to avoid airspace over Iraq and Iran following an Iranian missile strike on U.S.-led forces in Iraq. 
On Jan 8, all 176 people aboard a Ukrainian airliner flight were killed when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff en route from Tehran to Kiev.
Iran acknowledged shooting the plane down but said it had done so by mistake while under high alert, hours after it had fired at U.S. targets in retaliation for a U.S. strike that killed an Iranian general.
In June, some global airlines re-routed flights to avoid Iran-controlled airspace over parts of the Gulf, after the U.S. aviation regulator barred its carriers from the area following the downing of a U.S. drone by Iran.

The talks were halted once again on Wednesday, this time only about a fortnight before the expected start-up of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which is being built near Ethiopia's border with Sudan and is the centrepiece in its bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter.
Cairo said on Friday it had called on the United Nations Security Council to intervene to restart the talks.
""When we moved to the Security Council... that was (because) we are always keen to take the diplomatic and political path until its end,"" Sisi said in a speech at an air force base.
""We need to move strongly towards concluding the negotiations and reach an agreement... and solutions that achieve the interest of all,"" he said.
Egypt, which is almost entirely dependent on the Nile for its fresh water supplies, is anxious to secure a legally binding deal that would guarantee minimum flows and a mechanism for resolving disputes before the dam starts operating.
The latest talks, which had started on June 9 over video conference, followed a previous round of negotiations in Washington, which ended without agreement in February.
On Saturday, Sisi recalled that in a speech he gave to the Ethiopian parliament five years ago he said that while Egypt respects Ethiopians' need for development they also should respect its needs for ""life"".

Earlier on Saturday, Sisi ordered his army to be ready to carry out any mission inside or outside the country amid tensions over regional rival Turkey's intervention in neighbouring Libya.

Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Friday for the second time in a month to demand President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita step down. 
Keita, who was re-elected in 2018 for a second five-year term, has struggled with an ongoing security crisis, a strike by teachers and the coronavirus outbreak. 
Political tensions increased after disputed local elections in March in which turnout was low due in part to fears of attacks by jihadist groups who roam the desert north. 
The lead-up to the poll was marred by allegations of vote buying and intimidation and the kidnapping of opposition leader Soumaila Cisse.
ECOWAS ""invites the Government of the Republic of Mali to reconsider the results of all the districts which have been subject to review,"" the group said in a statement after a two-day mission to the country. ""New elections for the constituencies concerned should be organized as soon as possible.""

""The Secretary-General calls on all political leaders to send clear messages to their supporters to exercise utmost restraint and to refrain from any action likely to fuel tensions,"" said Farhan Haq, a deputy spokesman for Guterres. 
Mali, which produces gold and cotton, has struggled to establish stability since 2012 when jihadist fighters hijacked an insurrection by Tuareg separatists, seizing the north.

""You were one of the supporting pillars of the entire country,"" he told doctors and nurses from the Lombardy region gathered in the Vatican's frescoed Clementine Hall, which had not been used for months because of the crisis.
""To those of you here and to your colleagues all across Italy go my esteem and my sincere thanks, and I know very well I am interpreting everyone's sentiments,"" he said.
He thanked the health workers, who wore masks, for being ""angels,"" including by lending their cell phones to dying patients so they could say their final goodbyes to their loved ones.
Italy returned to relative normality on June 3 when Italians were allowed to move between regions again. But rules such as social distancing in public and wearing masks are still in effect.
Nearly 35,000 people in Italy have died of coronavirus, the fourth highest number in the world after the United States, Brazil and Britain.
Nearly 170 of them were doctors and the pope paid special tribute to them in his address on Saturday.
At the end the meeting, the pope joked about what he called ""the liturgy of the greeting"" explaining that they would take a group picture but he would ""be obedient to the rules"" and greet them from a distance as he passed down the aisle.
Francis' weekly general audience is still being held without the public and streamed over the internet, although he has resumed giving his Sunday message from his window since St. Peter's Square was reopened last month.

He has resumed public Masses but with only about 50 people allowed.

183,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 20, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>","India, China accuse each other of violating de facto border","NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - India and China on Saturday traded accusations that the other had violated their shared de facto border, an area that this week became the site of their deadliest clash in half a century.
Fighting on the two countries' Himalayan frontier on Monday killed at least 20 Indian soldiers and injured more than 70. China has not released any casualty figures for its troops. 
While Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to downplay the clash on Friday, his government a day later blamed China for seeking to erect structures ""just across the Line of Actual Control"", as the demarcation is known, and refusing India's request to stop.
India will not allow any unilateral changes to the disputed border, it said in a statement. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused Indian troops of a ""deliberate provocation"" in the tense Himalayan area.
In a series of tweets, Zhao said the Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the line and that Indians had since April unilaterally built roads, bridges and other facilities in the region.
The Indian troops ""crossed the Line of Actual Control"" and attacked Chinese officers and soldiers who were there for negotiation, triggering ""fierce physical conflicts"", Zhao said.
India's foreign ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava denied any violation of the Line of Actual Control by India, and said the claims by the Chinese side were ""not acceptable"".
""We do not accept the contention that India was unilaterally changing the status quo. On the contrary, we were maintaining it,"" Srivastava said. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticised China for escalating border tensions with India. 
""The PLA (China's People's Liberation Army) has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India... and we watch as it militarizes the South China Sea and illegally claims more territory there,"" Pompeo said in at the virtual Copenhagen Democracy Summit.
Troops remain locked in a face-off at several locations along the poorly defined Line of Actual Control, despite talks between local commanders to de-escalate.

Modi on Friday appeared to downplay the clash with Chinese troops, saying: ""Nobody has intruded into our border, neither is anybody there now, nor have our posts been captured.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The Democratic Republic of Congo's high court on Saturday found the president's chief of staff guilty of embezzling $48 million in public funds and sentenced him to 20 years in jail, the lead judge said. 
Vital Kamerhe, once a future presidential hopeful, is the most senior politician convicted of graft in Congo, where high-level corruption is endemic. He now faces 20 years of hard labour. 
""The court has established as fact the offence of embezzlement of public funds relating to the amount of $48,831,148,"" said presiding judge Pierrot Bankenge Mvita wearing a mask and rubber gloves. 
Kamerhe denies stealing money earmarked for social housing under President Felix Tshisekedi’s flagship 100-day building programme, and has dismissed the accusations as political. His lawyer, Jean Marie Kabengela Ilunga, called the verdict a ""violation of human rights"" and said he would appeal. 
Kamerhe, a veteran power broker, appeared at the three-hour outdoor court hearing in a blue and yellow prison jacket and also wore a mask to protect against the new coronavirus.
He backed Tshisekedi in his successful 2018 election campaign in return for Tshisekedi’s support the next time around in 2023. Under the ruling, Kamerhe will not be able to run for president for ten years after his punishment. 
His arrest on April 8 sent shock waves through the nation. 
Last week the justice minister revealed that the former presiding judge, who was originally said to have died of a heart attack last month, was actually brutally murdered. 
Transparency groups and the international community had been pressurising Tshisekedi to fulfil his campaign promise of clamping down on corruption, political analysts say.
""I sincerely think that this is a positive sign for the fight against corruption,"" said Florimond Muteba from the Observatory of Public Expenditure, a Congolese transparency group.

The curfew will be lifted as of 6 AM local time on Sunday. Restrictions will remain, however, for religious pilgrimages, international travel and social gatherings of more than 50 people.
The kingdom introduced stringent measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in March, including 24-hour curfews on most towns and cities.
In May, it announced a three-phase plan to ease restrictions on movement and travel, culminating in the curfew completely ending on June 21. 
The number of coronavirus infections has risen in recent weeks following a relaxation of movement and travel restrictions on May 28. 
The kingdom has recorded 154,223 cases of COVID-19 and a total of 1,230 deaths, the highest in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council.
Saudi Arabia plans to limit numbers at the annual haj pilgrimage to prevent a further outbreak of coronavirus cases, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this month.

Some 2.5 million pilgrims visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long haj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it. Saudi Arabia asked Muslims in March to put haj plans on hold and suspended the umrah pilgrimage until further notice.

BEIJING/HONG KONG (Reuters) - China will have overarching powers over the enforcement of a new national security law in Hong Kong, according to details released on Saturday that signalled the deepest change to the city's way of life since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
The planned law has alarmed foreign governments as well as democracy activists in Hong Kong, who were already concerned that Beijing is eroding the high degree of autonomy granted to the territory when it was handed over from British rule.
According to details released by the official Xinhua news agency, Hong Kong will establish a committee to safeguard the legislation, headed by the city's leader Carrie Lam and supervised by the central government.
New police and prosecution units will be set up to investigate and enforce the law.
Lam will also have the power to appoint judges to hear cases related to national security, an unprecedented move likely to unnerve some investors, diplomats and business leaders in Hong Kong
Currently senior judges allocate judicial rosters up through Hong Kong's independent judicial system.
""From these initial details, this new law presents unprecedented legal questions that we will have to confront in coming years,"" Simon Young, a barrister and professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school, told Reuters.
Young said he was troubled by the apparent ""broad supremacy"" of the new law over current and future Hong Kong laws.
Officials in Beijing and Hong Kong have sought to reassure investors that the law will not erode the city's autonomy, insisting it will target only a minority of ""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security.
Xinhua said human rights and freedom of speech and assembly would be protected, echoing previous comments by authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong.
The details were unveiled after a three-day meeting of the top decision-making body of China's parliament. It is unclear when the law will be enacted but political analysts expect it to take effect ahead of Legislative Council elections in Hong Kong on Sept. 6.
China, which sees a growing national security threat from Hong Kong, says the draft law is aimed at tackling separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces.
Critics fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms that are seen as critical to Hong Kong's status as a global financial centre.
ALLEGIANCE
Under the details released on Saturday, any Hong Kong residents running for election or working for the government will have to swear allegiance to the city and its mini-constitution, the Basic Law.
China's move to impose the law directly on Hong Kong, bypassing the city's legislature, comes after a year of sometimes violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests. Mainland and local authorities have blamed ""foreign forces"" for fomenting the unrest.
Some political commentators say the law is aimed at sealing Hong Kong's ""second return"" to the motherland after the handover from Britain failed to bring residents to heel.
At the time of the handover, China promised to allow Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy for 50 years under what is known as the ""one country two systems"" formula of governance.
Beijing proposed the new legislation last month, drawing rebukes from Britain, the United States and other countries.

China has repeatedly told foreign governments not to interfere in its internal affairs.

""Mainly for crowded and covered areas...we may make (masks) compulsory in a week, more or less. But first plenty of inexpensive masks should be made available for the people,"" Rouhani said in remarks broadcast by state television.

He went to the Atmeh camp for displaced people on the Syrian-Turkish border, where families have been sheltering since 2011 from a conflict that has made half of Syrians homeless.
He illustrated each of the war's nine years with a simple picture: a refugee child born in that year. Each poses in a tent, each alone, apart from eight-year-old Jumana and her twin brother Farhan.
""Every kid represents a year in the uprising. Every kid narrates a story and they each have their unique story of the war,"" Ashawi explained. ""These kids don't know the meaning of a home, some don't know or have forgotten that a house has a wall and a door.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's oldest zoo reopened on Saturday, but to a fraction of the normal number of visitors, after being forced to close more than three months ago because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The 156-year-old Ragunan Zoo, located in the capital Jakarta, is home to more than 2,200 animals, including many of the country's endangered species.
The zoo introduced precautionary measures to reopen, including a 1,000 a day limit on visitor numbers, markers to ensure social distancing, and health protocols.
""We are requiring people to use masks and not allowing pregnant women, children nine and under, or the elderly to visit,"" zoo spoksperson I Ketut Widarsana told Reuters. 
Visitors said they were excited about the reopening and had been worried about the zoo's survival. 
""During COVID-19, the zoo had no income from visitors, so I wanted to come support it,"" Kusmana, who uses one name, told Reuters.
Others, such as Jakarta resident Budi Henry, said he and his wife felt safer in the open air zoo than at indoor attractions and malls.
The zoo is owned by the local government and Widarsana said the animals had remained in good health and been closely cared for during the closure.
Some of Indonesia's smaller zoos have struggled to feed their animals during the pandemic. The Indonesian Zoo Association said in April that the majority of the country's zoos could not afford animal feed. 
Indonesia reported 1,226 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, with 180 cases in the capital, bringing the country's total number of cases to 45,029.

Taiwan said on Thursday it will set up a dedicated office to help those thinking of leaving Hong Kong as Beijing tightens its grip on the former British colony, including planned new national security legislation.
The new office begins operations on the sensitive date of July 1, the day Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule from Britain in 1997 with the promise of continued, wide-ranging freedoms under China's ""one country, two systems"" formula.
In a statement late on Friday, China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said the plan by the ""Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party authority"" - China's standard way of referring to Taiwan's government - was a political plot to meddle in Hong Kong affairs and sabotage its stability and prosperity.
""Providing shelter for and taking onto the island the rioters and elements who bring chaos to Hong Kong will only continue bring harm to Taiwan's people,"" it said.
The plots of forces that advocate independence for Hong Kong and Taiwan and also seek to damage ""one country, two systems"" and split the nation will never succeed, the office said.
Months of anti-government, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong won widespread sympathy in democratic and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, which has welcomed those who have already moved to the island and expects more to come.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen last month became the first government leader anywhere to pledge measures to help Hong Kong people who leave due to what they see as tightening Chinese controls, smothering their democratic aspirations.

China denies stifling Hong Kong's freedoms and says the national security legislation is needed to return order to the global financial hub.

ADEN/SANAA (Reuters) - Despite six years of war and hardship in Yemen, Somali refugee Bader Hassan had stuck it out hoping for a better life than in his homeland. 
But the coronavirus pandemic has pushed his precarious existence to the edge, and now he wants out. 
""Me, my wife and my son want to live in a good place, like other people,"" the Somali-born 32-year-old said in the capital Sanaa. 
As a refugee he has lived his life in Yemen with no state or charity support, he said. He dropped out of school early to earn a living and now washes cars in the street. 
""But how do we live now when corona is also shutting off car washing?"" he said.
Divided between Houthi authorities in the north and the Yemeni government in the south, Yemen today is a land of displacement with 80% of the population reliant on humanitarian aid. 
One in every eight Yemenis has been internally displaced by the six-year conflict and 280,000 foreign refugees also live there. Yemen hosts the second-largest Somali refugee population. 
After Houthi authorities in May announced their first coronavirus case in a Somali national found dead in a Sanaa hotel, African migrants and refugees have been increasingly stigmatized, the United Nations and migrants said. 
""They ask 'what's your nationality: Yemen, Somalia?' I say Somali and they say 'sorry, goodbye',"" Hassan said of potential customers.
Tensions between host and refugee and migrant communities over Yemen's scarce resources have historically been low, but the relationship is coming under strain as Yemen's woes deepen, the U.N. refugee agency's (UNHCR) Jean-Nicolas Beuze said from Sanaa.
Alongside refugees, around 100,000 migrants also arrive each year by sea from the Horn of Africa hoping to trek north into wealthy Saudi Arabia and beyond.
Largely Ethiopian, they suffer the same traffickers, abuse, rape and theft as refugees, often living side-by-side in squatter camps in the main cities. 
""When [migrants and refugees] reach the UNHCR office or our partners they are often without anything, not even identity documents most of the time,"" said Beuze. 
As coronavirus concerns mount, U.N. migration agency IOM says migrants are being forcibly transferred out of urban areas to hard-to-access locations, including more than 1,300 forcibly moved north to south since late April. 
Ethiopian migrant Abdelaziz came by sea, but said his journey to Saudi was blocked by northern authorities. 
""There were 250 of us on the sea journey we paid 1,500 Saudi riyals ($400) for. Around five died,"" he said from the bare roadside garden where he and dozens of other African migrants sleep on cardboard. 
He desperately wants to leave. 

""We have nothing to eat and drink,"" he said. ""The people are tired of helping us.""

Enraged North Korean people across the country ""are actively pushing forward with the preparations for launching a large-scale distribution of leaflets,"" which are piled as high as a mountain, said state news agency KCNA.
""Every action should be met with proper reaction and only when one experiences it oneself, one can feel how offending it is,"" KCNA said.
North Korea has blamed North Korean defectors for launching leaflets across the border and threatened military action. On Tuesday, Pyongyang blew up an inter-Korean liaison office to show its displeasure against the defectors and South Korea for not stopping them launching leaflets.]
South Korea's unification ministry, which is responsible for inter-Korean dialogue, said on Saturday that North Korea's plan to send leaflets was ""extremely regrettable,"" and urged it to scrap the plan immediately.
A North Korean defector-led group said on Friday it had scrapped a plan to send hundreds of plastic bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and face masks to North Korea by throwing them into the sea near the border on Sunday.
The two Koreas, which are still technically at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty, have waged leaflet campaigns for decades.
South Korea's military used to launch anti-North flyers across the demilitarized zone, but the program ended in 2010.
Several defector-led groups have regularly sent back flyers, together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news, usually by balloon over the border or in bottles by river. 

Pyongyang has used balloons to send its anti-South leaflets. South Koreans previously were rewarded with stationery if they reported leaflets from the North.

CARACAS (Reuters) - A Venezuelan doctor known for treating the poor during the Spanish flu pandemic a century ago has been beatified, moving a step closer to sainthood, Venezuelan Cardinal Baltazar Porras said on Friday.
The announcement sparked celebrations outside the La Candelaria church in central Caracas, which holds the remains of Jose Gregorio Hernandez. They came despite Porras' call for the faithful to celebrate the news at home in the predominantly Roman Catholic country, to help avoid spreading the novel coronavirus. 
Hernandez, born in the Andean state of Trujillo in 1864, was known as the ""doctor of the poor"" for his care of the needy in Caracas during the Spanish flu pandemic just over a century ago. He died in 1919 after being struck by a car. 
In 2017, the Catholic church attributed a miracle to Hernandez for saving the life of a young girl, Yaxury Solorzano, who was shot in the head during a robbery attempt. 
Doctors said Solorzano would be disabled if they managed to save her life, but she recovered and was able to walk just weeks after leaving the hospital, according to church records. They state that Solorzano's mother had prayed to Hernandez for her salvation. 
Murals of the mustachioed doctor line the walls of La Pastora, the working-class neighborhood of Caracas where Hernandez died.
""In the middle the COVID-19 pandemic affecting the world, in the middle of this terrible crisis that our fatherland is living through, today we receive a balm from this person who unites us,"" Porras said in a news conference.
He said Pope Francis had ordered the beatification.
Venezuela is suffering a six-year economic collapse marked by hyperinflation and chronic shortages of basic goods. It ranks among the most crime-stricken countries in the world.
In the Catholic Church, beatification is a step toward sainthood. A second, distinct miracle must take place after the beatification in order to proceed to sainthood. 

""I pray to him for an exit to this coronavirus that has Venezuela worried, for peace, and that we all stay healthy,"" said Jose Gregorio Cairo, a 59-year-old La Pastora resident named after the newly-beatified doctor.

Protesters scattered in groups in neighbourhoods in the town of Hoorn, about 45 kilometres (30 miles) north of Amsterdam, as riot police moved in with vans, footage showed.
Police with shields and batons broke up crowds near a large statue of Jan Pieterszoon Coen, an officer in the Dutch East India Company who is seen by some as a hero of the country's Golden Age and by others as a brutal oppressor.
A group of around 20 supporters carried Dutch flags with the name ""Coen"" written on them. Around 250 protesters attended an earlier peaceful protest on the outskirts of town calling for Coen's statue to be taken down.
In 1621, Pieterszoon Coen led the Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands in current-day Indonesia, when thousands of inhabitants were killed with the help of Japanese mercenaries. Just 1,000 out of 15,000 local residents are believed to have survived and around 800 were deported to the Dutch-held Batavia.

The former head of France's financial prosecutors, Eliane Houlette, told lawmakers earlier this month that she had come under pressure over her handling of former prime minister Francois Fillon's case about the misuse of public funds.
Her remarks triggered concerns from conservatives that the legal system may have been biased against Fillon in the case and used for political ends.
""It is therefore essential to erase all doubt about the independence and impartially of the justice system in this case,"" Macron's office said in a statement announcing the review.
Fillon and his wife Penelope went on trial in February over the fake jobs scandal that wrecked his 2017 run for president and opened the Elysee Palace door for Macron.
Since her first remarks to lawmakers, Houlette has since said that Fillon was not put under investigation under pressure from the executive branch and that she had referred to the heavy-handed supervision by superiors in the high-profile case.
Once a front-runner in the election, Fillon's bid for the presidency fell apart after allegations he paid his wife hundreds of thousands of euros for doing little, if any, work as his parliamentary assistant.

Talks over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam were halted once again this week, this time only about a fortnight before its expected start-up.
""The Arab Republic of Egypt took this decision in light of the stalled negotiations that took place recently on the Renaissance Dam as a result of Ethiopian stances that are not positive,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday.
The latest round of talks, which had started on June 9 over video conference, followed a previous round of negotiations in Washington, which ended without agreement in February.
Egypt, which is almost entirely dependent on the Nile for its fresh water supplies, sees it as a potentially existential threat. It is anxious to secure a legally binding deal that would guarantee minimum flows and a mechanism for resolving disputes before the dam starts operating.
The dam is the centrepiece in Ethiopia's bid to become Africa’s biggest power exporter.

Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed on March 13 after the officers entered her apartment bearing a ""no-knock"" arrest warrant that targeted the wrong house. 
In a letter to Detective Brett Hankison posted on Twitter, Louisville Metro Police Department Chief Robert Schroeder said he intended to fire the officer for what he called ""extreme"" violations of standard operating procedures when Hankison used deadly force upon entering the apartment. 
""Your actions displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life when you wantonly and blindly fired ten (10) rounds into the apartment of Breonna Taylor,"" Schroeder wrote. ""I find your conduct a shock to the conscience.""
The River City Fraternal Order of Police, which represents LMPD officers, did not reply to a request for comment.
Hankison, who was hired by the department in 2003, had previously been disciplined in January 2019 for reckless conduct that injured an innocent person, Schroeder's letter said.
It said Hankison would have the opportunity, with counsel or a union representative, to provide ""additional information or mitigating factors"" before his termination was finalized.
Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Taylor's family, called the police chief's letter ""damning,"" and said on Twitter that he wanted to see the other officers fired and criminally charged.
Taylor's death, along with the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd and other police killings of Black people, has become a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and has sparked nationwide protests against racism and police brutality. 
Hours after the March 13 raid, Louisville police Lieutenant Ted Eiden told reporters the officers had knocked on the door before forcing entry and were shot at by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. One officer was struck in the leg and all three returned fire, hitting Taylor at least eight times, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.

Walker was charged with attempted murder and assault, but last month state prosecutors dropped the charges, the Courier-Journal reported.

Scenes of mayhem during the operation caused Lopez Obrador's government considerable embarrassment in October as security forces briefly captured Ovidio in Culiacan, capital of western Sinaloa state, only to let him go hours later as security forces were overwhelmed by cartel forces.
Likely tipped off ahead of the operation, hundreds of heavily armed gunmen from the Sinaloa Cartel had poured into the city of a million people during an hours-long siege, erecting flaming roadblocks and unloading bursts of gunfire in the streets in a coordinated effort to free the younger Guzman.
Lopez Obrador had previously said his security cabinet made the call to release Ovidio, a decision he said he endorsed to protect terrorized residents from the crossfire between cartel henchmen and security forces.
Friday was the first time the president openly acknowledged having given the order himself.
""So as not to put the population at risk ... I ordered that this operation be stopped and that this alleged criminal be released,"" Lopez Obrador said at a regular news conference.
Lopez Obrador added that a couple days later U.S. President Donald Trump offered to help crack down on the cartel, but Mexico did not accept it. 
The United States continues to seek Ovidio's extradition.
Despite Lopez Obrador's promises to tame spiraling violence with policies focused on relieving rampant poverty and youth unemployment, homicides in Mexico have climbed to record levels during the first four months of this year.
In 2019, the president's first full year in office, homicides hit an all-time high.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government's financial crime department has frozen the bank accounts of companies and people blacklisted by the United States under accusations of having evaded the sanction regime imposed on Venezuela, its chief said on Friday. 
Santiago Nieto, chief of Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, did not elaborate on details, but told Reuters that bank accounts of ""all those listed"" by the U.S Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control were frozen.
Washington on Thursday blacklisted Mexico-based Libre Abordo and related firm Schlager Business Group, accusing them of helping Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's administration evade sanctions, in the first formal action by the U.S. Treasury against Mexican firms involved in trading Venezuelan oil.
The United States also imposed sanctions on four firms linked to Mexicans Joaquin Leal Jimenez, Veronica Esparza and Olga Zepeda, which it accused of having cooperated with Libre Abordo, Schlager and businessman Alex Saab, arrested last week in Cape Verde, to evade sanctions.
""Saab and Leal, working with Mexico-based Libre Abordo and Schlager Business Group, brokered the re-sale of over 30 million barrels of crude oil on behalf of (Venezuela's state-run) PDVSA,"" the Treasury said on Thursday.
Nieto said the accounts of Zepeda were among those that were frozen. 
Leal, Esparza and Zepeda could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Libre Abordo told Reuters on Friday it was working on its legal defense before the United States and Mexico. ""We are convinced that this action will contribute to ratifying the legality of all our operations.""
Libre Abordo and Schlager began receiving Venezuelan oil for resale in Asian markets in 2019 after signing an oil-for-food pact with Maduro's government framed as a humanitarian provision. 
While the companies supplied about 500 water trucks to Venezuela, 210,000 tons of corn originally included in the pact were not delivered, Libre Abordo said, adding that very low oil prices modified a schedule agreed by the parties.
Libre Abordo announced bankruptcy in May after losing $90 million amid what it called ""excessive"" U.S. pressure. The trade with Venezuela got suspended.

207,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 04:05PM ET</span>",India's Modi says there was no border intrusion in deadly clash with China,"By Sanjeev Miglani and Devjyot Ghoshal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared to downplay a clash with Chinese troops in a disputed Himalayan region that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and more than 70 injured, saying on Friday there had been no intrusion across his country's borders.
""Nobody has intruded into our border, neither is anybody there now, nor have our posts been captured,"" Modi said, referring to Ladakh's Galwan valley, where hand-to-hand fighting between soldiers from the nuclear-armed neighbours took place earlier this week.
India and China are attempting to cool tensions after the deadliest clash in at least five decades, with military-level talks taking place in an attempt to deescalate the confrontation.
But Modi's comments, made in a televised statement at the end of an all-party meeting to discuss the incident, contrasted with his government's earlier stance.
On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar had told a senior Chinese diplomat that the dispute was triggered after ""the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC,"" according to a ministry statement.
The LAC refers to the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border that has been a constant source of friction in the region where India and China fought a brief war in 1962.
With his nation in shock over the loss its soldiers lives, Modi faces one of the most difficult foreign policy challenges since he came to power in 2014.
On Friday evening, some opposition parties questioned why the government was not better prepared. 
""Does the government not receive, on a regular basis, satellite pictures of the borders of our country? Did our external intelligence agencies not report any unusual activity along the LAC?"" said Sonia Gandhi, president of the opposition Congress party.
SOLDIERS RETURNED
Earlier on Friday, an Indian government source said that China had returned 10 Indian soldiers captured during the battle.
In a briefing in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian denied any Indian troops had been in its custody.
""As far as I know China hasn't seized any Indian personnel,"" Zhao said. 
The Indian army did not comment on the release, which according to the source took place on Thursday evening, instead referring to a government statement that said all of its soldiers were accounted for.
India has said the Chinese side also suffered casualties in the clash, but China has not disclosed any.
Military officials have since held talks, but there is no sign of a breakthrough.
""The situation remains as it was, there is no disengagement, but there is also no further build up of forces,"" said a second Indian government source, who is aware of the ground situation.
The official said at least 76 Indian troops were wounded during the clash, and had been hospitalised.
""No one is critical as of now,"" he said.
U.S. SYMPATHY
The United States offered condolences to India on Friday. 
""We extend our deepest condolences to the people of India for the lives lost as a result of the recent confrontation with China,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a message posted on Twitter.
""We will remember the soldiers' families, loved ones, and communities as they grieve.""
Having actively sought greater economic engagement with China, Modi is compelled to review the state of those ties, just at a time when Sino-U.S. relations have also deteriorated.
As a non-aligned nation, India has always sought to balance the influence of super-powers.

But in the past two decades, New Delhi has built closer political and defence ties with Washington, and the United States has become one of India's top arms suppliers.

MINSK (Reuters) - Police in Belarus arrested demonstrators and journalists on Friday evening to break up new protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, hours after he blamed foreign plotters for fomenting unrest.
For the second evening in a row, protesters had formed a long line through the centre of the capital Minsk in solidarity after the jailing of Viktor Babariko, Lukashenko's main rival in August's presidential election.
Protests also broke out in several other towns across the eastern European country. 
Lukashenko has ruled with an iron fist for 26 years, but faces his biggest challenge in years as frustration over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic has combined with grievances over the economy and human rights.
Relations with traditional ally Russia have been strained in recent months as Moscow reduced subsidies that have propped up Lukashenko. But his crackdown on opponents will likely hobble his efforts to mend fences with the West. 
The European Union called for the release of Babariko, widely seen as the most potent challenger to Lukashenko.
As criticism of Babariko's arrest grew, Lukashenko said his government had foiled a plot to foment a revolution akin to the street protests in Ukraine in 2014. 
He said political forces from ""both from the West and from the East"" had concentrated their interests in Belarus, and that ""certain forces"" had intensified their efforts. He did not give details or say which foreign country was involved. 
""That was the goal. The masks were torn not only from certain puppets we had here, but also from puppeteers who sit outside Belarus,"" he said.
Babariko was head Belgazprombank, of the local unit of Russia's Gazprombank, before running for president. A top security official said Babariko was controlled by Russian ""puppeteers"" and Lukashenko said the bank's money was being used to finance Babariko's campaign. Babariko's campaign team called the allegations against him ""an absurdity"".
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia had no plans to intervene. Separately President Vladimir Putin and Lukashenko spoke by phone but the Kremlin readout did not mention Babariko's arrest.
Lukashenko's allegations of a foreign plot came after authorities opened a criminal case against Belgazprombank. 

On Friday, Lukashenko said the International Monetary Fund was demanding Belarus impose lockdown measures as a condition for loans, but Minsk would not cave in to the demand.

EU governments have already expressed ""grave concern"" over China's security law for Hong Kong, which democracy activists, diplomats and some businesses say will jeopardise its semi-autonomous status and its role as a global financial hub. 
In a resolution, the European Parliament voted 565 in favour to 34 against, with 62 abstentions to protest the security law that Europe, Australia and the United States say would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle that governs Hong Kong's autonomy.
The European Parliament ""calls on the EU and its member states to consider, in the event the new security law is applied, filing a case before the International Court of Justice,"" the resolution said, referring to the highest United Nations legal body and based in The Hague.
The parliament's resolutions are non-binding but the political signals they provide can steer policy.
The resolution also called on the EU to consider possible economic sanctions on China.
The parliament ""believes that the EU should use its economic leverage to challenge China's crackdown on human rights by economic means,"" the resolution said.

The leaders of the EU institutions and Chinese Premier Li Keqiang are set to hold a summit by video on Monday.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario Premier Doug Ford said on Friday parents will have the option to keep their children at home to continue with remote learning under the three scenarios school boards have been asked to consider, as the province prepares to reopen classrooms for the 2020-21 school year.
Ontario's three scenarios are: a return to pre-pandemic education, with all students attending in person and strict cleaning guidelines in place; a modified routine allowing a maximum of 15 students per day into classrooms and adapting timetables to limit the movement of students throughout the day; or continue exclusively at-home learning.
The province said depending on the state of the coronavirus pandemic in September, each school district will follow the most appropriate option. Canada's most populous province closed its schools in mid-March to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus, along with most other provinces.
Earlier this week, Quebec said all schools will reopen in September, with social distancing measures in place.
Ontraio school boards will be asked to plan for each of the three scenarios, and be flexible to switch to any option on short notice.
Boards must be prepared to submit their plans to the government by early August, according to the province's guidelines.
""We need to empower the school boards to make decisions based on their local needs, their local challenges and their local priorities,"" Ford said. ""The fact is this virus remains a threat and the health and safety of our children will always remain top of mind.""

The government will consult with public health units in August to decide which scenario is appropriate.

PARIS (Reuters) - Britain, France and Germany said on Friday they would not back U.S. efforts to unilaterally trigger the reimposition of United Nations sanctions on Iran, but said they wanted talks with Tehran over its ongoing violations of a 2015 nuclear accord.
Under Iran's 2015 deal with world powers to accept limits to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions, a U.N. weapons embargo is due to expire in October. The United States, which exited the deal in 2018, says it wants to extend the embargo. 
If the U.N. Security Council does not extend the embargo, Washington has threatened to trigger a so-called snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, using a process outlined in the nuclear deal.
Such a move would be likely to kill the nuclear accord.
""We firmly believe that any unilateral attempt to trigger U.N. sanctions snapback would have serious adverse consequences in the U.N. Security Council,"" the foreign ministers of the three European countries (E3) said in a statement.
""We would not support such a decision, which would be incompatible with our current efforts to preserve the JCPoA (Iran nuclear deal),"" they said after discussing Iran in Berlin.
European diplomats are working on a compromise, but it is unclear whether they will able to satisfy the United States as well as Russia and China, which like the E3 remain in the deal.
""We believe that the planned lifting of the U.N. conventional arms embargo... would have major implications for regional security and stability,"" the E3 said, adding it was working in coordination with China and Russia on the issue. 
Speaking to reporters on Friday in a teleconference call, the U.S. special envoy to Iran, Brian Hook, declined to comment on a potential compromise.
""Nobody can argue that Iran's behaviour since 2015 merits a lifting of the arms embargo,"" he said.
The E3 ministers said they hoped to hold a ministerial meeting with Iran to discuss its violations of the nuclear deal and assess a mechanism they had launched in January aimed at resolving differences within its framework.

""We remain committed to the JCPoA and, in order to preserve it, urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the agreement and return to full compliance without delay,"" they said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council on Friday condemned discriminatory and violent policing after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month and ordered a report on ""systemic racism"" against people of African descent.
The 47-member-state forum unanimously adopted a resolution brought by African countries. The mandate also asks U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to examine government responses to peaceful protests, including alleged use of excessive force, and deliver findings in a year's time.
Philonise Floyd, the brother of the Black man whose death under the knee of a white officer roused world protests against racial injustice, urged the forum on Wednesday to investigate U.S. police brutality and racial discrimination.
Burkina Faso's Ambassador Dieudonné W. Désiré Sougouri presented the African resolution on Friday, urging its adoption by consensus.
""It is important to show Africa...the Human Rights Council has heard the plight of African and people of African descent calling for equal treatment and application of equal rights for all,"" he said.
The Africa group had made numerous ""concessions"" in the negotiations with other countries, he added.
Senegal's envoy Coly Seck, a former council president, welcomed the consensus, telling the talks: ""Black Lives Matter"".
The text was watered down during closed-door negotiations from an initial draft explicitly calling for a U.N. commission of inquiry on racism in the United States and elsewhere.
""It is absurd that the final resolution passed by the United Nations strips mention of the United States, where police kill people, particularly Black people, at alarmingly higher rates compared to other developed countries,"" said Jamil Dakwar of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which led 600 activist groups in calling for the urgent debate.
""The United Nations needs to do its job — not get bullied out of doing it — and hold the United States accountable,"" he said in a statement.
The Trump administration, which quit the forum two years ago alleging bias against its ally Israel, made no immediate comment. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Andrew Bremberg said on Wednesday that his country was ""not above scrutiny"" as it grappled with racial discrimination but was implementing police reforms after Floyd's killing.
During the debate, Western delegations including Australia, Germany, Italy, Poland and the European Union said that the United States should not be singled out.
""This problem does not belong to any one country, it is a problem around the world,"" said Australian ambassador Sally Mansfield.
Activists said that Australia had been particularly active in negotiations to take the spotlight off the United States.

Germany's ambassador Michael Ungern-Sternberg said: ""We are convinced a report with a broader approach and less focus on one specific case would have been more appropriate"".

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Tens of thousands protested in Bamako on Friday demanding the Malian president resign or face civil disorder despite political concessions offered in response to mounting frustration over the many crises afflicting the west African nation.
President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, re-elected in 2018 for a second five-year term, is struggling with a years-long security crisis in northern Mali, an outbreak of the new coronavirus, a strike by teachers, and political tensions arising from a disputed legislative election in March.
For the second time this month, crowds of protesters - including representatives of various political groups and human rights activists - filled Bamako's Independence Square, waiting for a response to a letter sent to the presidential palace demanding Keita, known as IBK, step down.
""We decide to maintain the mobilisation of all forces of the nation until the president resigns,"" opposition politician Cheick Oumar Sissoko said in a speech that called for civil disobedience and the occupation of strategic locations if there was no reply to the letter.
Protesters chanted: ""No to bad governance and corruption"" and ""It's too much. IBK, clear off!""
A delegation from regional bloc ECOWAS arrived in Bamako on the eve of the protest to encourage talks between the two sides - a sign of governments' concern about the political standoff on their doorstep.
After the first demonstration on June 5, Keita offered to make concessions including the creation of a unity government. But protesters were not satisfied.
""I'm here for the second time to tell IBK to step down. He can't govern this country as proved by his last seven years in power,"" said 26-year-old street trader Aboubacar Sidiki.
Mali, which produces gold and cotton, has struggled to find stability since 2012 when jihadist fighters hijacked an insurrection by Tuareg separatists, seizing the entire desert north of the country.
French troops helped to recapture the north but violence persists, despite the presence of thousands of United Nations troops, with groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State stoking intercommunal tensions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday the United States would in future treat Hong Kong as a Chinese city rather than an autonomous one to the extent that China treats the territory as a Chinese city.
Pompeo told the online Copenhagen Democracy Summit that elections due in Hong Kong in September would ""tell us everything that we need to know about the Chinese Communist Party's intentions with respect to freedom in Hong Kong.""
He also said Washington was working its way through a decision-making process over who would be held accountable over curbs to Hong Kong's freedoms.
Pompeo spoke two days after his first face-to-face meeting in months with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, at which the latter said Washington needed to respect Beijing's positions on key issues and halt its interference in matters such as Hong Kong, while working to repair relations.
U.S.-China relations have reached their lowest point in years since the coronavirus pandemic that began in China hit the United States hard.
Pompeo said his conversations with Yang had been ""very frank"" and Washington still did not have answers it wanted from China over the outbreak.
Among multiple points of friction are China's moves to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong, which have prompted Trump to initiate a process to eliminate special economic treatment that have allowed the territory to remain a global financial center.
""To the extent that the Chinese Communist Party treats Hong Kong as it does Shenzhen and Shanghai, we will treat them the same,"" Pompeo said.
""Any agreements that are unique between the United States and Hong Kong, separate and different to those we have with Beijing, we will move away from every one of those.""
Pompeo urged more European governments to speak out about China, saying the U.S. and its allies needed to ""take off the golden blinders of economic ties"" and see the risks of dealing with Beijing.
Pompeo's remarks came a day after Trump renewed his threat to cut economic ties with China, with which he has been waging a trade war aimed at rebalancing a massive U.S. deficit.

Pompeo tweeted on Thursday that Yang had ""recommitted to completing and honoring all of the obligations"" of a Phase 1 trade deal agreed this year. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, David Stilwell, said coming weeks would show if there had been progress in the talks.

The government this month eased some lockdown measures in regions with low infection rates, but kept in place a ban on people leaving their homes without permits in areas with more cases, including some big cities. 
The area around the cluster, some 150 km north of the capital, is covered by the permits but lockdowns are harder to enforce in rural and semi-rural areas. Most businesses are working again, but restaurants, cafes, cinemas and other enterprises in the vital services sector remain shut along with airports.

Lopez Obrador chastised National Council for Preventing Discrimination chief Monica Maccise because it organized a ""classism and racism in Mexico"" event on Wednesday and invited a comedian the president and his wife consider racist.
""I think that this event should not have been convened and those who do not share the transformation policy that is being carried out (by the government), in complete freedom can decide not to work for this government,"" Lopez Obrador said in his morning press conference on Friday.
The leftist president said he was also planning to fold the agency into the Interior Ministry. 
The death in the United States of African American George Floyd under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis has sparked a fresh debate about racism in Mexico, where the issue often goes hand-in-hand with classism.
Lopez Obrador on Wednesday questioned why an invitation to the event had been extended to comedian Chumel Torres, who became famous for his current affairs commentary on YouTube and has a television program on the U.S. channel HBO.
""They are people characterized by despising others, truly racists ... now it turns out that for a forum against discrimination you are invited,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""It's like inviting a torturer to a human rights forum.""
The president's wife Beatriz Gutierrez had previously taken offence to Torres making a joke about her son by calling him ""chocoflan"", referring to the dessert which is half black in colour and the other half a lighter hue.

The comedian apologised for his comments but after Maccise's resignation Torres said free speech in Mexico is under threat for those who disagree with Lopez Obrador.

Romanian police detained Mansouri earlier this month and a Bucharest court had been expected to rule next month on whether to extradite him. 
Bucharest police said a hotel had found one of its guests dead in the lobby after he appeared to have fallen from a higher floor. 
""It was established that the man was a 52-year-old foreign citizen under judicial control for crimes committed in another country,"" the police said in a statement, adding that an investigation into his death was underway.
Iran's Foreign Ministry confirmed Mansouri's death and said it was awaiting a report from Romania. Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told Iranian media Mansouri had gone to the Iranian embassy to discuss a potential return and was arrested by Romanian police because he was wanted in Tehran. 
Mansouri had been placed under a 30-day judicial control period and was being kept under surveillance. A July 10 deadline had been set for Tehran to file extradition documents.

Last week the Paris-based media freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) filed a complaint against Mansouri in Germany, where he was believed to have resided before travelling to Romania, accusing him of being responsible for the ""arrest and torture"" of at least 20 journalists in 2013.

An aspiring medic, in a community largely barred from accessing healthcare, can no longer search the web for remedies to help sick neighbours.
The government-ordered shutdown in two of Myanmar’s poorest states - Rakhine and neighbouring Chin - home to about a million people, is a year old on Sunday.
Justified on emergency grounds amid a growing insurgency, it is the longest internet blackout in the world, rights groups say.
Myanmar's bloodiest conflict in decades has spiralled despite the shutdown and more than a dozen residents told Reuters the blackout had made their lives worse
From traders losing business to villagers forced to make risky trips to send messages, they described an information freeze that has damaged the economy and left them in the dark about the conflict and the novel coronavirus.
""It's like we lost our sight,"" said Ray Than Naddy, 22, from Buthidaung, one of eight townships affected.
After the internet was switched off, she said, she had to close her online shop, losing income that paid for her brother's schooling.
Authorities say the shutdown will remain at least until Aug. 1 and will only be lifted when security improves.
Myo Swe, director-general at the Ministry of Transport and Communications, which ordered the blackout, said it was for security.
""The internet might encourage instability and destructive activities,"" Myo Swe told Reuters by telephone.
LIVES DISRUPTED 
Rakhine is the region from which hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled in 2017 after a military crackdown that the government said was ordered in response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
But since then, a new conflict has blown up between the army and rebels from the largely Buddhist Rakhine ethnic group, a majority in the state.
Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya remain confined to camps and villages, subjected to restrictions on movement and access to healthcare.
The aspiring medic, a Rohingya man in his twenties who declined to be identified, said he had been learning English on YouTube and giving people medical advice through videos, but was no longer able to.
""It would be very easy if I got the internet,"" he said.
Residents said it was harder to get information about fighting between the military and the Arakan Army insurgents, who seek greater autonomy for the state, and to determine if roads were safe.
The shutdown was imposed on military orders six months after fighting began, government spokesman Zaw Htay said.
But the fighting has not slowed. 
More people have been killed and injured this year than in 2019, according to the United Nations. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced and dozens killed.
Former U.N. human rights envoy Yanghee Lee said the shutdown could be used to conceal war crimes. Rights group Amnesty International says civilians feel isolated and have few options to report abuses.
The military denies abuses and accuses insurgents of using villagers as human shields - an accusation the insurgents say is not true. A military spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
OPPOSING THE SHUTDOWN
The government introduced telecoms reforms in 2014, allowing Norway’s Telenor Group and Ooredoo from Qatar to operate. The price of SIM cards quickly dropped from $200 to as little as $2, bringing millions of people online.
The International Crisis Group think-tank said the shutdown had affected digital payments, cash remittances and market information for farmers.
Few people use banks but more than 11 million people use a digital payments service called Wave Money, a joint venture between Telenor and Myanmar's Yoma.
Activists have urged mobile operators to challenge the law that justifies the blackout but both Telenor and Ooredoo have said they must obey it, though they have participated in discussions about building a coalition to propose amendments to the law.
Telenor Myanmar said in an April letter to activists seen by Reuters it believed if it disobeyed the law and lost its license, the impact would be even worse.
Cathrine Stang Lund, a company spokeswoman, said it had done an assessment that found the shutdown had an impact on rights principles, including access to information and freedom of speech.
""We have been in continuous dialogue with the authorities to end the shutdown, and look forward to be allowed to resume Internet services on Aug. 1,"" she said.
Ooredoo Myanmar did not respond to a request for comment.
Businesswoman Ray Than Naddy said it felt like people were being penalised for the insurgency.

""Please don't punish us civilians for what's going on,"" she said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization should change guidelines that led it to oppose travel restrictions early in the coronavirus epidemic, said former WHO chief Gro Harlem Brundtland, who now chairs an independent watchdog that monitors the global body.
The WHO's decision to oppose travel restrictions when it declared an international emergency on Jan. 30 has been one of the steps criticised by the United States, which has announced it will quit the U.N. agency.
Brundtland, speaking to a briefing on Friday, strongly opposed the U.S. decision to quit the WHO. But she acknowledged a need to look at the guidelines, known as the International Health Regulations, agreed by member states years earlier and which discourage restricting trade and travel during epidemics.
The guidelines ""need reform and we will propose reforms because we have seen weaknesses very clearly,"" Brundtland said. ""In the whole process of formulating and agreeing on the International Health Regulations, many countries were adamant to try to avoid air and travel restrictions.""
She said some governments had worried that the threat of travel restrictions would cause countries not to report outbreaks.
Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister who led the WHO from 1998-2003, said China's delay last year in reporting the new coronavirus had led to more cases, but that Beijing's response was far better than during the 2003 SARS outbreak.
""I think it's right to say that China had maybe learned something from the SARS experience where they really closed down and refused to speak to the WHO and even to me as director-general when I had to enter in,"" Brundtland said.

""This time, China did communicate with WHO, although I do believe that it took too many days, maybe a week or two more than it should (have), to really give the information that they already had,"" she said.
President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will quit the WHO and withhold funding for the body, which Trump says was too supportive of China early in the crisis.
Brundtland said quitting the WHO was ""the most astonishingly and transparently counterproductive"" of all of Trump's moves against multilateral arrangements. ""I believe the WHO is essential,"" she added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Around 350 Belgian police officers protested in Brussels on Friday saying they were tired of constant criticism and being ""spat on"" in public after demonstrations against police racism and brutality in the United States turned global.
The officers, some in uniform and all wearing face masks, lined up in front of the central court house in Brussels and dropped their badges and handcuffs on the ground.
""This is not the United States. This is not the same thing. We have to stop generalizing and permanently bashing the police,"" said inspector Vincent De Clercq, one of the protesters.
The killing of unarmed Black American George Floyd by police on May 25 has led to weeks of global protests and prompted a rethink about discrimination in many countries, including Belgium.
De Clercq said Floyd's killing was scandalous but added that, while a few Belgian police officers might have to be fired for holding racist views, the majority were doing a good job.
""They are tired of being spat on from morning to night,"" he said.
Belgian police said on Wednesday they were investigating an incident in which a Black member of the European Parliament said she had been pushed and grabbed by four police officers after she began to film police harassing two young Black people outside Brussels' Gare du Nord station.

A police spokeswoman denied any violence had been used in that incident.

U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington will consider the government's emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop the memoir's release, because it contained classified information and publication could threaten national security.
Several excerpts have already been released from the book, ""The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,"" which is scheduled for release on Tuesday.
The book has drawn attention for its withering portrayal of Trump, including alleged improprieties far more extensive than the accusations underlying the president's impeachment trial, where he was acquitted in February.
Bolton is a foreign policy hawk who was ousted last September after 17 months as national security adviser.
He accused Trump in the memoir of exhibiting ""fundamentally unacceptable behavior"" that eroded the legitimacy of the presidency, and being driven by his own political interests.
Bolton said Trump, who is seeking re-election on Nov. 3, once explicitly sought Chinese President Xi Jinping's help to win a second term. 
Trump tweeted on Thursday that the book was ""a compilation of lies and made up stories,"" which could undermine the argument that publication could pose a threat.
The government supported its argument with filings from several senior intelligence officials who said publishing would damage national security. 
Simon & Schuster, Bolton's publisher, has rejected the government's accusations, and lawyers for Bolton said more than 200,000 copies of the book have already been distributed.

Bolton's lawyers also called an injunction an illegal prior restraint, citing the Supreme Court's 1971 rejection of the Nixon administration's bid to stop publication of the Pentagon Papers, which detailed U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.

Now Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has finished her degree at Oxford University and, like all students, is just looking forward to some sleep and some movies.
With universities in Britain temporarily closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, Yousafzai posted pictures on social media which showed her celebrating with a cake and balloons, and covered in foam, paint and confetti as per tradition for Oxford students on the last day of their final exams. 
""Hard to express my joy and gratitude right now as I completed my Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree at Oxford. I don’t know what’s ahead. For now, it will be Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), reading and sleep,"" she said on her Twitter and Instagram feeds.
Congratulations poured in on social media, including from aid charity Oxfam, which said: ""Congratulations, you are an inspiration!"". Hollywood and Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra Jonas, who has 54 million Instagram followers, said: ""Congratulations Malala!! That’s amazing.""
Yousafzai, now 22, survived being shot in the head by a Taliban gunman in 2012, after she was targeted for her campaign against efforts by the Taliban to deny women education.
She had become known as an 11-year-old writing a blog under a pen name for the BBC about living under the rule of the Pakistani Taliban. A gunman arrived at her school, asking for her by name. He opened fire on her and two classmates on a bus. 
She was airlifted to a hospital first in Pakistan and then to an intensive care unit in England for multiple operations. After recovering, Yousafzai attended school in England, before winning the place at Oxford.
At the age of 17, in 2014, Yousafzai became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize for her education advocacy. Through her Malala Fund, she has also become a global symbol of the resilience of women in the face of repression. 
""Like many of you, the pandemic has changed a lot about my final year of university,"" she wrote in a post to graduates in the Malala Fund's digital newsletter for young women, Assembly, speaking about how her brothers kept interrupting her studies. 

""It’s hard not to think about all the moments we’re missing. But we didn’t miss out on the most important thing: our education.""

A vast fuel tank lost pressure on May 29 and unleashed 21,000 tonnes of diesel into rivers and subsoil near the city of Norilsk, an incident that Greenpeace has compared to the devastating 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez oil spill off Alaska.
""Russia has not yet had experience of clearing up such vast pollution from bodies of water as far as I understand,"" Putin told officials on state television. 
It will take at least 10 years for biodiversity in the waters to fully return where the accident happened, the state fishing agency said at the meeting.
The state environmental watchdog plans to finish its assessment of the damage by July 1, its head told Putin. 
Vladimir Chuprov, a Greenpeace activist, said the damage to the water totalled 100 billion roubles ($1.44 billion), a figure that was higher than it should be because of what he said was the slow official response, the TASS news agency reported. 
The city of Norilsk is home to mining giant Norilsk Nickel (MM:GMKN). The company and emergency specialists are collecting contaminated soil and fuel from local rivers into containers.
Nornickel has already spent 5 billion roubles on the clean-up, its co-owner Vladimir Potanin said. The mining giant also plans to spend 13.5 billion roubles on safety checks for its remaining fuel storage tanks in 2020-2021.
More than 90% of the fuel from the rivers and about 70% of the contaminated soil have been already collected, Nornickel said earlier this week.
Putin previously ordered officials to check all similar fuel storages in Russia, and they plan to complete this process by July 24, they told him.

TAOS, N.M. (Reuters) - A New Mexico protester was unarmed when he was shot during a demonstration earlier this week to remove a conquistador statue in Albuquerque, the man's lawyer said.
A video of the incident appears to show protester Scott Williams (NYSE:WMB), 39, picking up a skateboard and hitting suspected shooter Steven Baca, 31, with it before Baca shoots Williams with a handgun.
""Williams was not armed and that is clear when he picked up the skateboard,"" his attorney Laura Schauer Ives said late Thursday. ""It does not make sense that he would pick up a skateboard if he had a weapon,"" she added.
Monday's shooting incident has raised questions about why Albuquerque police did not intervene sooner as civilian vigilantes and members of a heavily armed militia tried to protect the statue from protesters who wanted to pull it down. 
A New Mexico prosecutor on Wednesday dropped a shooting charge against Baca, of Albuquerque and called for further investigation after allegations Williams was armed. 
Williams, an artist and a student at the University of New Mexico, was in stable condition after receiving multiple gunshot wounds to his torso, Schauer Ives said.
Jason Bowles, an attorney representing Baca, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bowles previously said Baca, who was defending the statue, would plead not guilty to remaining charges against him, the Albuquerque Journal reported.
Albuquerque Police Department Commander Art Sanchez on Wednesday said officers did not intervene sooner in the standoff as they did not want to escalate the situation.
Anti-racism protesters angered by the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, have tried to topple sculptures of Spanish conquistadors and colonial rulers associated with subjugation of indigenous people.
The city of Santa Fe, New Mexico, on Thursday removed a statue of colonial governor Diego de Vargas before a planned demonstration against it.

""The Supreme Court asked us to resubmit on DACA, nothing was lost or won. They 'punted', much like in a football game (where hopefully they would stand for our great American Flag). We will be submitting enhanced papers shortly in order to properly fulfil (l) the Supreme Court’s ruling & request of yesterday,"" Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy.
Trump did not explain what he meant by ""enhanced papers."" The highest court in the country left the door open for Trump to attempt again to rescind the program, ruling only that the administration had not met a procedural requirement and its actions were ""arbitrary and capricious"" under a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act.
Ken Cuccinelli, the Department of Homeland Security acting deputy secretary, on Friday said the department would ""move as quickly as possible"" to present Trump with various executive options he could take.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's ruling stopping President Donald Trump from rescinding protections for ""Dreamers"" immigrants marked the second time in a year that he lost a major case because Chief Justice John Roberts faulted his administration for sloppiness in the policymaking process.
The conservative Roberts, joined by the court's four liberal justices, decided on Thursday that the administration's actions in crafting the immigration policy were ""arbitrary and capricious"" under a federal law called the Administrative Procedure Act.
The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program protects roughly 649,000 immigrants, mostly young Hispanic adults born in Mexico and other Latin American countries, from deportation and provides them work permits. [L1N2DV12V] 
Thursday's decision echoed a June 2019 ruling in which the court - Roberts again siding with the four liberal justices - faulted the administration's plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. census.
Roberts wrote then that the administration had violated the same law, concluding that the stated rationale for adding the question ""seems to have been contrived."" Critics said the question was intended to dissuade immigrants from taking part in the decennial population count.
In both 5-4 rulings, Roberts split from his four fellow conservatives and ruled against the administration on technical legal process issues without judging whether the actual policy was lawful. 
The rulings showed that Roberts, an appointee of Republican former President George W. Bush, is willing to push back against Trump. They also showed that in key instances Trump's administration has been unable to craft high-profile policies that will stand up in court. 
""Quite honestly, this is why we have had so many victories against this administration in court. They just refuse to follow the rules,"" Xavier Becerra, California's Democratic attorney general, told reporters. ""They seem to be very impatient and they don't believe the rules apply to them.""
Becerra, among those challenging the DACA rescission, pointed to another ruling issued on Wednesday by a different court. A California-based judge blocked Trump's Department of Education from withholding federal coronavirus pandemic relief funds from students who do not qualify for financial aid.
Case Western Reserve University School of Law professor Jonathan Adler said that in some cases that Trump's administration has lost, courts have adopted an ""unduly rigorous standard"" that makes it harder for the government to win. But, Adler added, ""it's also fair to say this administration has had its fair share of sloppy work.""
Trump's administration has lost 79 out of 85 cases involving federal agencies on deregulatory or policy issues tracked by the Institute for Policy Integrity, a think tank connected to New York University School of Law.
Earthjustice, an environmental group that regularly sues the administration over regulatory issues, has said it has won 33 of 40 cases decided on the merits of the legal issues involved. In one of them, a judge blocked Trump's attempt to open vast areas of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans to oil and gas leasing.
The Justice Department did not respond to a request seeking comment.
TRUMP VERSUS JUDGES
""Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me?"" Trump asked on Twitter on Thursday. 
Trump has often criticized American courts and judges - and Roberts himself - for ruling against his policies. Roberts in November 2018 hit back at Trump after the president called a judge who ruled against one of the president's immigration policies an ""Obama judge.""
But Trump has also won a number of big cases, with victories over ending subsidy payments to health insurance companies, various deregulatory efforts and his the efforts toward a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border.
The Supreme Court has bailed him out in two major cases.
Lower courts found that his administration did not adequately explain why it was in the interests of the United States to implement Trump's 2017 travel ban targeting people from several Muslim-majority countries, as required by federal immigration law. Lower courts also faulted the administration for failing to back up its policies to restrict transgender troops from the military. 
The Supreme Court, in both instances, sided with the administration to allow the travel ban and the transgender military policy to take effect.

Trump and his fellow Republicans have said voting by mail invites tampering, although numerous studies have found little evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to mail-in balloting, and have filed lawsuits and threatened to withhold federal funding over the issue. 
""My biggest risk is that we don’t win lawsuits,"" Trump told Politico in the interview, conducted on Thursday. ""If we don’t win those lawsuits ... I think it puts the election at risk."" 
The coronavirus outbreak, which has killed more than 118,000 Americans and led to fears of a second wave of infections in the autumn, has pushed a number states to expand mail-in voting. Some parts of the country have seen a recent spike in cases.
Long lines in Georgia's nominating contest last week following other voting problems in several other states in recent weeks also have raised concerns about potential voting problems in November's presidential contest. 
Meanwhile, lawsuits over mail-in voting have been filed in several states, including California, Texas and Arizona. 
A Reuters/Ipsos poll in April showed most Americans, including a majority of Republicans, want the government to require mail-in ballots for the Nov. 3 presidential election if the coronavirus outbreak continues to be a threat.
In March, as Congress wrestled with coronavirus economic relief and Democrats pushed to expand access to voting, including mail-in balloting, Trump told Fox News: ""If you ever agreed to it you'd never have a Republican elected in this country again.""
Asked if he would accept the results of the election no matter the outcome, Trump told Politico that was a question ""you can never answer."" 

He told Fox News last week he would ""go on and do other things"" if he did not win a second term.

The bloc included tech-powerhouse Taiwan on its list of trade partners for a potential bilateral investment agreement in 2015, the year before Tsai first won the presidency. But since then it has held no talks with Taiwan on the issue.
Speaking in a pre-recorded message to the Copenhagen Democracy Summit, Tsai alluded to autocratic China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, in describing how her island stands to benefit from the reshaping of global supply chains in the COVID-19 world.
""European and American businesses will be looking for more reliable partners. To them I say, democratic Taiwan, with its respect for the rule of law, human rights and intellectual property, its talented workforce and its strong and trustworthy track record in high-tech industries, welcomes your investment,"" she said.
""An investment agreement between Taiwan and the European Union, for example, will be a great first step, one that will align our norms and standards and permit business to flourish, alongside protections accorded to traders and investors,"" she said. 
""What better way to show the world that democracies are willing to support each other in the face of rising challenges to our values? We should use the power of economics to strengthen our democracies.""
EU member states, and the EU itself, have no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan due to China's objections, which considers the island one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of state, so any investment deal could be tricky politically for the EU.

However, the EU has grown increasingly impatient with China on trade, saying Beijing has failed to provide fair access for European firms. Negotiations on a China-EU investment agreement have been underway for six years and may be concluded in 2020.

Security Council to make good on an agreement to hold a face-to-face summit to try to tackle the world's problems as soon as possible. 
Putin made the appeal in an article in English published late on Thursday in American international affairs magazine The National Interest in which he examined the events of World War Two ahead of a Red Square parade next week to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany.
""Today, as in 1945, it is important to demonstrate political will and discuss the future together,"" wrote Putin. 
He proposed such a summit in January and the four other permanent members of the U.N. Security Council - the United States, China, France and Britain - gave their agreement in principle.
Moscow hopes the summit can proceed once coronavirus fears recede despite its relations with the West, and particularly the United States, being strained over everything from Syria and Ukraine to alleged Russian political meddling abroad.
The summit would discuss the global economy, global security, arms control, extremism, cyberspace and climate change, Moscow has said. Putin said Moscow had specific ideas and initiatives on all the themes. 
""Drawing on a shared historical memory, we can trust each other and must do so. That will serve as a solid basis for successful negotiations and concerted action for the sake of enhancing...stability and security on the planet,"" wrote Putin.

The Rugby Football Union is reviewing the use of the song as it was believed to have been written in the 19th Century by a black slave. 
""Frankly I think what people need to do is focus less on the symbols of discrimination ... all these issues that people are now raising to do with statues and songs and so on - I can see why they're very emotive, I understand that,"" Johnson told Sky. 
""But what I want to focus on is the substance of the issue."" 
Asked about the Swing Low, Sweet Chariot song, he said: ""I certainly don't think there should be any sort of prohibition on singing that.""

He added that he was curious about why so few people knew all of the words of the song.

The Sea-Watch 3 vessel is now sailing in international waters in the area of the Italian island of Linosa waiting for a safe port to disembark migrants, the charity group said.
Of the 211 people on board, mainly from Africa, 20 are women and 62 are minors, including a few months old baby, Sea-Watch said. ""We immediately need a safe port,"" they wrote on Twitter.
Italy, one of Europe's worst-hit countries by COVID-19, last April issued a decree saying its ports could not be considered safe because of the pandemic and would not let migrant boats dock for the duration of the emergency, which will remain in effect until July 31.
For years Italy was the primary route into Europe for hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers and other irregular migrants but after a crackdown in Libya against smugglers, the numbers making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean fell sharply.
However, there has been a pick-up in 2020 with 5,832 people landing in Italy so far against 2,242 in the same period of 2019, interior ministry data show.

Along with NGO rescues, migrants continue to arrive in Italy aboard smaller ships. Six boats with more than 100 migrants arrived in the island of Lampedusa in the last few days.

LLEIDA, Spain (Reuters) - Like many African immigrants seeking fruit-picking jobs in Spain, Europe's largest fruit and vegetable exporter, Ibrahim Ndoye had to sleep rough on the streets of Lleida for 10 days this month as nobody would rent him a room.
The 42-year-old Senegalese acknowledges that restrictions over the coronavirus and fears of the disease may have undermined the northeastern town's hospitality while stoking demand for seasonal jobs, but he largely blames racism.
It took the intervention of a Black celebrity, and momentum from the Black Lives Matter protests, to change Ndoye's fortunes, temporarily. He is now one of 80 immigrants staying at two hotels in Lleida paid for by Monaco soccer player Keita Balde, 25.
""What he has done is something huge and human,"" said Ndoye, who has lived in Spain for 19 years and travelled to Lleida after losing a restaurant job on the coast due to the COVID-19 crisis.
Local councillor for civil rights Sandra Castrol said Lleida saw a huge early inflow of seasonal job seekers this year, before the campaign starts in earnest in July, after many lost jobs in the tourism sector or as street vendors as a result of the pandemic.
Balde's gesture has grabbed media attention, putting the spotlight on the long-standing struggles of the thousands of seasonal farm workers across Spain.
AFRAID TO SPEAK OUT
In late May, after learning about their plight, Balde, who was born in Spain to Senegalese parents, offered to pay for the harvest-season hotel accommodation of around 200 migrants.
Most hotels initially rejected the offer, said Nogay Ndiaye, a Catalan-Senegalese activist who represented Balde in the talks. ""There's been racism by the hotels,"" she said.
The local hotel federation denied the accusation, citing hotel closures due to the coronavirus, repairs and administrative issues.
""If one person wants to rent 20 or 25 rooms ... if you are being offered to get paid in advance and you reject it because they are Black people, how do you call that?"" said Ndiaye.
Rights group SOS Racismo tweeted earlier this month that the homeless migrants in Lleida showed: ""The state, all its institutions and our economic system maintains a racial and unequal system"".
After about two weeks, municipal authorities and the hotel federation helped arrange a two-week hotel stay paid for by Balde, while another 120 people are staying in a municipal pavilion.
But dozens more Black men were earlier this week sleeping in Lleida's crammed covered square full of mattresses and suitcases.
In a June 1 video, Balde said he was not looking to stir tensions, but ""looking for a solution ... No-one deserves this indifference and difficulties"".
The situation is not confined to the city of 139,000 where around 25,000 migrants come for the season, or the northeast. 
In February, the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme Poverty Philip Alston cited a migrant settlement in the southern province of Huelva, which houses up to 2,000 people during the peak strawberry picking season, where he said conditions were ""inhuman"", without adequate sanitation or access to water.
By law, farmers can hire only legal immigrants and have to provide housing. But many undocumented migrants arrive anyway and often get underpaid jobs without lodging, even though most of the sector complies with the law, Castrol said.
She called for the regularization of the city's undocumented migrants to prevent labour exploitation and vowed to seek a permanent lodging solution after years of neglect.

But even legal immigrants like Ndoye say they are afraid to defend their rights: ""I am not going to risk losing a job,"" he said.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Three consecutive explosions claimed by a little-known separatist group killed four people including two soldiers in Pakistan's southern province of Sindh on Friday, officials said.
At least a dozen people were also injured.
Shadowy secessionist organization the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army, which wants the province to break from the Pakistani federation, said it carried out the attacks. 
One of the blasts was in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and the capital of Sindh, where a civilian died and eight others including a paramilitary soldier were injured.
That explosion was outside a centre for distribution of government cash handouts, and police believe the target was a vehicle of the Sindh Rangers paramilitary force parked outside.
The second blast was reported in Ghotki district, 500 km north of Karachi, where two Rangers soldiers died along with a passerby, local police chief Furrukh Ali told Reuters.
The third blast took place in Sindh's Larkana district, where no casualties were reported.
The Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army has carried out low-intensity attacks in the past, including blowing up train tracks, but its separatist fight has been less violent than that of neighbouring Balochistan province.
""Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army claims the responsibility of Karachi, Ghotki and Larkana attacks,"" it tweeted, without giving more details. 
The Rangers, a wing of the Pakistan Army, have been deployed around Pakistan and played a prominent role in crackdowns on militant and criminals in Karachi.

Sindh's Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah ordered an inquiry into Friday's violence.

LONDON/CARACAS (Reuters) - In the vaults beneath the Bank of England, where foreign nations stash parts of their vast gold reserves, lie 1.7 billion euros ($1.9 billion) of disputed gold bars. Two parties claim access to them. 
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro says they belong to his administration's central bank. His rival, opposition leader Juan Guaido, who the British government recognizes as Venezuela's rightful leader, say the bars are his to control.
Next week, a British commercial court will begin deciding whose claim is just, after the Venezuelan central bank (BCV) sued the Bank of England to gain access. A decision is not expected until August or September, the judge wrote in a May 28 ruling.
At stake is a sizeable chunk of the Maduro government's dwindling overseas assets. Lawyers representing the BCV say much of the gold would be sold to fund Venezuela's response to the coronavirus, which threatens to overwhelm a health system gutted by six years of economic crisis.
The opposition alleges Maduro wants to use the gold to pay off his foreign allies, which his lawyers deny. Over the past two years, Maduro's government has removed some 30 tonnes from its reserves in Venezuela to sell abroad for much-needed hard currency, according to people familiar with the operations and the bank's own data.
The opposition, still led by Guaido almost a year and a half after he began a parallel presidency, hopes a favorable verdict could influence other countries to hand them control of more Venezuelan assets, including $5 billion of state funds frozen in foreign bank accounts.
""Without a doubt recognition from the court would be a very important precedent,"" Guaido's chief overseas legal representative, Jose Ignacio Hernandez, told Reuters.
The Bank of England has declined to comment on the case. 
The dispute began in May 2018 when Maduro secured re-election in a vote that the main opposition coalition boycotted and called a sham. Afterwards, Boris Johnson, then the British foreign minister, said: ""We may have to tighten the economic screw on Venezuela.""
Concerned by mounting sanctions against the Maduro government, the BCV told the BOE it wanted to bring home 14 tonnes of gold it had stored there. 
Around the year's end, Calixto Ortega, the BCV president, traveled to London to discuss this with BOE officials, according to Sarosh Zaiwalla, a London-based lawyer representing the BCV.
The BOE officials told Ortega they could not accept his instruction as there was an issue with his authority, Zaiwalla told Reuters.
The following February, Britain joined dozens of other nations in backing Guaido's claim. In April, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned the BCV, alleging Maduro was using it to ""plunder"" Venezuelan assets to ""enrich corrupt insiders.""
Before the sanctions, Venezuela paid off several gold swap transactions the BCV had agreed with  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) in the previous years, people familiar with the deal said. This resulted in 17 tonnes of gold held in the BOE's vaults being returned to the control of the BCV, bringing its holdings there to 31 tonnes, about a quarter of Venezuela's total gold reserves.
The sanctions then triggered the early termination of other gold swaps made between BCV and Deutsche Bank, releasing more gold to the BCV, according to a chronology filed to the court by Guaido's legal team.
Guaido's team asked the court to determine who had the authority to represent the BCV and receive the gold. In July, Guaido appointed his own central bank board.
This February, Maduro's government hired Zaiwalla to replace another law firm. He says Ortega contacted him after he represented Iran's Bank Mellat in a case seeking damages from the British government for imposing sanctions that harmed its reputation and goodwill. The British government settled for £1.25 billion last year.
""This case is bound to have some bearing because a UK court decision is respected worldwide,"" Zaiwalla said.
""IMPORTANT PRECEDENT""
In April, Zaiwalla sent the BOE's solicitors a letter instructing the BOE to facilitate the sale of $1 billion of the gold and transfer the sum to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which would purchase medicine and food needed for Venezuela's coronavirus response, according to documents submitted in court.
When the BOE did not comply, Zaiwalla filed a legal claim against the bank in May, saying it was depriving the BCV of funds at a time of ""national and global emergency.""
""We have no income, no way of generating cash flow,"" Ortega told Reuters in May.
So far, Maduro's administration says the virus has killed 28 people out of 3,300 confirmed cases. The number of infections has accelerated in recent weeks raising worries that any leap in severely sick patients could overwhelm hospitals.
UNDP has confirmed the BCV approached it. In a letter seen by Reuters sent to the opposition on June 3, the UNDP's Latin America regional director said any UNDP engagement would only follow a ""formal agreement"" between the BCV and the BOE.
In response to the legal claim, the BOE asked the court to rule on whether it should follow instructions from Maduro or Guaido's boards.
In their arguments submitted to the court, Maduro's BCV says the court should consider which side controls the state in Venezuela and whose ambassador is recognized by the British government.
The UK Foreign Office's current diplomatic list names a Maduro-appointed official as ambassador, not Guaido's own ambassador, Vanessa Neumann. Neumann told Reuters this is because Guaido does not control the immigration authority.
Guaido's camp argues the court should base its decision on the British government's recognition of his authority. The Foreign Office, in a letter to the court in March, confirmed this remains the government's position.
Meanwhile, the opposition says Maduro is trying to intimidate figures involved back home. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in May accused Guaido and his legal chief Hernandez of ""trying to steal the gold.""
On June 1, Hernandez denounced that intelligence agents were raiding his home in Caracas, though he now lives in the United States. He said this was in retaliation for ""defending"" Venezuela's assets abroad.

Conflict, hunger and economic upheaval had displaced nearly 80 million people worldwide, half of them children, by the end of 2019 - nearly twice as many as a decade ago.
In Africa alone, fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Burkina Faso and the Sahel region have contributed to the number of refugees surging to 6.3 million, Clementine Nkweta-Salami, the UNHCR director for East Africa, Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes said.
""I think we are witnessing today record levels of forced displacement, where almost close to 80 million people are displaced worldwide. This breaks down as 1% of humanity,"" she told Reuters.
""One person in every 97 persons is forcibly displaced. On the (African) continent, we also see rising numbers. We started the decade with about 2.2 million and that has almost tripled.""
Nkweta-Salami said the coronavirus outbreak had presented more challenges.
In Kenya, the government and the UNHCR have provided items such as face masks and sanitisers in the Dadaab refugee camp, close to Somalia. 
It houses more than 217,00 people, making poor sanitation and overcrowding a big concern. The agency said in May at least two people had tested positive for COVID-19 at the camp.
""On World Refugee Day, I think the message we have this year, notably that together we can make a difference and that every action counts,"" Nkweta-Salami said. 
""I think is one that should resonate in the hearts of most people globally, I would say more than it would have done in a year in which we were not all confronting the same situation.""
Habiba Muhamad, from Somalia, lives at the camp. ""We've been receiving food during the coronavirus,"" she said. ""We were given masks, soaps."" 
Mumina Yussuf, another refugee from Somalia, said health workers there had been diligent.

""Hand sanitisers have been provided to keep our hands clean. They have put containers with running water outside,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Eastern European Union countries have rejected using carbon emissions trading to boost the bloc's budget, sources said as leaders convened on Friday to wrangle over how to pay for recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
The 27 national EU leaders are discussing by video link an unprecedented stimulus package based on a proposal by the bloc's executive to raise 750 billion euros for a recovery fund that would top up the next EU budget worth 1.1 trillion euros.
If approved, the plan would need to lay out how to repay the debt, with the European Commission proposing raising new EU funds to achieve that, including using the EU emissions trading system (ETS) to garner 10 billion euros.
That proposal has faced opposition from east European states that want to keep hold of their carbon revenue. 
Poland, the Czech Republic, Lithuania, Estonia and Bulgaria are all against the idea, EU diplomatic sources said.
""Expanding the ETS revenue is unacceptable to us, it would cost us too much,"" a senior EU diplomat from one of the countries told Reuters.
The EU's ETS puts a price on pollution by forcing power plants and factories to buy permits to cover their emissions. Proceeds from those carbon permit sales - totalling 14.6 billion euros in 2019 - currently go to national budgets. 
The Commission proposed that, from 2021, countries keep the same ETS revenue as in recent years, while extra proceeds from expanding the scheme to shipping would go to EU coffers.
Another eastern EU diplomat said it would put a disproportionate burden on poorer members of the bloc.
That draws a battle line between the east and their western peers such as France and Luxembourg which favour the idea. 
Supporters say the ETS proposal, and the Commission's idea to tax non-recycled plastic to raise further EU revenue, could be implemented faster than other schemes, such as a digital tax and imposing carbon costs on imported goods. 
The fight over carbon reflects bigger divisions over a push by western EU countries including Germany, France and the Netherlands to deliver a ""green"" economic recovery from the pandemic, while the east frets about costly climate aims.

""We refuse to put the Green Deal above the recovery,"" one government official from an eastern EU country said, referring to the EU's flagship plan to slash emissions to zero by 2050. ""There is no Green Deal without a recovery.""

Wong, who was 17 when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement, has not been a leading figure of the often-violent protests that have shaken the semi-autonomous financial hub for the past 12 months.
However, he has drummed up support for the pro-democracy movement overseas, meeting with politicians from the United States, Europe and elsewhere, drawing the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a ""black hand"" of foreign forces.
He was disqualified from running for the less important district council elections last year on grounds that advocacy of Hong Kong's self-determination violates electoral law, which he described at the time as political censorship.
He intends to run in a primary for the pro-democracy camp that will choose candidates for the Legislative Council vote on Sept. 6.
""If more people vote for us ... it could generate more pressure and more hesitation for Beijing,"" Wong said, in front of campaign posters with the slogan ""Ballot, or bullet.""
Wong has said he supports the idea of a non-binding referendum for people to have a say over Hong Kong’s future but that he is against independence.
Electoral rules after Hong Kong's 1997 return to China from Britain effectively guarantee that the legislature is stacked in Beijing's favour, with only half the seats directly elected. 
The rest are picked by business and professional groups called ""functional constituencies,"" which are dominated by pro-establishment figures.

In 2016, the pan-democratic camp won 29 seats, but then lost six when candidates were disqualified after China’s national parliament ruled their oaths of office were invalid.

AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - Many Juneteenth observances celebrating the emancipation of African American slaves more than a century and a half ago were shifted to the internet on Friday due to the coronavirus, though street marches and ""car caravans"" were planned in several major U.S. cities.
Organizers said the occasion holds particular significance this year - despite limitations imposed by the pandemic - as it comes amid a reckoning with America's troubled racial history following last month's death of George Floyd under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.
Weeks of mounting demands to end police brutality and racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system are sure to animate rallies expected in cities coast to coast, including New York, Washington, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago and Los Angeles.
In Texas, where Juneteenth originated, Lucy Bremond oversees what is believed to be the oldest public celebration of the occasion each year in Houston's Emancipation Park, located in the Third Ward area where Floyd spent most of his life.
This year a gathering that typically draws some 6,000 people to the park, purchased by freed slaves in 1872 to hold a Juneteenth celebration, will be replaced with a virtual observance.
""There are a lot of people who did not even know Juneteenth existed until these past few weeks,"" Bremond said. 
Juneteenth, a blend of June and 19th, commemorates the U.S. abolition of slavery under President Abraham Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, belatedly announced by a Union army in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, after the Civil War ended.
Texas officially made it a holiday in 1980, and 45 more states and the District of Columbia have since followed suit. This year, a number of a major companies declared June 19, also known as Emancipation Day or Freedom Day, a paid holiday for employees.
Union dockworkers at nearly 30 ports along the West Coast planned to mark the occasion by staging a one-day strike.
But much of the focus of the 155th annual observance will take place on social media, with online lectures, discussion groups and virtual breakfasts, to help safeguard minority communities especially hard hit by the pandemic.
""We have been training our staff on how to use technology to present their events virtually and online,"" said Steve Williams (NYSE:WMB), president of the National Juneteenth Observance Foundation. 
Many chapters have also planned ""car caravans"" - slow-speed processions of motorists honking horns and waving their arms as they wend their way through neighborhoods, Williams said.
One possible focal point of Juneteenth observances this year will be Tulsa, Oklahoma, where President Donald Trump's first campaign rally in three months was originally scheduled for Friday but was moved to Saturday after a storm of opposition.
Critics said staging the rally on Juneteenth in Tulsa, the scene of a notorious massacre of African Americans by white mobs in 1921, showed a profound lack of sensitivity to the city's history, not to mention disregard for public health concerns. Local media reported Juneteenth organizers were planning an outdoor event expected to draw tens of thousands on Friday. 
Byron Miller, Juneteenth commissioner for San Antonio, Texas, said he has long felt compelled to make the celebration ""palatable"" to white people by emphasizing advances in racial harmony, rather than dwelling on centuries of abuses endured by African Americans. 
But Floyd's death has left him newly embittered.
""The times we're living now have forced many of us to acknowledge that maybe slavery has never ended, in some fashion or another,"" he said.

Bremond saw the potential for the holiday as a balm for racial wounds, saying, ""I'm hopeful that Juneteenth will serve as a stabilizing influence for the chaos that we've been seeing in the streets.""

VALLETTA (Reuters) - In the months before her murder in 2017, Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was on the trail of an offshore company called 17 Black Limited.
She didn't know who owned the firm, which was registered in the United Arab Emirates. But she was certain it was set up to channel corrupt payments to her country's leaders, she wrote in her blog, without providing evidence.
Caruana Galizia was killed in a car bombing in October 2017.
Last year, police charged one of Malta's wealthiest businessmen, Yorgen Fenech, previously revealed by Reuters to be the owner of 17 Black, with ordering her murder. He denies the charge. The assassination triggered a political crisis in Malta that drove Prime Minister Joseph Muscat from office earlier this year.
17 Black's activities have remained shrouded in mystery. But now new evidence uncovered by Reuters and the Times of Malta sheds light on its operations through one particular deal.
In December 2015, 17 Black made a previously undisclosed profit of 4.6 million euros ($5 million) when Malta's state energy company, Enemalta, bought a wind farm in Montenegro. The purchase came after negotiations and several trips to Montenegro led by Malta's then energy minister, Konrad Mizzi.
In that same month, accountants for Mizzi and the prime minister's then chief of staff, Keith Schembri, wrote in an email that Schembri and Mizzi stood to receive payments from 17 Black for services that weren't specified. Reuters and other news outlets have previously reported these emails, which were part of an application to open bank accounts for Panama firms owned by the two men.
Schembri confirmed to Reuters in April 2018 that companies he owns had devised a ""draft business plan"" with 17 Black that was not implemented, but he gave no further details. He is now under investigation for potential involvement in Caruana Galizia's murder, police have said. He has denied any role in the journalist's killing.
Mizzi has previously stated he had no involvement in or knowledge of the plot to murder Caruana Galizia.
He told Reuters he had no connection to 17 Black and disputed ""that an email from my service provider states that I might profit"" from the firm. Asked about his trips to Montenegro, Mizzi replied: ""My involvement in this project was as Minister responsible for Enemalta, setting overall energy policy."" He said he played no part in any corrupt deals.
Reuters has found no evidence that 17 Black made the payments to Schembri and Mizzi.
MONTENEGRO VENTURE
Montenegro's Mozura wind farm project was launched in 2010 as the Balkan state's first major renewable energy scheme. A concession to build and run the wind farm was won by a Spanish company, Fersa Renovables, since merged with another Spanish firm, Audax Renovables.
In November 2015, the Maltese government announced that state-controlled Enemalta was acquiring the project.
Accounts published by Fersa and corporate records in Montenegro revealed, however, that Fersa sold its 99% interest in Mozura to an intermediary, a Seychelles-registered company called Cifidex Ltd. The remaining 1% of shares, held by a local Montenegrin company, were also sold to Cifidex.
According to the public records, Cifidex bought the Mozura shares on December 10, 2015, for 2.9 million euros ($3.3 million). Two weeks later, Cifidex sold all the shares to Enemalta. In its accounts, Enemalta said it paid 10.3 million euros - more than three times the original price tag.
The ownership of Cifidex, and the extent of any profit it made, including any additional fees it may have earned from brokering the deal, were not revealed in public filings. Nor could Reuters determine how or why Cifidex became involved in the sale. The company couldn't be reached for comment.
Audax declined to share with Reuters any details about Cifidex's ownership or representation, saying in a statement it ""cannot provide information that is personal or about individuals."" Audax explained it sold the wind farm because it was ""non strategic."" The Montenegrin firm with the one percent shareholding didn't comment about the deal. Enemalta said it would reply to questions as early as possible once information was ""collected and verified."" At the time of publication, Enemalta had not provided any further details about the wind farm transaction.
Sources directly involved in the transaction have told Reuters how it was structured: Cifidex purchased the shares from Fersa with 3 million euros borrowed from 17 Black. After Cifidex sold the shares to Enemalta, it repaid the 3 million euros to 17 Black, plus an additional 4.6 million euro ($5 million) ""profit share,"" these sources said. Reuters couldn't determine what 17 Black did with this profit.
Two other people with access to information about 17 Black's bank account in Dubai confirmed to Reuters that 17 Black transferred 3 million euros to Cifidex in late November 2015. Cifidex paid a total of 7.8 million euros to 17 Black by May the following year. A third source gave a lower figure of 7.6 million euros.
Cifidex is owned, said one person with direct knowledge, by Turab Musayev, an executive of SOCAR Trading, the Swiss-based subsidiary of the Azerbaijan state oil company, SOCAR.
Musayev, who has a British passport, was a business associate of Fenech, the owner of 17 Black. The two men were co-directors of a consortium which in 2017 built a 450 million euro gas power station in Malta. Musayev represented SOCAR Trading, which owned one third of the consortium, according to public records.
Musayev's UK-based law firm, Atkins Thomson, said Musayev had no reason to avoid any dealings with Fenech. ""As you will imagine, our client knew nothing, suspected nothing, and had no reason to believe Mr Fenech had any involvement in this atrocity,"" the law firm said in a letter to Reuters.
The letter added that ""any business dealings that our client had with him involved due diligence from other very reputable and established companies, including bankers, professional accountants and lawyers.""
Cifidex had its own independent management, the letter said. It did not directly address Musayev's ownership of Cifidex, or respond to questions about his role in the Mozura deal. A further letter clarified that beyond the Mozura transaction, Musayev had ""no other business with Mr Fenech.""
Fenech, who is in prison on remand while hearings in the murder case continue, did not respond to questions, sent via his lawyers, about the wind farm. A lawyer said Fenech did not wish to comment yet on the matter.
SOCAR Trading told Reuters it had no involvement in or knowledge of the Mozura scheme and no knowledge of 17 Black. In a statement, the company said it had employed Musayev as a consultant ""allowing him to conduct business outside his official duties."" SOCAR confirmed it appointed Musayev as director of the power project consortium, where he served alongside Fenech.

Reuters asked Schembri, Mizzi and former PM Muscat if they knew that Musayev, 17 Black or Fenech were connected to the wind farm project. Mizzi and Muscat said they were not aware. Schembri did not respond. Muscat, who opened the completed wind farm project in November 2019, just before he left office, said in a statement: ""My role was to foster relations with the government of Montenegro at Presidential and Prime Ministerial level, as was my duty as Prime Minister."" He said that, to his knowledge, Schembri was not involved in negotiations for the project.

The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics also reflected previous studies which showed that black and other ethnic minority groups had a far higher risk of death from the disease than those with white ethnicity.
According to the ONS, which examined data from the start of March until May 15, the mortality rate among Muslims was higher than any other group, with those who were Jewish, Hindu or Sikh also showing higher death rates.
""With ethnicity included, (this) demonstrates that a substantial part of the difference in mortality...between religious groups is explained by the different circumstances in which members of these groups are known to live; for example, living in areas with higher levels of socio-economic deprivation and differences in ethnic makeup,"" the ONS report said. 
""However, after adjusting for the above, Jewish males are at twice the risk of Christian males, and Jewish women are also at higher risk,"" said Nick Stripe, Head of Life Events at the ONS, adding that more research was needed to explain this. 
The mortality rate among Muslim men was 98.9 deaths per 100,000 and 98.2 deaths per 100,000 for women. For those who said they had no religion in Britain's 2011 census, the figure was 80.7 deaths per 100,000 males and 47.9 deaths per 100,000 females.
The findings coincide with more statistics which show that black and Asian people in England and Wales were at higher risk from the novel coronavirus.
Figures showed that the highest mortality rate was among black men at 255.7 per 100,000 compared to a rate of 87 deaths per 100,000 white males. The death rate was 119.8 per 100,000 for black women and 52 per 100,000 for white women.
That echoes an official study earlier this month which found black and Asian people in England were up to 50% more likely to die after becoming infected with COVID-19.

""Significant differences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men,"" Stripe said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese prosecutors said on Friday they have charged two detained Canadians for suspected espionage, indictments that could result in life imprisonment, in a case that has driven a diplomatic wedge between Ottawa and Beijing. 
Former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor were arrested in late 2018 on state security charges, soon after Canadian authorities arrested Huawei Technologies Co's [HWT.UL] chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in Vancouver on a U.S. warrant.
While China maintains the detentions are not linked to Meng, former diplomats and experts have said they are being used to pressure Canada.
China has repeatedly called for Meng's release, and has warned Canada that it could face consequences for aiding the United States in her case.
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular briefing on Friday that the indictments were ""of particularly serious circumstances which violated Article 111 of the Criminal Law of the People’s Republic of China,"" which pertains to espionage and state secrets.
Under that article, a conviction can carry a sentence of from 10 years to life imprisonment ""when circumstances are particularly serious"". 
""The facts are clear and the evidence is solid and sufficient. He should be held accountable for criminal responsibility under the above mentioned charge,"" Zhao said of Kovrig, before making the same statement about Spavor.
The charges mean a formal trial can begin.
Canada has called the arrests ""arbitrary"". The Canadian Embassy in Beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Earlier this month, China's envoy to Canada, Cong Peiwu, told Reuters the two detained men were ""in good health."" The foreign ministry said on Friday that consular visits to detainees had been suspended due the coronavirus.
The ruling Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said last year that Kovrig is accused of ""stealing and spying on sensitive Chinese information and intelligence."" It said Spavor provided Kovrig with intelligence, without giving details. 
Kovrig works for the International Crisis Group (ICG), a non-governmental organization that focuses on conflict resolution. ICG could not immediately be reached for comment. 
ICG has previously said the accusations against Kovrig are ""vague and unsubstantiated.""
Spavor, 44, is a businessman with deep ties to North Korea.
Last month, Huawei's Meng, the daughter of the founder of the telecoms giant, lost a legal bid to avoid extradition to the United States to face bank fraud charges, dashing hopes for an end to her house arrest in Vancouver.

She recently raised a new argument in a Canadian court in a bid to fight extradition, court documents released on Monday showed.

The opposition has been scrambling to muster a credible alternative to Muhyiddin, who was unexpectedly made prime minister in March after a week of political turmoil punctuated by the shock resignation of his predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad.
But its search for a leader has been unable to settle on either Mahathir or Anwar Ibrahim, veteran politicians who joined hands in 2018 to oust then prime minister Najib Razak, with Anwar becoming Mahathir's successor-in-waiting.
Muhyiddin's appointment was the unintended consequence of a plan, green-lit by Mahathir, to block Anwar from becoming prime minister, after Mahathir became convinced Anwar would not be able to command a majority. But Mahathir ended up being outplayed by colleagues and close allies, who included Muhyiddin.
Anwar's People's Justice Party, which holds 38 of the 222 seats in Malaysia's parliament, said it cannot accept Mahathir back at the helm, insisting that the only way forward is to place Anwar as the opposition's prime ministerial candidate.
In a statement, the party said it remained ""open to discussing with all parties"", including Mahathir, on ways to ""save Malaysia and return the people's mandate"".
The party issued its statement after its partners in the Pakatan Harapan pact made known their support for Mahathir to lead them, and set up the stage for his return to a possible third term as prime minister.

Mahathir had pushed for a confidence vote in parliament in Muhyiddin's leadership, and has said that the prime minister will face ""very big trouble"" as the opposition will seek to oust him at every turn.

WASHINGTON/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday blacklisted Mexico's Libre Abordo and a related company, accusing them of helping Caracas evade U.S. sanctions in the first formal action by the U.S. Treasury Department against Mexican firms involved in trading Venezuelan oil.
The Treasury said in a statement it imposed sanctions on three individuals, eight entities and two vessels for activities related to a network attempting to skirt U.S. sanctions on Venezuela aimed at ousting President Nicolas Maduro.
Mexico's peso slumped 2% after the U.S. action.
Among those blacklisted were Mexico-based Libre Abordo and related Schlager Business Group, as well as their co-owners, Olga Maria Zepeda and Veronica Esparza. 
The Treasury also targeted Mexican Joaquin Leal Jimenez, accusing him of having worked with Alex Saab, recently arrested in Cape Verde, Libre Abordo and Schlager for brokering the resale of millions of barrels of Venezuelan crude.
""Leal is the critical conduit between Libre Abordo, Schlager Business Group, and their owners, and PDVSA and Saab. Leal has been coordinating the purchase and sale of Venezuelan-origin crude oil from PDVSA,"" Treasury said.
Leal did not reply to a request for comment.
A Maduro ally who has previously helped the government buy food, Saab was sanctioned in 2019 and charged with money laundering and conspiracy in a U.S. court in relation to a food program managed by Maduro's administration. The government has denied any wrongdoing in connection with the program.
Libre Abordo said its lawyers will evaluate the Treasury's decision, which it said wrongly linked the firm to unrelated entities. 
""Our exchange of humanitarian aid with Venezuela should not be subject of sanctions,"" Libre Abordo told Reuters in a statement.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets of the individuals and entities and generally prohibit Americans from dealing with them.
Libre Abordo and Schlager began receiving Venezuelan oil for resale in Asian markets late last year after signing two contracts with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in mid-2019.
The agreement was framed as an oil-for-food pact exempted from U.S. sanctions as the Mexican firms intended to supply Venezuela with 210,000 tons of corn.
Through May, Libre Abordo and Schlager received some 30 million barrels of Venezuelan oil, according to PDVSA's documents. Even though they supplied about 500 water trucks in exchange, food was never delivered, as very low oil prices affected a schedule originally planned, Libre Abordo said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the oil-for-food ""enterprise skimmed millions from funds that were claimed to have been for humanitarian aid, yet failed to deliver the promised food to the Venezuelan people.""
Reuters reported last month that the FBI was probing several Mexican and European companies allegedly involved in trading Venezuelan oil, gathering information for a Treasury inquiry.
""They want us to be unable to export oil so the Venezuelan people are left without food, medicine or gasoline,"" Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said on Thursday. ""Your actions and sanctions are criminal,"" he told Pompeo over Twitter.
Washington in January 2019 recognized Venezuelan politician Juan Guaido as the OPEC nation's rightful leader and has ratcheted up sanctions and diplomatic pressure in the aftermath of Maduro's 2018 re-election that was widely described as fraudulent.
Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. 
""The United States will continue to relentlessly pursue sanctions evaders,"" Treasury Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich said in the statement. 
Washington also targeted on Thursday Marshall Islands-based Delos Voyager Shipping Ltd. and Greece-based Romina Maritime Co Inc. for operating in the Venezuelan oil sector, giving them until July 21 to wind down activities.
The other firms blacklisted are Alel Technologies LLC, Cosmo Resources Pte. Ltd, Luzy Technologies LLC; and Washington Trading Ltd.

The Treasury delisted Marshall Islands-based firm Afranav Maritime Ltd and Greece-based Seacomber Ltd, and two vessels they own, after the companies promised to stop trade with Venezuela while Maduro is in power.

A resolution, adopted in a vote called after China expressed opposition to it, raised pressure on Iran to let inspectors into the sites mentioned in two International Atomic Energy Agency reports because they could still host undeclared nuclear material or traces of it.
The text of the resolution submitted by France, Britain and Germany and obtained by Reuters says the board ""calls on Iran to fully cooperate with the Agency and satisfy the Agency's requests without any further delay, including by providing prompt access to the locations specified by the Agency.""
Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers drew a line under what the IAEA and U.S. intelligence services believe was a covert, coordinated atomic weapons programme halted in 2003. But Israel's seizure of what is calls part of an ""archive"" of Iran's past work appears to have yielded new clues on old activities.
The IAEA suspects activities possibly related to developing nuclear weapons were carried out in the early 2000s at these sites. Iran has suggested the IAEA is seeking access based on the Israeli information, which it argues is inadmissible. It also says the IAEA file on its old activities has been closed.

The resolution, the first by the board since 2015 and the implementation of the nuclear deal, was passed by a 25-2 margin with seven abstentions, diplomats said. Iran's allies China and Russia opposed the measure.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway, which has some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe, must maintain tight control of its borders to avoid importing COVID-19 cases from abroad, Prime Minister Erna Solberg said on Friday.
Fears of an early second wave of infections in Europe are growing as the continent lifts travel restrictions ahead of the summer holidays.
""There is still a danger of new infections ... Cases of infection coming from abroad is the biggest danger today,"" Solberg told parliament. ""So it is important to keep control.""
While other European countries have gradually lifted some, or all, travel restrictions, Norway, which is not a member of the European Union but belongs to the passport-free Schengen travel zone, has followed a tougher line.
Most non-residents, including tourists, are still not allowed into the country, though those who work in sectors deemed crucial, such as agriculture or oil, and those who can prove a family link with Norway can come. They must undergo a 10-day quarantine. 
However, since Monday citizens and foreign residents of Denmark, Iceland, Finland and the Swedish island of Gotland have been allowed to enter Norway, and without undergoing quarantine. 
People from mainland Sweden are not allowed into the country given the higher number of infections there.
As of June 18, Norway had identified a total of 8,692 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with 244 deaths. It has estimated that no more than 1% of its 5.4 million population has been infected since the outbreak began. 

Norway was early in Europe in imposing a lockdown, in mid-March and was able to begin lifting restrictions after Easter. The main restriction still in place is a ban on gatherings of more than 200 people.

The review, led by Labour First which describes itself as bringing together all traditions of the leftist movement, was in response to last year's electoral defeat, when Boris Johnson's Conservatives made gains in the party's traditional heartlands.
After electing a new leader, Keir Starmer, many in the party hope to end years of division to try to challenge Johnson's majority in parliament by capitalising on the shortcomings of the government's response to the coronavirus crisis.
But the review issues a cautionary note - the party will need to do more to try to win back power after 10 years in opposition after the last Labour government.
""Our report echoes the consensus of many reports that a combination of views of our party leadership, Brexit and a manifesto that was not seen as credible sealed our defeat in 2019,"" the report said, referring to former leader Jeremy Corbyn. 
""It would be a mistake to believe that a different leader, with Brexit no longer the defining issue, would in itself be sufficient to change Labour’s electoral fortunes.
""This loss is the story of more than one election - indeed it is a story that stretches back two decades.""
The report, based on survey responses, interviews with party figures and data, said the election loss was a ""story that stretches back two decades"", compounded by fighting the 2019 election with no clear strategy.
""Our political strategy, organisation and campaigning infrastructure needs major overhaul,"" the report said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has been ramping up tensions with South Korea in recent weeks, but the campaign seems aimed at making a renewed push for sanctions relief by recapturing the attention of a U.S. administration that is distracted by domestic issues.
North Korea blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border last week, declared an end to dialogue with South Korea and threatened military action.
After three historic meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to lead to a denuclearisation deal, U.S. President Donald Trump's attention is fixed elsewhere, including the coronavirus epidemic, anti-racism protests and the November presidential election.
Kim, however, is facing real-world consequences for the failed talks, with North Korea's sanctions-hit economy further strained by a border lockdown imposed to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, potentially threatening his support base among the elites and military.
Analysts say one of Kim's goals in lashing out at U.S. ally South Korea is to remind Washington of the unresolved issues with North Korea, potentially forcing it to intervene.
""Trump could feel the need to talk to the North to manage the situation for now, and publicly claim that he had warded off the possible military provocations that Kim has threatened,"" said Chang Ho-jin, a former South Korean presidential foreign policy secretary. 
""By raising inter-Korean tensions, North Korea could also be hoping South Korea will push harder to get sanctions exemptions for joint economic projects that have so far been elusive.""
'LAST-DITCH EFFORTS'
A diplomatic source in Seoul said U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun who had led negotiations with North Korea, are willing to make ""last-ditch efforts"" before the U.S. election. 
""There was anxiety among them that they couldn't just idle away the first half of this year,"" the source said, noting Washington would switch to full election mode soon. 
But a U.S. source familiar with the matter told Reuters that while Washington is willing to talk with Pyongyang at any time, there will unlikely be any negotiations that lead to a significant breakthrough in the near future, especially if North Korea only offers to dismantle its main Yongbyon nuclear facility. 
The source said that sanctions relief is likely far away, as North Korea has been unwilling to discuss abandoning enough of its nuclear programmes for the United States to consider rolling back sanctions.
The pandemic, anti-racism protests and the rise of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden may have changed Kim's strategy for winning concessions, said Wi Sung-lac, a former South Korean chief nuclear negotiator. 
In his New Year address, Kim vowed to unveil a ""new strategic weapon,"" after Washington ignored a year-end deadline he had set for a restart of talks, but North Korea appears to have fallen off Trump's agenda as he found himself mired in domestic crises. 
""North Korea had been expected to stage a serious provocation such as an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test, but COVID-19 and the ensuing U.S. political situation seem to have provided Kim a new calculation,"" Wi said. 
""With Trump already in trouble, firing an ICBM would only benefit Biden, so he resorted to short-range missile testing as a stop-gap measure and now is targeting the South."" 
If Biden is elected, any negotiations would be ""much more painful"" for Kim as he would take a more principled approach and empower seasoned negotiators without summitry extravaganzas, said Cho Tae-yong, a South Korean lawmaker who previously as vice foreign minister worked with Biden's foreign policy advisers. 
Some experts do not rule out a return to ICBM testing if Trump looks increasingly likely to lose in the election, but that would also upset China which has been lobbying for Pyongyang to ease international sanctions. 

""Serious provocations like an ICBM test could backfire, so Kim must be thinking hard not to overplay his hand until November,"" Wi said.

VILLAFALE, Spain (Reuters) - Brought to Spain on a special flight amid the coronavirus lockdown, some 250 Uruguayan sheep shearers race against time to shear millions of Spanish sheep as the sweltering summer temperatures hit. 
The Uruguayan shearers come to Spain every year, where farmers value them for their skills, their speed and particular care for the animals' wellbeing. This year the pandemic delayed their arrival by about a month to mid-May, leaving the sheep in urgent need. 
The shearers are so prized in Spain, that farmers chipped in to charter a plane for the Uruguayans after border closures, flight cancellations and restrictions on movement threatened to leave them unable to make the journey. 
The farmers, who even asked the Spanish King for help, convinced the government to authorise their stay after the Uruguayans underwent medical tests before flying. 
Federico Ventura is one of the workers each shearing around 10,000 sheep over a 70-day campaign in the northern region of Castilla y Leon. They use special machines and an animal restraint technique that further speeds up the process. 
""I've been coming here for six years. Because of the coronavirus, everything was delayed, but we're moving at a good pace,"" Ventura told Reuters at a farm in Villafale, around 300 kilometres northwest of Madrid.
The Spanish season is crucial to his livelihood. 
""With the 70 days here we live for a year in Uruguay.""
Three or four shearers can shear 750 sheep on a farm in just one day, while with less skilled workers it could take up to a month, said farm owner Angel Leon. The Uruguayans earn 1.5 euros ($1.68) plus tax per animal.
""Had they not come, we would not have been able to shear,"" said farmer Jose Moran, one of those to help fund their flight.

LONDON (Reuters) - British financial institutions that benefited from slavery such as Lloyd's of London should go further than saying sorry for their role in the Atlantic slave trade and atone for their sins by funding Caribbean development, the region's countries said.
More than 10 million Africans were shackled into the Atlantic slave trade by European nations between the 15th and 19th centuries. Those who survived the often brutal voyage, ended up toiling on plantations in the Americas.
While the history of Europe's scramble for African slaves has been widely known for centuries, the death of George Floyd in the United States has prompted a sweeping global reassessment of racism and the financing of the slave trade.
The Lloyd's of London insurance market apologised on Thursday for its ""shameful"" role in the 18th Century Atlantic slave trade and pledged to fund opportunities for black and ethnic minority people.
But a regional alliance of Caribbean countries said that Britain's institutions should go much further than simply apologising and give some of the wealth back to the Caribbean by funding development at the epicentre of the slave trade.
""It is not enough to say sorry,"" said Hilary Beckles, chairman of the CARICOM Reparations Commission which was set up by Caribbean countries to seek reparations from former colonial powers such as the United Kingdom, France and Portugal.
""We are not asking for anything as mendicant as handing out cheques to people on street corners,"" Beckles told Reuters from Jamaica. ""The issue of money is secondary, but in this instance the moral discharge of one's duty does require in a market economy that you contribute towards development.""
There was no immediate reply from Lloyd's of London to a request for comment. 
NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT
Beckles, a Barbadian historian, said the antecedents of many British and European banks, as well as an array of accompanying institutions in the City of London, ""drank from the well of Caribbean slavery"".
The Bank of England apologised for what it called the ""inexcusable connections"" of some past governors and directors to slavery, and said it would remove any portraits of them from display anywhere on its premises.
The history of several other British financial firms, including  Barclays  (L:BARC), is also under fresh scrutiny.
""Unfortunately, one cannot go back and remake the history but you can make atonement: it is not enough to make your apology as a public spectacle, it is not enough to present it as public relations exercise,"" said Beckles.
""It is not about public relations - it is about a negotiated settlement whereby everyone finds closure within a moral framework,"" he said. ""To say sorry and issue a press release is disrespectful - it does not fly with the people who were victimized.""
British institutions, he said, should sit down with Caribbean nations to fund development projects - or even consider a sort of ""Marshall Plan"" to give some of the plundered wealth back - a reference to the U.S. aid given to Europe after the destruction of World War Two.
""The British legacy of slavery and colonalisation has left the black community in quite a mess,"" Beckles said, adding that he was not calling for litigation of any kind.
""All the institutions that created this mess really have to come and help in practical ways to clean it up.""
On Britain's broader reassessment of its past, Beckles said public consciousness was catching up with history.

""Public consciousness is catching up with history: that moment has come. British public morality has caught up with its own institutional history of slavery.""

261,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 04:35AM ET</span>",Factbox: China's new national security proposals for Hong Kong riddled with uncertainty,"By Greg Torode
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's plans to impose new national security laws on Hong Kong are raising widespread fears the legislation could lead to profound changes in the former British colony.
As the standing committee of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, discusses the changes over the next two days, here are the most nagging questions:
WILL MAINLAND CHINA'S POWERFUL SECURITY AND INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES BE ABLE TO TAKE ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN THE CITY? 
The initial resolution of the National People's Congress raises the prospect that officers from such agencies could be based in the city for the first time if needed on national security cases.
It remains unclear how that would work in practice, given the extensive capabilities of Hong Kong's own police force and the protections and freedoms residents enjoy under the mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, that guides the city's relationship with Beijing. The Hong Kong Bar Association noted recently that such personnel should not be entitled to any immunity and have any powers, including of surveillance, beyond those based on Hong Kong laws.
GIVEN HONG KONG'S EXTENSIVE FREEDOMS UNDER THE ""ONE COUNTRY/TWO SYSTEMS"" MODEL, WHAT KIND OF ACTIVITY WILL BE THE TARGET OF THE NEW LAWS?
The legislation will outline offences and penalties covering secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces. Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong say the laws will target only a small number of ""troublemakers"" who threaten national security, and that the rights and freedoms of ordinary Hong Kong people will be protected.
But critics fear it will effectively stifle freedoms of speech and assembly, and many are waiting for details and definitions to see what kind of actions could lead to prosecution.
The city has strong media, artistic and religious traditions that are protected to a far greater degree than those on the mainland, where Communist Party-led control is strong.
Some fear broad, ideologically driven definitions, as the laws are being drafted by party legal experts and not Hong Kong's lawyers.
The references to criminalising foreign interference will also be heavily scrutinised, given Hong Kong's extensive international links across business and politics. 
WILL MAINLAND COURTS BE INVOLVED IN PROSECUTING HONG KONG NATIONAL SECURITY CASES?
Hong Kong's proudly independent judiciary and separate common law-based legal system are considered key to its success as a global financial centre. Many across the political, business and diplomatic spectrum are watching for signs of any shift under new laws given recent comments from some pro-Beijing figures that trial-by-jury could be scrapped in national security cases or that foreign judges - a long-standing tradition in Hong Kong - should not be involved.
A mainland official further muddied the waters this week by saying that Beijing must be able to have jurisdiction over the most serious national security cases.
WHAT ELSE ARE PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT?
Any clauses related to the seizure of assets will be closely watched, given Hong Kong's attractiveness to mainland Chinese capital in particular. Fears of asset seizure requests by mainland courts were among earlier concerns about a now-scrapped extradition bill last year. At the height of the debate about the need for laws allowing offenders to be extradited to face trial in mainland courts, a retired mainland security official said Beijing had a list of 300 mainlanders it wanted from Hong Kong. 

Some critics fear provisions to retrospectively examine certain offences, which could target people involved in the sometimes violent anti-government protests that rocked the city for much of the last year. A senior mainland official said this week that the laws would not be retroactively applied.

Taiwan's air force said the J-10 fighter jet was involved in the approach but did not say whether only one aircraft or more had entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone to the island's southwest around midday (0400 GMT).
The Chinese air force was given a verbal warning to leave, and Taiwanese jets ""responded"", Taiwan's air force said, without giving further details.
The aircraft then withdrew and the situation returned to normal, it said in a brief statement.
In the past week-and-a-half, the Chinese air force has buzzed Taiwan six times, according to Taiwan's military.
China has not said in public why it has increased its activity near the island, but has previously described such drills as routine and intended to show China's determination to defend its sovereignty.
Taiwan's air force, which is well trained and is modernising its U.S.-made F-16 fighter jets, routinely patrols above the sensitive Taiwan Strait which separates the island from its much larger neighbour.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring democratic Taiwan under its control though the island has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic Beijing.
Taiwan has complained China has stepped up its military activity, including sending aircraft carriers near the island, since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European governments are working with the United States on plans to overhaul the World Health Organization, a top health official for a European country said, signalling that Europe shares some of the concerns that led Washington to say it would quit.
The European health official, who spoke on condition of anonymity while discussing initiatives that are not public, said Britain, France, Germany and Italy were discussing WHO reforms with the United States at the technical level.
The aim, the official said, was to ensure WHO's independence, an apparent reference to allegations that the body was too close to China during its initial response to the coronavirus crisis early this year.
""We are discussing ways to separate WHO's emergency management mechanism from any single country influence,"" said the official.
Reforms would involve changing the WHO's funding system to make it more long-term, the official said. The WHO now operates on a two-year budget, which ""could hurt WHO's independence"" if it has to raise funds from donor countries in the middle of an emergency, the official said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has accused the WHO of being too close to China and announced plans to quit and withdraw funding.
European countries have occasionally called for reform of the WHO but have generally shielded the organisation from the most intense criticism by Washington. In public the European position has usually been that any reform should come only after an evaluation of the response to the coronavirus crisis.
EVALUATION AND REFORM 
But minutes of a videoconference of EU health ministers last week suggested European countries were taking a stronger line and also seeking more European influence at the WHO in future. The German and French ministers told their colleagues ""an evaluation and reform of the WHO was needed"", the minutes said.
That was stronger wording than in a resolution last month which the EU drafted and which was adopted by all 192 WHO member countries. That resolution called for an evaluation of the response to the coronavirus crisis, but it stopped short of calling for reforms.
The German and French ministers also told their colleagues""The EU and its MS (member states) should play a bigger role at the global level,"" the minutes showed.
A spokesperson for the German health ministry said Berlin sought stronger engagement with the WHO ahead of Germany taking over the EU presidency on July 1.
A German government source told Reuters the aim of the intervention at the health ministers' meeting was to encourage debate among EU member states about how to reform the WHO. Asked whether Germany was now pushing for quicker changes, instead of waiting until after the crisis, the official said: ""Reforms of international organisations normally take years, not months.""
A French health ministry spokesman also said the WHO would be on the agenda of Germany's presidency of the EU, and Paris would work on it with Berlin. France backed WHO reform but changes should follow the evaluation of the organisation's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, he said. 
A British government spokesperson said Britain worked with organisations including the WHO ""to encourage and support transparency, efficiency and good management"".
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the WHO did not respond to requests for comment.
The WHO drew criticism for public praise of China's efforts to combat the disease in the early days of the crisis, even as evidence emerged that Chinese officials had silenced whistleblowers.

The EU and its governments funded around 11% of the WHO's $5.6 billion budget in the 2018-19 period, and the United States provided more than 15%. China covered just 0.2%.

""I am not ruling out anything,"" Junior European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin told Europe 1 radio, when asked if she could rule out a no-deal Brexit.
""Those who need a deal the most are the British. They cannot withstand a second shock after the epidemic. They wouldn't have access to the security net that is Europe, they wouldn't have access to the stimulus fund,"" she added, alluding to the economic hit to European states caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told visiting French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday that talks on a post-Brexit deal cannot drag on into the autumn. 
Montchalin said: ""We will not yield to this deadline pressure, this final sprint that Britain want to impose on us in the hope we will cave in. We do not want a deal for the sake of having a deal but we want a balanced deal.""
Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 but talks on a future relations have so far made little progress. Johnson and EU leaders say a deal is achievable, but both sides say time is running out and the prospect of no-deal remains.
An internal document obtained by Reuters this week showed the German government is urging other EU states to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, casting doubt on Johnson's public optimism about chances of an early agreement on future ties.
A transition period during which Britain remains in the EU's customs union and single market expires on Dec. 31 and Johnson has ruled out extending it. 
Montchalin was speaking as EU leaders hope to unite behind an unprecedented stimulus to inject billions of euros into their coronavirus-ravaged economies at a teleconference meeting on Friday.

267,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 03:51AM ET</span>","On World Refugee Day, Palestinians try to scrape by in Gaza","By Nidal al-Mughrabi
GAZA (Reuters) - On the United Nations' World Refugee Day on Saturday, Marwan Kuwaik, a 70-year-old Palestinian in Gaza, will be focused on trying to eke out a living by selling snack food on the street.
The June 20 event this year is aimed at reminding the world that everyone, including refugees, can contribute to society, the U.N. said on its website. 
In Gaza, Kuwaik earns about 30 shekels ($8.50) a day selling lupin beans from his bicycle. He is among 1.4 million Palestinians U.N.-registered refugees in the impoverished and crowded enclave, whose economy has suffered from years of Israeli and Egyptian blockades.
""I support my family, 15 people. I have never stopped my work for 40 years, even during wars, curfews and closures, except when I am sick,"" Kuwaik said.
Kuwaik's parents were among the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who fled or were forced to leave their homes in what is now Israel during the fighting that surrounded its founding in 1948.
He was born two years later in Gaza and lives in the outskirts of its Beach refugee camp. The U.N. registers as refugees the descendants of those Palestinians displaced more than 70 years ago.
Kuwaik said his family once owned farmland in Lod, a city in Israel. He visited Lod twice in early 1980s and found a new house of concrete had been built next to his father's old shelter. 
The new Israeli owners continued to grow olive trees on the farmland as his family long had, he said.
""We will return,"" Kuwaik vowed in his house as he filled small plastic bags with lupin beans. ""If we die our sons will rise, and if they die then our grandchildren will do it.""
Asked about World Refugee Day, he said: ""We remain without a solution ... the situation is miserable but we still have hopes.""

SYDNEY/TAIPEI (Reuters) - The presidential run-off in the Pacific island nation of Kiribati between a pro-Beijing leader and an opposition candidate sympathetic to Taiwan is the most aggressive campaign in the country's history, according to former president Anote Tong.
The vote, scheduled for June 22, could open the door for Taiwan to reclaim the strategic ally it lost to China last year, with the opposition campaigning on a platform critical of the diplomatic switch.
Kiribati, the site of a mothballed Chinese space tracking station in the central Pacific, has a finely balanced parliament with loyalties evenly split between President Taneti Maamau and ally-turned-rival Banuera Berina, who broke from the government last year citing concerns over the switch. 
""Primarily, it has been about the Taiwan-China issue,"" said Tong. ""In my experience, it's the most aggressive campaign that I've seen,"" describing a bidding war of uncosted policies and combative claims over whether or not Kiribati will benefit from relations with Beijing.
Tong, who said he had been impartial since retiring from politics in 2016, oversaw a shift in Kiribati's ties from China to Taiwan during his first term in 2003. 
""There are some strong feelings against China particularly with the very active participation of the Chinese diplomatic mission during the campaign,"" said Tong.
China's embassy in Kiribati (pronounced Kiribas) said China does not interfere with the internal affairs of other countries. 
China's foreign ministry in Beijing said there had been rich results since the nations resumed diplomatic relations last year.
""China is willing to work with the Kiribati government, on the basis of the one China principle, to promote the continuous development of Sino-Kiribati ties, to help with the well-being of both countries people,"" the ministry said.
Kiribati received more than $4.2 million from China for ""livelihood projects"" in the weeks leading up to the vote, according to a Kiribati government statement. 
The offices of the candidates Maamau and Berina did not respond to requests for comment.
Diplomatic sources say both Washington and Canberra are watching the election closely, given concerns about China's increased role in the Pacific.
""We took the Pacific for granted too long and didn't pay enough attention, giving China its opportunity,"" a senior Western official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters, referring to Kiribati and the Solomon Island's decisions last year to recognise Beijing.
The U.S. embassy in Fiji, which oversees relations with Kiribati, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
BEIJING BUILDS CLOUT
Many Pacific island nations, long-aligned with the United States and its allies, have been forging closer ties with China in recent years amid a push by Beijing to increase its diplomatic and financial clout in the region.
China claims democratic Taiwan as its territory with no right to state-to-state ties.
Taiwan, which shares a robust yet unofficial relationship with the United States, now has only 15 formal allies left worldwide.
A member of the Kiribati parliament, who declined to be named because they were not authorised to speak to the media, said Kiribati would want to re-establish a working relationship with Taiwan if Berina wins.
""I believe Taiwan would be invited back; whether we take the next move of terminating relations with China remains to be seen,"" the member said.
Taiwan's government is also watching the election, but officials have cautioned against being overly optimistic a new president would move to quickly reinstate ties with the island. 
Western intelligence agencies have privately expressed concern China has used and wants to use again Kiribati's space tracking station to watch U.S. missile and other weapons tests in the Pacific, security sources told Reuters.

China's Foreign Ministry told Reuters the station was only for ""peaceful purposes"", without elaborating.

270,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 19, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>",China's public health reforms may not prevent next virus: experts,"By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's latest plans to overhaul its disease control system may not improve its ability to handle future virus outbreaks, according to some experts inside and outside the country. 
The reforms, announced in late May, do not fix all the flaws exposed by the new coronavirus and do not tackle the issues of secrecy and censorship that many experts believe turned an isolated outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan into a pandemic. 
""The biggest problem in China is (local governments) are afraid that epidemics can impact social stability,"" said Yang Gonghuan, a former deputy head of the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing. ""So they don't want reporters to speak and don't want people like Li Wenliang to speak.""
Li, a doctor in Wuhan, was reprimanded by police for “spreading rumours” when he tried to raise the alarm about the disease, which he later died from. 
China's authorities waited 16 days to shut down Wuhan after the new coronavirus was first identified there in early January. Health minister Ma Xiaowei admitted this month that the struggle to curb the virus ""exposed some problems and shortcomings,"" without giving specifics. 
To address flaws, Beijing has said it will give its hundreds of Centres for Disease Control (CDCs) - which coordinate public health across the country - more power to detect and respond quickly to new outbreaks and will give them better access to hospitals and clinics.
The reforms, which are so far only draft guidelines with no details on timelines or funding, were met with scepticism overseas. 
""It is very clear from the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak and the COVID outbreak that the political, institutional factors have complicated and compromised the whole government's ability to deal with the outbreak,"" said Yanzhong Huang, a public health expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, a U.S. think tank. 
China has reported more than 80,000 cases and 4,634 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. The country's handling of the virus is again in the spotlight after more than 180 new infections were reported in Beijing over the last week or so, the most in the city since February.
LEARNING FROM SARS 
According to China, the first case of abnormal pneumonia was diagnosed in Wuhan at the end of December, and the new coronavirus was identified as the cause on Jan. 7. 
Beijing locked down Wuhan on Jan. 23, but one study from Britain's University of Southampton suggested it could have cut infections by as much as 95% if it had done so two weeks earlier. 
China has also failed to address calls from health advisers and experts for a more independent CDC system capable of responding more rapidly to new health risks.
""The CDCs should be able to do objective, independent investigations after receiving epidemic information,"" said Wang Chenguang, a Tsinghua University law professor who served on China's anti-coronavirus advisory committee.
He said the CDCs were strengthened after the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003, but local government complacency had marginalized them over time: ""After 17 years, everyone seems to have felt at ease, and some of the functions of the CDC were diluted.""
After SARS, China loosened state secrecy restrictions, established an online, real-time reporting system designed to ensure that new outbreaks were disclosed quickly. The system covered nearly all of the country's hospitals and clinics by 2007. 
But many of the improvements proved to be temporary, and Wuhan repeated many of the same mistakes made during SARS, with local authorities covering up bad news rather than acting on it immediately. 
China needs to improve the flow of information and prevent local leaders from censoring citizens and journalists, said Huang, who has studied China's response to epidemics over the past 20 years. 
It must also protect rather than punish whistle-blowers and end social media censorship, given that online posts are often the earliest sources of information on infectious diseases, said Huang.

""This would probably be more effective than simply focusing on investing more on upgrading technologies or reinforcing the authority of the CDC,"" he said.

Selahattin Demirtas, one of Turkey's best known politicians, has been in jail since November 2016 on terrorism-related charges. He faces a sentence of up to 142 years in jail if found guilty in the main case against him.
The court's decision, published in Turkey's Official Gazette, said his detention had exceeded a reasonable period and his right to freedom had been violated, ordering the payment of compensation. 
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling could lead to his release.
A court ruled last September that Demirtas should be released while his main trial continues. The Constitutional Court ruling concerns the detention for this period.
However, prosecutors then launched a new investigation into him and requested his detention again after a court lifted his arrest warrant. Demirtas denies the charges against him.
The party which he led before he was jailed is the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), the second-largest opposition party in Turkey's parliament.
Ankara accuses the HDP of links to the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged a decades-long insurgency against the Turkish state and which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. 

The HDP denies such links.

Many residents have been forbidden from mixing with those outside their families since early April under measures to contain infections that have topped 41,000 - one of Asia's highest tallies.
Jerry, 22, and his girlfriend, who had been apart for weeks, queued for bubble tea in a reopened neighbourhood mall at mid-morning.
""We came early. We wanted to avoid the crowds,"" said Jerry, adding that the couple planned to spend the rest of the day at his home chilling out and catching up.
A nearby coffee shop serving kaya toast, or bread slathered with coconut jam and served with runny eggs, was full of masked patrons who had scanned QR codes on their telephones before entering, to help with contact tracing.
Some restaurants set up plastic screens between tables while retailers used yellow tape to keep people apart in long queues that formed outside their shops. 
Singapore won plaudits for its early containment efforts before a surge in imported cases and outbreaks in cramped migrant dormitories saw it enforce one of the world's strictest lockdowns with hefty fines and even jail for non-compliance.
Restaurants could only offer takeaways and home deliveries, among other restrictions. 
A woman was fined S$5000 ($3,587) this week for several offences including meeting her boyfriend and not wearing a mask, local media reported. 
But there was joy across the island on Friday as old friends nattered over tea at hawker centres and parents watched children play on swings and slides that had been cordoned off for weeks.
Some just couldn't wait for lunch.
John, 24, and Samantha, 21, were one of several couples queuing outside a closed sushi restaurant at 11 a.m.

""We have been talking about sushi for a while,"" said Samantha, adding that they had been holding off until now due to the high costs of home delivery.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Friday accepted the resignation of the minister responsible for relations with North Korea, as tensions with Pyongyang rise over the activities of defectors in the South and stalled diplomacy.
South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with North Korea, offered on Wednesday to step down, making himself accountable for the worsening ties.
After seeing a boost in favourability over his government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, Moon's approval rating fell to 55%, the lowest level in about three months, driven by worries over North Korea, according to a Gallup Korea poll released on Friday.
North Korea has snubbed Seoul's calls for engagement as efforts to restart inter-Korean economic projects stalled due to international sanctions designed to rein in the North's nuclear and missile programmes.
Pyongyang has also taken issue over defectors in the South sending propaganda leaflets into North Korea.
Citing South Korea's failure to stop the defectors, North Korea this week blew up the joint liaison office on its side of the border, declared an end to dialogue with South Korea and threatened military action.
Unification Ministry spokeswoman Cho Hye-sil told a briefing on Friday that an emigre planning to send hundreds of bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and medical face masks to North Korea by throwing them into the sea near the border on Sunday, had been asked to abandon its plan.
She warned that authorities would stop the group, and others like it, from carrying out such plans, and would seek to impose penalties for violations of a law governing inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation.
After a flurry of barbed statements earlier this week, North Korean officials did not issue direct criticism of South Korea for a second day in a row on Friday.

But state media kept up steady stream of reports on North Koreans ""exploding with anger"" at the South.

According to a survey by the ministry, about 40% of projects have seen little adverse impact, and another 30-40% have been somewhat affected, said Wang Xiaolong, director-general of the ministry's International Economic Affairs Department, at a news briefing in Beijing.
""About 20% percent of the projects have been seriously affected,"" he said. Wang did not give any details.
The results from the survey were better than expected and although some projects had been put on hold, China had not heard of any major projects being cancelled, he added.
Over 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. According to a Refinitiv database, over 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion are linked to the initiative.
Restrictions on travel and the flow of goods across borders, as well as local measures to combat COVID-19, were the main reasons for the impacts on projects, said Wang. 
""As the situation improves we have confidence that the projects will come back and the execution of them will speed up,"" he said.
The challenge of the pandemic to BRI projects follows a pushback in 2018, when officials in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere criticized projects there as costly and unnecessary.
China scaled back some plans after several countries sought to review, cancel or scale down commitments, citing concerns over costs, erosion of sovereignty, and corruption.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar effectively pulled herself out of contention to be Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's running mate on Thursday, saying she felt that the historic moment required picking a woman of color.
""This is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket, and there are so many incredible qualified women,"" she said in an interview on MSNBC. ""If you want to heal this nation right now – my party, yes, but our nation – this is sure a hell of a way to do it.""
Biden, who will take on Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election, is under pressure to pick a black woman as his understudy as racial tensions flare over instances of police brutality, including the videotaped death last month of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes.
Klobuchar's record as the top prosecutor for the Minnesota county that includes Minneapolis, where Floyd died, came under scrutiny. Some Democrats took issue with her record on police misconduct and other prosecutions.
Klobuchar, who competed against Biden for the party's presidential nomination before endorsing him, said she spoke with Biden on Wednesday night.
Biden late on Thursday praised Klobuchar's ""grit and determination"" on Twitter and said that ""with your help, we're going to beat Donald Trump.""
Biden has already promised to pick a woman as his running mate, and several black candidates are on his short list, including Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Val Demings. He has also considered candidates of other backgrounds, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, who is white.

Some African-American leaders and activists have said that a black woman on the ticket would help demonstrate to black voters, a crucial component of the Democratic base, that Biden is committed to addressing issues such as criminal justice reform and police misconduct.

Schools and daycare centres near the scene of the incident in Auckland were on lockdown as police searched for the shooter, who also injured a member of the public when fleeing by car.
The two officers were unarmed, which is usual procedure in New Zealand, where only specialist police like those at airports or in tactical response teams routinely carry guns. 
""At this stage, there is nothing to indicate this job was going to be anything out of the ordinary,"" Police Commissioner Andrew Coster said at a media briefing in Wellington. He did not provide details on why the car was stopped by the officers.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the death was devastating.
""To lose a police officer is to lose someone working for all of us, but also a family member, someone’s loved one and friend,"" Ardern said in a statement. 
New Zealand has tightened gun laws twice since a gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in Christchurch last year in the country's worst peace-time mass shooting.

The world's biggest iron ore miner last month destroyed two caves at Juukan Gorge that had previously contained evidence of continual human habitation stretching back 46,000 years as part of a mine expansion.
""On behalf of the Rio Tinto board, I would like to apologise to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people,"" said Simon Thompson, chairman of Rio Tinto, in a statement containing his first public comments since the blast nearly a month ago.
""The decision to conduct a board-led review of events at Juukan Gorge reflects our determination to learn lessons from what happened and to make any necessary improvements to our heritage processes and governance,"" he added. 
The review, to be conducted by independent non-executive director Michael L'Estrange AO, will begin immediately and seek input from Rio employees as well as the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. The findings will be made public, Rio said.
A final report, expected by October, will focus on events at Juukan Gorge to assess Rio Tinto's internal heritage standards, procedures, reporting and governance, as well as examining the company's relationship and communications with the PKKP. 
It will also consult indigenous leaders, traditional owners and experts on the subject. 

The review will complement and feed into a national inquiry into the destruction of the caves. Under terms of the inquiry, the joint standing committee on Northern Australia must report back by Sept. 30.

(Reuters) - California, North Carolina and a string of U.S. cities mandated or urged mandatory mask use on Thursday to get a grip on spiraling coronavirus cases as at least six states set daily records.
Putting aside concerns about individual rights and political unpopularity, U.S. governors and mayors said they were turning to compulsory face coverings to stop the virus running out of control as economies reopened.
On a day when Florida posted 3,207 new cases, its second daily record in a week, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings ordered obligatory mask use, telling residents of Orlando and other cities it would help them avoid a second shutdown.
California Governor Gavin Newsom ordered mask use in most places as the state for the second day in a row registered over 4,000 new cases.
As Arizona posted another daily case record, the Democratic mayors of Tucson and Phoenix respectively ordered and prepared to vote on mandatory face coverings after Republican Governor Doug Ducey bowed to pressure and let cities set mask rules.
""This piece of protection may even save your life,"" North Carolina Democratic Governor Roy Cooper told reporters, adding that he was considering statewide obligatory mask use on a day when statewide COVID-19 hospitalizations set a new high.
A month after many governors reopened their economies, a growing number are adopting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance that masks are essential to prevent community spread.
Resistance to face masks took on a partisan edge after President Donald Trump opposed them, telling the Wall Street Journal in an interview published on Thursday that some people wear them to show opposition to him.
But with businesses ranging from Las Vegas casinos to hardware chains requiring their use, masks are becoming commonplace in the United States.
In Texas, the mayors of the state’s nine biggest cities asked Republican Governor Greg Abbott this week to grant them authority to set mask regulations.
As Oklahoma reported its second day of record coronavirus cases, the Tulsa arena hosting a Trump rally on Saturday said it would encourage all attendees to remain masked throughout the event and issue staff with personal protective gear.
Trump has pushed ahead with the rally - which would be the biggest U.S. indoor social gathering in three months - even as health experts worry assembling thousands of people inside an arena - particularly if many are not wearing masks - could turn it into a virus ""super-spreader event.""

Nationwide, COVID-19 cases rose by 26,357 on Thursday to about 2.2 million, according to a Reuters tally, marking the biggest daily increase in nearly two weeks. There have been 118,377 U.S. deaths, an increase of 684 on Thursday.

Only the capital and neighboring Matanzas province have reported new cases in recent weeks.
The government has authorized activity to resume in the rest of the country, to the delight of Cubans tired of staying at home, although some businesses complain that shortages of basic goods that worsened in the wake of the pandemic are hampering a return to normal. 
""It's a relief to be able to go out, especially for the children who worried me the most,"" said Lisandra Hernandez, on a beach in Artemisa, the province just west of Havana, with her husband and two young children. ""We go to the supermarket, run errands but the kids have been stuck indoors for three months, without setting foot outside.""
Cuba closed its borders, suspended public transport and schools, and banned onsite dining at restaurants when the novel coronavirus started to spread there. Citizens were ordered to stay at home except for work or essential tasks.
Last week, the government said it would start to ease its lockdown although face masks would remain mandatory in public spaces and schools would only resume in September.
On Wednesday, it said international tourism, a key source of hard currency, would re-start in July albeit only with travelers arriving via charter flights and tested upon arrival for the coronavirus.
The absence of tourism has further dented an economy already struggling with a decline in Venezuelan aid and tighter U.S. sanctions. Shortages of even basic goods have worsened.
In Artemisa, the capital of Artemisa province, several owners of private businesses, which in Cuba do not have access to wholesale stores, complained of a lack of supplies, hampering a return to normality.
Raul Jimenez said his private cafeteria lacked staple items like ham and bread for sandwiches so was limited largely to selling fresh fruit juices.

Garrett Rolfe, a white officer charged on Wednesday in the killing, was being held at the Fulton County jail. He was fired by the department on Saturday, a day after the shooting in a Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) parking lot in south Atlanta.
In announcing the charges on Wednesday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said he had recommended no bond for Rolfe, who shot Brooks twice in the back with his service handgun after a scuffle. Rolfe was charged with felony murder and 10 other counts. 
A second officer on the scene, Devin Brosnan, did not discharge his weapon. He faces a handful of lesser charges, including aggravated assault and violation of his oath.
Brosnan turned himself in at the Fulton County Jail earlier on Thursday and was released on bond, according to his lawyer.
The death of Brooks - the latest in a long line of African Americans whose fatal encounters with law enforcement have been documented on video - further heightened U.S. social tensions at a time of national soul searching over police brutality and racism in the criminal justice system.
Howard also said Brosnan had agreed to turn state's evidence against his fellow officer. 
""He has decided to testify on behalf of the state in this case,"" the prosecutor said at a briefing to announce the charges.
But Brosnan's attorney, Don Samuel, on Thursday denied that his client had made such an agreement.
While his client had told Howard's office ""everything"" during a lengthy interview and would cooperate with the Georgia Bureau of Investigation's probe, he had not agreed to be ""state's witness,"" the lawyer said. 
""Officer Brosnan has not agreed to testify.  He has not agreed to plead guilty,"" Samuel said in a statement, adding that he ""has not agreed to be a 'state's witness.'""
The killing of Brooks followed a national wave of protests sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. That officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with second-degree murder. Three other Minneapolis policemen were charged with aiding and abetting.
The police encounter with Brooks started out calmly after he was found sleeping in his car at a Wendy's fast-food restaurant drive-through lane in Atlanta. Rolfe and Brosnan administered a sobriety test, after which the situation escalated.
Previously released video of Brooks appeared to show him grabbing one of the officer's Taser stun guns and turning and pointing it at Rolfe before being shot. Howard said Thursday that investigators concluded Rolfe knew by then that the Taser had already been fired twice and thus was rendered harmless.
One of the bullets from Rolfe's gun hit a white Chevy Trailblazer at the Wendy's, threatening the life of the three passengers inside, according to Howard and the charging documents against the two officers.
One of the car's passengers, Michael Perkins, told a media briefing on Thursday that he had taken cover in the back seat as the struggle between the officers and Brooks escalated. He said he ""smelt gunsmoke"" but was unaware the car had taken a bullet until later. 
""I almost was killed myself. I feel troubled about it but I'm glad the family is getting the justice it deserves.""
Samuel described the decision to charge his client as ""irrational"" and politically motivated. He said Brosnan's conduct on the night of the shooting was ""exemplary"" and a ""textbook example"" of how an officer should approach a situation involving someone inebriated, as Brooks was that night.
While Brosnan did not fire his gun, Howard charged him with aggravated assault for allegedly standing on Brooks' body after he was shot and for violating his oath of office by not rendering medical aid immediately after Brooks went down.
Samuel said Brosnan, despite suffering a concussion during a tussle with Brooks, rushed to provide medical aid.

A private funeral for Brooks is scheduled for Tuesday at 1 p.m. (1700 GMT) at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the church said in statement. On Monday a public viewing is scheduled at the church.

The catch-up package will be worth 1 billion pounds ($1.24 billion) over the 2020-2021 academic year, a statement said.
Of that, 650 million pounds will be shared across state primary and secondary schools to help them put in place small group tuition and other measures to assist pupils.
Another 350 million pounds will go to a national tutoring programmes aimed at increasing access to high-quality tuition for disadvantaged young people.
Schools were shut in March to most children, as part of a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of COVID-19. 
Some year groups started returning to classrooms this month, but the government has faced criticism for dropping plans to get all primary pupils back into school before the end of the academic year.

""I am determined to do everything I can to get all children back in school from September, and we will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.

Morrison said that while the threat wasn’t new, the frequency of the attacks had been increasing over many months and he urged all organizations to improve their cyber resilience.
He didn’t reveal the source of the attacks, but said that there weren’t many “state-based actors” that could engage in such activities. Morrison said the issue was constantly raised with Five Eyes intelligence partners and that he briefed U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the matter last night.
“This activity is targeting Australian organizations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure,” Morrison said. “We know it is a sophisticated state-based cyber actor because of the scale and nature of the targeting and the tradecraft used.”
Russia, China and North Korea are among nations that have in the past been accused of sponsoring or carrying out malicious cyber activity, including Russia’s efforts to disrupt U.S. elections. China last year rejected speculation that it was behind an attack on Australia’s Parliament House that breached the systems of the nation’s major political parties.
Australia’s main internet site that provides online access to government services was hit by a cyber attack in March.
During the press conference, Morrison was asked how he would respond to speculation that China could be behind the recent rise in attacks, particularly in light of escalating tensions between the two nations.
“The Australian government is not making any public attribution about these matters,” he said, and also declined to reveal whether the government actually knows the source of the attack.
Morrison said there had been no large scale personal data breaches as a result of the attacks.

David Stilwell, who spoke after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii on Wednesday, told reporters the next couple of weeks would show whether the talks were productive.
""The PRC (People’s Republic of China) side could not be described as really forthcoming,” said Stilwell.
""Whether or not (they) were productive … look at what comes up in the next couple of weeks. Do we see a reduction in aggressive behavior or not?""
At the same time, China did commit to following through on phase one of a trade agreement reached with the United States this year, Stilwell said, adding that trade would be a good acid test as to whether Beijing was a cooperative partner.
Stilwell said recent Chinese actions, over India, in the South China Sea and over Hong Kong had not been constructive. He said Washington looked forward to seeing China reconsider plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong.
The world's two largest economies have been at loggerheads over multiple issues and ties have dipped to what many experts see as their lowest ebb in decades in recent months as the coronavirus pandemic that began in China hit the United States hard.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump who has made rebalancing trade with China a top priority, renewed a threat to cut ties with Beijing.

China's foreign ministry said Yang told Pompeo that Washington needs to respect Beijing's positions on key issues, halt its interference on matters such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang, and work to repair relations.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dana Kopel testified that New York City police kicked her in the jaw and bound her wrists so tightly with zipties her hands turned blue, leaving one hand numb with nerve damage weeks after she marched through the Bronx to protest the killing of George Floyd. 
Jeffrey Castillo displayed cuts on his knees, bruises on his arms and a scar on his shoulder he said was caused after six officers knocked him off his bike while he chanted against police violence in Manhattan's West Village.
One by one, some of the protesters who have filled city streets since Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody in May described being injured by New York Police Department officers at a virtual public hearing called by state Attorney General Letitia James, which spilled into a second day on Thursday.
Michael Sternfeld said police knocked him and other protesters to the ground while chasing them out of a Brooklyn park on June 3 for defying an 8 p.m curfew, scenes that were captured in cellphone videos. 
""Shame on you, to all the NYPD, for acting like childish bullies, a gang of cowards with weapons and shields to hide behind and badges to justify their action,"" Sternfeld told the hearing, which was streamed online because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
New York Mayor Bill De Blasio and Police Commissioner Dermot Shea have defended the NYPD's response to protesters as mostly proportionate, saying misconduct was limited to isolated cases that were being investigated. 
Both have pointed to several nights of looting that marked some of the earlier protests, widespread property damage and instances of protesters hurling projectiles at police officers, injuring them.
In late May, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was alarmed by ""disturbing violent clashes"" between NYPD officers and protesters, and appointed James to investigate and produce a report within 30 days. 
The hearing was a chance for protesters to share their anger with investigators at their treatment by police during protests that have become daily occurrences in New York and dozens of other cities after Floyd's death.
James said she had received hundreds of written submissions from protesters and cellphone videos of armored police hitting people with batons and pepper spray. 
Elected officials and civil rights groups also testified, the majority criticizing what they described as mostly unprovoked police aggression.
James said the NYPD and the Mayor's office declined multiple invitations to participate in the public hearing.
The NYPD said in a statement it received no ""formal invitation"" to join but was cooperating with the investigation. The mayor's office did not respond to a request for comment.
One officer, Vincent D'Andraia, was arrested and charged with assault after he was seen in videos calling Dounya Zayer, a protester in Brooklyn, a ""bitch"" before violently pushing her down, her head hitting the tarmac. He has pleaded not guilty. 
Zayer testified that she suffered a seizure a few minutes later and protesters helped her get to a hospital while scores of officers walking by ignored her plight.
After her testimony, James appeared onscreen again to thank her, saying: ""I just want you to know that the officers involved fortunately really don't reflect the vast majority of the officers of the NYPD.""

Zayer replied with visible anger: ""Thank you for your sympathy, but I don't want to hear that there are good cops when not a single good cop helped me and I'm afraid to even leave my house now.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson told France's President Emmanuel Macron that talks on a post Brexit deal cannot drag on into the autumn, as the French leader visited London to mark the 80th anniversary of General de Gaulle's call for wartime resistance, 
Macron's first trip outside France since the coronavirus pandemic highlighted the new rules of socially-distant diplomacy as the normally tactile pair posed two metres apart for photos.
The main focus for Macron was to mark De Gaulle's ""Appel"" of June 18, 1940, a radio address he made to the French nation from BBC headquarters in London calling for resistance to the Nazi occupation of France during World War Two.
However, Macron and Johnson also held wide-ranging talks agreeing on the need for a global response to the coronavirus crisis, and condemning China's new security laws in Hong Kong.
But with less than six months until a Brexit transition arrangement expires, slow-moving trade talks with the EU inevitably featured prominently.
""(Johnson) underlined that the UK does not believe it makes sense for there to be prolonged negotiations into the autumn,"" his office said.
Macron told Johnson France still supports reaching a deal.
Britain left the European Union on Jan. 31 but talks have so far made little progress. Johnson and EU leaders say a deal is achievable, but both sides say time is running out and the prospect of a no-deal outcome remains.
The French President was welcomed by a guard of honour as he was greeted by Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife Camilla at their Clarence House home.
They then laid wreaths at a statue to De Gaulle, while Macron also placed tributes at memorials to Queen Elizabeth's parents, George VI, king during the war, and his wife also called Elizabeth.
The queen spoke to Macron over the phone during his visit, and Johnson later watched a flypast by British and French aerobatic teams with their red, white and blue vapour trails.
Macron bestowed the Legion d'Honneur, France's highest distinction, on London in recognition of the city providing a base for De Gaulle, while Britain has honoured four French Resistance fighters: Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100; Daniel Cordier, 99; Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98. 
""That night, De Gaulle became the voice and the breath of Free France,"" Macron said of the ""Appel"".
""He raised the flame of the resistance higher than a beacon, so that its ray of hope, from the banks of the Thames, shine over the land of France. The man who would carry the destiny of a breathless country. From London. Thanks to London.""

Thursday's occasion poignantly coincided with the death of singer Vera Lynn at the age of 103, whose songs became symbols of hope in Britain during World War Two.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - U.S. civil rights leader Jesse Jackson has written Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte asking him to end the use of the pre-Christmas character ""Black Pete,"" which Jackson called a racist relic of colonialism.
""I am writing to urge you to heed your moral conscience and do what you believe and know to be right,"" Jackson wrote to Rutte in a letter sent via the Dutch Embassy in Washington that was received in The Hague on Thursday.
The debate about Black Pete has gained momentum in the Netherlands in recent weeks as tens of thousands of anti-racism demonstrators protested the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and discrimination at home.
In the Dutch tradition, St. Nicholas arrives on Dec. 5 bringing gifts to children accompanied by numerous ""Petes"", clownish servants usually portrayed by white people in black face paint wearing frizzy wigs and red lipstick.
Rutte said in 2013 that ""Black Pete is just black and I can't do much about that"". But this month, he said his attitude had undergone ""great changes"" after meeting people, including ""small children, who said: 'I feel terribly discriminated (against) because Pete is black'.""
The prime minister added his government was not planning any legal action on the matter, but that ""I expect in a few years there will be no more Black Petes.""
Rutte's office confirmed it had received the letter, but had no additional comment.
Supporters argue that Black Pete is not meant to portray black skin colour, but chimney soot. Several large Dutch cities have replaced Black Pete with ""rainbow"" Petes in recent years, but the practice is still widespread.
""Black Pete cannot be separated from the very offensive tradition of black face in the United States. The December 5 tradition of Black Pete is seen as an offensive relic of colonial times,"" Jackson wrote.

""I believe with your moral leadership the good people of the Netherlands will respond positively to ban the offensive and racist Black Pete, for good. The whole world is watching,"" he said.

France, Britain and Germany, all parties to Iran's nuclear deal with major powers, have submitted a draft resolution to the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors calling on Iran to stop denying the agency access to two old sites and to cooperate fully with it, diplomats taking part in the virtual meeting said. 
The board prefers to adopt resolutions by consensus, meaning without a vote as long as no one opposes. 
Diplomats said Iran's ally Russia told the board it saw no need for a resolution but China voiced clear opposition, prompting the board's chairwoman to call an in-person meeting on Friday for further discussions and possibly a vote.
""Certain countries, while pushing ahead the draft resolution, have denied the peril of such a move. This is a classic case in point of an ostrich policy, totally irresponsible,"" China said in a statement to the board earlier on Thursday.
If passed, the resolution would raise pressure on Iran to let inspectors into the two sites where the IAEA suspects activities potentially related to developing nuclear weapons were carried out in the early 2000s, long before the deal.
The sites could, however, still host undeclared nuclear material or traces of it, which it is the IAEA's job to track down. The IAEA and U.S. intelligence services believe Iran had a coordinated nuclear weapons programme until 2003.
China said pressing what it called a ""non-urgent"" issue with a resolution could eventually lead to action by the U.N. Security Council and ""the ultimate termination"" of the deal, known officially as the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Comprehensive Plan of Action.

Daniel Guggenheim of Switzerland and Jose Alburqueque of Brazil were kidnapped on March 16 by a group of dissident members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which officially demobilized more than three years ago, the government said in a statement. 
The two foreigners had been kidnapped by members of the FARC's former sixth front, known as the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column, who had demanded $1 million for their release.
""With this result a total of six people have been freed from the scourge of kidnapping at the hand of the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column,"" General Jorge Hoyos, of the Colombian army's third division, told journalists.
As well as the two foreigners, two dogs that had accompanied them during their kidnapping were freed. 
The FARC demobilized under a 2016 peace deal after more than five decades of conflict with the government, becoming a legal political party.
But several top commanders have rejected the accord and chosen either not to demobilize or to return to arms. The government considers the dissidents to be criminals without an ideological motivation unlike the traditional FARC. 
In January, Colombia's government asked the United States and the European Union to include FARC dissidents on their lists of terrorist organizations. 
The United States has offered rewards of up to $10 million each for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Seuxis Solarte and Luciano Marin - better known by their respective noms de guerre Jesus Santrich and Ivan Marquez - who are both former leaders of FARC.

SINGAPORE/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - In the days leading up to the most violent border clash between India and China in decades, China brought in pieces of machinery, cut a trail into a Himalayan mountainside and may have even dammed a river, satellite pictures suggest.
The images, shot on Tuesday, a day after soldiers engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the freezing Galwan Valley, show an increase in activity from a week earlier.
India said 20 soldiers were killed in a premeditated attack by Chinese troops on Monday night at a time when top commanders had agreed to defuse tensions on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), or the disputed and poorly defined border between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
China rejected the allegations and blamed frontline Indian soldiers for provoking the conflict which took place at the freezing height of 14,000 feet (4,300 metres) in the western Himalayas. 
The 4,056-km (2,520-mile) border between India and China runs through glaciers, snow deserts and rivers in the west to thickly forested mountains in the east. 
The Galwan Valley is an arid, inhospitable area, where some soldiers are deployed on steep ridges. It is considered important because it leads to the Aksai Chin, a disputed plateau claimed by India but controlled by China. 
The satellite pictures, taken by Earth-imaging company Planet Labs and obtained by Reuters, show signs of altering the landscape of the valley through widening tracks, moving earth and making river crossings, one expert said.
The images shows machinery along the bald mountains and in the Galwan River.
""Looking at it in Planet, it looks like China is constructing roads in the valley and possibly damming the river,"" Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at California’s Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
""There are a ton of vehicles on both sides (of the LAC) - although there appear to be vastly more on the Chinese side. I count 30-40 Indian vehicles and well over 100 vehicles on the Chinese side.""
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said he was unaware of the specifics on the ground but reiterated that the Indian army had crossed into Chinese territory in several places in recent days and that they should withdraw.
BACKLASH
The clash was the most serious since 1967. Since early May, soldiers have faced off on the border where India says Chinese troops had intruded and set up temporary structures. The confrontation turned into a deadly brawl on Monday. 
The fighting was triggered by a row over two Chinese tents and observation towers that India said had been built on its side of the LAC, Indian government sources in New Delhi and on the Indian side of the border in the Ladakh region said.
China had sought to erect a ""structure"" in the Galwan Valley on India's side of the LAC even after military officials had reached an agreement on June 6 to de-escalate, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told China's senior diplomat, Wang Yi, in a phone call on Wednesday, the Indian Foreign Ministry said. It was not immediately clear to what structure he was referring.
The problem arose when an Indian patrol visited the area near a ridge to verify a Chinese assertion that its troops had moved back from the LAC, the two government sources aware of the military situation said. 
The Chinese troops had thinned out and left behind the two tents and small observation posts. The Indian party demolished the towers and burnt the tents, the sources said.
The satellite images show possible debris from the observation posts on Tuesday morning on a ridge on India's side of the LAC. There was no such structure in the image taken a week earlier.
A large group of Chinese soldiers arrived and confronted the Indian troops, led by Colonel Santosh Babu. They were lightly armed in line with the rules of engagement at the LAC, one of the sources said.
India and China have not exchanged gunfire at the border since 1967, despite occasional flare-ups. Soldiers are under instructions to keep their rifles slung at their backs.
It was not clear what happened next, but the two sides soon clashed, with the Chinese using iron rods and batons with spikes, one of the sources said.
Colonel Babu was one of the 20 victims, they said. More Indian troops were rushed in and the confrontation turned into an hours-long brawl eventually involving up to 900 soldiers, the source said. Still no shots were fired on either side.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao rejected the Indian version of the events. ""The rights and wrongs of this incident are very clear. The responsibility does not lie with China.""

The Romanian parliament approved the ban without public debate this week in the latest initiative by religious and conservative groups to adopt similar policies on gender to neighbouring Hungary and Poland.
Romania is one of the only European Union states that bars both marriage and civil partnerships for same sex couples.
Centrist President Klaus Iohannis suggested on Thursday he would send the ban, which would enforce fines of up to 50,000 lei ($11,578) for teaching gender identity, back to parliament.

""I no longer want stereotypical gender roles to be promoted,"" 26-year-old Andra told Reuters.
Opposition senator Vasile Cristian Lungu, one of those behind the ban told Reuters that gender identity was ""an academic falsehood"".

""This bill wants to remove us from public space,"" said Luca, a 24-year-old LGBTI activist who helped organise the protest. ""We must show that we exist and that we cannot ... be erased.""

293,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>","Jean Kennedy Smith, last surviving sibling of JFK, is dead at 92","By Peter Cooney
(Reuters) - Jean Kennedy Smith, the last surviving sibling of slain President John F. Kennedy, who as U.S. ambassador to Ireland in the 1990s played a pivotal role in the Northern Irish peace process, died on Wednesday at age 92.
Kennedy Smith died at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Kym told Reuters, declining give a cause of death ""to keep it private.""
The eighth of nine children born to Joseph and Rose Kennedy, Kennedy Smith was labeled ""the shy Kennedy,"" long finding herself in the shadow of her famous father and brothers, including U.S. Senators Robert and Edward Kennedy.
Her husband, Stephen Smith, was himself a trusted adviser who helped run the Kennedy family's business interests, played a senior role in John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and managed the presidential runs of Robert and Edward.
Kennedy Smith also played family matchmaker, introducing Robert in 1945 to her Manhattanville College classmate Ethel Skakel, whom he later married.
She got her introduction to politics helping with John's 1946 campaign for Congress. In 1960, by then a wife and mother, Kennedy Smith traveled the country campaigning for him ahead of his narrow victory over Republican Vice President Richard Nixon to become America's first Catholic president.
John F. Kennedy's presidency ended tragically with his assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas. Five years later, Kennedy Smith and her husband were at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles when Bobby, two years her senior, was gunned down after winning the California Democratic presidential primary.
Like the rest of her family, Kennedy Smith had already been no stranger to tragedy. Born on Feb. 20, 1928, in Brookline, Massachusetts, she was just 16 when her oldest brother, Joseph Kennedy Jr., was killed in World War Two. Four years later, her older sister Kathleen ""Kick"" Kennedy died in a plane crash.
She married Smith in 1956 and they settled in New York, where they raised four children. Her husband died of lung cancer in 1990 at age 63. A year later, she was in attendance in Florida at the rape trial of her son William Kennedy Smith, who was acquitted in a heavily publicized case that cast a darker light on the family once considered American royalty.
Kennedy Smith also helped care for brother Ted before he died of brain cancer in August 2009, just two weeks after the death of their older sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver.
""It's the philosophy of our family that you keep moving,"" Kennedy Smith told USA Today in a 2010 interview, reflecting on her family losses. ""You have to do things and look at the bright side of life — and remember them with love.""
STEPPING OUT OF THE SHADOWS 
Kennedy Smith made her own leap into the spotlight in 1993 when she became U.S. ambassador to Ireland, 30 years after accompanying brother Jack on his triumphant visit to their family's ancestral homeland. Nominated by President Bill Clinton at the suggestion of her brother Edward, she was determined to use the Dublin post, traditionally a sinecure for retired Irish-American politicians or business leaders, to advance the cause of peace in Northern Ireland.
Washington had long deferred to close ally London on efforts to end decades of sectarian violence in the North. But acting on signals that the Irish Republican Army was open to discussions about abandoning its armed struggle to end British rule in Northern Ireland, Kennedy Smith helped spearhead an Irish government-backed effort to secure a U.S. visa for Gerry Adams, the head of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing.
Despite fierce opposition from the UK government, Northern unionists loyal to Britain, and even many U.S. officials, Kennedy Smith enlisted the support of brother Edward in persuading Clinton to approve the visa in early 1994. A year later, the IRA declared a ceasefire, leading to negotiations that culminated in the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement that largely ended three decades of violence that killed more than 3,600 people.
While Kennedy's five-year tenure in Dublin attracted its share of criticism, she won recognition from all corners as a catalyst for change. Irish journalist Tim Pat Coogan, who has written extensively about the IRA, said Kennedy Smith helped ""change Irish history for the better."" 
""Her courageous and determined diplomacy helped to bring peace to our island, built bridges, opened doors to all communities, and to all those striving for peace when peace was not a certainty,"" Leo Varadkar, the prime minister of Ireland, said in a statement on Thursday.
She was awarded honorary Irish citizenship in 1998 for her efforts and told the Washington Post: ""I was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time.""
For her diplomatic and philanthropic work, including founding Very Special Arts, an organization for the developmentally disabled, Kennedy Smith in 2011 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest U.S. civilian honor, by President Barack Obama. In 2016, she published her memoir, ""The Nine of Us,"" about growing up in one of America's most famous families.
""We all pitched in for each other. That's the way we were growing up, and that's the way we went into history,"" Kennedy Smith told Parade magazine. ""We were always together. Our best friends were our brothers and sisters.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Western powers are backing the Afghan government's refusal to free hundreds of prisoners accused of some of Afghanistan's most violent attacks, a release demanded by the Taliban as a condition to start peace talks, five sources told Reuters.
The issue is a final major sticking point which, if resolved, is expected to lead quickly to intra-Afghan peace negotiations in Qatar aimed at ending more than 18 years of war in a U.S.-brokered peace process.
""The contentious part right now is the prisoners issue,"" a senior government source told Reuters. Two European diplomats, an Asian diplomat and another Afghan official confirmed his account.
""There are some dangerous Taliban fighters named in the list, and releasing them is literally crossing a red line,"" said a senior European diplomat. ""Some NATO members find it extremely uncomfortable to support the release of Taliban prisoners who were behind large-scale suicide attacks on minority groups and on expats.""
The Taliban struck a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in February to pave the way for talks with the Afghan government. But the insurgent group insisted a list of 5,000 prisoners be released, leading to months of delay as the Afghan government initially refused to set free that many prisoners before talks.
All prisoners walking free, including those accused of killing many civilians in some of Afghanistan's bloodiest attacks, would give the impression the insurgent group had the upper hand over the government while negotiations get under way, the sources said.
They spoke on condition of anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter. 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Thursday the group still insisted that all 5,000 be released so peace talks could begin.
The Afghan government in recent weeks released around 3,000 of the prisoners and is prepared to set free all but a few hundred, government sources said. The Taliban has also released hundreds of prisoners.
The U.S. embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to a request for comment. One Afghan security source and one diplomatic source told Reuters the United States had also expressed reservations about releasing some of the group that NATO and the Afghan government were objecting to setting free.
Included in that group were prisoners involved in large-scale attacks, such as the 2017 truck bombing near Germany's embassy in Kabul, which killed more than 150, according to two sources. 
The Taliban denied high-profile attackers were on their list. 

""There are no such people on our prisoners list that the Kabul administration is saying, these are just excuses to create barriers against the peace process,"" Mujahid said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Bureau of Prisons riot teams that helped protect the White House during protests earlier this month injured employees by deploying flash bang grenades and pepper spray during exercises last year, the Justice Department's internal watchdog has found.
In a memo issued on Thursday, Inspector General Michael Horowitz said the two mock exercises by the BOP's Special Operations Response Teams (SORT) led to staff injuries and represented ""potential policy violations and dangerous conduct"" by the corrections officers involved.
The report is likely to raise new questions about the conduct of the BOP's riot team, one of the federal law enforcement agencies on the scene in Washington on June 1 when officers fired smoke canisters, flash bang grenades and rubber bullets to drive protesters farther from the White House, enabling a photo shoot by President Donald Trump in front of a damaged church.
In the first incident, the team deployed an unauthorized flash bang round that hit a staff member and detonated, causing ""significant injury requiring surgery and ongoing treatment,"" the report said.
In the second case, the SORT team used crow bars to breach a room where there were staff members on restricted duty due to medical conditions. Despite verbal warnings, the SORT team shot pepper spray and struck a staffer in the chest with a training round, according to the report, leading to pushing and shoving between the two groups.
A BOP spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attorney General William Barr has defended the decision to push Washington protesters back, claiming that protesters had thrown objects at police and refused orders to move. However, neither Reuters witnesses nor protesters interviewed by Reuters ever heard such warnings or saw projectiles being thrown at the time.

Security Council on Thursday, defeating Djibouti in a second-round of voting by the 193-member General Assembly after an initial ballot failed to produce a clear winner. 
Mexico, India, Ireland, Norway - who were elected on Wednesday - and Kenya will take up their two-year terms on the 15-member council on Jan. 1, 2021. Mexico and India were elected unopposed, while Ireland and Norway beat Canada.
To ensure geographical representation, seats are allocated to regional groups. All candidates need to win the support of more than two-thirds of the General Assembly to be elected. Neither Kenya or Djibouti achieved that during the first round of voting. 
After operating virtually since March amid the coronavirus pandemic, diplomats - wearing masks and social distancing - returned to the General Assembly hall on Wednesday and Thursday to cast their secret ballots at allotted times.

297,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 01:36PM ET</span>",At least 13 killed in landslide in Ivory Coast's main city,"ABIDJAN (Reuters) - A landslide on the outskirts of Ivory Coast's main city of Abidjan in the early hours of Thursday caused by heavy rains killed at least 13 people, the defence minister said.
The landslide occurred on the northern outskirts of Abidjan, where some neighbourhoods saw more than three times as much rain between June 12 and 15 than is usual, according to Ivory Coast's weather service.
""The provisional toll is 13 dead,"" defence minister Hamed Bakayoko told journalists.
Amidou Sylla, mayor of Anyama, told Reuters the death toll was set to rise. 
""The toll could get higher with ongoing search. We could have at least 20 dead as a result of the landslides because there are still a lot of houses to explore,"" Sylla said.
Landslides and deadly floods are common in Abidjan during the rainy season, which runs from April to the end of October, routinely costing lives in informal settlements built into eroding hillsides. 
There were heavy downpours in other parts of the country as well this week, raising concerns they could damage crops in the world's top cocoa producer.
Farmers in the western region of Soubre, at the heart of the Ivorian cocoa belt, said the rains were so heavy they fear the torrents could pluck off young pods and flowers from trees. This could reduce crop output in August and September.
They added that harvested beans could become mouldy in the coming week as the weather remained cloudy, making it difficult to dry their beans properly because of lack of sunshine.
""The rains are a bit heavy,"" said Salame Kone, who farms near Soubre, adding that if it continues, farms could become flooded. 

Data collected by Reuters showed rainfall in Soubre was 229.3 millimetres in the week to Wednesday, 175.2 mm above the five-year average.

""We want to prevent not being able to follow the contacts of those who are infected ... so we need to react immediately where it is needed, primarily on our borders,"" Health Minister Tomaz Gantar told a news conference.
The government could also increase restrictions inside the country if the virus continues to spread, he added. In May Slovenia became the first European country to declare an end to its coronavirus outbreak, although some restrictions remain in place.
Earlier on Thursday, Slovenia reported eight new cases, the highest daily number of new infections since April 29. Most cases over the past two weeks have been imported from abroad or through contacts with people coming from abroad. So far the country has confirmed a total of 1,511 cases and 109 deaths.

The Judicial Court of the Province of Gaza on Thursday handed the six policemen sentences of between three and 24 years for their involvement in the murder, while a seventh accused, a civilian, was acquitted.
The court also ordered the six to pay compensation of 1.5 million meticais ($22,000) to Matavel's family.

Seuxis Hernandez and Luciano Marin, best known by their respective noms de guerre Jesus Santrich and Ivan Marquez, had originally supported the 2016 peace accord between Colombia's government and the Marxist-led Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). But both later rejected the deal.
The two ""have a long history of involvement in drug trafficking activities, which resulted in their criminal indictments,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
The Colombian government, in a separate statement, said the capture of the men would contribute to the stability of the peace process.
Marquez, a FARC commander who was one of the negotiators of the peace accord, disappeared in 2018 after his nephew was arrested and bundled off to the United States.
Santrich had been set to serve in one of 10 congressional seats granted to former rebels under the deal. But he was indicted by the United States for drug trafficking that allegedly occurred in 2017, after the peace deal. The indictment sparked months of legal wrangling, including his arrest, before he too disappeared in mid-2019.
Both men reappeared in August 2019 in a video they said was filmed in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) announcing a new offensive against the government.
The announcement was condemned at the time by President Ivan Duque's government, the United Nations and the FARC political party, whose leadership said the majority of former rebels remain committed to peace.
Implementation of the accord has been hampered by the murder of hundreds of former guerrillas and human rights activists. Delays in funding to create more economic opportunities for former combatants have also set back the peace process amid deep political polarization in the South American country.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's top court rejected most of a draft law that would have compelled social media giants such as Facebook (O:FB) and Twitter  to remove any hateful content within 24 hours, it said on Thursday. 
The ruling by the Constitutional Council, which said the law interferes excessively in free speech, is a setback for President Emmanuel Macron. He has vowed to make France a leader in containing the spread of illicit content and false information on the most used platforms. 
The bill was approved by France's lower chamber last July but still had to be cleared by the Constitional Council. 
Under the draft law, social media groups would have faced fines up to 4% of their global revenues for failing to remove within a day ""clearly illicit"" content related to race, gender, religion, sexual orientation or disability. 
Several freedom of speech advocacy groups had argued the bill could pave the way for state censorship because it does not clearly define illicit content. 
""(These measures) undermine the exercise of freedom of expression and communication in a manner that is unnecessary, inappropriate and disproportionate,"" the court said.
The court, which is the French equivalent of the U.S. Supreme Court, cited the 1789 ""Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen"" that is the preamble to the constitution. 
It noted that the draft law currently stipulates the administration would have had the main role in deciding on illicit content, without any intervention from a judge. 
This could push social media companies to remove more online content than necessary for fear of being sanctioned, it said. The court also said the 24-hour time window was ""particularly brief"". 
The court also slapped down another provision of the draft law, under which any content deemed child pornography, or terrorist in nature, would have had to be removed within an hour.
Facebook and Twitter did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Britain left the EU on Jan. 31 but talks have so far made little headway on agreeing a new trade deal with the bloc by the time a status-quo transition arrangement ends in December.
""If we haven't secured significant progress by October, then it will be difficult,"" said Minister for the Cabinet Office Michael Gove, a Brexit supporter and one of the most influential members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. There was however no firm cut-off date, he added.
Talks have snagged on EU fishing access to British waters, British compliance with EU rules aimed at a level playing field and the customs arrangements for Northern Ireland. 
French President Emmanuel Macron is due to hold talks with Johnson in London on Thursday.
""We've agreed on both sides to energise and intensify the talks,"" British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told LBC radio. ""We don't want to hang around - we're not going to wait for this to be dragged out into the autumn and the winter."" 
Any deal would require ratification by both sides - a process which could take several months in the 27-member EU.
Gove said he did not expect businesses in Northern Ireland to face higher import costs as a result of Brexit and that import declarations would not be required for goods going from Britain to Northern Ireland.
Asked whether those sending goods to Northern Ireland from Britain would have to submit entry summary declarations, Gove declined to answer directly.
""There will be some new safety and security information,"" he said, adding that more details would be given in the summer. ""We are seeking to minimise the overall burden on business."" 

Previously the government has said that entry summary declarations and import declarations would be required for such movement of goods.

At least 14 MiG-29s and several Su-24s were flown to Libya via Syria, where their Russian markings had been painted over, AFRICOM said in May.
AFRICOM said in a statement on Thursday it had photographic evidence of a Russian aircraft taking off from Jufra in central Libya, and that a MiG-29 was photographed operating in the vicinity of the city of Sirte.
The Russian defence ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Sirte and Jufra are on the dividing line between areas in western Libya controlled by groups loyal to the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) and eastern areas controlled by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
The LNA has retreated eastwards in recent weeks after a 14-month offensive on the capital, Tripoli, though it is holding the line around Sirte and still controls Jufra air base. 
The Russian aircraft were being used to support private military companies (PMCs) sponsored by the Russian government, AFRICOM said.
""There is concern these Russian aircraft are being flown by inexperienced, non-state PMC mercenaries who will not adhere to international law; namely, they are not bound by the traditional laws of armed conflict,"" said Bradford Gering, AFRICOM's director of operations.
""Russia continues to push for a strategic foothold on NATO's southern flank and this is at the expense of innocent Libyan lives,"" he said.
Libya's conflict has seen growing involvement by foreign powers that have poured weapons into the country in violation of a U.N. arms embargo.
Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have backed the LNA, while GNA forces are supported by Turkey.

WARSAW/BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union leaders will try to narrow their differences over a coronavirus economic recovery plan at a summit on Friday, worried that further bickering and delay will only dent public confidence in the bloc as a deep downturn takes hold.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU, reeling from more than 100,000 deaths linked to COVID-19 and facing its worst recession since World War Two, urgently needed an agreement on its multi-year budget and a multi-billion-euro recovery fund.
""The pandemic has revealed how fragile the European project still is,"" Merkel told parliament in Berlin, lamenting the ""rather national and not European"" initial response to the pandemic by EU governments, including her own. 
Leaders of the EU's 27 member states will meet by video-conference on Friday in what is expected to be only a first step towards a consensus on a joint economic rescue that has so far been a tug-of-war between fiscally conservative northern countries and a high-debt ""Club Med"" group of southerners.
Financial markets have factored in a deal coming together thanks to conciliatory language on both sides, but diplomats said on Thursday that another summit - or even two - may be needed next month to get it across the line.
The leaders will discuss a proposal made by the European Commission, the EU's executive, to borrow 750 billion euros (£674 billion) from the market to help revive economies hardest hit by the pandemic, notably Italy and Spain.
They will also debate a proposal to set the bloc's EU budget for 2021-27 at 1.1 trillion euros, returning to an issue that kept them arguing through the night at a summit in February.
SENSE OF URGENCY
Diplomats said the coronavirus crisis that erupted after that meeting has brought a sense of urgency across Europe.
The pandemic struck as the bloc struggled with other big challenges, from finding a common strategy to counter China's economic rise to dealing with a hostile U.S. administration. 
""The EU needs to send a strong signal that it is ready to act decisively before the expected wave of discontent with the economic malaise hits this autumn,"" said a senior EU diplomat.
""We would like to reach consensus in July. Come this autumn, the effects of the economic stagnation will be increasingly visible, including in the streets of EU cities. We must send a signal that the EU is acting to fix this.""
The Commission has suggested that two-thirds of the recovery funds be disbursed in grants and one-third as loans. 
The Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden and Austria, dubbed ""the Frugal Four"", say the fund is too large and want it used only as loans, since grants would have to be repaid by all EU taxpayers.
""It's such a complex debate, that it will be difficult to find a way out in coming weeks, if at all,"" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutter told parliament in The Hague on Wednesday.
""But eventually you will need to aim for a compromise, because there are the bigger interests ... to avoid that Europe, the European Union, as an important guardian of security and stability in the world, come out of this weaker.""

He said that European solidarity needs to cut both ways and the countries benefiting from the recovery funds must push ahead with economic reforms in areas from the labour market to taxation and their legal systems.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council is considered a proposal to reopen a border crossing from Iraq into Syria for six months to allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to help millions of Syrian civilians combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The 15-member council in January allowed a six-year-long cross-border aid operation to continue from two places in Turkey until July 10, but dropped crossing points from Iraq and Jordan due to opposition by Syrian ally Russia and China.
Germany and Belgium gave the council a draft resolution on Wednesday that would extend approval for the Turkish border crossings for one year and reopen the Iraq crossing for six months. 
The draft text also gives the council an option to extend the approval for the Iraq crossing for another six months based on an evaluation of the impact of the coronavirus in Syria by U.N. chief Antonio Guterres later in the year.
In December Russia and China vetoed a draft resolution that would have authorized all three crossing points for one year. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to pass.
Western diplomats have said the closure of the Iraq crossing cuts off 40 percent of medical aid to northeastern Syria.
""Failure to renew cross-border aid will cause unnecessary suffering and deaths, and COVID-19 could spread like wildfire. Surely Russia can't want that,"" said Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director for Human Rights Watch. 
Last month U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft pushed the council to reauthorize aid deliveries from Iraq. However, Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said: ""Do not waste your time on efforts to reopen the closed cross-border points.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats introduced legislation on Thursday to block President Donald Trump's plan to remove 9,500 troops from close ally Germany by prohibiting funding for a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe without congressional approval.
Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Senator Bob Menendez, ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, introduced the bill, reflecting concern in Congress from Democrats as well as Trump's fellow Republicans about the plan to cut troops.
Trump said on Monday he would reduce the number of U.S. troops in Germany to 25,000, faulting Berlin for failing to meet NATO's defense spending target and accusing it of taking advantage of the United States on trade.
The troop reduction would be a remarkable rebuke to one of the closest U.S. trading partners and could erode faith in a pillar of postwar European security: that U.S. forces would defend alliance members against Russian aggression.
Under the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers, the Senate and House of Representatives - not the White House - control government spending.
Lawmakers often use their power of the purse to influence policy decisions, such as keeping the prison camp at Guantanamo Bay open by barring spending federal money to close it.
The bill would prohibit the use of funds to withdraw or reduce the presence of U.S. armed forces in Europe unless the host government requests it, or the president declares the intent 180 days in advance, justifies the decision, Congress approves it and the secretaries of State and Defense testify about it.
""President Trump's disastrous decision to withdraw thousands of troops from and reduce the total force cap in Germany endangers our national security,"" Engel said in a statement.

""Our legislation will stop the Administration from carrying out this calamitous policy,"" he said.

YANGON (Reuters) - A Myanmar barbershop business is trimming costs and generating cash amid concerns about the coronavirus, offering a salon on wheels to cautious customers who want their cuts away from crowded places.
The truck was launched a month ago by a group of entrepreneurs in Yangon, Myanmar's biggest city, who are targeting clients concerned about being indoors or in a public place, where infection risks are higher.
The truck has enough space to fit a sink, mirror, chair and a work surface for equipment and parks up outside the homes of customers who book in advance.
""People are afraid of going outside during this time,"" said client Kyaw Zin Htut.
""Even though this cannot ensure complete safety from infection, I am so happy with their home delivery service during this time.""
The stylist works with doors and windows open and two assistants disinfect the truck, clean the equipment and dispose of masks and gloves after each customer.
They have served an average 10-15 clients each day, who pay $3.60 for a cut. On quieter days, they also accept customers off the street. 
Supervisor Phyo Kyaw said the idea came from seeing demand from people desperate for a trim with many salons choosing to close amid social restrictions. Myanmar has reported 163 cases of the coronavirus and six deaths.
""We are confident that most people, especially those who don't dare to go outside like the elderly and children, will need our home delivery service,"" said Phyo Kyaw.

BERLIN (Reuters) - German federal prosecutors accused Russia on Thursday of ordering the killing of a former Chechen rebel in Berlin last summer and indicted a Russian man for the murder, which has severely strained diplomatic ties.
Investigators have gathered enough evidence to charge the man, identified only as Vadim K., with the murder as well as with the illegal possession of a weapon, the prosecutors said.
""The accused accepted the order from state authorities to kill. He either hoped for a financial reward or shared the motive of the order-givers to kill a political opponent and thereby retaliate for participating in previous conflicts with Russia,"" they said in a statement.
The dead man, identified in the statement as Tornike K., a Georgian citizen, was shot in a Berlin park last August as he headed to a mosque. His killer had been on a bicycle.
Russia has denied any connection with the killing. President Vladimir Putin has said the dead man was himself a killer who had carried out bloody acts on Russian soil and that Moscow's requests for his extradition had not been heeded.
Welcoming the prosecutors' move, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas called the killing an ""extraordinarily serious"" incident.
The Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador to make its position clear and Moscow understands that Berlin reserves the right to take further steps in this case, Maas added.
MORE SANCTIONS
Juergen Hardt, foreign policy coordinator of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives in parliament, said Berlin should mull further sanctions against Russia.
""As long as top Russian officials shield the perpetrators of the Tiergarten murder, the federal government must not shy away from sanctions. It must also win over our European partners for such a move,"" he told Reuters.
Germany expelled two members of the Russian embassy in December 2019 in connection with the case.
Last month, in a separate dispute, Germany's foreign ministry called in the Russian ambassador to complain about a 2015 hacking attack on the German parliament and said that possible sanctions were discussed against those responsible.
Russia has denied that its military intelligence was behind the cyber attack.

Germany expects European Union leaders this week to pave the way for an extension of EU sanctions against Russia over its involvement in the Ukraine crisis, a senior government official said on Thursday.

Helvey said that it was difficult to tell what North Korea would do in the coming days and weeks. 
North Korea on Tuesday blew up a joint liaison office set up in a border town in 2018 to foster better ties with South Korea after threatening action if defectors continued with a campaign of sending propaganda leaflets into the reclusive North.
Destruction of the building, closed since January due to coronavirus fears, represented a major setback to South Korean President Moon Jae-in's efforts to coax North Korea into cooperation. It also appeared to be a further blow to U.S. President Donald Trump's hopes of persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and open up to the world.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, on Wednesday criticized Moon for failing to implement a 2018 peace accord, saying Moon ""put his neck into the noose of pro-U.S. flunkeyism.""

Fabricio Queiroz, who worked with Senator Flavio Bolsonaro when he was a Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker, was arrested outside of Sao Paulo in a home owned by a personal lawyer for the Bolsonaro family, according to prosecutors.
Investigators sought Queiroz for questioning over more than 1.2 million reais ($230,000) in bank transactions in a suspected scheme to embezzle the salaries of phantom employees in the Rio state assembly. 
The senator has denied any wrongdoing and called the investigation a political attack on his family.
""I face today's events with tranquility. The truth will prevail!"" Senator Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter after the arrest of Queiroz. ""Another piece on the playing board was moved to attack Bolsonaro ... It's a brutal game!""
The presidential press office and the president's personal lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The right-wing president ran for office in 2018 pledging to get tough on crime and end decades of political corruption exposed by the record-breaking Car Wash graft investigation.
Former federal judge Sergio Moro, who oversaw that probe and joined Bolsonaro's government last year, quit in April and accused the president of meddling in police appointments for personal reasons, triggering a federal investigation.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said on Thursday he would reject European Union membership if Belgrade does not receive concessions in return for recognising Kosovo and dropping attempts to stop it joining the United Nations.
After meeting Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Vucic said no resolution of Serbia's future relationship with its former province would be possible without Moscow's consent. 
""In reply to a possible offer (to Serbia) to recognise Kosovo and that Kosovo enters the UN, and we receive nothing in return, except EU membership, our answer would be 'no',"" Vucic said. 
Serbia, which is in talks to join the EU, has set a number of preconditions for normalising ties with Kosovo, including the establishment of an association of predominantly Serb municipalities and special status for medieval Serbian Orthodox Christian churches and monasteries. 
It also wants to regulate outstanding problems, including issues related to energy and finances.
Kosovo, where Albanians account for 90% of the population, declared independence from Belgrade in 2008, nearly a decade after NATO bombed Serbia to halt the killing and expulsion of Albanians in Kosovo during a two-year counter-insurgency. 
Serbia, with allies Russia and China, has been blocking Kosovo's membership of international organisations, including the United Nations. 
Lavrov's visit comes three days ahead of elections in Serbia and is widely seen as a sign of support for Vucic in the ballot.
Lavrov said the Kremlin would only support solutions to the Kosovo question acceptable to Belgrade and approved by the UN Security Council, where Russia has a veto. 
""We believe that forcing the co-called final normalisation, hastening it through any artificial deadlines, would be counterproductive,"" he said. 

Vucic is scheduled to attend a Red Square parade on June 24 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. He will meet President Vladimir Putin, who has visited Serbia twice since 2012.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Seven suspects accused of taking 2.3 billion rand ($132.43 million) from VBS Mutual bank in 2018 said they would plead not guilty to 47 counts of fraud, theft, corruption and racketering when they appeared in a South African court on Thursday.
The National Prosecuting Authority has called it probably the biggest bank robbery in South Africa's history.
An eighth suspect did not appear because he was under COVID-19 quarantine.
The suspects, all arrested on Wednesday, include former VBS executives, a former partner of KPMG South Africa - the firm which audited the bank and reported the partner to the police - an ex-police officer and a former state pension fund executive.
""All the accused acquired or maintained, directly or indirectly, an interest in or control of the enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activities,"" read the charge sheet document in court.
""To hide the crime of theft, misrepresentations were made to the Registrar and/or shareholders.""
The court set bail at 100,000 rand.
VBS was a little known lender until it gained notoriety in 2016 for providing a 7.8 million rand ($660,000) loan to former president Jacob Zuma to reimburse the state for upgrades to his personal home including a swimming pool and amphitheatre.

The 2.3 billion rand that went missing from VBS included cash from sizeable short term deposits by municipalities, and some 50 people were thought to be involved in the swindle, the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation said on Wednesday.

Iyad al-Halaq, 32, was on his way to volunteer at a special needs school in Jerusalem's Old City on May 30 when police chased him and shot him dead, suspecting him of carrying a weapon. 
""The boy surrendered and he lay on the ground like a baby in his mother's womb,"" Kheiry al-Halaq said of his son, whom police said was found to be unarmed.
""They shed the blood of an innocent young man who did not experience much from this life ... he was one of God's weakest creatures,"" his mother, Rana al-Halaq, said from her son's bedroom, surrounded by his possessions and a poster of him. 
Police are investigating the shooting and two officers have given testimony, a police spokesman said. 
Both Floyd, 46, and Halaq were from communities that often complain of police brutality and racism. 
Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him on May 25. He was unarmed and his death has led to protests around the world.
Demonstrations for Halaq have been held in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv and Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, where protesters lit candles and chanted ""Palestinian lives matter"", in what they called an act of solidarity with African-Americans.
Palestinian artist Taqi Spateen has painted murals of Floyd and Halaq on a concrete wall Israel built through parts of the West Bank. The painting of Halaq is captioned, in English: ""Not only Floyd. Iyad Hallaq too"". 
""Both men were killed by the arrogance of racism,"" Spateen said. 
Halaq's killing drew condolences from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called it a ""tragedy"". 
Palestinians have long complained of heavy-handed tactics by police and troops using lethal force in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
The Israeli rights group B'Tselem says that of the 133 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces in 2019, 56 ""were not taking part in hostilities"" and 28 were minors. 
Salem Barahmeh, a Palestinian rights advocate in the West Bank city of Ramallah, said he believed Israeli police officers might be lightly punished for Halaq's death.

""But a proper charge? I don't have much hope,"" he said. ""It won't be the justice that Iyad al-Halaq deserves.""

321,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>",From Damascus to Berlin: A Reuters journalist's quest for family reunion,"By Riham Alkousaa
BERLIN (Reuters) - It was still dark in Damascus as I walked down the stairs, my new life contained in a red suitcase. My mother stood next to the taxi door praying for my safety. My father was silent, certain that he would never see me again.
I lowered the taxi window and waved to my parents until they disappeared, grieving over the separation but at the same time grateful to my exhausted old city, which had finally let me go.
I had become one of the 700,000 refugees who have fled Syria and its war without end to Germany, which offered shelter under a grey but generous sky.
Since that morning in September 2014, I've told many stories of refugees' attempts to make Germany more like a home by reuniting with their families here. As a journalist covering the biggest refugee crisis of the 21st century, I've reported about the waiting, the loneliness, the maze of the paperwork that torments the family reunification process.
This time, I am telling my story. 
A year after I left Syria for Germany at age 23, my parents and I tried in vain to meet in Lebanon, Algeria, Sudan, Iran and Malaysia – some of the countries that still offer visas to Syrians. But as descendants of Palestinian refugees in Syria with no formal Syrian or Palestinian citizenship or national passport, our chances to meet were very slim.
Since the moment I left Syria behind, my life has been a litany of moments meant to be shared: I missed my parents at my graduation from my postgraduate program at Columbia University in New York after President Trump imposed a travel ban on visitors from Syria. I missed them at my engagement party; when I moved to my first apartment in Berlin; and on every Ramadan, Eid, Christmas and New Year's Eve.
WhatsApp helped to create an illusion of contact and closeness. At the beginning, the first thing I saw on my phone in the morning were missed calls from my mother. Then she learned that she could send me voice messages through the app, and they became our morning routine. She would record them while she was having morning coffee with my father, and I would listen to them on my way to German-language school or to work. 
We also cherished our video calls, even though the slow internet in Syria would cut them short. But when the ones you love are seen only on the screens of your laptop or phone, they slowly become unreal, like your favorite childhood TV character: very familiar, but imaginary.
In Arabic, we call it ""ghurba,"" which has an unsatisfying translation of ""being a stranger in a foreign land."" It's trying to cook all your favorite dishes at once, just to reassure yourself that you can bring home back; it's the long Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) evening where tea is made in a cup, not the big pot your mother used to keep ready for you; it's dreading weekends with their empty hours slowly sneaking in on quiet Friday evenings.
Then I heard about a special resettlement program offered by Berlin's local government that offers a chance – a minuscule one, but a chance nonetheless – for Syrian and Iraqi families to reunite.
Migration has been one of the most divisive topics in Germany and Europe since Chancellor Angela Merkel decided in 2015 to open borders to more than 1 million people escaping war and persecution in the Middle East and beyond. Concerns about migration have fueled far-right parties across the continent and pushed European governments to shut their borders and seal a controversial deal with Turkey to control illegal migration. The number of asylum- seekers in Germany fell 72.5% between 2016, the year the deal was signed, and 2017.
For Syrians, even obtaining a visitor visa to Germany today is difficult because immigration authorities are sceptical that the travellers will return to the war-torn country. There are no government statistics on how many Syrians have been granted a short-stay visa in recent years because the German Foreign Ministry doesn't record the citizenship of applicants. But in 2019, the German Embassy in Beirut granted only 7,913 short-term visas, which would include all Lebanese applicants in addition to Syrians.
Only minors with ""recognized refugee"" status have the right to bring their parents and minor siblings to Germany. I was an adult when I applied for asylum five years ago and didn't qualify for a regular family reunification process.
But if an adult Syrian refugee – or an employed European Union citizen – promises to take care of all financial expenses of a family member, they can reunite in Germany through a special program for Syrian and Iraqi refugees. The resettlement scheme offers two years' residence, with a work permit and public health insurance for family members.
The program was introduced in 2013 by many German states to resettle families of Syrian refugees whose asylum applications have been approved and already have recognized refugee status in Germany. It's renewed on an annual basis, and the decision to extend it is made by states' governments; out of 15 states that offered the program in 2014, only five of them have extended it for 2020.
To be eligible for the program, I had to have a stable job in Germany with long-term employment prospects and a minimum salary to demonstrate that the family member wouldn't end up being a drain on the system.
With language and skills barriers, meeting those conditions is challenging. In the six years ending in October 2019, only 1,098 people had benefited from the program in the state of Berlin, government data showed. Out of 459 applications submitted in 2019, 173 were approved.
Having a wage of at least of 2,300 euros a month after taxes is among the most challenging conditions.
""It's is not that easy to earn this amount when one has immigrated here recently,"" said Engelhard Mazanke, the head of Berlin's migration office.
At the beginning of my time in Berlin as an Arabic speaker in a country facing a wave of Arab refugees, I worked with American and German freelance journalists to tell the stories of the newcomers. While translating and talking to people at Berlin's asylum reception center, I thought that I could tell these stories on my own. But moving from being a ""fixer"" to a real journalist in a new language and a new country needed much more than I had expected.
It took four years, countless German classes, a master's degree from an Ivy League school, a few internships and a year-and-half training program until I got a job contract at Reuters and met the program's conditions.
But one condition was the hardest for me: A choice had to be made.
The Berlin migration official responsible for my case was clear that I must choose between my parents or one of my four siblings for the application. My brothers are still in school in the Syrian city of Homs, so waiting few more years to bring them here made sense. That meant either denying my sisters an opportunity to build a future in Germany or pushing my five-year separation with my parents longer, with no end in sight.
Weeks passed because I couldn't decide. Then a German friend of mine astounded me with an offer to help.
Pascale Mueller and I had met few years earlier when she needed help translating for a Syrian refugee family for a story for Tagesspiegel newspaper during the 2015 wave of migration. We hadn't seen each other for more than a year when she said she would act as a guarantor for one of my sisters.
I asked her to take some time before deciding, because the guarantor is financially responsible for the new arrival. If my sister claimed welfare or unemployment benefits, the government would send a bill to Pascale.
""Everyone I spoke with said, 'I wouldn't do it,' but I have a good feeling about this,"" Pascale said. A few weeks later we were at Berlin's migration office signing the papers.
When life decides to give you a break, it makes you feel that the doors that seemed shut might have not been closed in the first place. When another friend of mine, a Briton, heard of Pascale's unexpected help, he stepped in to guarantee my other sister. We needed to rush through the paperwork before Brexit happened and he was no longer a European Union citizen, but we also had to wait on the pay raise he had been promised. Each delay in Britain's parliament that pushed its parting from the EU further away gave my sister and me a bigger chance to reunite.
Finally, he was able to sign the papers.
Within weeks, I received an email from the German Embassy in Beirut asking my family for an interview. Because Germany pulled its diplomatic representation in Syria shortly after the uprising there in 2011, Syrians who apply for a German visa must be interviewed in one of the German embassies or consulates in Syria's neighboring countries. Lebanon was the closest and, theoretically, at least, the easiest to get in.
But like the complicated German sentence structure I have come to know so well, nothing was easy in this process. A simple appointment became a metaphor for the struggles, both bureaucratic and emotional, that the displaced face the world over.
First, my family had to leave Damascus before midnight for an 8:30 a.m. appointment in Beirut, although the trip only takes 3½ hours by road, because of a complicated entry process for Palestinian-Syrians to Lebanon. Then, at the appointment, they tried to hand over a document they'd been told to bring, but the employee said it wasn't required.
A few weeks later, the embassy called, asking for that same document. We could either pay a driver a fee that was half my father's monthly salary as a professor to take it to Lebanon or find someone to take it. We got lucky – the parents of a friend of mine were traveling to the consulate in Lebanon the next day for a visa interview through the same program.
But then our luck ran out again. After waiting a month for word of our application, we were asked to send the passports so ""an answer"" of yes or no could be stamped on the applications. This time we happily paid for a courier to take them to Beirut.
Then came the next delay: We were told there was a problem with my father's travel document, but the authorities didn't say what the problem was, exactly.
We called the embassy more than 100 times, with either no answer or a busy line. I tried a different emergency number dedicated for German citizens and was finally forwarded to someone who could answer my question. It turned out that the problem was my father's passport photo: The glasses he wore made his face unrecognizable. I understood the argument. But why wasn't this issue flagged when I had applied for the program with copies of the travel documents, or when my father was interviewed and his documents were checked at the embassy six weeks earlier? Why didn't the embassy simply phone us, asking for a new travel document?
""Due to the very high number of applications in some cases, not all details relevant for any specific applications may stand out at first glance when first filing the application,"" the German Foreign Ministry told me in an email.
We hired a driver, Abu Hisham, to take the passports to the embassy again after my mother received a second call few weeks later. But even that trip was fraught with potential disaster. With an empty car on the way back, he stopped to pick a man on the road, thinking that he needed a ride to Damascus. The man asked to stop for two friends of his, and they robbed Abu Hisham of all his money. But they left a brown envelope in the glove compartment that held the stamped passports.
Finally, more than six months after I applied for their resettlement, my parents were ready to fly to Germany. On a winter evening, I was at Berlin Tegel airport waiting for them to arrive. During normal times, a flight from Beirut to Berlin lands there every other evening, and Syrians are easily recognized at the arrivals' gate: reunions with excessively arranged bouquets, cute boys dressed in black suits and old men openly crying. Even security guards tear up and smile, although they must have seen the reunion scenes many times.

I cried and cried at my father's shoulder as he walked off the first flight he had ever taken, at age 59. I cried for all my lonely nights in Berlin, for the years that made him an old man while I became stronger, for our family home that had been pounded to ruins, for the life moments we hadn't spent together. After five years, we were a family once more.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The owner of a children's clothes shop in Hong Kong has refused a request from his landlord to remove a statue celebrating anti-government protests saying he wanted to teach children about democracy and he was not violating his lease agreement.
Pro-democracy protests that started a year ago have generated widespread enthusiastic support, as well as staunch opposition, in the Chinese-ruled city and there is growing concern businesses are coming under pressure to distance themselves from the movement.
The life-sized, white statue is of a silhouetted protester with a helmet, gas mask and goggles, holding an umbrella in one hand and a black flag reading ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times!"" in the other.
Herbert Chow, the 56-year-old owner of Chickeeduck, which has 13 shops across the former British colony, said he will meet the landlord on Friday to discuss the statue in one of his shops, and hoped to renew his lease, which expires this month. 
""The revolution that we need now is the persistent fight for ... the freedom of speech, press, expression and creativity, and not to have to put up with anything that you think is unjust,"" Chow told Reuters in his shop in a suburban mall.
Beijing and Hong Kong's government say the sometimes violent protests have hurt businesses and damaged the city's economy.
As Chow spoke, some shoppers shouted ""add oil"", a Cantonese-language expression of encouragement often heard at protests.
""We will not remove it,"" Chow said in response, referring to the statue.
In a letter circulated online and verified by Reuters, the landlord, Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Park Commercial Services Ltd, cited a contract clause that said decorations needed approval and holding ""an exhibition"" without a licence may be in breach of the law and going beyond the purpose of the tenancy. 
Discovery Park is a managing company for the shopping mall owned by New World Development, one of Hong Kong's biggest developers.
""We have a duty to keep smooth people flow, public safety and order and ensure that all activities on the premises comply with the law,"" the company said in a statement. 
""In the absence of a written approval from the mall, we have requested they remove the statue as soon as possible,"" it said.
Chow said the statue was ""a display item"" and could not be described as an exhibition as he was not earning money from it.
""I’ve never seen in 30 years of retail experience landlords choosing not to renew because of political reasons,"" he said.
""I think it's first class, nicely executed and aesthetically very suitable. I was actually going to do a tour with it in my stores.""
Many customers said they came to show their support, and give Chickeeduck their custom.

""I don’t want him to be suppressed,"" said Natalie Lau, 42, shopping for her 9-year-old daughter.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Thursday sentenced three men to life in imprison for their part in the assassination of a Pakistani political leader who was stabbed to death in London in 2010, a government prosecutor said.
Imran Farooq, 50, was a founding member of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) but had moved to London and had not been active in the party for about two years. He was on his way home from work in north London when he was attacked.
The three accused were members of the party. Their motives were unclear.
Besides their life sentences, the three were each fined 1 million Pakistani rupees ($6,050), the prosecutor, Khawaja Mohammad Imtiaz, told reporters. 
Britain gave Pakistan legal assistance, sharing evidence and having its officers testify at the trial, according Toby Cadman, counsel to a Pakistani government barrister, Toby Cadman.
Imtiaz said it was first trial of its kind in Pakistan. ""There are hardly any examples in the world that an offence is committed in one country and the trial is conducted in another,"" he said.
Farooq's death marked the start of cracks in the leadership of the MQM. The ethnic party, which held sway for decades in Pakistan's commercial capital, Karachi, later split into several factions.
The party represents Urdu-speaking migrants from India who settled in Pakistan after the partition of the subcontinent at the end of British rule in 1947.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's main rival has been detained for questioning in a crackdown on opponents before an Aug. 9 presidential election, lawyers for the detained candidate said on Thursday.
Lukashenko has allowed little dissent in the former Soviet republic since his rule began in 1994 but faces the biggest challenge to his authority in years, with thousands of people taking to the streets to support opposition candidates.
Viktor Babariko, widely seen as Lukashenko's main challenger in the election, had been taken in for questioning by police, his lawyers said. State television said he was being questioned, without citing a source. 
""According to the information we have, his car was stopped and he was delivered for what they call a conversation,"" lawyer Alexander Pylchenko told reporters. ""Actually this is a detention.""
Babariko's lawyers were not allowed into the building where he was taken and were not told of his legal status, they said.
""This is a flagrant violation of the constitutional right to defence,"" said one of his lawyers, Dmitry Loevsky. 
Babariko's election team said the authorities were also conducting a search at Babariko's house.
Public frustration with Lukashenko's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and grievances about the economy and human rights have reinvigorated opposition to his rule.
Babariko is a former head of the local unit of Russia's Gazprombank, whose offices were raided in June in a tax evasion and money laundering case. Belgazprombank has been taken into temporary administration and 15 employees have been detained.
Officials at the government's department for financial investigations were not immediately available for comment. 
Another election candidate said this week she was pressing on with her campaign despite receiving a threat to have her children taken away. 

Svetlana Tikhanouskaya decided to run after her husband, an anti-Lukashenko blogger, was arrested last month for threatening public order.

Singh, the first minority leader of a federal Canadian political party, was trying to secure support for a motion recognizing the existence of systemic racism in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).
When Bloc Québécois MP Alain Therrien refused to support the motion, Singh called him racist, prompting speaker Anthony Rota to kick Singh out for the rest of the day, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp reported.
Later, Singh told journalists he was angry during the moment and stood by what he said: ""In that moment, I saw the face of racism.""
The motion, which asks MPs to support a review of the RCMP's budget and other matters, comes as many Canadian cities have seen anti-racism rallies in recent weeks, on the heels of similar demonstrations in the United States. The U.S. rallies were triggered by the recent killing of a black man after a white policemen knelt on his neck for over eight minutes. 
Earlier this month, Chief Allan Adam of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation alleged the RCMP had beat him in March during an incident involving an expired licence plate.
A 12-minute video, obtained by news outlets including Reuters, last week showed Adam was forcefully arrested by police, which Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described as ""shocking.""
Singh, a practicing Sikh who often pairs bright turbans with stylish suits, is a former criminal defense lawyer.
The Bloc Québécois issued a statement saying: ""Discrimination against indigenous communities and cultural minorities is a major issue"" but the public safety committee is currently studying systemic racism in the RCMP and it should be allowed to do its work, CBC reported.
Canada is a multicultural country, and more than 22% of the population is made up of minorities, and another 5% are aboriginal, according to the latest census.

""Systemic racism exists in Canada... but Canada did not bring any changes to federal policing...why can't we act?"" Singh later said.

The parade, originally scheduled for May 9, is designed to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, but was postponed due to the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The move to quarantine the veterans beforehand would help safeguard Putin from getting the virus.
The Kremlin said earlier this week that Putin was protected from the coronavirus by special disinfection tunnels that anyone visiting his residence outside Moscow or meeting him in the Kremlin must pass through.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a group of war veterans was now in quarantine at sanatoriums and rest homes in ""lovely conditions.""
""Above all there is a concern for their health, since they will be there together and chatting with one another,"" he said. 
Taking such precautionary measures was important, he added, and it was a good opportunity for veterans to receive additional medical care. 
The annual parade is a raw display of military strength and patriotism that has become a hallmark of Putin’s rule.
Some cities have postponed their own military parades however, citing the coronavirus, but in Moscow, the epicentre of Russia's outbreak, plans remain in place, with a rehearsal taking place on Wednesday evening.

FUJAIRAH, United Arab Emirates (Reuters) - Off the east coast of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) coral freshly removed from a reef is cut into pieces and replanted by a group of divers in the waters below. 
The divers, from the Fujairah Adventure Centre, are building artificial reefs they hope will spur a resurgence in sea life degraded over the years by climate change and development.
The small team and other volunteers have planted more than 9,000 corals over about 600 square metres in the past year. Within five years, they hope to cover 300,000 square metres with 1.5 million corals. 
""It's a fertile environment for coral reefs, and this diversity has started spreading and has helped bring back sea life,"" diver Saeed al-Maamari told Reuters. 
Reefs, developing over thousands of years, are crucial to the survival of many marine species, while also acting as a barrier against waves that can help reduce erosion.
As elsewhere, UAE reefs have suffered substantial degradation over the past two decades, mostly due to climate change but also because of land reclamation.
Artificial reefs can help restore reefs that become a habitat for marine life and help combat coral bleaching and other degradation caused by climate change.
But it could take 10-15 years until meaningful levels of coral begin to grow naturally on artificial reefs, marine biologist John Burt told Reuters.
""This is a programme that is going to take a considerable amount of time before it is able to demonstrate efficacy in terms of rehabilitating a coral reef,"" said the associate professor at New York University's Abu Dhabi campus.
The project in Fujairah, one of the poorer parts of the oil-rich Gulf Arab state, has government support with technical expertise provided by the Ministry of Climate Change and Environment. 
Fujairah is where most of the country's few popular diving spots are located and officials hope the reef will help foster sustainable fisheries and eco-tourism.

""We're recreating the coral reef environment and system, which will become colonized with fish and increase biodiversity and become a habitat for fish species that are threatened and become a nice environment for diving tourism,"" said Ahmed Al-Za'abi, director of the ministry's marine environment research department.

329,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Taiwan to set up office to help people fleeing Hong Kong,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan said on Thursday it will set up a dedicated office to help those thinking of fleeing Chinese-ruled Hong Kong as Beijing tightens its grip on the former British colony.
Months of anti-government, pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong won widespread sympathy in democratic and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, which has welcomed those who have already moved to the island and expects more to come.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen last month became the first government leader anywhere to pledge measures to help Hong Kong people who leave due to what they see as tightening Chinese controls, including new national security legislation, smothering their democratic aspirations.
China denies stifling Hong Kong's freedoms and has condemned Tsai's offer, while pushing ahead with the new legislation.
Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said the new office would begin operations on July 1, which is also the day Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule from Britain in 1997 with the promise of continued, wide-ranging freedoms under its ""one country, two systems"" formula.
The office aims to ""practically handle humanitarian relief and care"" for Hong Kong citizens, though under the precondition of safeguarding Taiwan's national security, the council added.
The office is also aimed at ""reinforcing"" the council's existing services which include immigration, work and student visas for Hong Kong citizens, and demonstrates Taiwan's support for democracy, freedom and human rights in the city, it said. 
However, Taiwan's borders remain largely closed to keep out the coronavirus so there will be no immediate influx of Hong Kong people.
Nearly 200 Hong Kong people have fled to Taiwan since protests flared last year and about 10% have been granted visas under a law that protects Hong Kong people who are at risk for political reasons, according to the Taiwan Association for Human Rights.
Government officials have expressed concern that Taiwan is ill-prepared to cope with a large number of Hong Kong people, having little recent experience dealing with refugees or how to screen people who may seek asylum.

The death in Minneapolis of a black man, George Floyd, after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes has sparked protests around the world, with many demonstrators kneeling in streets and squares to protest against racism.
The position was first taken by National Football League player Colin Kaepernick during the playing of the U.S. national anthem to call attention to racial injustice, and has been adopted by many sports players since. 
In England, Premier League soccer players including champions Manchester City took a knee before kickoff in support of the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement when the season restarted on Wednesday.
Raab, asked if he would adopt the position during a TalkRadio interview on Thursday, said he understood the sense of frustration and restlessness driving the Black Lives Matter movement. 
He added: ""I've got to say on this 'taking the knee' thing, which I don't know, maybe it's got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones. 
""It feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it so it's a matter of personal choice."" 
Asked again if he would take a knee to protest, he said: ""I take the knee for two people, the queen and the missus when I asked her to marry me.""
In ""Game of Thrones"", the phrase ""bending the knee"" is used when someone pledges fealty to a monarch or lord.
Raab later tried to clarify his remarks, saying he had ""full respect"" for the Black Lives Matter movement.
""If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice,"" he said on Twitter. 
A clip of Raab's interview attracted 1.5 million views on Twitter within hours of it being posted and opposition lawmakers were highly critical of his words.
""This is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab,"" David Lammy, the justice spokesman for the Labour Party and a longtime black rights campaigner, said on Twitter.

""He is supposed to be the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indians burned portraits of Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday as families cremated the remains of some of the 20 soldiers killed in brutal hand-to-hand fighting with Chinese troops in a disputed mountainous border region.
Troops remained on alert at the Galwan Valley in the Ladakh region of the western Himalayas three days after the clashes, in which India said China had also suffered casualties. China has not given details of any deaths or injuries among its troops.
Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar spoke to senior Chinese diplomat Wang Yi on Wednesday and the two sides agreed not to take any steps to escalate matters and instead ensure peace and stability on the contested frontier.
An Indian official said senior military officers from both sides were holding talks on Thursday to defuse tensions. The talks were ongoing, the official said.
But both Jaishankar and Wang Yi traded blame for the deadliest border clash since 1967 and called for the other side to rein in their troops. 
""The need of the hour was for Chinese side to reassess its action and take corrective action,"" the Indian foreign ministry quoted Jaishankar has telling Wang. 
The Chinese diplomat said India must punish those responsible for the conflict and control its frontline troops, the Chinese foreign ministry said.
Hardline nationalist groups with ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party have stepped up calls for a boycott of Chinese goods and a cancellation of contracts with Chinese firms. 
China's Oppo cancelled the live online launch of its flagship smartphone in India.
Scores of people shouted ""Victory to Mother India"" as the body of Colonel B. Santosh Babu, the seniormost Indian officer killed in the clash, was taken in a flower-bedecked military truck to his home-town of Suryapet in southern India.
Funerals of other soldiers will also be taking place in their hometowns and villages. 
Residents in the northern city of Kanpur held a mock funeral of Xi and burned his portrait, shouting anti-China slogans. While in Cuttack, in eastern India, an effigy of Xi and a Chinese flag were burned.
In the western Indian city of Surat, a group of people gathered on Wednesday and threw a Chinese-made television set on the ground and stomped on it in a show of protest. 
""In the current situation, the China issue should not be taken lightly…In many cases, there may be Chinese money invested, but I think the regular things we buy from the market, one should certainly make sure that we avoid Chinese products,"" Food and Consumer Affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan told the Economic Times.
STRIDENT NATIONALIST
Russia, which is close to both nations, said on Wednesday it hoped India and China would find mutually acceptable ways to ensure security on their border, Interfax news agency reported.
Rising tensions with China - whose economy is five times bigger than India's and spends three times as much money on its military - has become Prime Minister Narendra Modi's most serious foreign policy challenge since he took power in 2014. 
A strident nationalist, Modi was elected to a second five-year term in May 2019 following a campaign focused on national security after spiralling tensions with old enemy Pakistan, on India's western border. 
Following Monday's violence, he is under pressure from the opposition and the gung-ho Indian media to respond strongly to China.
China and India fought a brief border war in 1962 and have had occasional flare-ups when patrols have confronted each other at the poorly defined Line of Actual Control, the de facto border. 
Under agreements in the 1990s, the two sides have said they will not use arms near the border. But on Monday night, hundreds of soldiers fought with iron rods and clubs studded with nails in the freezing heights for several hours. 
India's financial markets reacted nervously, but steadied later in the day.

The NSE Nifty 50 index was up 2.12% at 10,090.50 at 1000 GMT, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex was up 2.09% at 34,208.05.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brussels added to its large collection of murals on Thursday with a newly commissioned work in memory of African-American George Floyd, whose killing by police has sparked global protests against racism and police violence.
Belgian-Congolese street artist NovaDead, whose real name is Julien Crevaels, completed the work in just over a week in a suburb near the canal that crosses the Belgian capital.
The mural on a street corner, stretching across two buildings, features the face of Floyd, some scenes of nature and two hands clasping a rose.
""For me this picture could be a reminder of the absurdity, as I see it, of racism and the absurdity of such violence over the difference of colour,"" Crevaels told Reuters TV.
The Black Lives Matter protests have extended to Belgium and sparked calls for statues of King Leopold II to be removed. The king is known for his brutal colonial rule in what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1885-1908. 
There are flecks of vivid pink, purple and orange on the face of Floyd but generally grey, a colour city resident Crevaels says he uses in all his depictions of people, whatever their race.
""I always use the same range of grey and it functions very well. It's really to create this unity of human beings,"" said the artist, whose work also features on walls in France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Miami in the United States.

The wall itself is the property of the Brussels district of the Belgian capital, which wanted a mural to honour all victims of racism. The district, which includes the city centre, has some 150 murals, including other NovaDead works.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican urged Catholics on Thursday to disinvest from the armaments and fossil fuel industries and to closely monitor companies in sectors such as mining to check if they are damaging the environment.
The calls were contained in a 225-page manual for church leaders and workers to mark the fifth anniversary of Pope Francis' landmark encyclical ""Laudato Si"" (Praised Be) on the need to protect nature, life and defenseless people.
The compendium suggests practical steps to achieve the goals of the encyclical, which strongly supported agreements to contain global warming and warned against the dangers of climate change. 
The manual's section on finance said people ""could favor positive changes ... by excluding from their investments companies that do not satisfy certain parameters."" It listed these as respect for human rights, bans on child labor and protection of the environment.
Called 'Journeying Towards Care For Our Common Home', one action point called on Catholics to shun ""shun companies that are harmful to human or social ecology, such as abortion and armaments, and to the environment, such as fossil fuels"".
Another section called for the ""stringent monitoring"" of extraction industries in areas with fragile ecosystems to prevent air, soil and water contamination.
Last month, more that 40 faith organizations from around the world, more than half of them Catholic, pledged to divest from fossil fuel companies.
The Vatican bank has said it does not invest in fossil fuels and many Catholic dioceses and educational institutions around the world have taken similar positions. 

The document urges Catholics to defend the rights of local populations to have a say in whether their lands can be used for oil or mineral extraction and the right to take strong stands against companies that cause environmental disasters or over-exploit natural resources such as forests.

The first European to reach the Americas, Columbus is often seen by rights activists as a symbol of racial hatred as his discovery opened the gates to invasions from Europe resulting in millions of deaths all over the Americas.
""Cities have history and moments which must be respected and learned from,"" minister Isabel Celaa told reporters when asked about demands by protesters, including some left-wing politicians, in Spain to tear down the statues.
The Italian-born explorer, who made his travels on behalf of the Spanish crown, is a national hero in Spain, where dozens of cities have erected statues to honour him.
Following the death last month of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, anti-racism protesters across the United States and around the world have targeted statues of various historical figures, including Columbus. 

Statues of the explorer were taken down or vandalised in several cities in the United States, including St Louis, Boston, Richmond and Detroit.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand could allow inbound international travel to resume next month for business purposes, the aviation regulator said on Thursday, as the country seeks to revive an economy hit badly by the impacts of the coronavirus and global travel curbs. 
Thailand's tourism industry, which accounts for 12% of the economy, has ground to a halt from travel bans and health concerns, and projects as few as 14 million visitors this year, down from nearly 40 million in 2019.
""In July, we may open for some groups, but it will not be 100%,"" director-general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT), Chula Sukmanop, told Reuters.
A flight ban for all but repatriation flights is due to expire at the end of this month, but the extent to which the country can reopen depends on the government's Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration, Chula said.
Thailand, which has recorded 3,141 cases of the coronavirus and 58 deaths, suspended international flights in April.
Chula said specific groups may be allowed to visit, such as business delegations, but it was possible they may need to do quarantine upon arrival.
Thailand has eased many restrictions and recorded no new local transmissions for 24 days. All recent cases, including six reported on Tuesday, have been found in quarantine among Thais returning from abroad. 
Details for travel requirements are still being discussed, such as entry certificates and other conditions before departure and upon arrival, he added. 
Thailand has been planning to reopen to foreign visitors by creating so-called travel bubbles with countries that have also contained the virus, though no target date was set.

On Wednesday, Airports of Thailand Pcl said it expects travel to return to normal levels in October 2022.

""As the world is involved with the Corona pandemic, the imposition of such inhumane sanctions will only exacerbate the suffering of the Syrian people,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told state media.
""We will continue our economic cooperation with the resilient Syrian nation and Syria's government, and despite these sanctions, we will strengthen our economic relations with Syria,"" Mousavi said.

KUALA LUMPUR/BANGKOK (Reuters) - Malaysia is considering a plan to send nearly 300 Rohingya Muslim refugees detained after arriving on a damaged boat back out to sea once the ship has been fixed, two security sources told Reuters on Thursday.
Muslim-majority Malaysia has been a favoured destination for ethnic Rohingya fleeing persecution in Myanmar and more recently, refugee camps in Bangladesh, in search of better prospects.
But Malaysia has said it will no longer accept Rohingya refugees after tightening border controls to rein in the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Malaysia had earlier asked Bangladesh to take back 269 Rohingya refugees, who were detained upon their arrival on June 8, but Bangladeshi officials had rejected the request. 
Authorities have now drawn up a plan to send the detainees back out to sea after the boat has been fixed, two Malaysian security sources said. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.
""That is the current plan but no decision has been made yet,"" one of the sources said.
The boat would be supplied with food and water if the plan to push them out to sea was approved, the source said.
The Malaysian government's National Taskforce on migrant issues, which includes the maritime agency, navy, police and immigration, did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Nor did Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's office.
The body of one Rohingya woman was found on the boat but rights groups say more had died while others were left starving after being stranded at sea for months before being rescued. 
The Arakan Project, a non-profit group focusing on the Rohingya crisis, urged Malaysia not to send the refugees back out to sea. 
""This would amount to refoulement and would be completely inhumane as passengers already died aboard this boat before it was rescued,"" Chris Lewa, the group's director told Reuters.
Refoulement means the forced return of refugees to a place where they risk persecution in contravention of international humanitarian and human rights laws.
""Rohingya need protection and cannot be pushed off from one country to another, let alone back to sea.""
In recent weeks, Malaysia has turned away at least two boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya already in the country, as well as other undocumented migrants. 
The action comes amid heightened public anger towards foreigners in Malaysia, who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and being a burden on state resources.
At least one boat with as many as 300 Rohingya refugees on board remains at sea, according to rights groups. Some of those on board are believed to be sick. 
Its location is not known.

Previous clashes between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group, have complicated U.N. efforts to end Yemen's ruinous conflict and protect its fractured health sector from COVID-19.
The STC in April declared self-rule in Aden, interim seat of the Riyadh-backed government, and in other southern regions, risking reigniting violence between the two sides, both members of the anti-Houthi alliance.
Three sources with knowledge said Riyadh submitted a proposal, seen by Reuters, to implement a power-sharing deal brokered by Saudi Arabia last November but which stalled.
It calls for a ceasefire in Abyan province and for STC to rescind emergency rule. Thereafter Saudi-backed President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi would appoint a governor and security head for Aden, and name a premier to form a cabinet that includes the STC.
The STC would then remove its forces from Aden and redeploy in Abyan, following which the new government would be formed.
Mistrust remains an obstacle to Riyadh's attempts to prevent another front in the multifaceted war it seeks to exit, goals that have gained urgency ahead of its hosting of a G20 summit in November and as Yemen struggles with a coronavirus outbreak.
Two of the sources told Reuters the STC, which is backed by coalition partner the United Arab Emirates, wants the cabinet formed before moving its forces.
Hadi's government was ousted by the Houthis from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene. The war, which has caused the world's largest humanitarian crisis, has been in stalemate for years. 

Riyadh late last year launched indirect talks with the Houthis, who say they are fighting a corrupt system. The conflict is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The arrest of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's former justice minister could be a devastating blow for the Japanese leader whose support is near record lows, raising the possibility of his departure before the end of his term next year.
Some in Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are speaking of an early exit and rivals have stepped up manoeuvring to succeed him, party sources said. While Abe has rebounded from low ratings before, Japan's longest-ruling prime minister now appears to be losing more internal support.
Prosecutors on Thursday arrested former justice minister Katsuyuki Kawai, a one-time foreign policy adviser close to Abe, and Kawai's wife, Anri, on suspicion of vote-buying in a 2019 upper-house election.
Tokyo prosecutors said in a statement that the couple paid 1.7 million yen ($15,904) to five people to get her elected. Separately, Katsuyuki Kawai gave a total of about 24 million yen to about 90 people. 
At the time, Anri Kawai's campaign received 150 million yen ($1.4 million) in funds from LDP headquarters. The size of the contribution, although not illegal, raised questions about whether Abe approved it.
Abe has declined to comment on the Kawais, but has said lawmakers had the responsibility to explain their actions.
""Abe cannot last,"" said an LDP lawmaker who, like other politicians interviewed, spoke on condition of anonymity. 
""He probably cannot last until the year-end.""
The scandal has further eroded the support of voters already frustrated by Abe's handling of coronavirus stimulus, which has been seen as slow, and out-of-touch. He has also been hit by a backlash over his attempt to raise the retirement age of prosecutors, which was seen as undermining judicial independence. 
""Huge amounts of money circulated in the dark,"" Noriko Saito, a 65-year-old Tokyo housewife, said about the latest scandal.
""Mr Abe has a heavy responsibility.""
Abe returned to the prime minister's office in December 2012. His third term as LDP leader, and hence premier, ends in September 2021. 
'NUMBER ON HIS BACK'
Ousting a prime minister is tough and Abe, who quit in 2007 after a troubled first term, may want to avoid a similarly hasty exit this time. 
But jockeying by potential successors is heating up.
""Abe has a number on his back and that number is September 2021,"" said Jesper Koll, senior adviser at fund manager WisdomTree Investments (NASDAQ:WETF). ""Challengers within the LDP are on the on-ramp and ready to take off.""
Former foreign minister Fumio Kishida, an Abe loyalist plagued by weak public support, set up an intra-party group to create a ""vision for a post-coronavirus world"" this month, in an apparent effort to raise his profile. 
A former defence minister, Shigeru Ishiba, an Abe critic who polls well with voters but has weak support among LDP parliamentarians, has been cultivating ties with powerful LDP Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai.
There is also speculation that Defence Minister Taro Kono is angling for the top job. Even if Abe serves out his term, chances of a substantial rebound that would restore his control over the party appear slim, especially with the economy headed for its worst slump since World War Two. 
""Abe's handling of the coronavirus might be not that bad but he has too many other problems,"" said an LDP veteran lawmaker. ""Besides, he's been in power so long that people are fed up.""
Japan has not suffered an explosive coronavirus surge but critics have pointed to a slow early response and delays in much-needed support payments.
WILD CARD
Abe had hoped for a far different year in 2020 - presiding over the Tokyo Olympics, leading his party to an election victory and perhaps even winning a rare fourth term as LDP leader. 
That scenario began to unravel in March when the coronavirus forced the postponement of the Games.
His voter ratings fell below 30% in two opinion polls last month - often seen as a danger sign. A June 5-7 survey by the Nikkei business daily showed an 11 point drop to 38%.
He has one wild card: he could call a snap general election to renew his mandate. 
Party insiders said that was unlikely but could not be ruled out. He has already led his party to victory in five elections.
""The Abe government won't last unless he threatens LDP politicians with a snap election,"" said a senior LDP official. 
Abe's other strength lies in his rivals' weakness. 

""I'd like to see a change of administration,"" said Chisato Tanaka, a 26-year-old translator. ""But there's no one in particular I'd like to see become premier.""

AHMEDABAD, India (Reuters) - In their last phone conversation, Neha Ojha, the wife of an Indian soldier, said she laughed off her husband's idea to name their daughter Snow White because he received the news of her birth while patrolling a snow-covered valley on the border with China.
She said she asked her husband, Kundan, to come up with an Indian name before he came home.
Sixteen hours later, Ojha was informed that her husband was among 20 soldiers killed by Chinese troops in the disputed Galwan Valley. On Thursday, she said she was struggling to nurse her 18-day-old infant as she awaited her husband's remains. 
""We were all waiting for him (Kundan) to host the naming ceremony of our daughter. Now we're preparing to hold his final rites,"" 23-year-old Ojha said in a telephone conversation, speaking haltingly. 
The Indian army on Thursday began handing over the bodies of the soldiers killed in the fight - the worst clash in over half a century between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Both countries blame each other for the clash, but agreed not to take any steps to escalate matters further.
Indian soldiers who survived the clash said the Chinese used bamboo sticks studded with nails during the confrontation in sub-zero temperatures in the high altitude terrain, while the Indians used stones and sticks. Under an agreement forged in the 1990s, the two armies carry but do not use arms near the border.
China said its troops were engaged in a ""violent physical confrontation"" with Indian soldiers, but has given no details on casualties.
Families of the fallen Indian soldiers and other citizens demanded Prime Minister Narendra Modi find diplomatic and strategic ways to punish China. 
Despite her husband's posting in one of world's most highly militarized areas, Ojha said she had assumed that the dispute with the Chinese would never take a serious turn.
""My husband had compared brawls with Chinese soldiers to scuffles between boys in school, 'We push them, they push us, we throw a stick, they fling it back',"" she recalled her husband recounting to her. 
""I was wrong, we were all wrong to trust the Chinese...they must be punished.""
Hardline nationalist groups with ties to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party have stepped up calls for a boycott of Chinese goods and a cancellation of contracts with Chinese firms. 
""This kind of bludgeoning must stop. China has a strong army but Indians will unite against them if they continue such attacks,"" said Kishore Singh, the father of a deceased soldier, hours before he received the body.

""The Chinese are using their brute force amid a pandemic, the world must stand with India to punish them,"" said Singh, a retired teacher.

The test-firing comes as the United States is seeking an extension of a U.N.-imposed arms embargo against Iran, which is due to expire in October under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Washington withdrew from that pact.
""During the exercises, short-range and long-range coast-to-sea and sea-to-sea missiles were successfully fired from the coast and from decks of ships, hitting their targets with great precision,"" the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.
The new generation cruise missiles, with a range of 280 km (175 miles) were tested during exercises by the Iranian navy in the Gulf of Oman, which lies next to the Strait of Hormuz waterway at the mouth of the Gulf, and the northern Indian Ocean, Tasnim said.
In April, Iran said it had increased the range of its naval missiles to 700 km.
Western military analysts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities but concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles programme contributed to the U.S. decision to leave Iran's 2015 deal to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions.

MADRID (Reuters) - Adjusting to life under lockdown has been tough for the 52 residents of Madrid's Alas centre for women with intellectual disabilities, who often struggle to grasp abstract concepts and develop social and practical skills. 
Keeping everyone occupied and engaged is key to maintaining morale, said activity coordinator Concha Delgado. Staff use pictograms and stories to explain the dangers of the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed some 27,000 people in Spain. 
Vigorously bumping elbows with her friends and singing from behind a smart purple mask, Maricarmen Lara, 55, has adapted better than most to the restrictions but she still misses close physical contact. 
""What I want most is for this to end and to be able to go out and hug and kiss my friends, the people I love,"" said Lara, who has lived at the foundation since 1981.
In a large hall where a dozen women, including Lara, whirled and jived to a Latin dance track, another group sat to the side, engaged in an ocean-themed jigsaw puzzle. 
When the music ended, small cartons of fruit juice were handed out and the women caught their breath, as Delgado set up the television to receive a livestreamed concert.
""Anything we can do that gives them something to look forward to is important. It's like an oxygen-tank to keep us all going,"" Delgado said.
Since Spain eased confinement measures, the residents have been able to socialise with each other and receive visitors, but cannot yet mix with their friends at the recently-reopened day centre.
Many remain wary of infection. Only eight people have rejoined the daily workshops compared with around 90 before the pandemic, with the majority sticking to classes and therapy sessions online.

But the centre's manager Paula de la Rocha is optimistic more will return soon: ""They want to come back when you don't have to wear a mask and disinfect all the time.""

India, which controls the region – a slice of land including Limpiyadhura, Lipulkeh and Kalapani areas in the northwest – has rejected the map saying it was not based on historical facts or evidence.
Some 57 members in the 59-seat National Assembly, or the upper house of the country’s parliament, voted in favour of a constitutional amendment bill seeking to replace the old map, chairman of the house Ganesh Prasad Timilsina said.

Turkish warplanes struck PKK targets in various regions of northern Iraq on Sunday and Tuesday in two separate raids, which Ankara said were in response to an increase in militant attacks on Turkish army bases. 
Ankara launched the ""Claw-Tiger Operation"" on Tuesday in northern Iraq's Haftanin region.
A Defence Ministry statement said Turkish F-16 jets, drones and howitzers had hit and destroyed more than 500 PKK targets in 36 hours.
""The Claw-Tiger Operation is going very well. God willing, by continuing with the same seriousness and determination, we will conclude the operation with success,"" the statement cited Defence Minister Hulusi Akar as saying.
Turkey regularly attacks PKK militants, both in its mainly Kurdish southeast and in northern Iraq, where the group is based. It has also warned in recent years of a potential ground offensive against PKK bases in Iraq's Qandil mountains.
The United Arab Emirates said on Wednesday Turkish and Iranian military interventions in Iraq violated Iraqi sovereignty. The UAE and Ankara have strained ties, including over the Libyan crisis where the two countries back opposing sides.

The PKK, designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, focused in southeast Turkey.

Armed police moved into to restore order as the violence spread between rival gangs, authorities said.

The Chinese J-10 and J-11 fighter aircraft flew into the southwestern part of Taiwan's air defence identification zone in the morning, Taiwan's air force said in a statement.
Taiwanese fighters, which regularly patrol the air space around the Chinese-claimed island, warned the Chinese aircraft over the radio, whereupon they left Taiwan's air defence zone, it added, without giving further details.
Since June 9, China's air force has flown at least four other similar missions and were each time chased off by Taiwanese jets, according to Taiwan's military.
Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.
China has not commented publicly on the last week of Chinese air force activity near Taiwan. Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country's determination to defend its sovereignty.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan becoming independent.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist intent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

The draft legislation specifies the definition of four crimes: separatist activity, state subversion, terrorist activity and collusion with foreign forces, Xinhua reported.
It also sets out punishments for those crimes, it said.
The law is expected to bring about the most profound change to the former British colony's way of life since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It is expected to allow mainland security agents to be based in Hong Kong for the first time. 
Critics fear it will crush wide-ranging freedoms in Hong Kong denied to people in mainland China that are seen as key to its success as a global financial centre.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have dismissed fears the law will curb freedoms and say it will only target a minority of ""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security. 
Despite such assurances, the legislation has triggered some of the strongest exchanges between officials in Beijing and Washington, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling it a ""death knell"" for Hong Kong's freedoms. 
Pompeo met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii on Wednesday amid a deep deterioration of ties between the strategic rivals, their first face-to-face meeting since last year.
The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement Yang told Pompeo that the United States needed to respect China's positions and halt interference in issues such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Xinjiang region and work to repair bilateral relations.
Pompeo stressed ""the need for fully-reciprocal dealings between the two nations across commercial, security, and diplomatic interactions"", U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
The Hong Kong security legislation is the biggest step yet by Beijing in a concerted campaign to assert its authority over the city and its 7.5 million people after months of often violent anti-government demonstrations. 
The legislation was not listed on an earlier agenda of the session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee.

353,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 18, 2020 02:46AM ET</span>","Former Japanese justice minister, lawmaker wife arrested for suspected vote-buying: NHK","By Linda Sieg
TOKYO (Reuters) - A former Japanese justice minister and his lawmaker wife were arrested on Thursday on suspicion of vote-buying, public broadcaster NHK reported, in a harsh blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as he struggles with falling voter support.
Voter support for Abe, who had close ties to the ex-justice minister, has declined over what critics say is his clumsy handling of the coronavirus outbreak, a furore over efforts to extend top prosecutors' retirement age, and questions about government programmes to support tourism and smaller companies.
Media have said prosecutors suspect former justice minister Katsuyuki Kawai and his wife, upper house lawmaker Anri Kawai, of offering millions of yen in cash to about 100 people prior to the 2019 upper house election, in which Anri Kawai won a seat. 
Katsuyuki Kawai, who previously served as a foreign policy adviser to Abe, quit as minister last October after reports of election irregularities by his wife.
""I have never engaged in political activities that are shameful in the light of my conscience, nor against the law,"" Kyodo news agency quoted Katsuyuki Kawai as saying on Wednesday.
Anri has also denied vote-buying, media reports said. On Wednesday she told reporters her lawyer had advised her not to comment. Neither could be reached immediately for comment on Thursday.
Lawmakers cannot be arrested while parliament is in session. Parliament's session ended on Wednesday.
Abe returned to office in December 2012 and last November became Japan's longest serving prime minister. His term as ruling Liberal Democratic Party leader and hence, premier, ends in September 2021 but speculation is simmering that he may have to step down sooner given his sagging voter support, which fell below 30% in two opinion polls last month.
""Abe's responsibility for appointing Kawai as justice minister will be called into question,"" said Tomoaki Iwai, a political science professor at Nihon University. ""His ratings could fall further.""
Political sources and experts said Abe would be weakened but was unlikely to step down immediately as Japan contends with the coronavirus outbreak.
""The damage will be quite big,"" said University of Tokyo political science professor Yu Uchiyama. ""He will be a lame duck.""
Abe is struggling to ease the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the world's third-largest economy.
He has responded with two stimulus packages totalling $2.2 trillion - including payouts to citizens and ailing firms - but over half of the respondents to a Reuters survey were critical of the response.

This is New Zealand's second set of gun reforms in the wake of the Christchurch massacre by a suspected white supremacist who murdered his victims with semi-automatic weapons. 
Australian Brenton Tarrant has pleaded guilty over the attack and will be sentenced later this year.
The tougher gun laws will take effect next week following the passage of a bill through Parliament on Thursday.
The most significant change is the new firearms registry which licence holders will be required to update as they buy or sell guns. 
""The new law is designed to stop firearms falling into the wrong hands. It spells out for the first time that owning a firearm is a privilege, limited to responsible licensed owners,"" Minister of Police Stuart Nash said in a statement.
Other changes include prohibiting high-risk firearms like short semi-automatic rifles, tighter rules for gun dealers, and reduced the length of firearms licence from 10 to 5 years for first time licence holders and those who had their licence revoked or allowed it to expire.
The government had near-unanimous support in parliament last year when it passed a law banning military style semi-automatic firearms within weeks of the March 2019 attack.
The second round of changes passed on Thursday faced some resistance, with gun lobbyists and opposition leaders questioning the need for a gun registry.
New Zealand's efforts on gun control have gained global praise, especially in the United States, where lawmakers in favour of gun control and activists have struggled to address gun violence.

The blast occurred in the Silopi district, near the borders with Iraq and Syria, while the vehicle was carrying fuel to be used by workers involved in road construction, the Sirnak governor's office said in a statement.
It said the explosives were planted and detonated by Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii on Wednesday in what Beijing described as a ""constructive dialogue,"" amid a deep deterioration of ties between strategic rivals that are the world's two top economies.
The countries have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China's move to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong, among the latest flare-ups in years of escalating tensions.
In the meeting, Pompeo stressed ""the need for fully-reciprocal dealings between the two nations across commercial, security, and diplomatic interactions,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
""He also stressed the need for full transparency and information sharing to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and prevent future outbreaks.""
Beijing said the two sides agreed to continue engagement.
""Both sides fully articulated their countries' respective positions, and believe that this was a constructive dialogue. Both sides agreed to take action to implement the consensus reached by leaders of both countries,"" China's Xinhua news agency said.
The meeting in Honolulu started shortly after 9 a.m. (1900 GMT) and concluded at 3:50 p.m. (0150 GMT Thursday), a senior State Department official said. 
As the meeting got under way, U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions against those responsible for repression of Uighur Muslims in China's Xinjiang region.
Separately, foreign ministers of the G7 countries, including Pompeo, issued a statement calling on China not to follow through with the Hong Kong legislation.
Pompeo has been forceful in his criticism of Beijing and it was his first known contact with Yang since they discussed the coronavirus by phone on April 15. They had not met face to face since last year.
Tensions have risen also over China's neighbor North Korea. The United States and China share concerns about that country's nuclear weapons program.
LOW POINT
Experts say U.S.-China relations have reached their lowest point in years, and in mid-May Trump, who has pursued a deal to end a damaging trade war he launched with China, went so far as to suggest he could cut ties with Beijing.
The bill Trump signed calls for sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for oppressing Uighur Muslims, including on one of Yang's colleagues on China's powerful Politburo.
Trump tempered that possibility with a signing statement saying that some of the bill's sanctions requirements might limit his constitutional authority as president to conduct diplomacy so he would regard them as advisory, not mandatory.
While Trump and his administration have stepped up rhetoric against China in the run-up to the November U.S. election, his former national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Wednesday the president sought Chinese President Xi Jinping's help to win re-election during a closed-door June 2019 meeting. 
Bolton's accusations are part of a book that the U.S. government on Tuesday sued to block him from publishing, arguing it contained classified information and would compromise national security.
Trump hit back at Bolton, calling him ""a liar"" in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. He told Fox News in a separate interview that Bolton had broken the law by including highly classified material in the book.
Neither side outlined an agenda for the Hawaii talks, but diplomats and other sources have said the meeting was requested by China.
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also told a congressional hearing that Chinese officials had repeatedly affirmed their commitment to buy more U.S. goods and services under a Phase 1 trade deal signed in January and that some $10 billion in purchases had been recorded thus far. 
Lighthizer also said, when asked about exports of products made by Uighurs and other Muslim groups in camps in China, that Washington would ""strongly enforce"" U.S. laws banning the import of goods made by forced labor.
Among his criticisms of China, Pompeo has said it could have prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths from the global coronavirus pandemic by being more transparent, and accused it of refusing to share information.

Trump has initiated a process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China for curbing freedoms there, but has stopped short of immediately ending privileges that have helped the territory remain a global financial center.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's chief nuclear negotiator will hold talks with officials in Washington on Thursday amid flaring tensions with North Korea after Pyongyang blew up an inter-Korean liaison office and threatened military action. 
Lee Do-hoon's unannounced trip came days after North Korea blew up a joint liaison office in Kaesong, near the South Korean border and declared an end to dialogue with the South.
Lee is expected to hold consultations with U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun who had led denuclearisation negotiations with North Korea, Seoul's foreign ministry said. 
Lee and Biegun will ""assess the current situation on the Korean peninsula and discuss responses,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
South Korean television showed Lee arriving at Washington's Dulles International Airport on Wednesday evening, where he declined to comment to reporters. 
Pyongyang has increasingly snubbed Seoul's calls for engagement as efforts to restart inter-Korean economic projects stalled due to international sanctions designed to rein in the North's nuclear and missile programmes. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, on Wednesday criticised South Korean President Moon Jae-in for failing to implement a 2018 peace accord, saying Moon ""put his neck into the noose of pro-U.S. flunkeyism.""
Pyongyang has also taken issue over defectors in the South sending propaganda leaflets into North Korea.
Several defector-led groups regularly send back flyers carrying critical messages of Kim Jong Un, often together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news. 
The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, said the demolition of the liaison office was the ""first stage action"" in its ""holy war"" aimed at punishing Seoul authorities for turning a blind eye to the defector's campaign. 
""It was an iron hammer of stern punishment meted out to those who were having empty dreams while pursuing concealed hostile policy,"" it said in a commentary. 

The newspaper also ran a series of articles and photos carrying angry ordinary citizens calling for retaliation and vowing to send anti-South leaflets over the border.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China threatened retaliation after U.S. President Donald Trump signed legislation on Wednesday calling for sanctions over the repression of China's Uighurs, as excerpts from a book by his former national security adviser alleged he had approved of their mass detention.
The bill, which Congress passed with only one ""no"" vote, was intended to send China a strong message on human rights by mandating sanctions against those responsible for oppression of members of China's Muslim minority.
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang region. The U.S. State Department has accused Chinese officials of subjecting Muslims to torture, abuse ""and trying to basically erase their culture and their religion.""
China, which denies mistreatment and says the camps provide vocational training and are needed to fight extremism, responded to the signing of the law with anger, saying it ""vilified"" the human rights situation in Xinjiang and was a malicious attack against China.
""We again urge the U.S. side to immediately correct its mistakes and stop using this Xinjiang-related law to harm China's interests and interfere in China's internal affairs,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. 
""Otherwise, China will resolutely take countermeasures, and all the consequences arising therefrom must be fully borne by the United States,"" it added, without giving details.
China and the United States are already at loggerheads over everything from China's handling of the coronavirus pandemic to U.S. support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
One of the main exile groups, the World Uyghur Congress, thanked Trump for signing the law, adding that it ""gave hope to the desperate Uighur people"".
Trump signed the bill as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held his first face-to-face meeting since last year with China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi.
Trump issued a signing statement that some of the bill's requirements might limit his constitutional authority to conduct diplomacy so he would regard them as advisory, not mandatory.
Trump did not hold a ceremony to mark his signing, which came as newspapers published excerpts from the new book by former national security adviser John Bolton.
Among other allegations, Bolton says that Trump sought Chinese President Xi Jinping's help to win re-election during a closed-door 2019 meeting, and that Trump said Xi should go ahead with building the camps in Xinjiang.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Uighur law for the first time calls for sanctions on a member of China's powerful Politburo, Xinjiang's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, as responsible for ""gross human rights violations.""

It also calls on U.S. companies operating in Xinjiang to take steps to ensure they do not use parts made with forced labor.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A North Korean defector-led group on Thursday prepared hundreds of plastic bottles stuffed with rice which they plan to float into North Korea, despite a legal challenge from South Korean authorities and threats from Pyongyang.
Citing South Korea's failure to stop the defectors, North Korea this week blew up the joint liaison office on its side of the border, declared an end to dialogue with South Korea and threatened military action.
Denouncing defectors as ""mongrel dogs"" and ""human scum"", North Korea says their activities are an insult to the dignity of the country's supreme leader.
South Korea is keen to improve relations with North Korea, and last week the government announced it would pursue legal actions against two defector-led groups, saying their cross-border shipments of aid and propaganda were raising tensions with North Korea, posing risks to South Koreans who live on the border, and causing environmental damage.
Still, one group is planning to send hundreds of bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and medical face masks to North Korea by throwing them into the sea near the border on Sunday, said Park Jung-oh, 61, a North Korean defector who heads the group, called Kuensaem. 
""We do this as humanitarian aid amongst those who share the same values, so whatever North Korea says, we will continue to help those in hard situations, the elderly and the victims,"" he said. 
Gathered at a small park in Seoul, the group filled dozens of 2 litre bottles with up to 1.5kg of rice each, sending up to 700kg of rice in total, Park said.
Kuensaem has been sending goods to the North twice a month for the past five years. Sunday will mark their 108th time, Park said.
South Korean authorities have occasionally moved to stop such operations, including in 2018 during a series of summits between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
“I don’t know why the Unification Ministry is nitpicking at us all of a sudden. The (South Korean) government - the Gangwha police, maritime police and the military - all knew about us,"" said Park, unloading rice and bottles from his white truck.
He said he had not been contacted by any South Korean authorities since they announced they would pursue legal action.
Several defector-led groups regularly send flyers over the border, together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news. Most use balloons or bottles in rivers.

The two Koreas traded fire in 2014 after the North's military fired machine guns at balloons launched by defector activists.

Jorge Torres, who served as interim governor of the northern border state for most of 2011, was arrested in Mexico early last year and extradited to the United States in October to face trial in federal court for the Southern District of Texas.
Torres governed the state, which borders Texas, for the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which dominated Mexico's political landscape for the best part of a century.
U.S. prosecutors in Texas charged Torres and Hector Javier Villarreal, a former Coahuila finance minister, with fraud, theft and illegal transfer of funds in 2013.
Torres entered a guilty plea for his part in a money laundering scheme that included offenses against a foreign nation involving bribery of a public official, U.S. Attorney Ryan Patrick said in a statement issued by the DOJ.
Torres faces up to 20 years in prison and a possible $500,000 fine. As part of his plea, he agreed to forfeit property in the United States linked to the bribes, the DOJ said.
U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzalez Ramos has set Torres' sentencing for Sept. 10, the statement said. 
Villarreal has also been convicted in the Southern and Western Districts of Texas for money laundering offenses and is likewise awaiting sentencing, it added.
The PRI, which governed Mexico from 1929-2000 and again from 2012-2018, suffered a crushing defeat in the last election at the hands of veteran leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador after a series of damaging corruption scandals.
Lopez Obrador, who took office as president in December 2018, has vowed to root out political corruption in Mexico.

Workers at the Parisian landmark, which looms 324 metres (1,062 feet) over the French capital, were on Wednesday making preparations to re-open on June 25, after three months of shutdown. It has been the site's longest period out of action since World War Two.
Managers said they hoped to get operations fully back to normal later in the summer. In the meantime, a series of safety measures will be in place.
Visitors will not be able to go any higher than the second level of the tower, and until the start of July access will be only via the staircases. The elevators, with their confined space, represent a risk of disease transmission.
There will also be a one-way traffic system in force on the staircases, and all visitors over the age of 11 will be required to wear a face covering.
""To attract people, the most important thing is that security measures are taken, and that's why we're promoting safe distances,"" said Patrick Branco Ruivo, director of the Eiffel Tower's operating company.

Every day Pattillo told her sons they were unique, wanted, valued, and loved - ""each step in their life, each plateau of their life.""
But she also prepared them.
""I let them know that the world does not love them,"" Pattillo said. ""And just because they don't love you doesn't mean you're not great. And it doesn't mean that you're not important. And it doesn't mean that you don't exist."" 
The death of George Floyd, a 46-year old black man who died in May after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes, has triggered widespread protests in the United States and around the world against police brutality and racism. 
It has also been a painful reminder to black mothers in the U.S. how vulnerable their children, and especially their sons, are to police brutality, at least five women Reuters interviewed said. 
Police-involved fatalities in the United States average nearly three deaths per day, a 2018 study (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-race-police-deaths/police-involved-deaths-vary-by-race-and-place-idUSKBN1KL2M4) in the American Journal of Public Health showed, and black men are more than twice as likely to be killed during them than white men. 
One in every 1,000 black men in the United States will be killed by a police officer, vs. one in every 2,000 men overall, a 2019 study (https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793) by the National Academy of Sciences found. 
Floyd's death follows a string of other high profile deaths of unarmed African Americans at the hands of police, including the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Ohio in 2014, the choking death of Eric Garner in New York City in 2014, and the March shooting of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky during a ""no knock"" arrest that targeted the wrong house. 
On June 12, Rayshard Brooks, a black man, was fatally shot in the back by police in Atlanta, after being found asleep in a parking lot. 
DREADING 'THE TALK' FOR YEARS
Pattillo said she sobbed the first time she sat down her younger son, then 12 years old, to have what's known in the black community as ""The Talk"" - about how to behave when you are inevitably stopped by police, so you don't become another statistic.
Speak slowly, keep your school I.D. on you, but don't put your hand in your pocket to reach for it without asking. Don't give the officer anything that could be considered sass.
""These are not conversations that you should be having with your children who are 12,"" she said. 
The Talk is so ubiquitous that the National Black Police Association (NBPA) holds a dramatized version with police officers, judges and prosecutors in high schools, and distributes a written guide (https://542b2294-673b-4866-8ef1-b8424d1a03f3.filesusr.com/ugd/c725f7_2a8e3072c4d14e59a05272a8c370ed05.pdf) entitled ""What to Do When Stopped by the Police."" 
""We show how quickly it can go bad,"" explained Regina Holman, a retired police officer in Las Vegas, president of the NBPA in Nevada, and mother and grandmother. Officers teach students ""they have a very good chance that their cars are going to be ransacked, and they're not going to be treated right."" 
""When they become non-compliant, that’s when things go wrong,"" Holman said. ""We teach them you cannot fight your battles at that moment."" 
Neakai Lewis, an event producer in Los Angeles, lives in upscale neighborhood View Park nicknamed ""The Black Beverly Hills,"" that has been home to entertainers Ray Charles and Tina Turner. Lewis created ""The Mom Group,"" for black women in Los Angeles to address additional stresses they face as parents. 
Even though her son is only 21 months old, she's already planning The Talk. 
""It’s years of just drilling it in that everybody is beautiful, everybody deserves respect but you have a certain tone to your skin that for some reason is going to make you a threat - so here are the things that you're going to need to do to survive and this is real,"" said Lewis. 
""It's my duty as his mom to prepare him.""
Chantal Bonitto, 38, is raising a five-year-old son, and gave birth to a second baby boy with her white husband in New York earlier this month. Race has always been a part of family conversations, and she's already guiding her son's behavior due to fear of racial biases.
""He can't be the wild kid. He wants to be the class clown. You cannot be the class clown,"" she said. ""I fear the day when he turns 10, and that admiration for this cute little curly-haired boy turns into fear,"" she said.
Bonitto said she's trying to instill the same confidence in her son her parents instilled in her as a black girl growing up in Brooklyn. ""Most of all, that if someone does discriminate against him or makes him feel like he is 'lesser than,' in his heart he knows that's not true."" 
Bonitto's father was a corrections officer, she said. ""I know and respect that his job paid for my college tuition, it provided me with healthcare and benefits, but the compromise was that he saw a flawed criminal justice system that locked up men that looked like him."" 
Bonitto said she wants her son to be ""wary of all authority figures who wear a badge and a gun."" 
""I don’t deny that there are good cops,"" Lewis said. But, she added, ""How can you respect or how can you look up to somebody that you constantly have to fear?"" 
POLICE GRAPPLE WITH THEIR ROLE 
Floyd's death has prompted an unprecedented national conversation about the role of police in America, and their treatment of African Americans. On June 15, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a police reform bill, flanked by mothers who has lost their black sons to police violence.
Some black mothers who made their careers in law enforcement find they're struggling for answers. ""My grandson is 17,"" said Holman, who served on the Las Vegas police force for over 27 years. ""He said to me, 'You taught me to respect the police. You always told me to comply. But look at George Floyd. He respected the police, and now he’s dead. What do I do now?'"" 
The fear that black boys and their parents are feeling ""is something that is hard to fight,"" said Zsakhiem James, a police captain in Camden, New Jersey, a city that has reformed (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-camden/one-american-citys-model-of-policing-reform-means-building-social-currency-idUSKBN23J2RU) law enforcement in recent years to focus on de-escalation and community policing.
""Especially in light of the George Floyd incident,"" James said. ""It's not just a fear of the Camden County Police. It's a fear of all police."" 
'WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE' 
Black women in the United States are under a unique set of stresses, said Lori Hoggard, associate professor of psychology and director of the Racism, Identity, Coping, and Health Lab at Rutgers University in New Brunswick (NYSE:BC), New Jersey.
The stress they experience contributes to the disproportionately high levels of depression and cardiovascular disease, among other health problems, Hoggard said. 
Pattillo and other mothers say they feel pressure to fix the impacts of systemic racism on the men in her life, and especially their sons.

""Black women have been tasked with having to be trauma surgeons for situations that we are not trained for... This is not something that only the black community can do, because the black community didn't put the black community in this predicament. So we can't do it alone.""

364,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>",Bulgarian PM says opponents trying to undermine him to block euro entry,"SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov on Wednesday accused his political opponents of trying to undermine his government with the aim of blocking Bulgaria's deeper integration into the European Union.
Borissov, 61, whose third government took office in 2017, has come under pressure this week due to an audio file published by some local media in which a voice similar to Borissov's is heard making offensive remarks about the head of parliament and a deputy minister. 
The voice on the recording also boasts about ordering an independent financial regulator to carry out a probe into a Bulgarian company. 
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the file.
Prosecutors have launched a probe into the audio, which refers to events of April, 2019, to check if it was acquired via illegal eavesdropping and whether it had been doctored.
In an emotional statement from the headquarters of his centre-right GERB party on Wednesday evening, Borissov said the audio had been doctored and called it a ""manipulation"".
He also said that pictures of him published earlier on Wednesday on a local news website were ""a setup"".
In one of the photos, Borissov is shown sleeping next to a gun on a bedside nightstand. Other pictures show only the nightstand filled with 500 euro notes and gold bars.
Reuters could not verify the authenticity of the pictures.
""Today our political opponents hit rock bottom,"" Borissov said.
""Why now? Because July is an important month... Bulgaria, along with Croatia, is confidently on its path to join the banking union and the euro zone... They will not make me quit, nor will I stop.""
Bulgaria, one of the European Union's poorest countries, hopes to join the ERM-2 'waiting room' to the euro in July.
Borissov said entry in the banking union would ensure strict supervision over money flows and banks and would set the country, once the Soviet Union's closest satellite, firmly in the Euro-Atlantic community. 
Despite public anger over endemic corruption in the country, Borissov's popularity has risen amid the coronavirus pandemic. Bulgaria has reported a relatively low 181 COVID-19 deaths, and two recent opinion polls showed his party ahead of its rivals.
Borissov said his opponents, including President Rumen Radev, the main opposition Socialist party, and other smaller political factions, were trying to rattle him and trigger early elections so the president could appoint a caretaker government.

General elections in Bulgaria are due next March.

The Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down on Jan. 8 by an Iranian ground-to-air missile, killing 176 people in what Tehran termed a “disastrous mistake” at a time of heightened tensions with the United States.
Ukraine initially lacked the technical capability to read the boxes but now says it has that ability, Eslami said. He said ""the Americans"" may have provided Ukraine with the necessary software and documents to read the black boxes of the 737-800 airliner made by U.S.-based Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 
The reading of the boxes will take place in coordination with the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization.
“The necessary coordination is in this way that the reading of the black box be done in the country of Ukraine in the presence of representatives of ICAO,” Eslami said. “And if the conditions aren’t provided then at that time the reading will take place together in France.”
The fate of the cockpit voice and data ""black box"" recorders has been the subject of an international standoff eclipsed by the coronavirus crisis, which Iran says has also contributed to delays in a probe by Iran’s Air Accident Investigation Board.
Iran’s envoy to ICAO said last week that France’s BEA air accident agency had been asked by Iranian investigators to read the black boxes if the BEA could accommodate this.
A spokesman for BEA said it had exchanged messages with Iran offering technical support and discussing logistics due to the coronavirus crisis, but added that Iran had not conveyed a formal decision on how to read the black boxes.

LONDON (Reuters) - Four men who played significant roles in the French Resistance during World War Two will be honoured by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron during a ceremony in London on Thursday.
Macron, on his first trip outside France since the start of the coronavirus lockdown in March, will also meet Johnson at 10 Downing Street to discuss their governments' responses to the pandemic.
They are also likely to discuss Brexit, an issue that has been rising back up the political agenda in recent weeks as pressure increases on Britain and the European Union to agree and ratify a trade deal before a Dec. 31 deadline.
Macron's visit marks the 80th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle's radio address to the French nation, shortly after the Nazi invasion of France, in which he laid the foundations of the Resistance.
The address was broadcast from London by the BBC on June 18, 1940, with permission from Winston Churchill.
To mark the occasion, Britain will bestow awards on four Resistance fighters: Edgard Tupet-Thome, 100; Daniel Cordier, 99; Hubert Germain, 99, and Pierre Simonet, 98. They will not be present, but will receive their awards in France later.
The four are the only surviving holders of the Croix de la Liberation (Cross of Liberation), an honour bestowed by De Gaulle on 1,038 men and women who distinguished themselves in the struggle to liberate France.
Johnson said the men symbolised ""the enduring depth and strength"" of Franco-British friendship - which has been tested by Brexit turbulence since Britain voted to quit the European Union in a 2016 referendum.
Macron will take part in a ceremonial event with Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, and his wife Camilla. The French leader will also be treated to a joint flypast by the Red Arrows, the Royal Air Force's aerobatic team, and their French counterparts, the Patrouille de France.
A statue of Churchill that stands on Parliament Square was uncovered for Macron's visit. The statue had been boarded up since last week to prevent it from being damaged by Black Lives Matter protesters.

Turkish officials said this week they might have to adopt a harder line on social interactions after a jump in coronavirus infections, but said there were no plans to reverse an easing of lockdown restrictions aimed at reviving the economy.
The governors' offices in the three cities announced the order on face masks.
This month restaurants and cafes reopened, intercity flights and car travel resumed, and weekend stay-home orders were lifted. However, new COVID-19 cases subsequently doubled to around 1,500 a day, official data shows. 

As Turks have poured into streets, malls and parks or taken vacations - often without face masks - authorities have urged caution and said new cases are emerging in more rural central and southeastern provinces.

Canada lost out to Ireland and Norway in a hotly contested election that included Ireland enlisting the help of U2 singer Bono and taking U.N. ambassadors to a U2 concert and Canada taking envoys to a Celine Dion concert. 
Mexico and India were elected unopposed. Kenya and Djibouti were competing for the final seat, but there was no clear winner. 
To ensure geographical representation, seats are allocated to regional groups. But even if candidates are running unopposed in their group, they still need to win the support of more than two thirds of the U.N. General Assembly.
The new members will start their two-year term on the 15-member council on Jan. 1. 
After operating virtually since March amid the coronavirus pandemic, diplomats - wearing masks and social distancing - returned to the General Assembly hall on Wednesday to cast their secret ballots at allotted times. 
They also elected - unopposed - Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir as the president of the 75th session of the U.N. General Assembly. He will take up the role later this year.

The Security Council is the only U.N. body that can make legally binding decisions like imposing sanctions and authorizing the use of force. It has five permanent veto-wielding members - the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia.

DARBY, Pennsylvania (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden on Wednesday accused President Donald Trump of ""surrendering"" to the coronavirus pandemic and failing to stay prepared for a resurgence that could put a U.S. economic recovery at risk.
""American people sacrificed so much to fight this virus... we may lose some the progress we've begun to make. All because he's lost interest,"" Biden said. ""Now he's just flat surrendering the fight.""
Trump is eager to reopen the economy and resume political campaigning even as coronavirus cases have started to rise again, with record increases reported this week in Oklahoma, Texas and Oregon. 
The president is planning his first rally since the coronavirus forced people to stay at home three months ago on Saturday in heavily Republican Oklahoma, over the objections of public health officials.
""He's so eager to get back to campaign rallies that he’s putting people at risk,"" Biden said in a speech near Philadelphia, his third visit to the key battleground state of Pennsylvania this month.
A spokesman for Trump's campaign, Ken Farnaso, called the speech a ""rehash"" of ""failed attacks"" on Trump's bipartisan approach to fighting the coronavirus.
""President Trump and the nation's governors have partnered up in the greatest public and private sector mobilization effort since [World War Two], while Biden has done nothing but sit on the sidelines fear-mongering and rooting against America's success,"" he said.
Biden is seeking to capitalize on a growing lead in national polls and to diminish Trump's advantage of being seen by voters as best equipped to rebuild the coronavirus-scarred economy.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll on Wednesday showed the Democrat with a 13-percentage-point lead. Still, 43% percent of registered voters said they thought Trump would be a better steward of the economy than Biden, against 38% who said Biden would be better. 
Commerce Department data on Tuesday showed U.S. retail sales rising by 17.7% last month, the most on record, after two straight months of sharp declines. That rebound is threatened by certain regions seeing a resurgence of the virus.
Biden has put forward a plan to reopen the economy including expanded coronavirus testing and protective equipment for people who go back to work, as well as paid sick leave, small-business grants and hiring a workforce to chart the disease's spread.
Before his speech on Wednesday, Biden met with business owners in Pennsylvania struggling to weather the pandemic. 

Trump won Pennsylvania by less than a percentage point in 2016, an unexpected victory along with wins in Wisconsin and Michigan that propelled him to the presidency.

NATO defence ministers are holding a virtual meeting this week amid growing tensions between Paris and Ankara. The two allies have traded barbs over the crisis in Libya, accusing each other of supporting opposing sides in the country's war.
French foreign ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said violations of the embargo, notably by Turkey, were the main obstacles to achieving peace and stability in Libya.
""Turkey’s support for the ongoing offensive of the Government of National Accord goes directly against efforts to secure an immediate truce,"" von de Muhll said.
""This support is coupled with hostile and unacceptable behaviour by the Turkish maritime forces towards NATO allies, aimed at hampering efforts to implement the United Nations arms embargo.""
Turkey, which backs the internationally recognised GNA authorities in Tripoli, has secured a foothold in Libya by helping to repel an assault on the capital by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
France, which has supported Haftar in the past, says it is not taking sides.
Paris' strong reaction appears to stem from an incident at the end of May when Turkish warships flashed their radar lights three times at the French Courbet warship in the eastern Mediterranean, a French defence official said. 
He said the Courbet, under NATO command, was carrying out a mission to check whether the Turkish vessel Cirkin was smuggling arms to Libya after it turned off its transponder, failed to identify itself and did not divulge its final destination.
A senior Turkish official rejected the accusation earlier in the day. He said French forces had sought to search a Turkish vessel in international waters ""and this was not permitted"", and that Turkey had taken no provocative or aggressive action to prevent this.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has committed to restoring voting rights to those with past felony convictions, according to a Radio Iowa report, potentially expanding the electorate in a state that could be competitive in the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Most U.S. states restrict voting for some people with felony convictions, but Iowa is the last state where felons are barred from voting even after serving their sentences, unless they successfully apply to the governor for restoration. 
The rule disenfranchised 2.2% of Iowa's voting-age population and 9.8% of African Americans in 2016, according to The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit organization that works on criminal justice.
Reynolds, a Republican, made the pledge on Tuesday, a day after she met with Black Lives Matter activists, who have held demonstrations in several Iowa cities since the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis last month.
Reynolds told reporters she was consulting with ""various groups,"" but would issue an executive order on voting rights for felons before the November election, Radio Iowa reported.
She did not go into detail about the terms of the order, and her office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Earlier this month, Reynolds signed a bill that would require felons to pay financial damages owed as part of their sentence, as well as serving their prison time, before regaining the right to vote.
A similar rule on financial obligations in Florida was struck down by a federal court last month, after voting rights groups argued it constituted a poll tax. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has appealed the ruling.

Republican President Donald Trump won Iowa by a 9.4% margin in the 2016 election, but a recent Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll of likely voters in the state had Trump at 44% versus 43% for his presumptive Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden.

CARACAS (Reuters) - After 14 weeks locked up in their homes, some Venezuelans are welcoming a decision by President Nicolas Maduro's government to relax a coronavirus lockdown, though doctors warn the measure could speed up contagion in the crisis-hit country.
""It's like restarting one's routine,"" said Yolimar Quintero, a 47-year-old lawyer working out in a Caracas gym, which opened its doors again on Monday and is enforcing mask use and temperature checks. ""I'm super happy.""
Nearby, Natalia Alvarez, a 38-year-old marketer lifted weights for the first time in weeks, alongside several dozen other gym-goers. ""It's normal that it makes you a bit afraid,"" she said.
Maduro decreed a national quarantine on March 17 to contain the virus, which so far has killed 26 people among 3,000 confirmed cases, according to the socialist government. Medical experts have expressed doubts about the government's testing regime and the validity of the official figures. [nL8N2BU6FL]
Authorities began to relax the lockdown on June 1, allowing some complexes like gyms, shopping centers and drive-in cinemas to open, while courts, schools and bars remain closed. 
Health workers warn that a recent acceleration in the number of cases coincides with the easing of lockdown measures, with the weekly case count rising from 45 to 450. They say Venezuela's dilapidated health system, where some hospitals lack basics like soap and running water, would be unable to deal with a significant leap in severely sick patients.
According to Julio Castro, an infectious diseases specialist advising Venezuela's opposition, the chance of infection is now 10 times higher than seven weeks ago. ""You decide if you protect yourself or not,"" Castro said on Twitter on June 14.

Maduro on Tuesday said the government could take ""drastic and radical"" measures to tighten the lockdown in the event of a new outbreak.

The toughest U.S. sanctions yet against Damascus came into effect on Wednesday under the Caesar Act, named after a Syrian military photographer who smuggled thousands of photos out of Syria showing mass killings, torture and other crimes. 
""It's a good decision. But what's important is that we don't get affected by it,"" said Baker al-Ali, 30, in the opposition-held Idlib region of the northwest.
""Today all the prices are irrationally high.""
Already battered by nearly a decade of war, the Syrian pound has collapsed in the last month, with dealers citing the impending sanctions as one of the factors driving demand for hard currency, along with a financial collapse in neighbouring Lebanon.
While the northwest corner falls outside Assad's rule, the Syrian pound is still used there. This month the pound has sunk to 3,000 to the dollar from 47 in 2011, when the conflict began.
The U.N. agency OCHA says the halving of its value since May has pushed the price of basic goods to record highs and further out of reach of the four million people in the northwest, where many Syrians fled as Assad recovered territory from rebels.
PRICE RISES
Syria has already been under U.S. and European Union sanctions but the new sanctions are more sweeping.
They exempt imports of essential food and humanitarian items but increase scrutiny of aid to ensure it does not benefit Assad's government.
""The economic situation here cannot bear yet another rise in prices. The (sanctions) should keep civilians out of harm's way,"" said Yusef Ghraibi, 24.
In government-held areas, too, the currency's collapse is biting hard.
""The prices of shoes increased 10,000 (pounds) from yesterday to today,"" said Abdulrahman Jlelati in Aleppo.
The U.N. special envoy to Syria warned this week of a ""dramatic collapse in economic conditions throughout the country"".
Western states want to see progress towards a political transition in Syria before they will help to rebuild the country.
Damascus says the new sanctions breach all international norms and are part of an economic war.

Assad, in a 2015 interview, dismissed the Caesar photos as ""allegations without evidence"", and part of a Qatar-funded plot against his government.

Despite decades of anti-narcotics efforts, Colombia remains one of the world's top cocaine producers. Leftist rebels, crime gangs and former right-wing paramilitaries are all involved in production and transport to consumers based largely in North America and Europe, according to security sources.
The area planted with coca fell 9% in 2019 to 154,000 hectares (381,000 acres) from 169,000 hectares the year before, the UNODC said. Potential cocaine output was 1,120 metric tonnes annually last year.
The increase in productivity is due to the concentration of coca-growing in specific areas, UNODC representative Pierre Lapaque said in a joint presentation with President Ivan Duque.
""Colombia continues forward, confronting this phenomena and also continuing to confront the organized armed groups that feed off and are fueled by illicit economies,"" Duque said. 
Some 18% of the country's coca is planted in forest reserves and about 16% on territory with primarily Afro-Colombian populations, Lapaque said.
The UNODC numbers were below recent estimates from the U.S. White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which says coca cultivations cover more than 200,000 hectares (494,211 acres). Duque has come under repeated pressure from the U.S. Trump administration to increase eradication.
Duque backs the re-introduction of aerial fumigation with glyphosate, which was suspended in 2015 after the World Health Organization said the herbicide could potentially cause cancer.

Duque's administration, which aims to eradicate 130,000 hectares (321,237 acres) of coca this year, is working to meet various health and environmental requirements demanded by the Constitutional Court before aerial fumigation can restart.

VIENNA (Reuters) - As anti-racism protesters topple statues of slave traders and colonisers worldwide, some nations are pondering how to mark their dark past. In Austria, debate over confronting one link to Adolf Hitler has taken decades, and it's not over yet.
Austria recently unveiled plans to convert the house where the Nazi leader was born, in the town of Braunau am Inn on the German border, into a police station.
It also suggested moving a rock that stands on the sidewalk outside, which is inscribed with an anti-fascist message, to a Vienna museum.
While many agree that the house should not be allowed to become a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis, the idea of removing the rock has upset some Jewish and survivors' groups who have said that Austria must confront its role in the Holocaust.
More consultations on the rock will now be held.
""Clearly (the government) wants to let the world forget that the worst mass murderer in history was born in Braunau,"" said Willi Mernyi, head of the Mauthausen Committee, Austria's main Holocaust survivors' group.
""This approach is wrong ... One must recognise what happened.""
'NEVER AGAIN'
The rock, which carries the inscriptions ""fascism never again"" and ""millions of dead"" but does not mention Hitler, was installed by the town in 1989.
At that point, Austria was moving away from its position of denying responsibility for the Holocaust, a post-war stance during which it described itself as the first victim of the Nazis.
Partly because of that, some say that Austria has done less to confront its Nazi past than neighbouring Germany.
""Sometimes it feels like something that is done as a chore rather than a commitment made out of deep conviction,"" said Gerhard Baumgartner, a historian and scientific director at the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance. 
While progress has been made in terms of education on the Holocaust and erecting memorials since the 1980s, Jewish and survivors' groups say more remains to be done, especially in explaining how widespread and systemic the Nazis' crimes were.
""That is very important - that people really know there was something everywhere,"" said Charlotte Herman, head of the group officially representing the Jewish community in the province of Upper Austria, which includes Braunau.
She and Mernyi mentioned the ""Stolpersteine"", or ""stumbling blocks"", project as one way to raise awareness.
Originally a German initiative, it involves laying small brass plaques to Holocaust victims in the pavement at relevant places, like where they lived.
Those plaques cover a fraction of Holocaust victims, but are a relatively common sight in Vienna, where a notoriously repressive and anti-Semitic system was put in place with local support after Hitler's Germany annexed Austria in 1938.
""In all of Austria, in every corner, in front of almost everyone's door, something happened, whether it's death marches, people walking past and dying in the street,"" said Herman.
Hitler's role in history is well known, so there is no need to spell it out in great detail at the house, she added. But attention should be called to the building.

""Because this is where evil was in fact born.""

London Mayor Sadiq Khan's office confirmed the uncovering was linked to Macron's visit, which marks the 80th anniversary of General Charles de Gaulle's radio address to France after the Nazi invasion in 1940, broadcast from London by the BBC.
The plinth of Churchill's statue outside parliament was daubed with graffiti that said ""Churchill was a racist"" during a Black Lives Matter march 10 days ago.
The authorities feared it was at risk of further damage following the toppling of a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th century slave trader, by protesters in Bristol in southwest England.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, an admirer and biographer of Churchill, said it was ""absurd and deplorable"" that the monument should have been in any danger.

Churchill expressed racist and anti-Semitic views and critics blame him for denying food to India during the 1943 famine which killed more than 2 million people - aspects of his legacy which some say are not scrutinised enough.

The coin has the phrase ""after darkness, I hope for light"" written around its edge in Latin. It features a shaft of light illuminating the year 2020 and spelling out SOS, the international distress signal, in shadow.
""We wanted to say 'thank you' to the medics, the medical workers, public transport drivers, to thank teachers who worked at a distance, the shop workers and those who stayed in self- isolation and kept the virus from spreading,"" said Asta Kuniyoshi, deputy governor of Lithuania's central bank.
""So the coin is a coin of hope because, even at the darkest point, we believed that by staying together we would reach the light,"" she said.
The coin is minted in silver with a nominal value of five euros and in copper and nickel with a nominal value of 1.5 euros.
The bank decided on the coin in March, when the country went into lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus, partly to reuse blanks intended for coins to mark the cancelled events of 2020, including the Tokyo Olympics.
Lithuania, with a population of around 2.8 million, and its fellow Baltic states of Latvia and Estonia have been relatively unscathed by the new coronavirus so far. To date, Lithuania has confirmed 1,778 cases of COVID-19 and 76 deaths. 

Lithuania lifted most lockdown restrictions in May, but the central bank still expects the economy to contract by 9.7% this year. [nL8N2CW8Y0] [nS3N28800T]

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's chief executive, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Wednesday that the bloc will do its best to seal an agreement on new ties with Britain by the end of the year but will not compromise its core values, notably on fair competition.
Britain left the EU, the world's largest trading bloc, on Jan. 31 after 47 years of membership, to the huge regret of the EU, and there has been little progress on designing a new relationship with a year-end deadline looming.
""The negotiations with the UK always promised to be difficult and they have not disappointed,"" von der Leyen, the head of the European Commission, told the European Parliament. 
""We are now halfway through these negotiations with five months left to go. But we're definitely not halfway through the work to reach an agreement ... We will do all in our power to reach an agreement.""
She said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had confirmed to her this week that London would not seek to prolong negotiations on a new EU-UK trade deal beyond December.
The EU says Britain cannot retain all the economic and trading benefits it had as an EU member, while London says Brussels is not showing enough flexibility.
""We're ready to be creative to find common ground,"" von der Leyen said.
But she went on to say said there could be no deal without ""level playing field"" guarantees of fair competition, and agreements on fisheries and on dispute-settling mechanisms.
""ADVANCE TOGETHER"" 
The EU insists that Britain must commit to maintaining EU standards on everything from state aid to labour to environment regulations to prevent it undercutting EU products in the future.
""It should be a shared interest for the European Union and the UK to never slide backwards and always advance together towards highest standards,"" von der Leyen said.
She also said Britain must offer legal guarantees that it would handle sensitive data on EU citizens correctly if it wanted access to the bloc's databases or close judicial and police cooperation.
Any deal sealed between the 27 EU states and Britain will eventually need ratification by the European Parliament. Some lawmakers called for preparations in case the talks fail. 
""It's going to be difficult. It's possible but the time is very short,"" the bloc's Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, told the same hearing. 
""It's the choice of the UK whether they want an agreement, or not, because the conditions for an agreement are already known.""
Barnier said EU-UK talks will intensify through July, August and September, and called for a deal to cover not only trade but also security, environmental standards and welfare rights: 

""Our priority is and remains to be to reach an agreement. But we also have the responsibility to prepare for all possible scenarios, whether there is an agreement or there isn't.""

Mostar, famous for its Ottoman-era Old Bridge, has not held local elections since 2008 because the two rival ethnic parties failed to enforce a 2010 constitutional court decision on power-sharing, leaving the town without a city council and halting development and investment.
Bosnia is set to hold a local election on Nov. 15, but election authorities had exempted Mostar due to the lack of election rules for the city.
Heads of the Bosniak Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) signed an agreement in Mostar defining the election rules for the city and its statute.
""SDA and HDZ will submit the proposal...to the parliament next week so that elections here can be held alongside the Bosnia-wide local vote,"" HDZ head Dragan Covic told reporters in Mostar.
The deadlock in Mostar, divided between Bosniaks and Croats since the end of Bosnia's 1992-95 war, stems from the distrust between the two groups. The Bosniaks, who are the minority in Mostar want safeguards to make sure they are not out-voted. The Croats, in the majority, want the town unified.
""This is a feast for democracy,"" said Austrian diplomat Valentin Inzko, who oversaw negotiations between the two parties along with the U.S. Ambassador and the head of the European Union delegation.
Western peace overseers have tried for years to unite the city and create a single administration. 
Covic and Bakir Izetbegovic, the head of SDA, said the election law could be changed by the end of 2021.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed its toughest sanctions ever targeting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to choke off revenue for his government in a bid to force it back to United Nations-led negotiations and broker an end to the country's nearly decade-long war.
The fresh round of sanctions on Syria which Washington dubbed as the first taste of a deeper and broader pressure campaign against Assad come at a time when the Syrian leader is grappling with a deepening economic crisis after a decade of war and amid a rare outbreak of protests in government-held areas.
The new travel restrictions and financial sanctions strike Assad's inner circle, including his wife Asma, whom along with her family Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described as ""one of Syria's most notorious war profiteers."" They also target Assad's brother, sister, a few senior generals and Iranian militia. 
In a statement announcing the designations imposed under an executive order and the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act - the latter signed by President Donald Trump in December - Pompeo said the new steps were the start of a sustained campaign of economic and political pressure against Assad, and vowed more in the coming weeks.
""We anticipate many more sanctions and we will not stop until Assad and his regime stop their needless, brutal war against the Syrian people and the Syrian government agrees to a political solution to the conflict,"" Pompeo said.
'BROKEN COUNTRY'
Syria has already been under U.S. and European Union sanctions that have frozen the assets of the state and hundreds of companies and individuals. Washington already bans export and investment in Syria by Americans, as well as transactions involving oil and hydrocarbon products.
But the new sanctions can freeze the assets of anyone dealing with Syria, regardless of nationality, and cover many more sectors. It also targets those dealing with entities from Russia and Iran, Assad's main backers.
In a call with reporters, a senior administration official said investment plans in areas, including in reconstruction, that were to aid Assad's government had already fizzled out due to fear of the Caesar Act. ""It's meant to keep the foreign investors out,"" he said.
Several analysts agreed. 
""If you are engaging in these sectors, you will be cut off from the U.S. financial system, which is the most powerful in the world. For you as a company, you choose between that and investing in a broken country,"" said Elizabeth Tsurkov, a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. 
Pompeo said those designated have all played a key role in obstructing a peaceful political solution to the conflict. But he singled out Asma al-Assad.
""I will make special note of the designation for the first time of Asma al-Assad, the wife of Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of her husband and members of her Akhras family has become one of Syria’s most notorious war profiteers,"" he said.

Syrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread hardship among ordinary residents, where the currency collapse has led to soaring prices and people struggling to afford food and basic supplies.

PARIS (Reuters) - As dawn broke on May 16, an elite French police team blew open the door to an apartment in a sleepy northwestern Parisian suburb where they found Felicien Kabuga, suspected of bankrolling the genocide against Rwanda's Tutsis in 1994.
The arrest marked the end of a 26-year manhunt for Kabuga, who used 28 aliases and relied on powerful connections in both Africa and Europe to evade justice, investigators say. In the end, his health failing, he was protected by some of his 11 children, but it was these same ties that helped uncover his whereabouts.
Interviews with 14 security officials and diplomats shed light on how Kabuga managed to live undetected for so long, despite the fact he had a $5 million bounty on his head and was facing seven counts of genocide and crimes https://tinyurl.com/y9mrcuq2 against humanity for his alleged role in the slaughter of 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
""It was a bombshell. Everyone had forgotten about him,"" said Alain Gauthier who, with his Rwandan-born wife Dafroza, has tracked Rwandan genocide suspects for 20 years.
Investigators accuse Kabuga, 87, a one-time tea and coffee tycoon, of financing, arming and inciting Hutu militias. They also say he used a radio station that he had co-founded to fan ethnic hatred in Rwanda, a landlocked country in the heart of Africa.
Kabuga told a French court on May 27 that the charges laid against him by an international tribunal were lies. ""I have not killed any Tutsis. I was working with them,"" he said.
Kabuga was in bed in the flat in Asnieres-sur Seine, just a 25-minute drive from the Eiffel Tower, when the police burst in. At first he feigned confusion at an interpreter speaking Kinyarwanda, an official language of Rwanda. He responded in Kiswahili, a language spoken widely across central Africa. His name, he said, was Antoine Tounga and he came from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
But a scar on his neck from 2007 throat surgery, which was detailed in an Interpol red ""wanted"" notice, gave him away. Two hours later, a DNA test proved that Tounga was indeed Kabuga.
The octogenarian had undergone the throat operation in Germany and it is still not clear when he moved to France, where he is now known to have lived for at least four years. 
""This was deeply embarrassing for us because he was here all this time under our noses. That reflects terribly on us,"" said a French source close to the investigation.
FAMILY CIRCLES 
Police said the third-floor apartment was rented out by his son, Alain Habumukiza, whose family name was on a letter box in the block's foyer. Another son, Donatien Nshimyumuremyi, was in the flat when the police arrived. He is based in Belgium but moved to Asnieres during the coronavirus outbreak, presumably to take care of his father, investigators said.
Under French law, children cannot be charged for trying to protect their parents from arrest.
Two neighbours thought Kabuga had lived in Asnieres for three years. Another said as many as five. They described a discreet man who had become increasingly housebound. 
""He was always accompanied by a younger man or woman, probably his children,"" said one of the neighbours, who declined to be named. ""He seemed weak, tired and had mobility issues."" 
Court documents presented by Kabuga's defence team and seen by Reuters show that he made at least 10 visits to the Beaujon hospital in northern Paris since 2016, always using the Tounga alias. 
He received a brain MRI scan on Jan. 25 of that year and subsequently had scans to his stomach and colon. He underwent surgery twice in 2019, the documents show. One of his daughters would accompany him to translate, Kabuga's lawyer said.
In a statement to reporters on May 29, Kabuga's family said he had a colectomy last year and suffered from diabetes, hypertension and dementia.
After Tutsi rebels backed by the Ugandan army took control of Rwanda in July 1994, millions of Hutu fled and Kabuga initially went to Switzerland. At the time, there was no arrest warrant for him and he was allowed to withdraw money from a bank before heading to the Democratic Republic of Congo, said a legal source who has tracked his flight.
He was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) in 1997. Investigators believed he was living in Kenya and Interpol repeatedly informed Kenyan police of locations where he had been sighted, a source in Europe said, but there is no record that any action was taken. The Kenyan government denied accusations by both the ICTR and Washington that the country was sheltering Kabuga. 
In 2003, Kabuga was nearly captured after an associate, a Kenyan journalist called William Munuhe, tried to cash in on the U.S. bounty by tipping off U.S. agents to the fugitive's location. But Munuhe was discovered dead in his house before he had a chance to contact the waiting U.S. security team, and the trail subsequently went cold. 
Kenyan police told Munuhe's family at the time that he had died from carbon monoxide poisoning. But his brother Mureithi Munuhe said he was murdered to thwart the U.S.-led operation. ""His face had been disfigured by acid and I had to ask the mortuary attendants to push his tongue back so we could identify him using his teeth,"" Mureithi told Reuters. 
U.S. embassy officials in Paris said they had no comment to make on the Kabuga case. 
HOSPITAL BILLS
Kabuga's trace was picked up again in 2007 in Germany when his son-in-law, Augustin Ngirabatware, Rwanda's planning minister in 1994, was arrested near Frankfurt. A person familiar with the case said Ngirabatware, now serving a 30-year prison term for incitement to genocide, had harboured Kabuga. 
Lawyer Richard Gisagara, who represents Rwandan expatriates in France and has filed a judicial complaint to initiate an investigation into who aided Kabuga, believes that only close family knew of his whereabouts in recent years. 
""They needed to keep it secret. The bounty on his head meant that if it went beyond that small family circle, there would have been a leak,"" Gisagara said. 
After more than a decade living on scraps of possible sightings in Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain, U.N. prosecutor Serge Brammertz, based in The Hague, changed tack in 2019 and decided to focus on the children. Operation ""955"", named after the U.N. resolution that created the ICTR, was launched. When the coronavirus lockdown paralysed most of Europe, it freed up time for investigators to focus on Kabuga's file.
""The children who protected their father always led back to Asnieres-sur-Seine,"" said Eric Emeraux, head of the French police's Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity.
One of the daughters travelled frequently between Britain and Belgium, often staying for periods in Paris. Her cell phone calls routed to the Asnieres area. So too did calls from his other offspring. 
Investigators also unearthed a 10,000-euro ($11,260) transfer to the Beaujon hospital in the summer of 2019 by one of Kabuga's daughters, Bernadette Uwamariya.
""The 10,000 euros corresponded to a downpayment for the (colon) operation,"" said a source aware of the transfer. A hospital bill for a further 65,000 euros remained unpaid, the source said. A second source said the patient was identified on records as Antoine Tounga. 
The Paris hospital group AP-HP, which manages Beaujon, said it would not to comment on the case.
For investigators, the transfer was the last piece in the jigsaw, enabling them to match DNA samples from the Beaujon hospital with samples from Germany and provide them with a copy of the Congolese passport Kabuga was using. 
DRC officials did not respond to requests for comment on how Kabuga held a legitimate Congolese passport. A French diplomatic source said Kabuga most likely entered France undetected on a regular, European Union Schengen visa. Reuters could not independently confirm this.
Kabuga is being held in a Paris jail ahead of transfer to a U.N. tribunal in The Hague or Tanzania. Rights activists fear he might manage to escape justice once more.

""We can only regret that this arrest has come so late. Given his age and his health, we don't know whether the tribunal will be able to complete his trial,"" said Gauthier.

The coalition that has been battling the Iran-aligned movement for five years said in a statement that it had targeted armed members of the group. The Houthi health minister had said 13 civilians, including four children, were killed in Monday's air strike. 
Both sides have released footage as proof. Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the videos or when or where they were taken.
The United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, Lise Grande, said in a statement on Tuesday that initial field reports indicated that at least 12 civilians, including four children, were killed in strikes on a vehicle in Saada.
""We share our deepest condolences with the bereaved families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives in this terrible, unjustified attack,"" Grande said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hackers posed as recruiters working for U.S. defence giants Collins Aerospace and General Dynamics (N:GD) on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) to break into the networks of military contractors in Europe, cybersecurity researchers said on Wednesday.
The cyber spies were able to compromise the systems of at least two defence and aerospace firms in Central Europe last year by approaching employees with pseudo job offers from the U.S. firms, Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET said.
The attackers then used LinkedIn's private messaging feature to send documents containing malicious code which the employees were tricked into opening, said Jean-Ian Boutin, ESET's head of threat research.
ESET declined to name the victims, citing client confidentiality, and said it was unclear if any information was stolen. General Dynamics and Collins Aerospace, which is owned by Raytheon Technologies (N:RTX), declined immediate comment.
ESET was unable to determine the identity of the hackers but said the attacks had some links to a North Korean group known as Lazarus, which has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of orchestrating a string of high-profile cyber heists on victims including  Sony  (NYSE:SNE) Pictures and the Central Bank of Bangladesh.
North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The attacks are not the first time LinkedIn has been caught up in international espionage. Western officials have repeatedly accused China of using fake LinkedIn accounts to recruit spies in other countries, and multiple hacking groups have been spotted using the business-networking site to profile their targets.
But ESET's Boutin said hacking attempts are usually conducted via email. ""This is the first case I am aware of where LinkedIn was used to deliver the malware itself,"" he said.

LinkedIn said it had identified and deleted the accounts used in the attacks. ""We actively seek out signs of state-sponsored activity on the platform and quickly take action against bad actors,"" said the company's head of trust and safety, Paul Rockwell.

Bolsonaro, a right-wing politician, has in recent weeks endorsed supporters who have staged illegal protests calling for military intervention and the closure of the Supreme Court, which the president says is not allowing him to govern the country.
The Supreme Court has authorized investigations into alleged interference by the president in federal police appointments for personal motives, and is now investigating the movement that is pushing for the court's closure as well as Congress.
The clash has triggered a political crisis and fears that it could undermine Brazil's young democracy as the country struggles to overcome the world's worst coronavirus outbreak outside of the United States. 
The court's investigation into the anti-democratic rallies led to the arrest of its most militant leaders and raids of homes and offices of alleged organizers. Now, in seeking the movement's funders, it is also lifting bank account secrecy and issuing subpoenas for communication records of federal lawmakers close to Bolsonaro.
""They are committing abuses, that is clear,"" Bolsonaro told supporters as he left his official residence in comments posted on social media.
""What happened yesterday, piercing lawmakers' privacy, does not have any precedent in a democracy, even a fragile one. It's time to put everything in its rightful place.""

The election law amendments mean that 50% of those elected to the 596-member House of Representatives will now be chosen through closed party lists, up from 20%, with the rest elected as individual candidates. 
All of those currently elected on the closed-list system belong to a pro-Sisi coalition. The president's right to appoint up to 28 members remains unchanged.
Members of parliament who introduced the changes said they would help achieve constitutional commitments to allocate 25% of seats to women and assure representation for other groups including workers, farmers, young people, Coptic Christians, people with disabilities and Egyptians living abroad.
But critics, including a small parliamentary opposition bloc, say the closed-list system works against fair representation.
""We believe that doing elections with the absolute closed-list system is rigging the will of the people,"" said Haitham al-Hariri, a member of the bloc. 
Parliament also approved a law for electing a second chamber, or Senate, established through constitutional amendments last year.
The Senate will be an advisory body without legislative powers. It will have 300 seats and a five-year mandate, with 100 members elected via closed lists and 100 as individuals. The president will appoint the rest. 
No dates have been set for elections to the two chambers though parliament's five-year mandate expires in January.
Last year constitutional amendments allowing Sisi to stay in office till 2030, expanding his power over the judiciary and bolstering the military's role were approved by referendum.

Supporters said Sisi had stabilized Egypt and needed more time to complete economic reforms. Critics feared a further narrowing of the space for dissent and opposition after a wide-ranging crackdown.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A black European Union lawmaker said on Wednesday she was a victim of ""extremely traumatic"" police violence outside a Brussels railway station, and lodged a complaint against Belgian police.
Pierrette Herzberger-Fofana, a German Green party deputy who was born in Mali, told the European Parliament she was pushed and grabbed by four officers on Tuesday after she began to film police harassing two young black people outside the Gare du Nord.
A police spokeswoman said an investigation into the incident was under way but denied violence had been used. 
""Four of those armed police officers brutally pushed me against the wall, they grabbed my handbag away from me, spread my legs and a police officer wanted to frisk me and they dealt with me in a very humiliating way,"" she told the parliament.
Herzberger-Fofana said police did not react when she said she was a member of the European Parliament, showed her two passports, Belgian residency card and official EU accreditation.
""I feel this is a discriminatory act with underlying racist tendencies,"" Herzberger-Fofana said.
The May 25 death of black American George Floyd in police custody has led to weeks of protests in the United States against racism and policy brutality, and prompted more European citizens to challenge discrimination in society. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday told the parliament she was aware of the lack of black staff and commissioners in the bloc's executive.
""The time has come for us to do more than just ... condemn racism, we have to take this opportunity to talk about racism openly and frankly,"" von der Leyen said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis paid tribute on Wednesday to hundreds of thousands of seafarers stuck on ships due to the coronavirus pandemic, a situation the United Nations has said poses a risk to the safe operation of the world's merchant fleet.
In a special video message for sea workers, Francis said the work of maritime personnel and fishermen had been made even more important during the pandemic because it was providing the world with food and other primary needs.
He said they had been hit particularly hard by the ripple effects of the pandemic.
""In these past months, your lives and your work have seen significant changes; you have had to make, and are continuing to make, many sacrifices,"" Francis said.
""Long periods spent aboard ships without being able to disembark, separation from families, friends and native countries, fear of infection...All these things are a heavy burden to bear, now more than ever.""
About 90% of world trade is transported by sea and continued complications with changing over ship crews due to restrictions against the coronavirus in some jurisdictions is still affecting supply chains despite a widespread easing of lockdowns.
On Tuesday, Kitack Lim, Secretary-General of the U.N.'s International Maritime Organization, said some seafarers had been marooned at sea for 15 months, well over the 11-month maximum laid out in a maritime labour convention, and a situation he described as a ""humanitarian crisis"".
In his message, the pope thanked them for the hardships they are enduring. ""I would like to say something to all of you. Know that you are not alone and that you are not forgotten,"" he said. 

The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF), which represents seafarers, told them on Monday that it was no longer acceptable to force crews to work.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European lawmakers lobbied by fathers who cannot see children taken by Japanese mothers urged Tokyo on Tuesday to combat the ""abduction"" of minors by one parent and change a law that does not recognise joint custody after a split.
In a resolution passed unanimously, the European Parliament's petitions committee said it was concerned about the practice of ""parental child abduction"" and Japanese authorities' reluctance to comply with international law.
Various European Union (EU) citizens living in Japan, including Frenchman Vincent Fichot and Italian Tommaso Perina, had been asking for action.
Critics also say there is lack of enforcement of court decisions in Japan to return children to their country of habitual residence, as provided under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction.
The EU lawmakers voted to urge Japan to enforce international norms and align laws with global rules, specifically the United Nations' convention on child rights. 
Unlike most countries, Japan does not recognise joint custody after divorce and children often lose contact with the non-custodial parent.
An official at Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the government had no comment, adding that it would continue to explain its actions to the EU and member states.
Figures from Japan's foreign ministry this month show that of 35 return orders decided in court in the six years since Tokyo joined the Hague Convention, three were not returned, while another three cases are waiting to be carried out.
The plight of left-behind parents last year prompted French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Giuseppe Conte to raise their concerns with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. 
Parents such as Fichot and Perina could not be immediately reached for comment on the EU parliament resolution. 
Beyond Europe, an Australian man, Scott McIntyre, was the latest foreigner to raise his voice over the issue in Japan. He was detained for trespassing when he went to his in-laws' apartment to seek information on his two children.
Charity Kizuna Child-Parent Reunion estimates that roughly 150,000 children lose contact with a parent every year in Japan because of estrangement from the non-custodial parent.

KYIV (Reuters) - A wealthy Ukrainian politician has made public a manuscript in his private collection that he says is a fragment of the Gutenberg Bible, the world's first substantial printed book, although researchers said it would need to be authenticated.
The Gutenberg Bible was produced using the moveable type printing press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in Germany in the 15th century. Only a few dozen volumes still exist and researchers struggle to collect information about scattered fragments.
Viktor Medvedchuk, a lawmaker with ties to Russia, listed the manuscript in a wealth declaration made mandatory for elected officials in an anti-corruption reform in 2016.
Last Friday, he put the single leaf, covered in two columns of dense, black type with red rubrics, on display for Reuters in Kyiv. He said he purchased it on advice of consultants in around 2011-2012, although he refused to say at what price. 
""I bought it right away and honestly, I did not even bargain for the price,"" said Medvedchuk, whose collection of old books contains around 8,000 volumes, including first editions of poets Alexander Pushkin and Taras Shevchenko.
At an auction http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/lot.28.html/2016/bible-collection-of-charles-caldwell-ryrie-n09539 in December 2016 at Sotheby's in New York, a single leaf of a Gutenberg Bible sold for $47,500. 
Medvedchuk said he did not know how the fragment arrived in Ukraine but that it comes from a bible acquired last century by American bookseller Gabriel Wells, who sold his copy piece by piece. 
Valentyna Bochkovska, Director of the Museum of Book and Printing of Ukraine, found out about the fragment from media reports and said experts would need to determine whether it was authentic. 
""Usually, experts do not trust when there is only one leaf. That is why ... a special chemical-based analysis should be done,"" Bochkovska said. 
Stephan Fussel, the Gutenberg Chair at the University of Mainz, told Deutsche Welle that he hoped Medvedchuk would give international researchers more information so that they could determine which book this fragment belongs to.

""We are ready to provide (access),"" Medvedchuk said.

HANOI (Reuters) - A British pilot in Vietnam stricken with COVID-19 who at one point seemed close to death has almost fully recovered and is in a position to be discharged from hospital, a Vietnamese medical official said on Wednesday.
The case of Stephen Cameron has attracted national attention in Vietnam, where a combination of targeted testing and aggressive quarantine has kept its coronavirus tally to an impressively low 335 cases, and zero deaths.
""The patient can leave now, but the most important thing is that he practises physical therapy,"" said Luong Ngoc Khue, a health ministry official, according to a government Statement.
The 43-year-old Scot arrived in Vietnam from Britain in early March to work for Vietnam Airlines, according to state media. He was one of 19 people who visited a bar in Ho Chi Minh City on March 13 where a cluster of coronavirus cases was discovered, and was initially identified as ""Patient 91"".
On March 17, he piloted his first flight for Vietnam Airlines to Hanoi, the capital. Three days later, he was hospitalised with COVID-19 symptoms.
By early April, Cameron was on a ventilator and life support machine at Ho Chi Minh City's Hospital of Tropical Diseases. In May, medical officials said the disease had reduced his lung capacity to 10% and that he urgently needed a lung transplant. 
With the vast majority of Vietnam's COVID-19 patients already recovered, the news of a potential first death prompted a national outpouring of support, with dozens of people coming forward as potential lung donors.
Weeks later, however, Cameron regained consciousness after his condition began to improve. He was taken off life support and will soon no longer require assistance from a ventilator to breathe, according to state media, and he no longer needs a lung transplant, said Luong Ngoc Khue.
In footage released on Wednesday, Cameron could be seen posing with a yellow and red Motherwell Football Club scarf as he met local officials and a British diplomat.
""I told him that he would be soon healthy enough to return to England,"" Khue said. ""He replied, very quickly, that he was from Scotland.""($1 = 23,196.0000 dong)

Parliament passed the amendment to the education law on Tuesday, pushing Romania's sexual politics onto the same authoritarian track as neighbouring Hungary and Poland.
The bill, approved without public debate, would consign Romanian education ""back to the Middle Ages,"" student associations said in a statement.
The groups, along with universities, said the amendment contravened human rights and freedom of expression, and urged President Klaus Iohannis - who is on record as advocating equality and who must sign all bills into law - to reject it.

""As such, they are directly responsible for all transgender people who are discriminated (against).""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - When Russians vote this month on whether to allow President Vladimir Putin to potentially stay in power until 2036, they will decide on a bundle of measures from economic sweeteners to political reforms for traditionalists. 
They include inflation-adjusted pensions, a fairer minimum wage, enshrining a reference to God in the constitution, and defining heterosexual marriage as the only true form of wedlock.
Authorities have highlighted those changes in their campaign rather than the reform that would let Putin run again for president twice after his current term expires in 2024. 
Voters will only answer one question: if they approve or reject the entire bundle of constitutional changes. 
Critics see this as a crude but effective Kremlin ploy to win support for a move that could keep Putin in power for longer than Soviet dictator Josef Stalin by lumping it in with reforms that have mass appeal or mobilise certain groups. 
Polls by the independent Levada Centre opinion pollster show Russians are divided over letting Putin extend his rule. But they also show overwhelming support for the economic benefits.
""They included what people actually wanted,"" said Denis Volkov, a sociologist at Levada, who said some voters recognised the tradeoff. ""You give us on the economic side and we'll support your political amendments."" 
Many Russians remain embittered over a 2018 pension age hike and frustrated by years of falling incomes and living standards that have slipped again due to the coronavirus lockdown.
Overall, 44% of Russians support the amendments against 32% against, according to Levada's latest polling data, with those who oppose much less likely to vote.
Voting will run from June 25 to July 1.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said earlier this month there were many reforms on offer and it was not possible to single out one. Most Russians and the country's main political forces back the changes, he said.

""It's a smokescreen,"" countered Dmitry Gudkov, an opposition politician. ""They're trying to conceal Putin's real intention of getting a mandate to rule forever.""

413,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>","Special Report: The pub and the pandemic - Regulars, suppliers, owner adrift in lockdown","By Reade Levinson
LONDON (Reuters) - When the Greenwich Pensioner was built in 1827, the girl who would become Queen Victoria was 8 years old and John Quincy Adams was serving as the sixth president of the United States.
Since then, the pub in London's East End has survived two world wars, including bombings that flattened the houses next to it, four cholera epidemics and the devastating Spanish flu pandemic of a century ago.
It has also survived another kind of blight: a decades-long decline in the industry that has killed thousands of British pubs. The working-class Poplar neighbourhood, which long ago buzzed with workers from the nearby shipping docks on the Thames, once was home to more than 340 pubs. Today, just 12 remain.
Now the Pensioner faces yet another existential threat. On March 20, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered the closure of Britain's pubs and restaurants to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has now killed more than 50,000 people in the United Kingdom. After the announcement, owner Tadgh Barry shut the Pensioner's narrow wooden doors and walked away from the pub that he had brought back to life two years ago.
He left behind the kind of place where old-school East Enders stopped round at 4 o'clock for their daily pint. Where wayward businesspeople walked the 20 minutes from the steel-and-glass skyscrapers of the Canary Wharf financial district. Where local Member of Parliament Apsana Begum and her campaigners could sometimes be spotted at a table by the window.
Under lockdown, the regulars are reduced to virtual pub nights with friends on Zoom and solitary pints behind the locked doors of self-isolation, barred from places so central to British social life, the word pub is an abbreviation of their original name: ""public houses.""
Pubs – and London pubs in particular – loom large in British popular culture. ""EastEnders,"" a long-running BBC soap opera, revolves around a watering hole called the Queen Vic. Harry Potter entered Diagon Alley, London's wizardry emporium, through another fictional pub called the Leaky Cauldron.
When the coronavirus pandemic struck, many Brits tweeted that they wanted to ""go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all this to blow over."" That's a line from the cult comedy ""Shaun Of the Dead,"" in which the eponymous hero survives a zombie invasion by sheltering in a London pub called the Winchester Tavern.
""The pub is there to stave off the chilblains of loneliness for a lot of people,"" said Alistair von Lion, 39, a London pub reviewer and fan of the Pensioner, whose sign bears a painting of a peg-legged Royal Navy pensioner from two centuries ago.
""It feels old, it feels London, it's not been touched by time,"" he said. ""You're drinking it in, the atmosphere, and that's part of what makes the perfect pub.""
The impact of its closure rippled out through the community the pub sustained.
The Pensioner is part of a network of small businesses that rely on one another. Barry gets his meat from a butcher in Bethnal Green, some of his beer from a brewery in Tottenham Hale and his vodka and gin from the East London Liquor Company.
Three months after the shutdown, the government appears to be moving toward reopening the country's pubs as the summer beckons and coronavirus infections fall. For now, however, the Pensioner's wooden chairs and plush red benches are empty, and it's hard to imagine a time when they'll be full once again with drinkers sitting elbow to elbow, leaning in close to chat over the din of the pub.
Barry says he can feel the ghosts of the past at the Pensioner. These days, it feels like they're keeping company with the ghosts of the present, too.
THE OWNER
In 1807, the East India Dock Company cleared the land that would later house the Pensioner, razing a terrace of brickmakers' cottages and laying out streets named after the company's directors: Wells, Woolmore and Cotton.
After All Saints Church was built in 1823, the land west of Bazely Street – named for a British admiral who captured an American warship during the War of Independence – was auctioned off by the vestry. And in 1827, James Hammack of Mile End built the Greenwich Pensioner public house.
When Barry found the Pensioner two years ago, he fell in love with the still-lovely tiled exterior of the Grade II-listed building, a marking that identifies the structure's historical and architectural significance. The interior, on the other hand, had seen better days.
""It was the outside of the place. It's beautiful,"" said Barry, a 36-year-old craft beer aficionado who had spent more than a decade behind the bar at other pubs. ""It wasn't so beautiful within.""
Even though some locals said the place seemed cursed because of a string of unlucky owners, Barry saw potential in the regenerating neighbourhood. And he came to think of himself as the Pensioner's last chance.
""Underneath the layers of green paint, I knew there was beauty,"" he said.
After months of work, Barry reopened the pub, transforming it from a scruffy one-room boozer to a cozy hub of the residential area. He'd thrown his heart into the redecoration. He commissioned his best friend, a carpenter, to rebuild the wooden bar, and did much of the mossy-green paintwork himself. But he didn't erase the pub's past: In the men's toilet, sepia-toned photographs show men in caps and three-piece suits outside an older iteration of the Greenwich Pensioner, beneath signs for ""Taylor Walker & Co."" and ""Ales Stout & Porter.""
The community welcomed back the Pensioner with open arms. But this year, even before the shutdown, times were hard for the pub. A week before temporarily closing his doors, Barry wrote on the Pensioner's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page: ""Tough start to year for pubs. Dry January hits us with the same force as a spade to the face. February was so wet no one could be arsed to leave their house/flat. Now in March, Coronavirus has struck fear in to a nation.""
The closure left him crushed.
""At the moment, that pub is just a glorified storage unit. It's where my stuff is kept, but I don't get to use it,"" he said back in April.
By that time, he had spent a month at home, taking care of his 2-year-old son, Zephan, and waiting out the lockdown. But as the situation worsened in Britain, he figured it would be a long time before he would open again.
""Pubs will be one of the last things to be allowed to get back to normal because they're not considered an essential part of life – although it depends on how you look at it,"" he said. ""I think they're essential.""
The government did designate liquor stores as essential businesses, and they've remained open in the lockdown. Some breweries and pubs have recently reopened to sell alcohol for takeaway only.
To keep busy, Barry began offering a weekly, curated beer scheme to friends and customers. He calls it ""A Good Drop"" and packages the boxes of six hand-picked craft beers in a garden shed, working alongside his wife, who is a fashion designer, and Zephan.
""People are thinking: 'I'll buy from this guy. It might cost a couple of quid more, but I'm helping him survive and come out the other side,'"" Barry said. His usually cheery face turned somber when asked about the pub's finances. 
""You can't completely stop your outgoings,"" he said. ""You can furlough your staff and shut your doors, but the landlord is still going to want to be paid.""
THE REGULAR
For Dave Gurney, a Pensioner regular who lives around the corner from the pub, the shutdown put a pause on many of his friendships.
""I didn't know many people around here until I started going to that pub,"" said Gurney, 42, who has lived in the area for 11 years. Before the lockdown, he spent at least three afternoons a week at the Pensioner. Now, his regular table gathers dust in the corner beside cardboard boxes filled with glassware.
His drinking mate, a 70-year-old East Ender whom everyone knows as ""Old Jack,"" hasn't emerged from his flat across the street except to tell Gurney through the mail slot that he's doing all right.
It's probably for the best, said Gurney, who worries about the toll the virus might take on the man.
Gurney, who works as a software engineer for the government, has been subscribing to Barry's beer delivery service. He feels a sense of loyalty to the pub and to Barry, and he's been looking after the building during lockdown.
""You can tell someone who knows how to run a pub,"" he said. ""The way he decorated, done it up and the effort he put into it.""
Last month, Gurney stopped by the shuttered pub with his 4-year-old daughter to spend a couple hours with Barry while he was being photographed for this article. Barry asked if he was enjoying the week's beer selection, which featured a New England IPA from Pressure Drop Brewing.
He nodded, but then added, ""It's not the same.""
THE SUPPLIER
Two hours north of the pub in Upwell, England, Yvan Seth of Jolly Good Beer is one of Barry's suppliers. Seth came to Britain from Australia in 2006 to work in information technology and turned a passion for craft beer – or what he prefers to call modern beer – into a company.
In 2014, he formed Jolly Good Beer, which he built from ""me and a van and a refrigerated shipping container."" Six years later, the distribution company boasts five vehicles, 14 employees and over 300 customers, from shops to pubs.
Now, his employees are all on furlough, and Seth is surviving on a small grant he received from his local authority.
""It's a drop in the ocean – but a very welcome drop in the ocean, because it's another £10,000 I can pay out to brewers,"" the 40-year-old said. ""We're all in this holding pattern, where cash flow in the industry has ceased. And we're hoping and waiting for the cash flow to return, which is going to take pubs like the Pensioner reopening and bringing money back in the door.""
He thinks the industry won't see a full recovery for at least a year from now, until there's a well-deployed vaccine, but he thinks pubs will endure.
""There will be some impact, but it won't be the long-term death of the pubs,"" he said. ""It's hard to do the same on Zoom.""
THE POLITICIAN
At first, the coronavirus pandemic left public servants rushing to take care of residents' immediate needs, such as delivering food parcels and medicine to the vulnerable and elderly. But as time passed in lockdown, a second wave of need hit London: the need caused by isolation.
""Loneliness is multigenerational,"" said Gabriela Salva Macallan, 37, a local councillor in London's Tower Hamlets borough, where the pub is situated. ""Isolation within our society – not just in Tower Hamlets – is a much wider problem.""
Macallan said pubs play a pivotal role in London's social fabric by creating spaces that bring people of different ethnicities, social classes and education together to celebrate and to commiserate. She said they also can help residents who fall through the cracks of society – the ones who might not socialise online or write their councillor.
""Community pubs are really quite an important part of East London,"" said Macallan, who grew up in nearby Bethnal Green and cycles down Bazely Street on her route home. ""It's hard for people to find community spaces where they can meet, and it's becoming harder and harder in Tower Hamlets.""
THE BARTENDER
For the Barry family, the pub's history is personal. Their late father grew up in East London and had dreams of opening a bar.
""It just seemed so right,"" said Trudy Barry, 26, Tadgh's sister, who bartended four days a week and worked as a DJ elsewhere the other nights.
The Pensioner sits in a residential area, which means staff served the same people over and over, the kind of regulars who might have had a bad day and want to talk to the bartender about it.
People who pack into pubs in central London or the hip East London neighbourhoods of Dalston and Hackney Wick ""go there to meet friends,"" she said. ""They don't go there to make friends.""
The Pensioner has more of an old-school cockney vibe. ""There have been staff members who haven't lasted very long because they come in with this mentality that they're just there to serve beer,"" she said.
In lockdown, she's filled her time doing exercise classes and running. She says she doesn't miss the late nights, but she misses talking to that community of people. A few have messaged her on Instagram, but the majority of the pub's patrons aren't online, she said.
Before her brother bought the place, it ""had a bit of a reputation,"" she said. Fights weren't exactly rare. ""We still get people coming in and saying, 'Oh, this place has changed a lot.'""
THE PUB LOVER
Before Tadgh Barry took over the place, the Greenwich Pensioner was run-down and ""pretty feral,"" says Alistair von Lion, the London pub reviewer.
In 2016, Von Lion wrote a critique of the pub under a previous owner, warning potential patrons off an after-work pint. ""Bit of a mistake,"" he wrote. ""Grim one room drinker, not very welcoming … and, to top it all off, one of the punters dogs took a sh*t on the sofa. I drank my pint quickly and left.""
But Barry gave the Pensioner a second life. Now, Von Lion says, walking around the back of Old Saints Church and down Bazely Street, it feels like you're stepping back in time. The bold Taylor Walker font gracing the pub's entrance serves as a reminder of just how few independent establishments like the Pensioner survive today. Founded in Limehouse in 1730, Taylor Walker & Co. Ltd. is now part of Britain's largest chain of pubs and brewers, Greene King, which sold to a Hong Kong firm last year.
""The Pensioner will probably be the first pub that I go back to,"" Von Lion said. ""I'm careful about championing independent pubs because I believe in what they're doing. They're providing that lifeline, that pastoral link, to people, and it's vital to the community.""
THE FUTURE
Until the photo shoot for this story a few weeks ago, owner Barry hadn't been back to the Pensioner since he locked its doors in March.
""It's surreal,"" he said, looking around at the empty, shuttered space. In one corner, a neglected fern drooped sideways, half its leaves yellow. Rocky, a black cat with a heart-shaped patch on his chest whom Barry calls the pub's most frequent visitor, was nowhere to be seen.
He's negotiated a discount on his rent and is staying hopeful.

""I think we'll be OK,"" he said. ""We'll come out the other side of it. Once the pubs do finally reopen, people will be desperate to go to those places. They'll be in for some of the busiest weeks they've ever had.""

The Chinese J-10, a fighter plane, and Y-8, a propeller aircraft often used for surveillance missions, entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone around midday (0400GMT) to the southwest of the island, Taiwan's air force said.
Patrolling Taiwanese fighters gave a verbal warning to the Chinese aircraft to leave, whereupon they ""immediately left"" the air defence identification zone, the air force said in a brief statement. 
""At present the situation is normal,"" it added, without giving further details.
Since June 9, China's air force has flown at least three other similar missions, and were each time chased off by Taiwanese jets, according to Taiwan's military.
Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.
China has not commented publicly on the recent Chinese air force activity near Taiwan. Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country's determination to defend its sovereignty.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan becoming independent.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist intent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

Netanyahu has said a U.S. peace plan, which envisages Israel retaining its settlements in the West Bank, provides an ""historic opportunity"" to extend Israeli sovereignty to them and to the Jordan Valley area.
Israel captured the West Bank, along with East Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, in a 1967 war. Palestinians hope to establish a state in those areas and say the peace blueprint announced by President Donald Trump in January kills that prospect. 
Israel Hayom, a pro-Netanyahu daily widely seen as reflecting his views, said the right-wing leader was now looking at the possibility of annexation in two phases.
It said Netanyahu, who has set July 1 for the start of a cabinet debate on the issue, was considering annexing only small settlements in phase one and, after renewing calls to Palestinians for peace talks, then annexing the remaining ones.
Netanyahu's annexation pledges have raised stiff opposition from the Palestinians, Arab countries and European nations, and Israeli officials say Washington has yet to agree to the move.
Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said potential phasing of annexation made no difference. ""Netanyahu is trying to confuse the international position which rejects annexation and the world will not be fooled by such a proposition,"" he said. 
The newspaper said Netanyahu does not anticipate a strong punitive response from Europe for annexation, despite vocal opposition, nor does he see it as substantially damaging Israel's ties with the Arab world. 
Nonetheless, by limiting annexation initially, he hopes to signal that Israel is attentive to international criticism, Israel Hayom said.
It attributed its report to sources that have held discussions with Netanyahu in the last few days, but did not identify them. Netanyahu's office declined to comment.

Most countries view Israeli settlements in occupied territory as illegal. Israel rejects this.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States is grappling with racial discrimination and implementing police reforms after the killing of George Floyd, but other countries should show the same level of openness, a U.S. envoy said on Wednesday ahead of a U.N. debate on racism.
Andrew Bremberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, issued a statement hours before the Human Rights Council (HRC) was to open an urgent debate at the request of African countries on racism and ""police brutality"" against protesters.
Activists said that U.S. officials were heavily lobbying African countries to tone down a draft resolution being considered so that it would not name the United States or set up a U.N. commission of inquiry, but rather a fact-finding mission.
African countries had lobbied to set up a U.N. inquiry into ""systemic racism"" and ""police brutality"" in the United States and elsewhere, aiming to defend the rights of people of African descent, the initial draft resolution showed.
""As the world's leading advocate for human rights we call upon all governments to demonstrate the same level of transparency and accountability that the U.S. and our democratic partners practice,"" Bremberg said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has condemned the actions of police officers in Minneapolis, he said, referring to the city where Floyd died last month after being held under the knee of an officer, launching protests across the nation and the world. 
Trump, facing criticism that his policies and inflammatory rhetoric have aggravated a racial divide in the United States, signed an order on Tuesday that he said would reform police practices even as he pressed for ""law and order"" nationwide.
""We are not above scrutiny; however, any HRC resolution on this topic that calls out countries by name should be inclusive, noting the many countries where racism is a problem,"" Bremberg said.

Bremberg, in a thinly veiled reference to ethnic Muslim Uighurs in China's Xinjiang province, said that another member state stood ""accused of running concentration camps directed at an ethnic minority"". In an apparent reference to Iran, he said that another state had murdered more than 1,500 peaceful protesters. Reuters reported in December that about 1,500 were killed in Iran during less than two weeks of unrest last year.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 17, 2020 07:17AM ET</span>","India, China want peace but blame each other after deadly border clash","By Sanjeev Miglani and Yew Lun Tian
NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - India and China said they wanted peace but blamed each other on Wednesday after soldiers of the two sides savagely fought each other with nail-studded clubs and stones on their Himalayan border, killing at least 20 Indian troops.
""We never provoke anyone,"" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on national television, referring to Monday's hand-to-hand fighting. ""There should be no doubt that India wants peace, but if provoked, India will provide an appropriate response."" 
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the clash erupted after Indian soldiers ""crossed the line, acted illegally, provoked and attacked the Chinese, resulting in both sides engaging in serious physical conflict and injury and death"".
He said he did not know of any Chinese casualties, although Indian media quoted officials as saying at least 45 people were dead or injured on the Chinese side.
Zhao said the overall situation at the border was stable and controllable.
Under an old agreement between the two nuclear-armed Asian giants, no shots are fired at the border, but there have been fisticuffs in recent years between border patrols. 
According to Indian officials, soldiers were hit with clubs studded with nails and stones during a brawl that erupted in the remote Galwan Valley, high in the mountains where India's Ladakh region borders the Aksai Chin region captured by China during the 1962 war. 
The rival armies have been eyeball-to-eyeball at their border for decades, but it was the worst clash since 1967, five years after China humiliated India in that war.
Modi, a strident nationalist, was elected to a second five-year term in May 2019 following a campaign focused on national security after spiralling tensions with old enemy Pakistan, on India's western border.
India's gung-ho media and the opposition piled pressure on him to respond aggressively.
""Gloves are off, with the Galwan valley clash, China pushed too hard,"" the Times of India wrote in an editorial. ""India must push back.""
""Beijing can't kill our soldiers at the border and expect to benefit from our huge market,"" it continued, advocating sanctions against Chinese imports.
Rahul Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress party tweeted: ""Enough is enough, We need to know what happened. How dare China kill our soldiers, how dare they take our land.""
Hundreds of Indian and Chinese troops have been facing each other since early May at three or four locations on the disputed border in the uninhabited, barren mountains of Ladakh.
India says Chinese troops have intruded into its side of the Line of Actual Control or the de facto border. 
China rejects the allegation and has asked India not to build roads in the area, claiming it to be its territory.
COLONEL KILLED
According to the Indian government sources, the fighting on Monday night broke out during a meeting to discuss ways to de-escalate tensions, and the colonel commanding the Indian side was one of the first to be struck and killed.
Many of the other Indian soldiers who died had succumbed to their wounds, having been unable to survive the night in freezing temperatures.
Unlike in India, the incident did not receive wall-to-wall coverage in China, where official media reported a statement on the incident from the spokesperson for the Chinese army’s Western Command.
On social media, bloggers and media aggregating platforms shared Indian media reports, such as the Indian army’s announcement acknowledging that the death toll had risen to 20.
Most vocal was the Global Times, a paper published by the official paper of the country’s ruling Communist Party.
Its editor-in-chief, Hu Xijin, took to domestic and global social media platforms to scold India, saying “Indian public opinion needs to stay sober” and to warn that China did not fear a clash.

The court found local courts had discriminated against the woman, born in 1967 in the United States to a Jewish father and a U.S. mother, who were unmarried.
Article 116 (2) of Germany's constitution - known as the Basic Law - states that Germans who between 1933 and 1945 were stripped of their citizenship on political, racial or religious grounds and their descendents can have their citizenship back.
The court ruling, dated May 20 and made public on Wednesday, stated that children born out of wedlock to former German citizens are equally entitled to citizenship.
The decision opens the door for descendants of German Jews born outside marriages to become German citizens.
""If a law mandates the state to grant citizenship, this right must be fulfilled without discrimination against illegitimate children,"" the court said.
Jewish campaigners said it was a ""momentous judgement"". 
Nicholas Courtman of the Article 116 Exclusions Group said it would have ""wide-ranging consequences for the naturalisation rights of descendants of German citizens persecuted under National Socialism"". 
Germany last year enforced two decrees to make it easier for people, mainly Jews, who fled Hitler's Nazi regime because of persecution as well as their descendents to have their citizenship restored.
The decrees followed a campaign by descendents of refugees from Nazi Germany who are angry that their applications for citizenship have been rejected despite constitutional guarantees.
Last year's decrees loosened the conditions needed for citizenship, for example by allowing individuals with a German mother and foreign father to have their citizenship restored, provided they were born before April 1953.
The new ruling said fathers should be able to pass their citizenship to their children too, not only mothers.

The letter was bought in Paris on Tuesday by the Vincent van Gogh Foundation which will display it in its museum in Amsterdam. The artists wrote the letter to French painter Emile Bernard in late 1888 during their stay in the French city of Arles, where the foundation also has a museum.
The letter, written a week after Frenchman Gauguin joined Van Gogh at the Dutchman's house in Arles, tells Bernard of their discussions on art and their work.
""Now something that will interest you — we’ve made some excursions in the brothels, and it’s likely that we’ll eventually go there often to work,"" the letter says.

The Vincent van Gogh Foundation said the letter was the most important document by van Gogh not held by any museum, as it was the only letter he wrote with Gauguin.
""Their artistic dialogue was unstoppable in those days and was even continued in brothels and in this letter,"" it said, adding that it ""gives a visionary picture of their artistic cooperation and the future of modern art.""
In the letter, Van Gogh refers to Gauguin as ""an unspoiled creature with the instincts of a wild beast. With Gauguin, blood and sex have the edge over ambition.""
Gauguin spent about two months with Van Gogh in Arles but their relationship soured. He left after Van Gogh suffered a breakdown and cut off part of his ear.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in faces the biggest crisis yet in his bid to foster reconciliation with North Korea, as it lashes out with the destruction of a joint office and rolls back agreements, but he has few options, analysts say.
Relations between the two Koreas have plunged to their lowest since Moon took office in 2017 vowing to work to end decades-old confrontation and be a mediator in nudging North Korea to give up its nuclear and missile programmes.
But with South Korea's ally the United States showing no sign of easing pressure on North Korea, despite President Donald Trump's efforts to woo leader Kim Jong Un, Moon has found himself stuck between escalating threats from North Korea and the unyielding international sanctions against it.
In the absence of sanctions relief, North Korea has increasingly derided Moon's calls for engagement between the two Koreas as meaningless.
Moon initially sought to quietly send envoys to defuse the rising tensions this week, but Pyongyang publicly rejected that, triggering a rebuke from Seoul.
South Korea now has to come up with a way of achieving progress with North Korea within the confines of the sanctions, said Jenny Town, a Korea specialist at the Washington-based Stimson Center think-tank.
""It can't simply come back with more requests to talk about long-term plans or lofty goals, but figure out measures that are practical and don't require international cooperation to achieve,"" Town said.
Moon, who has staked much of his political and diplomatic capital on improving relations with North Korea, has identified a cross-border rail link and a joint factory park and tourism zone as his top priorities this year.
But little progress has been made and it's not just the North Koreans who are growing frustrated.
Some of Moon's allies in the ruling party have scolded his government for failing to devise a way to get the projects going without violating sanctions.
Some have also accused the United States and a joint working group designed to coordinate North Korean policy of hampering Moon's efforts.
""The working group is increasingly seen as an obstacle to inter-Korean relations,"" Youn Kun-young, a former aide to Moon, told parliament on Tuesday. 
'NO CHOICE'
North Korea made its anger all too clear this week, blowing up the joint liaison office on its side of the border, declaring an end to dialogue and threatening military action, reversing the progress that Moon secured in peace talks with Kim in 2018. 
On Monday, the day before the office was blasted, some members of Moon's party urged the United States to give sanctions exemptions so the factory and tourism projects could get going again.
The party also pledged to ratify the agreement with North Korea reached in the 2018 talks.
But a despondent senior official in the presidential Blue House in Seoul said on Wednesday it would make little sense to ratify the pact now that the North was trying to nullify it.
Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean nuclear envoy, said he believed North Korea was not aiming for a military clash but was hoping to press South Korea through threats, and they could work.
Moon's administration could not just give up on inter-Korean relations, Chun said, adding: ""They have no choice but to make concessions.""
But for now, South Korean officials are perplexed and dismayed by the demolition of the liaison office, a centrepiece of the 2018 agreement.
""We're still discussing it,"" the senior Blue House official told reporters when asked what next.

""The situation is ongoing, and we don't make all decisions based on future predictions but will be prudent watching developments.""

HARARE (Reuters) - A newly established Zimbabwean company has started making cigars for export, aiming to take on established players while developing a culture of cigar smoking at home.
Mosi-Oa-Tunya, the local name for Victoria Falls which means ""the smoke that thunders"", is the first firm to make cigars in the southern African nation whose economic troubles have been compounded by the new coronavius pandemic.
After living and working in the United States for 15 years, Shep Mafundikwa returned home last year to set up Mosi-Oa-Tunya.
Since March, an all-women staff has been undergoing on-the-job training in the art of rolling cigars by hand, with each worker producing 256 cigars a day.
""We have solid interest right now from Romania and from Vietnam and we have inquiries from Dubai,"" Mafundikwa told Reuters at the company's factory in Harare.
""We have people waiting, customers waiting to have the cigars in hand,"" he said, adding that exports would start once restrictions caused by the coronavirus outbreak are eased.
Zimbabwe is famed for its tobacco, which is exported mainly to China and Europe and is used as a flavouring by global cigarette makers. For Mafundikwa, that was the starting point.
""You know Zimbabwe is well known for its high quality tobacco, so that gave me an idea to manufacture cigars.""
Motsi-Oa-Tunya will have to compete against another new southern African manufacturer, Bongani Cigars, which launched last year seeking to crack the luxury cigar market. 
Mafundikwa has recruited Elias Lopez as head of production and training. The 52-year-old from Dominican Republic has worked for cigar makers Arturo Fuente and Davidoff.
In between puffing on a cigar, Lopez expertly rolls tobacco leaves into cigars that he says will compete with the best in the world, like Habanos and Montecristo that are made in Cuba.
Mafundikwa wants to develop a cigar market locally by making affordable brands, although economic conditions present an additional challenge: inflation is rampant and unemployment has topped 80%.

""Traditionally I'm a cigarette smoker, but I decided to take this on a trial basis and I'm surprisingly enjoying it,"" Roy Ndudzo, a farmer, said while smoking Mosi-Oa-Tunya cigars with friends over bottles of wine at his house.

Duda's spokesman declined comment, referring reporters to Szczerski's remark. 
U.S. ambassador to Poland Georgette Mosbacher praised the state of relations in a video statement for media. Though she did not say whether the Polish president would visit Washington, she said cooperation would ""grow and grow"" and that Duda and Trump have a ""very unique relationship"".

The 24-hour stream of music, performances and speeches will feature politicians including U.S. presidential hopeful Joe Biden, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and spotlight the challenges faced in some countries by LGBTI+ individuals, many of which have increased since the start of the pandemic.
""A lot of people, especially young people, have had to go back maybe to their families who might not be supportive or they had to go back to their home town which might be a bit more conservative,"" said Ramses Oliva, 24, a trans gay man who is an ambassador for charity ""Just Like Us"" which supports LGBT+ young people.
Some individuals may not be out to their families and have even had ""to go back to the closet"", he said.
""I think that Pride for a lot of us is going to be just this chance to breath and to ... remind ourselves of our identities and how important it is to keep celebrating them especially during tough times like this.""
More than 500 Pride organisations submitted more than 1,000 pieces of content for Global Pride, and a volunteer production team are turning it into a 24-hour stream.
""What makes Global Pride very unique is that this is the first Pride of its kind where we are really focused on bringing the entire LGBT global community together,"" said Natalie Thompson, a chair of the Global Pride event.
It will also amplify black voices and the demand for racial justice from the Black Lives Matter movement.
""I think when people look at Pride who are not necessarily affiliated with it ... they see it as a big party. But behind the scenes, there's so much work that's being done to help push policies to help address human rights concerns.""
Among those to be featured is the Pride movement in Georgia. Last year organisers of the first ever Pride event in the capital Tbilisi received death threats.
Georgia organiser Giorgi Tabagari said being part of this year's global event gave them some kind of security from the threat of attack.
Another participating group is PINK DOT SG, that supports the LGBTQ community in Singapore.

PINK DOT SG committee member Clement Tan said that one of the aims was to show people that COVID-19 would not stop groups from highlighting discrimination.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek sex workers are concerned that new health and safety guidelines to protect them and their clients against the coronavirus will harm their business.
Regulations which came into force on June 15 urge sex workers to keep names and contact numbers of customers, who will lose the anonymity they previously sought.
""What client is going to give us their personal information? I tell you, people are going to go hungry,"" said Anna Kouroupou, a trans-woman who heads Red Umbrella, a support group.
As brothels across the country reopened on Monday, the rules dictate the use of masks, partners keeping their heads apart, bed linen changed after each encounter, cashless payments and clients leaving a name and contact number.
""They are ridiculous and I'm putting it mildly,"" said Rita, who manages a brothel in central Athens.
On Monday evening, business was brisk. But with the new requirements, sex workers wonder for how long.
""It's been mad, someone said sex-starved,"" said Rita, counting out 15 euros left by each client.
Those in the industry are anxious to earn some money now as sex workers received no benefits during the lockdown. Kouroupou would do fund-raisers, and collect supermarket coupons to help others.
She and others in the business fear the new rules may force sex workers to go underground. She also dismisses the notion of orderly queues at brothels. 

""They almost break down the door in their hurry to get in because they are embarrassed to be seen. How will they be expected to queue? It's ridiculous.""

DENVER (Reuters) - A 22-year-old Minnesota man was charged on Tuesday with aiding and abetting the arson of a Minneapolis police station during protests over the death of a black man under a policeman's knee, federal prosecutors said.
Dylan Robinson, who was arrested in Breckenridge, Colorado on Sunday, is accused of hurling a Molotov cocktail inside the Third Precinct police station in Minneapolis and igniting a fire in the building's stairwell on May 28, according to the criminal complaint.
Robinson appeared in U.S. district court in Denver on Tuesday to hear the charges against him, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Minnesota said in a written statement. Prosecutors said he is from Brainerd, Minnesota.
Robinson is the second man arrested June 3 in connection to the blaze. Branden Wolfe, 23, was arrested in Minnesota and charged with one count of aiding and abetting arson, federal prosecutors said. 
The police station was set on fire during demonstrations three days after George Floyd, 46, died when former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. 
The incident was captured by a bystander’s cell phone video and led to the firing of Chauvin, who was later charged with second-degree murder. Three other Minneapolis police officers were also charged in the case.
Authorities said they identified Robinson from social media posts and surveillance cameras. Agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms tracked him to Breckenridge, Colorado, a mountain town about 80 miles west of Denver, where he was taken into custody, according to an arrest warrant affidavit.

Robinson is due back in Denver federal court on Friday for a detention and removal hearing, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Denver told Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two Australian universities plan to hire a plane to fly in hundreds of foreign students shut out in the middle of their studies by border closures due to COVID-19, a move they hope will start to salvage a major export earner.
University of Canberra and The Australian National University, both based in the capital, said they plan to hire a plane to carry 350 students into the country in July so that they can complete quarantine then return to class.
The plan has the approval of the territory government but still needs the sign-off of the federal government, the universities said. The federal government closed national borders in March to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
""We are pulling out all stops to welcome back our continuing international students to campus, and to the vibrant Canberra community, as soon and as safely as possible,"" University of Canberra Vice-Chancellor Paddy Nixon in a statement released on Wednesday.
The universities did not say what country the flight would depart from. A university spokeswoman said the universities may arrange a flight from a regional travel hub so students from various countries could get on board.
The ""pilot programme"", as the universities called it, would be for older foreign students who had previously studied in Canberra and whose work had been interrupted by the abrupt border closure.
Foreign students have become a significant revenue source for Australian universities. Since the border closures took effect, universities have said they might lose A$16 billion in revenue by 2013 due to foreign students being shut out.
Though the Australian government has said it expects borders to stay closed at least until 2021, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he hopes to start letting universities make their own arrangements to fly in students in July.
The Canberra universities plan comes at a sensitive time. A week earlier China warned students to rethink studying in Australia due to racist incidents, an assertion the Australian government rejected.

Satsuki Katayama told reporters the party could formalise its proposal to the government as early as Thursday.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe suggested in parliament earlier this month that Japan could take in Hong Kong residents employed in the financial sector or other specialised areas as China moves to impose new security legislation.
Asked whether the LDP's proposal had Hong Kong residents in mind, Katayama said it did.
""The situation in Hong Kong and East Asia is very tense,"" Katayama told reporters after a committee meeting on foreign workers, adding that ""attracting financiers to Tokyo has been a long-standing struggle for us.""
The proposal is part of nation-wide economic policy which includes a plan to make Tokyo a financial hub. It will include suggestions on how foreign workers can assimilate into the Japanese workforce.

The world's third-largest economy has a dwindling and ageing population that has put pressure on the government to relax tight foreign labour controls.

Taiwan has never gone into total lockdown and life has continued largely as normal due to its early and effective prevention work and a first-rate public health system.
While it has largely lifted domestic restrictions, Taiwan has been more cautious about opening up its borders, which have been shut to most foreign visitors since mid-March.
Taiwan's Central Epidemic Command Centre said starting from Monday it would allow in business people coming from lower-risk areas including New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam and Thailand, plus those from South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau, which it judged medium to low risk.
Travellers will have to provide details of where they are going in Taiwan, be able to provide proof of testing negative for the virus three days before flying, and prove they have been invited by a company, the centre said on Wednesday. 
They will still be subject to 14 days of quarantine, as are all those coming into Taiwan, but will be able to shorten that if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative. 
""To foster the opening of foreign business activities in a timely manner, we are announcing the relaxation of some border control measures,"" Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters.
""We will simplify quarantine measures, starting from low risks areas.""
International flights have continued to operate to and from Taiwan throughout the border restrictions, though on a much reduced scale. Previously the only foreigners allowed in where those with residence permits, diplomats and a few other exceptions.

Taiwan has reported 445 cases, the majority of which were in people who get infected overseas, and just seven deaths. It has only four active cases remaining.

The letter, signed by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, among others, was addressed to Li Zhanshu, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's top legislative body. 
Beijing last month announced a plan to introduce legislation in Hong Kong to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference. The law could see Chinese security agencies set up bases in the city for the first time.
Critics, including diplomats, lawyers and business executives, see the law as a threat to a ""one country, two systems"" formula, agreed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 to protect its freedoms and role as a global financial centre.
Hong Kong and Beijing officials say the planned law in fact strengthens the governance formula and would only target a small number of ""troublemakers"" threatening national security, while leaving rights and freedoms intact.
They have dismissed criticism from foreign governments and organisations, urging them to stop interfering in China's internal affairs.
Key details of the legislation, expected to be implemented by September, remain unknown.
""Although no details of the law’s contents have been made publicly available, the decision – along with recent comments by Chinese and Hong Kong officials – suggest that it will threaten the basic rights and freedoms of the people in Hong Kong,"" the letter said.
""We are particularly concerned about the law’s impact on Hong Kong, especially its vibrant civil society.""
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday urged opponents of Beijing's national security legislation plans to stop ""smearing"" the effort, saying those who did were ""the enemy of the people"".

The signatories of the letter included rights groups from the United States, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Europe.

The General Staff of the Korean People’s Army will send the troops in the areas around a joint factory park in the western border city of Kaesong, where the liaison office was located, and to the Mount Kumgang tourist area, the official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday, citing a spokesman.
The two Koreas agreed to remove troops from those areas to make way for the joint projects that had once been seen as symbols of reconciliation. Such projects are now a focal point of a pressure campaign by Kim Jong Un’s to force President Moon Jae-in to break from a sanctions regime led by the U.S.
Kim Jong Un Raises Pressure on South Korea to Split With Trump
Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader’s sister, “flatly rejected” a request from Moon’s government to send National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong and spy agency chief Suh Hoon as special envoys, KCNA said separately. She called it a “tactless and sinister proposal,” KCNA said.
The South Korean won dropped 0.5% to 1,213.45 against the dollar as of 9:19 a.m. Seoul time as North Korea moved to send troops near its border with the South. The yield of the nation’s 10-year government bond was little changed at 1.4%.
South Korea infrastructure stocks, which are seen as benefiting from inter-Korean businesses, fell on Wednesday amid the rising tensions on the Korean Peninsula. Hyundai Rotem Co., a maker of train cars, dropped as much as 6% in early trading, while Hyundai Elevator Co. slipped as much as 5.1%. Defense stocks rose, such as LIG Nex1 Co. rose as much as 8.4%.
North Korea has blamed the deterioration in ties on defector-led activist groups in South Korea sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets by balloon across the border. While millions of such leaflets have been sent into North Korea over the years, the more recent campaigns after a flurry of speculation about Kim’s health and grip on power after a series of extended absences from public view.
Kim has shown increasing frustration with Moon since the long-time proponent of peace with North Korea has nonetheless maintained his support for the U.S.-led sanctions campaign. President Donald Trump has refused to relax the sanctions after three face-to-face meetings with Kim failed to produced what they U.S. side viewed as an acceptable plan to reduce North Korea’s nuclear program.
In recent weeks, Moon has renewed his pledges to restore economic cooperation and sought to lower tensions by seeking to cancel the licenses of the two groups over the leaflets. So far, the South Korean president has shown almost no appetite for retaliating against the Kim regime at the risk of derailing a pledge he made to his supporters to bring the Koreas closer together.
South Korea’s country’s National Security Council on Tuesday warned North Korea of a strong response if it took further actions, but gave no indication of imminent retaliation.
Still, North Korea also published a statement from the director of the ruling Worker’s Party of Korea’s United Front Department denouncing Moon, describing him as the “chief culprit” and a “provocateur” who allowed ties to fall apart. The statement from Jang Kum Chol illustrated the South Korean president’s dilemma in trying to please both North Korea and his own constituents at home, mocking his “humiliating policy of low posture and the policy of behaving at the beck and call of the north.”
Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former analyst for the U.S. government specializing in North Korea, said Kim’s government was likely to further escalate tensions. The country may later direct its attention to Trump to pressure him to make concessions in sputtering nuclear disarmament talks as the presidential election nears.
Last week, North Korea accused the U.S. of breaking promises it made at a historic summit two years ago, saying the Trump administration had turned dreams for peace into “a dark nightmare” and it saw no benefit in engaging with Washington.
“That would be great a way to get back at Trump,” Lee told Bloomberg Television, adding it may be a chance “to show off to the world North Korea’s strategic-weapons capability.”

In a statement, the coalition also said it welcomed U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' decision to remove it from a U.N. blacklist, several years after it was first accused of killing and injuring children in Yemen.
Guterres said in his annual report to the Security Council on Monday that the coalition would ""be delisted for the violation of killing and maiming, following a sustained significant decrease in killing and maiming due to air strikes"" and the implementation of measures aimed at protecting children.
He said the coalition killed or injured 222 children in Yemen last year. The Houthis were responsible for 313 such casualties and the Yemen government forces 96 casualties and both remain on the annual children and armed conflict blacklist.
""The coalition takes any allegations of violations of civilians and children's rights very seriously,"" it said in a statement on Tuesday. ""In order to investigate the allegations attributed to it in the report, the coalition invites the U.N. to share with the coalition the relevant information.""
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. The Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government.
The Saudi-led military coalition has officially been on the blacklist for the past three years.

It had been briefly added to the blacklist in 2016 and then removed by former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pending review. At the time, Ban accused Saudi Arabia of exerting ""unacceptable"" undue pressure after sources told Reuters that Riyadh threatened to cut some U.N. funding. Saudi Arabia denied threatening Ban.

""Our heroic commandos are in Haftanin,"" the ministry said on Twitter, dubbing the new operation ""Claw-Tiger"". 
""In order to neutralise the PKK and other terrorist elements threatening our people and our borders, our Air Force, along with fire-support equipment, helicopters and our commandos, supported by armed and unarmed drones, have mobilised to the region with air operations,"" the ministry said.
Wednesday's strike came just days after Turkey revealed an operation it called ""Claw-Eagle"" had struck PKK targets in various regions of northern Iraq.
Turkey regularly targets PKK militants, both in its mainly Kurdish southeast and in northern Iraq, where the group is based. The two latest airstrikes come amid what Ankara says is an increase in militant attacks on Turkish army bases.
Turkey has also warned in recent years of a potential ground offensive targeting PKK bases in the Qandil mountains.
The PKK, designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, focused in southeast Turkey.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's top court on Tuesday granted police permission to inspect financial and phone records of federal lawmakers allied with President Jair Bolsonaro as part of a probe into anti-democratic rallies, a source with direct knowledge of the ruling said. 
Bolsonaro's supporters have taken to the streets almost weekly to challenge coronavirus lockdowns and call for military intervention to close Congress and the Supreme Court, which they see as obstacles to his agenda.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain and apologist for Brazil's 1964 military coup, has attended several of the demonstrations, but he is not a target of the federal police investigation.
Tuesday's ruling by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, involving private records of 11 lawmakers, came after Brazil's federal police raided the homes of 21 targets with search warrants for their alleged role in financing the rallies earlier in the day.
Among those targeted by the raids were Congressman Daniel Silveira and conservative blogger Allan dos Santos, both of them said on social media.
Silveira and lawmakers Carla Zambelli and Bia Kicis were among those whose records were unsealed, allowing police to comb through them, the source said. It was not entirely clear if all 11 lawmakers had all of their records unsealed.
In a statement, Zambelli's press office said she had not been told of the ruling, and were not even sure what case it could relate to. ""If anyone expects to find anything that comprises me, they will have a big disappointment,"" she said in the statement. 
Kicis' office said it, too, had not been informed of the court's decision. Reuters was not able to reach Silveira. Nonetheless, earlier on Tuesday, he wrote about the police raid.
""Federal police in my apartment. I'm clearly making the old sphere of power uncomfortable,"" he said, adding that the accusations against him were ""absurd.""
The president's escalating confrontations with the Supreme Court come as Brazil suffers the world's worst COVID-19 outbreak outside the United States, which has killed some 44,000 people.
Bolsonaro's handling of the health crisis has drawn criticism from health experts as he minimized the severity of the disease, sidelined specialists and challenged social distancing orders from governors and mayors.

Tuesday's police operation followed arrests on Monday of pro-Bolsonaro activists behind far-right group ""Brazil's 300"" which held a torch-bearing march outside the Supreme Court last month.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Wednesday it has rejected South Korea's offer to send special envoys, and vowed to send back troops to demilitarised border units in the latest step towards nullifying inter-Korean peace accords. 
The warning was made by state media KCNA one day after North Korea blew up a joint liaison office set up in a border town as part of a 2018 agreement by the two countries' leaders, amid flaring tension over propaganda leaflets sent by defectors into the reclusive state. 
South Korea's President Moon Jae-in on Monday offered to send his national security adviser Chung Eui-yong and spy chief Suh Hoon as special envoys. But Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and a senior ruling party official, ""flatly rejected the tactless and sinister proposal,"" KCNA said. 
Moon ""greatly favours sending special envoys for 'tiding over crises' and raises preposterous proposals frequently, but he has to clearly understand that such a trick will no longer work on us,"" KCNA said. 
""The solution to the present crisis between the North and the South caused by the incompetence and irresponsibility of the South Korean authorities is impossible and it can be terminated only when proper price is paid."" 
There was no immediate comment from Moon's office. 
In a separate dispatch, a spokesman for the General Staff of the (North) Korean People's Army (KPA) said it will mobilise troops to Mount Kumgang and Kaesong near the border, where the two Koreas had carried out joint economic projects in the past. 
Police posts that had been withdrawn from the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) will also be reinstalled, while artillery units near the western sea border where the defectors frequently send leaflets will be reinforced with the readiness alert heightened to the level of ""top class combat duty,"" the spokesman said. 
The North will also restart sending anti-Seoul leaflets across the border, he added. 
""Areas favourable for scattering leaflets against the South will open on the whole front line and our people's drive for scattering leaflets will be guaranteed militarily and thorough-going security measures will be taken,"" he said. 
The KPA said on Tuesday it had been studying an ""action plan"" to re-enter zones that had been demilitarised under a 2018 inter-Korean military pact and ""turn the front line into a fortress.""
Seoul's defence ministry has urged North Korea to abide by the agreement, under which both sides vowed to cease ""all hostile acts"" and dismantled a number of structures along the DMZ.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will extend federal income support by eight weeks for those who lost their jobs amid the COVID-19 outbreak, and the border with the United States will remain closed to non-essential travel, the prime minister said on Tuesday.
The Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB), which delivers C$500 a week to those who qualify, had been available for a maximum of 16 weeks, which meant that some people would no longer be able to collect it starting in July.
At a news conference, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted that the 13 provinces and territories were gradually restarting their economies, but said the income support would still be needed. Unemployment in Canada hit a record high in May.
""I'm not going to sugarcoat it. We still have a long journey ahead. ... Many workers will be able to find work, but others won't,"" Trudeau said. ""Even as we start to reopen, a lot of people still need this support to pay their bills while they look for work.""
The opposition New Democratic Party's leader, Jagmeet Singh, had said he would not support a confidence vote in parliament on Wednesday if the CERB were not extended. 
Trudeau's Liberal government depends on the support of at least one of three opposition parties in the House of Commons.
""This is what we were calling for in the short term,"" Singh said about the extension. ""We'll keep working to make sure help is there for Canadians who need it in the long term.""
There had been 99,147 total coronavirus cases in Canada and 8,175 deaths, according to official data posted on Monday night.
Trudeau also told the news conference that the U.S. border restrictions would remain in place until July 21, confirming a Reuters story published last week.

In a video conference with U.S. congressional leaders and committees, Abdullah ""warned that any unilateral Israeli measure to annex lands in the West Bank is unacceptable and undermines the prospects of achieving peace and stability in the region,"" a royal palace statement said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, territory Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek for a state.
Netanyahu’s new government is due to begin discussing the de facto annexation on July 1, but it is unclear whether Israel’s main ally, the United States, would greenlight the step.
Jordan, which has the longest border with Israel, is a close Western ally and one of only two Arab states to have signed a peace treaty with Israel. 
Abdullah, who aides say has been deeply concerned about the annexation plan, told U.S. lawmakers that peace would only come with the creation of a ""independent, sovereign and viable Palestinian state"" with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Israel had to withdraw from territory it seized during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, he added.
Officials fear that annexation would bury the prospect of a viable Palestinian state and eventually bring a settlement of the decades-old conflict at the expense of Jordan, a country where many people are descendants of Palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of Israel in 1948.
Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said last week such a move would have ""catastrophic"" consequences and would not pass without a Jordanian response. 
Officials have not disclosed what steps Amman was considering in retaliation but some politicians have demanded freezing the peace treaty and cancelling a multi-billion dollar agreement that supplies Jordan with Israeli gas.

Warning of possible violence and diplomatic repercussions, some European and Arab states, together with the United Nations, have urged Israel not to annex its settlements, regarded by many countries as illegal.

448,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",Venezuela top court ousts leaders of opposition parties in run-up to congress vote,"By Brian Ellsworth
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's pro-government supreme court has ousted the leaders of two key opposition parties and put them in the hands of politicians widely accused of being shadow allies of the ruling Socialist Party, months ahead of legislative elections. 
The court issued rulings on Monday night and Tuesday putting the Democratic Action and First Justice political parties in the hands of politicians who have been expelled from those parties.
The move is certain to fuel criticism that Maduro is tampering with elections to prevent voters from punishing the Socialist Party for a crushing economic collapse that has forced some 5 million people to emigrate. 
And it threatens to leave opposition candidates with no party platform in the parliamentary vote, which is expected to take place this year but has not been formally scheduled. 
""First Justice is (made up of) tens of thousands of leaders, militants and sympathizers who continue to fight for the liberation of Venezuela,"" opposition lawmaker Juan Pablo Guanipa wrote on Twitter. ""It is not a time for resignation! It is time for resistance!"" 
The court on Monday said that Democratic Action would be led by long-time party activist Bernabe Gutierrez. The party said in a statement on Tuesday that it had expelled Gutierrez for ""conspiring with the regime of Nicolas Maduro.""
The court said First Justice would be run by legislator Jose Brito, who was expelled from the party in December following accusations he was involved in an influence peddling scandal in which opposition lawmakers reportedly helped burnish the reputation of a government-linked businessman. 
Gutierrez did not respond to a message seeking comment. Reuters was unable to obtain comment from Brito.
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Critics have long accused Socialist Party leaders of using a combination of threats and bribes to persuade opposition politicians to operate as allies while still claiming to be Maduro's adversaries. 
A group of lawmakers including Brito in January claimed to have beaten allies of opposition leader Juan Guaido in a vote for the parliamentary leadership after troops blocked Guaido from entering the legislative palace.

The group has since then been dismissed as Maduro puppets by the opposition, which recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of parliament.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States would like a face-to-face meeting with Iran to discuss prisoner releases and it wants the U.N. Security Council to impose an indefinite arms embargo on the Islamic Republic, a senior U.S. diplomat said on Tuesday.
The two adversaries disagree on many issues, including U.S. President Donald Trump's decision two years ago to abandon the 2015 Iran nuclear deal under which Tehran limited its nuclear program in return for economic sanctions relief.
Trump has since restored U.S. sanctions that have choked Iran's oil exports, the country's main source of revenue, while Iran has accelerated its nuclear program. Washington believes Iran may seek a nuclear weapon, something Tehran denies.
Despite the tensions, the two sides struck a deal under which Iran on June 4 freed a U.S. Navy veteran it had detained since 2018 and the United States allowed an Iranian-American physician to visit Iran.
Speaking at a virtual event hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations, U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook said he hoped for further prisoner exchanges and talks on a wide array of issues.
Tehran has been reluctant to deal with Washington since the Trump administration abandoned the nuclear agreement, demanding the United States return to it.
""We'd love to have an in person meeting to have a consular dialogue so that we can move faster than we have,"" Hook said.
""The door for diplomacy on our side is wide open, not just on these matters but on ... all the issues that have been bedeviling the US-Iran bilateral relations for 41 years,"" he said, saying Trump ""would like to get to the negotiating table.""

He also said Washington, which criticizes Tehran for backing proxies in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, believes a U.N. arms embargo on Iran expiring in October should be extended indefinitely.

NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Tuesday it would extend existing restrictions on non-essential travel at land ports of entry with Canada and Mexico due to continued risks from the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""This extension protects Americans while keeping essential trade and travel flowing as we reopen the American economy,"" U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Acting Secretary Chad Wolf said in a statement, without specifying an end date to the extension.
The travel restrictions had already been extended several times and were set to expire on June 23, according to a related U.S. government notice. A DHS official said the latest extension would run for 30 days. 
Mexico's foreign ministry said in a tweet on Tuesday that the travel restrictions across the country's border with the United States would continue for 30 days.
The United States said it was in ""close contact"" with both countries on its northern and southern borders about the restrictions, which were first imposed in mid-March. The Trump administration had already extended indefinitely a separate set of pandemic-related rules that permit rapid deportation of migrants caught at U.S. borders. 
Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice on Tuesday said in a statement it was again postponing hearings for thousands of migrants who have been waiting in Mexico for U.S. immigration court hearings.
The Justice Department, which runs the immigration court system, said the hearings for those in the so-called Migrant Protection Protocols program would be on hold until July 20.
""This will alleviate the need for travel within Mexico to a U.S. port of entry while pandemic conditions in Mexico remain severe,"" the Justice Department said. The controversial program has stranded migrants - many of them seeking asylum in the United States - in Mexico for months. 

Hundreds have been living in squalid tent camps near the U.S.-Mexico border, which health experts and immigration advocates have said leaves them vulnerable to coronavirus infections.

A dive in the pound currency last week sparked fresh protests in Lebanon, prompting the government to announce that the central bank would begin injecting scarce dollars into the market this week to reverse its fall.
Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh said on Tuesday the central bank was working with money changers to gradually reduce the dollar price but has not commented on whether dwindling reserves had yet been deployed to boost the pound.
In a televised address, Narallah said the United States had blocked dollars from reaching Lebanon, worsening a shortage that has hiked prices.
""Under the pretext that dollars are being collected in the (Lebanese) market and being taken to Syria, the Americans are preventing dollars from coming to Lebanon, even what is in the hands of the Lebanese central bank for the Lebanese market,"" said Nasrallah.
The local currency has lost more than 60% of its value since late last year, when Lebanon plunged deep into a financial crisis that has pushed the government to seek help from the International Monetary Fund. 
On the ongoing IMF talks, Narallah said they could take months and that there was ""talk"" it could take a year, asking, ""Can the country bear a year?""
Commenting on tough new U.S. sanctions taking effect this month on Syria, Nasrallah called them the ""last American weapon"" and said Syria's allies would not allow the sanctions to defeat Syria.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea on Tuesday blew up a joint liaison office set up in a border town in 2018 to foster better ties with South Korea after threatening action if defectors continued with a campaign of sending propaganda leaflets into the reclusive North.
The liaison office in Kaesong - a gleaming blue-glass four-storey structure in an otherwise drab industrial city - was ""ruined with a terrific explosion,"" North Korea's state news agency KCNA said. 
Destruction of the building, closed since January due to coronavirus fears, represented a major setback to South Korean President Moon Jae-in's efforts to coax North Korea into cooperation. It also appeared to be a further blow to U.S. President Donald Trump's hopes of persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons and open up to the world.
The U.S. State Department said Washington fully supports Seoul's efforts on inter-Korean relations and urged Pyongyang to ""refrain from further counterproductive actions.""
North Korea last week warned Washington to refrain from commenting on inter-Korean affairs if it wanted the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election to go smoothly, raising concerns it could be contemplating a return to nuclear and long-range missile testing.
Trump has hailed Pyongyang's freeze in such testing as a victory in his unprecedented but otherwise fruitless meetings with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2018 and 2019. 
The State Department said Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, the top U.S. official dealing with North Korea, would travel with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Hawaii on Tuesday. Sources said Pompeo will met with China's top diplomat Yang Jiechi in Hawaii on Wednesday to discuss issues including North Korea.
China is North Korea's main ally and neighbour and shares U.S. concerns about Pyongyang's weapons programs. U.S. officials have stressed the need for Beijing to strictly enforce international sanctions on North Korea.
Russia expressed concern about the Korea situation, urging restraint from all sides.
Surveillance video from South Korea's defence ministry showed a large explosion that appeared to bring down the office building. It also appeared to cause a partial collapse of a neighbouring 15-storey block that had housed South Korean officials who had staffed the liaison office.
Jenny Town of 38 North, a think tank focusing on North Korea, saw the destruction of the office as part of Pyongyang's efforts to secure sanctions relief and shift attention from domestic hardships worsened by coronavirus containment steps.
Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until early in Trump's administration, added, ""Ramping up pressure through escalating provocations is how Kim makes the point that without sanctions relief, sooner or later he will also blow up Trump's claim to have 'ended the threat' from North Korea."" 
'ACTION PLAN'
The first diplomatic mission of its kind, the liaison office was established in 2018 as part of a series of projects aimed at reducing tensions between the two Koreas.
North Korea's media also quoted its military as saying it had been studying an ""action plan"" to re-enter zones that had been demilitarized under the 2018 inter-Korean pact and ""turn the front line into a fortress"".
South Korea's defence ministry urged North Korea to abide by the agreement, under which both sides vowed to cease ""all hostile acts"" and dismantled a number of structures along the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone between the countries.
South Korea's national security council said Seoul would respond sternly if North Korea continued to raise tensions.
Deputy national security advisor Kim You-geun said destruction of the Kaesong building ""broke the expectations of all people who hope for the development of inter-Korean relations and lasting peace on the peninsula"".
South Korean vice unification minister Suh Ho, who co-headed the office, called its demolition ""unprecedented in inter-Korean relations"" and a ""nonsensical act"".
Reclusive North Korea and democratic South Korea remain technically at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty. Tensions have risen in recent days with North Korea threatening to cut ties and retaliate over the propaganda leaflets carrying messages critical of Kim Jong Un.
Referring to defectors, KCNA said the office was blown up to force ""human scum and those who have sheltered the scum to pay dearly for their crimes"".
Several defector-led groups have regularly sent flyers over the border, together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news, usually by balloon or in bottles by river. 
The Kaesong building was originally used as offices in the Kaesong Industrial Complex, a venture between the two Koreas suspended in 2016 amid disagreement over North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.

South Korea spent at least 9.78 billion won ($8.6 million) to renovate it in 2018. South Koreans worked on the second floor and North Koreans on the fourth floor. The third floor housed conference rooms for meetings between the two sides.

The statement marked a further escalation in a war of words between the two NATO allies, which are at odds over a range of issues including Libya, where Turkey recently helped the GNA repel a 14-month assault on Tripoli by Haftar's forces.
France called on Monday for talks among NATO allies on what it described as Turkey's increasingly ""aggressive"" role in Libya. Paris accused Ankara of thwarting truce efforts by breaking a U.N. arms embargo.
""The support France has provided to the putschist and pirate Haftar... has exacerbated the crisis in Libya,"" Turkey's foreign ministry said in a statement.
""What should actually be a cause for concern are France's dark ties. It is unacceptable for a NATO ally to behave this way,"" it said.
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt.
France denies supporting Haftar but previously gave him assistance in fighting Islamist militants. It has also stopped short of criticising countries openly supporting him while repeatedly criticising Turkey's stance.
In an interview with La Croix newspaper on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian reiterated that Paris was not taking sides in Libya, but said that Turkey endangered European security by sending Syrian fighters to Libya.
""It's a danger to ourselves, an unacceptable strategic risk, because it's 200 km (124 miles) from the Italian coast.""
Last year the GNA and Turkey signed a military cooperation deal. Ankara has since sent military advisers and trainers, along with allied Syrian fighters from the Syrian National Army rebel group, to Libya to support the GNA.

On Monday, Trump accused Germany of being ""delinquent"" in its payments to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and vowed to stick with the troop withdrawal plan unless Berlin changed course.
NATO in 2014 set a target that each of its 30 members should spend 2% of GDP on defence. Most, including Germany, do not.
""NATO is not a trade organisation, and security is not a commodity,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer said during a discussion at the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung in Berlin. 
""NATO is founded on solidarity, on trust. And it is based on common values and common interests.""
The reduction of about 9,500 troops to 25,000 would be a remarkable rebuke to one of Washington's closest strategic and trading partners and could erode faith in one of the pillars of post-World War Two European security: that U.S. forces would defend fellow NATO members against any Russian attack.
Trump's remarks on Monday were the first official U.S. confirmation of the planned troop cut, which was first reported by the Wall Street Journal and later confirmed to Reuters by a senior U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
That official said it stemmed from months of work by the U.S. military and had nothing to do with tensions between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who thwarted his plan to host an in-person Group of Seven (G7) summit.
A second senior administration official said the 9,500 troops would be sent elsewhere, some to Poland - closer geographically to Russia, some to other allied countries, while some would return home.

Last month, Prosecutor General Alexander Stoeanoglo said he had charged Plahotniuc with creation of an organised criminal group, extortion and fraud.
Representatives for Plahotniuc were unavailable for comment but his lawyers last year denied that he had been involved in an affair known locally as the ""theft of the century"", in which the equivalent of an eighth of the impoverished country's annual output was stolen from three of its largest banks.

The evidence of what rights groups have called possible war crimes came as Libya's frontlines suddenly shifted, displacing thousands of civilians and leaving a trail of landmines hidden in residential areas.
The internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) retook Tarhouna, southeast of Tripoli, on June 5 as an offensive by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) to capture the capital collapsed. 
GNA forces found 106 bodies in the hospital and local people discovered eight mass graves around Tarhouna, prompting the United Nations to call for an urgent and open investigation. 
Libyan Red Crescent representative Faisal Jalwal told a news conference that 29 of the bodies found in the hospital had been identified and that they included women and children. 
Kamal Al-Siwi, head of the GNA's missing persons bureau, said about 10 bodies had been disinterred from one of the eight mass graves that had been found. 
Tarhouna had for years been controlled by the local Kani family and its armed group, popularly known as the Kaniyat, which had been loyal to different sides during Libya's chaotic civil war. 
The town served as an important stronghold for the LNA during its attack on Tripoli and the Kaniyat fought alongside the LNA in the southern suburbs of the capital. 
A GNA justice ministry official, Nasser Ghaita, said it had issued 23 arrest warrants over the case and asked for U.N. technical help. The GNA said on Saturday that ""entire families"" had been killed. 
The LNA has denied its forces were responsible for any of the bodies found in the mass graves and has called for the United Nations to investigate reports of violations committed by pro-GNA forces in Tarhouna.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States will impose sanctions on Wednesday aimed at cutting off revenue for Syrian President Bashar al Assad's government in a bid to push it back into United Nations-led negotiations and broker an end to the country's nearly decade-long war. 
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft told the Security Council on Tuesday that Washington would implement the measures to ""prevent the Assad regime from securing a military victory.""
""Our aim is to deprive the Assad regime of the revenue and the support it has used to commit the large-scale atrocities and human rights violations that prevent a political resolution and severely diminish the prospects for peace,"" Craft said.

PARAMARIBO (Reuters) - Surinamese President Desi Bouterse, a former military ruler who has dominated the country's politics in recent decades, lost last month's national election, the country's electoral authority said on Tuesday after three weeks verifying the vote.
Chan Santokhi, a former police commissioner and justice minister of the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Reform Party, won a majority of votes and 20 seats in the 51-seat National Assembly in the May 25 election, ahead of Bouterse's 16 seats.
Suriname's economy collapsed under Bouterse, despite the recent discovery of vast oil reserves off the coast of the South American country, with a population of 575,000.
Santokhi says he will form a government with three other parties. The new National Assembly will be sworn in on June 29 and is expected to elect him as the new president.
Bouterse's National Democratic Party lost after a court in November sentenced him to 20 years in prison for ordering the execution of 15 adversaries in the former Dutch colony who had spoken out against his seizure of power in a February 1980 coup.
Bouterse, 74, has avoided prison due to his presidential immunity. He has appealed the conviction and the court is to reconvene on June 30.
Additionally, in 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him to 11 years in prison for drug smuggling. Bouterse never served the sentence but can still be arrested in countries that have extradition treaties with the Netherlands.
Bouterse, asked on June 11 about media speculation that a new president would extradite him, said: ""I don't seek confrontation, but I don't shy away from confrontation.""
Santokhi later told reporters that Suriname's constitution forbids the extradition of its citizens. 

Bouterse led Suriname through the 1980s as head of a military government, then assumed office again in 2010 and in 2015 secured re-election to another five-year term.

(Reuters) - Many of the Central Intelligence Agency's most sensitive hacking tools were so poorly secured that it was only when WikiLeaks published them online in 2017 that the agency realized they had been compromised, according to a report released Tuesday. 
The secret-spilling site drew international attention when it dumped a vast trove of malicious CIA code on the internet in March 2017. 
The digital tools, sometimes described as ""cyber weapons,"" provided a granular look at how the CIA conducts its international hacking operations. It also deeply embarrassed the U.S. intelligence community, which has repeatedly been hit by large-scale leaks over the past decade. 
An internal CIA report https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/wyden-cybersecurity-lapses-letter-to-dni.pdf dated October 2017 and released by Democratic U.S. Senator Ron Wyden on Tuesday described security at the agency's Center for Cyber Intelligence - the unit responsible for designing the tools - as ""woefully lax.""
""Most of our sensitive cyber weapons were not compartmented, users shared systems administrator-level passwords, there were no effective removable media controls, and historical data was available to users indefinitely,"" the report said. It described the WikiLeaks disclosure as ""the largest data loss in CIA history."" 
The CIA declined to comment specifically on the report, saying only that it ""works to incorporate best-in-class technologies"" to keep ahead of security threats.
The report, drawn up by the CIA's WikiLeaks Task Force, was heavily redacted, but it called out failures at the Center for Cyber Intelligence, which the report's authors said was too focused on building hacking tools rather than securing them.

In a letter accompanying the report, Wyden suggested that the weaknesses highlighted by the report ""do not appear to be limited to just one part of the intelligence community,"" which he said was ""still lagging behind.""

(Reuters) - An Indonesian court is expected to deliver a verdict on Wednesday in a high-profile trial of seven West Papuans accused of treason, in a case that has drawn concern about deteriorating political freedoms in the world's third-largest democracy. 
The seven men face between five and 17 years in prison if found guilty of treason, after they joined anti-racism protests that swept across Indonesia's westernmost provinces last August.
The demonstrations were sparked by alleged racist attacks on several Papuan students in Java, including being called ""monkeys"".
The defendants deny the charges. Among them is Buchtar Tabuni, a senior figure in a pro-Papuan independence group, the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP), Agus Kossay and Stevanus Itlay from the National Committee for West Papua (KNPB) and several Papuan university students. 
They were arrested in the provincial capital Jayapura last year and moved to Balikpapan on Indonesian Borneo for security reasons.
The resource-rich and remote provinces of Papua and West Papua came under Indonesian rule in a controversial 1969 referendum sanctioned by the United Nations. 
A low-level insurgency for independence has ensued since and the topic remains deeply sensitive to Indonesia's government.
Flying the Morning Star flag, a symbol of Papuan independence, is banned in Indonesia. Independence figure Filep Karma was convicted of treason after raising the flag publicly and spent 11 years in jail before his release in 2015.
The Balikpapan trial has drawn unusual levels of support in Indonesia, where it has coincided with the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States. 
That has inspired a local adaptation – Papuan Lives Matter – which Indonesians have used on social media and in street demonstrations calling for the Papuans' release.
The global movement has also sparked online forums about perceived racism and discrimination in Indonesia, events that activists say have been subject to obstruction and intimidation.

Pastora was one of the most respected Sandinista guerrilla commanders in the 1979 overthrow of dictator Anastasio Somoza, and an on-and-off ally of former Sandinista guerrilla leader and current President Daniel Ortega.
Pastora had entered a military hospital in capital Managua for treatment 10 days ago with respiratory problems, hospital representatives said.
His son Alvaro Pastora, one his many children, confirmed to Reuters that his father had died of respiratory arrest. He declined to comment on whether his father had contracted the coronavirus, which has been spreading fast in Nicaragua.
The ex-commander's heroic reputation dates to 1978, when he led a squad of Sandinista troops in capturing the National Palace and demanding the release of imprisoned guerrillas. The exploit helped bring fellow rebel Ortega, who is now in his second stint as president, to power the following year. 
But shortly after, Pastora lost faith in the Sandinista government, saying the spirit of the revolution had been lost.
He fled to Costa Rica and from there took up arms against his former colleagues for eight years. Upon his return to Nicaragua, he unsuccessfully attempted to run for mayor, led right-wing parties and, in 2006, ran a failed bid for the presidency.
When Ortega took office in 2007, the pair reconciled. After mass protests against Ortega's administration rocked the country in 2018, Pastora met with former leftist guerrillas across the country, asking them to support the present. 

""Daniel is not alone. We the old-timers are here, shoulder to shoulder with our people,"" Pastora said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Jewish community leaders in Warsaw on Tuesday voiced their opposition to the ""dehumanising"" language they say is being used against LGBT (lesbian, bisexual, gay and transgender) people in Poland's presidential election campaign.
Gay rights have been thrust into the spotlight during the campaign for the June 28 election. President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the right-wing ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), views what he calls LGBT ""ideology"" as an invasive foreign influence that harms traditional values in the devoutly Catholic nation.
""We have observed politicians... cynically undertake to forment hostility and hatred towards LGBT persons,"" the Board of the Jewish Community of Warsaw wrote in a letter.
""We Jews - the descendents of Holocaust survivors - cannot and will not remain indifferent to words that would dehumanise LGBT persons,"" the board wrote, saying that politicians had failed to learn the lessons of World War Two.
Duda has said he would ban teaching about LGBT issues in schools and labelled ""LGBT ideology"" more destructive than communism. He later said his words on LGBT and communism were taken out of context. 
Duda's main opponent is liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who has faced criticism for introducing education about LGBT matters in schools in the Polish capital.
Protestant bishop Jerzy Samiec tweeted on Sunday that LGBT people in his church were ""Sisters and Brothers in Christ"". Poland's influential Catholic Church has also referred to LGBT people as brothers and sisters, but has spoken out against ""an ideology that aims to revolutionise social customs"".
On a visit to Warsaw on Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said attempts by some Polish communities to introduce ""LGBT-free zones"" were incompatible with European values.
Duda's campaign spokesman Adam Bielan told the Super Express tabloid on Tuesday that Duda was not homophobic.
""The president defends the rights of families to decide how their children are educated... Like the overwhelming majority of Poles he is against the adoption of children by homosexual couples,"" Bielan said.

""I don't think you could call those homophobic views"".

Veteran Philippine journalist Maria Ressa, a dual U.S.-Filipino citizen whose website has put President Rodrigo Duterte under tough scrutiny, was convicted of libel on Monday and faces up to six years in jail, in a ruling widely seen as a blow to media freedom.
Reynaldo Santos, a former Rappler researcher and writer, was also found guilty in the case. Both were granted bail pending an appeal.
""The United States is concerned by the trial court’s verdict against journalists Maria Ressa and Reynaldo Santos and calls for resolution of the case in a way that reinforces the U.S. and Philippines’ long shared commitment to freedom of expression, including for members of the press,"" U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement on Tuesday.
The court decision has fueled concern over human rights in a country where Duterte's war on drugs has left thousands dead. He recently renewed a threat to kill drug dealers, despite condemnation in a U.N. report.

U.S. lawmakers have criticized what they see as harassment of Ressa.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A Harvard University professor pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges that he lied to U.S. authorities about his ties to a China-run recruitment program and funding he received from the Chinese government for research.
Charles Lieber, the former chair of Harvard's chemistry and chemical biology department, pleaded not guilty to making false statements during a videoconference held before a federal magistrate judge in Boston.
Marc Mukasey, his lawyer, said Lieber, 61, will fight the charges and that the ""government has this wrong.""
Lieber's case is one of the highest-profile to emerge from a U.S. Justice Department crackdown on Chinese influence within universities amid concerns about spying and intellectual property theft by the Chinese government.
The case centers on China's Thousand Talents Program, which U.S. authorities say China uses to entice overseas Chinese citizens and foreign researchers to share their knowledge with China in exchange for perks including research funding.
Prosecutors said Lieber in 2011 became a ""strategic scientist"" at Wuhan University of Technology in China and from 2012 to 2015 contractually participated in the Thousand Talents Program.
Under his contract, Lieber was paid up to $50,000 per month and living expenses of up to $158,000, prosecutors said. He also was awarded more than $1.5 million to establish a research lab, prosecutors said.
In exchange, Lieber agreed to organize international conferences, publish articles and apply for patents in the university's name, prosecutors said.
During a 2018 interview with federal investigators, prosecutors said, the nanoscience specialist falsely stated he was never asked to participate in the Thousand Talents Program.

When the U.S. National Institutes of Health, which funded his research, asked Harvard whether he had failed to disclose his ties to the program, Lieber had the Ivy League school falsely claim he had not participated in it, prosecutors said.

Members of the royal family, including heir-to-the-throne Charles and next-in-line William, had been seen in photos and videos released during lockdown, but had not taken part in any engagements outside their homes.
Charles and his wife Camilla visited the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital and met about 20 staff, ranging from clinicians to volunteers and social workers. The hospital, in central England, has treated about 650 COVID-19 patients, of whom 162 have died.
Charles himself contracted the virus in March but did not require hospital treatment.
In a separate engagement, William visited the Kings Lynn Ambulance Station, part of a service that provides round-the-clock emergency cover for 6.2 million people in eastern England.

William, a former helicopter rescue pilot himself, who with his wife Kate has campaigned to raise awareness of mental health issues, heard from staff about the impact of the coronavirus crisis on the mental wellbeing of first responders.

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris police blamed violent fringe groups for hijacking a peaceful protest by health workers in central Paris on Tuesday, where at least one car was overturned and projectiles were hurled at police lines.
The unrest broke out as thousands of doctors, paramedics and nursing home carers, many dressed in their scrubs and white blouses, had been protesting near the health ministry for better wages and working conditions.
Paris police said anarchist protesters known as ""black bloc"" were attacking its officers. Several were seen in video footage pushing an overturned car into the middle of a cobbled avenue as others threw missiles at the police. 
""Violent individuals do not belong in a peaceful demonstration,"" the Paris police prefecture said in a Tweet.
Tear gas swirled over the Invalides esplanade. Some protesters threw glass bottles and stones at the riot police who formed up along one side of the park. Firefighters extinguished one rubbish bin that had been set alight.
At least 16 arrests were made, police said.
The head of the Paris emergency room workers association told BFM TV the protest had been stolen from them: ""It's disgusting,"" Patrick Pelloux said.
Health care workers say the coronavirus crisis has laid bare strains that threaten to break public healthcare in France.
Even before the pandemic, health workers participated in nationwide labour unrest late last year. President Emmanuel Macron's government unveiled emergency plans in November for the sector, including a promise to take on some debt of hospitals, raise health spending and provide bonuses for nurses.
""Our hospitals run like machines, it's as if we're workers. We're no longer there to care,"" said one protester who said she earned 1,450 euros a month after 10 years in the job.

NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese troops clashed with iron rods and stones at their disputed border, resulting in casualties on both sides including the death of three Indian soldiers, Indian officials said on Tuesday, in a major escalation of a weeks-old standoff.
China and India traded accusations as to who was to blame for the face-off in the snow deserts of Ladakh in the western Himalayas on Monday. No shots were fired, an Indian government source said.
The deaths were the first since the last major border clash in 1967 between the nuclear-armed Asian giants and world's two most populous countries which have not been able to settle the dispute along their vast frontier.
Since early May, hundreds of soldiers have fronted up against each other at three locations, each side accusing the other of trespassing.
On Monday night, a small group of soldiers came to blows in the Galwan Valley, Indian officials said. 
""During the de-escalation process under way in the Galwan Valley, a violent face-off took place yesterday night with casualties on both sides,"" the Indian army said in a statement. 
""The loss of lives on the Indian side includes an officer and two soldiers. Senior military officials of the two sides are currently meeting at the venue to defuse the situation.""
The officer who died was a colonel, the government source said. The two sides had been discussing ways to de-escalate but at some point the People's Liberation Army turned on a group of Indian soldiers, the source said. 
""They attacked with iron rods, the commanding officer was grievously injured and fell, and when that happened, more soldiers swarmed to the area and attacked with stones,"" said the source, who had been briefed on the matter. 
The Chinese side brought in reinforcements and the brawl went on for a couple of hours, the source said.
""Both sides suffered casualties that could have been avoided had the agreement at the higher level been scrupulously followed by the Chinese side,"" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said in a statement.
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman in Beijing said there was a serious violation of a consensus reached by the two countries.
""What's shocking is that on June 15, the Indian side severely violated our consensus and twice crossed the border line and provoked and attacked the Chinese forces, causing a violent physical confrontation between the two border forces,"" Zhao Lijian told reporters in Beijing.
""China is raising strong opposition and stern representations to the Indian side on this,"" he said. There was no information provided on any casualties.
'EXTREMELY SERIOUS'
India and China fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962 and distrust has occasionally led to flare-ups ever since.
Border guards have had skirmishes and fist fights when patrols have confronted each other, but there has been no loss of life at the border since 1967.
""This is extremely, extremely serious, this is going to vitiate whatever dialogue was going on,"" former Indian army commander D. S. Hooda said.
Military experts say that one reason for the face-off is that India has been building roads and airfields to improve connectivity and narrow the gap with China's far superior infrastructure.
At Galwan, India completed a road leading to an airfield last October. The Chinese side have asked India to stop all construction.
India says it is operating on its side of the Line of Actual Control, the de facto border.
The editor-in-chief of China's Global Times newspaper said the Chinese military had suffered losses in the latest clash, though it was unclear whether those were deaths or wounded.

""Based on what I know, the Chinese side also suffered casualties in the Galwan Valley physical clash,"" Hu Xijin said in a tweet. He did not give further details. The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.

477,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 10:56AM ET</span>",Atlanta police officer who shot Rayshard Brooks had past reprimand for use of force,"(Reuters) - The former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks last week was previously reprimanded for use of force involving a firearm, according to records released to Reuters by the city's police department on Tuesday.
The records show Garrett Rolfe received a written reprimand in October 2017 for a firearm incident in September 2016, his sole use-of-force complaint in seven years on the force prior to Friday's shooting. No further details were disclosed.
Rolfe was fired from the department after the shooting in the parking lot of a Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) fast-food restaurant, which was captured by body and surveillance cameras. A second officer at the scene, Devin Brosnan, who is also white, was placed on administrative duty.
The death of 27-year-old Brooks, which came after he tussled with Rolfe and Brosnan and took off running with one of their Taser guns, was the latest killing of a black man to spark nationwide outrage at police brutality and racial injustice.
An autopsy conducted on Sunday showed that Brooks died from blood loss and organ injuries and ruled the death a homicide.
Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard has said he would decide by midweek whether to bring charges against the officers, a call that he indicated would hinge on whether they felt Brooks posed a threat.
Justin Miller, an attorney for Brooks' family, told CNN on Tuesday he did not think the officers' defense could rest on a Georgia law that allows them to shoot if they were in imminent threat of bodily harm, even though Brooks had a Taser.
""If you look at the tape closely, you can see that police officer was already going for his gun before Mr. Brooks turned around,"" Miller said. ""I don't think in this situation that's going to come up.""
Rolfe's disciplinary file lists 12 incidents, composed of five vehicle accidents, four citizen complaints, and three involving firearms, including one in 2015, the 2016 matter for which he received a written reprimand and the Brooks' shooting. 
Internal investigations exonerated him in eight of the incidents. He received a written reprimand and an oral admonishment for two vehicle accidents. The file does not indicate any conclusion for the 2015 firearm incident.
Vince Champion, southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, said two firearm incidents over seven years prior to the Brooks' shooting did not represent a pattern given the inherent dangers of the job.
""It doesn't raise any flags for me,"" Champion said, noting that Rolfe was not charged in any of the firearm incidents, which he said would have been vetted by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and internal affairs before being resolved.

Brosnan, who joined the police force in 2018, has no disciplinary history.

GENEVA (Reuters) - African countries are lobbying to set up a U.N. inquiry into ""systemic racism"" and ""police brutality"" in the United States and elsewhere, aiming to defend the rights of people of African descent, a draft resolution seen by Reuters shows.
The text, circulating among diplomats in Geneva, voices alarm at ""recent incidents of police brutality against peaceful demonstrators defending the rights of Africans and of people of African descent"". 
It will be considered at an urgent debate of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Wednesday.
The Council agreed to convene at the request of Burkina Faso on behalf of African countries after the death last month of George Floyd, an African American, in police custody in Minneapolis, which ignited protests worldwide. 
The United States quit the Council two years ago alleging bias against its ally Israel.
A senior U.S. diplomat in Geneva defended its record, saying: ""Our transparency, commitment to a free press, and insistence on the right to justice allow the world to see our problems and openly engage on our efforts at finding solutions."" 
""And when violations of people's rights are committed we hold people accountable through independent courts, and through an independent media,"" he added.
The resolution, subject to change after negotiation at the Council, calls for ""an independent international commission of inquiry ... to establish facts and circumstances related to the systemic racism, alleged violations of international human rights law and abuses against Africans and of people of African descent in the United States of America and other parts of the world"".
The inquiry would report back in a year.
""It is countries that hide the truth, violently silence their critics, don't have democratic accountability, and refuse even to recognise fundamental freedoms that merit censure,"" the senior U.S. diplomat said.
More than 600 activist groups, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, called last week for the Council to launch an investigation into U.S. abuses.
But Hillel Neuer of the Geneva-based UN Watch told the forum: ""We are concerned this session may be a farce when some of the worst practitioners of police brutality and racism will be the ones asked to be the judges."" 

The Council already has commissions of inquiry or fact-finding missions into human rights violations in hotspots including Syria, Burundi, Myanmar, South Sudan, Venezuela and Yemen.

Britain returned the Asian financial hub to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of freedoms, such as an independent judiciary and right to protest, for 50 years.
""The imposition of the proposed law lies in direct conflict with China’s international obligations under the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Declaration, a treaty agreed by the UK and China and registered with the United Nations,"" Julian Braithwaite, Britain's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told its Human Rights Council.
He urged China to engage with the territory’s people, institutions and judiciary to ""ensure it maintains Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy and rights and freedoms"".
Jiang Duan, human rights minister at China's Geneva mission, took the floor to say that Braithwaite had ""interfered in China's internal affairs which we firmly reject"".
""China's enactment of laws in the Hong Kong special adminstrative region to safeguard national security is aimed at plugging loopholes...and effectively safeguarding national sovereignty and security,"" he said. ""This is legitimate, legal and imperative.""
Pang Kwang Hyok, deputy ambassador at North Korea's mission, voiced concern at ""certain countries' attempt to use Hong Kong-related issues to interfere in China’s domestic affairs"". Hong Kong is ""an inseparable part"" of where China's sovereignty is exercised and its constitution is applied, he said. 
Hong Kong's national security legislation would not punish people retroactively, a senior Chinese official said on Monday, touching on a key question raised by local residents, diplomats and foreign investors over the disputed measure.
Beijing last month moved to directly impose the legislation on Hong Kong in a bid to tackle secession, subversion and foreign interference in the financial hub.
Hong Kong was rocked by months of sometimes violent anti-China, pro-democracy unrest last year, with protesters angry at what they see as meddling by Communist Party rulers in Beijing in Hong Kong's affairs.
China denies interfering and accuses Britain and the United States of fomenting the unrest.

Gagik Tsarukyan, leader of the Prosperous Armenia party and one of Armenia's richest businessmen, has denied any wrongdoing and told the assembly that the move was politically motivated.
Tsarukyan has been under investigation by the national security service on suspicion of vote buying, fraud and illegal land appropriation. Last Sunday his home was raided and he was interviewed.
Tsarukyan has recently accused Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government of mishandling the economy and failing to fight the coronavirus epidemic effectively.
Armenia, a country of 3 million, had registered 17,489 confirmed coronavirus cases and 293 deaths as of Tuesday, and is the worst-affected country in the South Caucasus region. The government now expects the economy to shrink 2% this year, after previously projecting growth of 4.9%.
Pashinyan and his party came to power two years ago after a peaceful revolution against corruption and cronyism, with which Tsarukyan aligned himself towards the end.

Tsarukyan's party won 26 out of 132 seats in a parliamentary election in December 2018. Some of its members joined Pashinyan's cabinet, but they were soon dismissed.

MINSK (Reuters) - A candidate standing against Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said Tuesday she would press on with her campaign, despite receiving a threat to have her children taken away.
Svetlana Tikhanouskaya launched her campaign for president in place of her husband, an anti-Lukashenko blogger who was arrested last month for threatening public order and now faces up to three years in prison.
She fought back tears in a video released on Tuesday describing how she had received an anonymous phone call threatening that her children would be taken away unless she abandoned her campaign. The call came just as she was about to hand in part of a petition with 100,000 signatures required to stand.
""I have a choice - my children or carrying on the struggle,"" said Tikhanouskaya in the video. She later said she would continue because ""it is only way to help my husband"". 
Lukashenko has brooked little opposition in his 26-year rule. The authorities have launched legal cases against several of his opponents in recent weeks after voters joined lengthy queues to sign petitions to support candidates against him.
Lukashenko is facing the biggest challenge to his authority in years as frustration with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances about the economy and human rights reinvigorated opposition to his rule.
He has largely dismissed the coronavirus and resisted measures taken in other countries to slow infections. After decades of promoting close ties with Russia, he has also lately squabbled with Moscow over oil supplies, subsidies and the Kremlin's push for closer economic and political union.
Tikhanouskaya's husband Syarhei Tsikhanouski popularised the slogan ""stop the cockroach"", comparing Lukashenko to a character in a children's fairytale.
Separately the state also launched a tax evasion case against the local unit of Russia's Gazprombank and has taken the bank into administration. The bank's former head Viktor Babariko is running against Lukashenko. 
Lukashenko has accused the opposition of trying to destabilise Belarus.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli dissolved parliament on Tuesday ahead of elections in October, touting his government’s record in expanding infrastructure such as roads, electricity generation and reforming the mining sector.
Nicknamed ""the Bulldozer"" for his ability to push through major projects, Magufuli took office in November 2015, pledging to expand the East African nation's road and railway network and power-generation capacity.
His government also approved new mining regulations aimed at ensuring that the benefits of the mining sector were shared more equitably between multinational mining companies and the state.
“Large reforms have taken place, including ... restricting smuggling of raw minerals out of the country, establishing mineral markets in each region, increasing participation of artisanal miners,"" he said. 
Magufuli, who is expected to run for a second and final five-year term, told parliament in the administrative capital Dodoma that since he took office, the government had added another 3,500 km (2,170 miles) of tarmacked road.
He said a new 300-km (185-mile) standard gauge railway line between the commercial capital Dar es Salaam and Morogoro was almost complete, while a 422-km line from Morogoro to Dodoma was a third complete.
The government said on Monday a 6.5-trillion-shilling ($2.81 billion), 2,115 MW hydropower dam, being built next to a park that is a UNESCO World Heritage site, was 40% complete.
""This project was highly protested (against) but we have succeeded,"" Magufuli said.
While hailed for also tackling corruption and wasteful spending, rights groups and opposition parties have accused Magufuli's government of curbing human rights including limiting freedom of expression and preventing opposition parties from holding public rallies and sometimes private meetings. 
The government has denied seeking to stifle dissent.
Tundu Lissu, deputy leader of the main opposition CHADEMA party, has announced he will run for president in October.

Now she wants to know how the French state is going to recognise her sacrifice.
""I don't know if the public really understood us,"" she said in her studio apartment in Paris after cycling home at the end of a 12-hour shift in the Robert Debre children's hospital.
""We give them care, and we'll need care too, sooner or later. We're human beings too,"" she said.
On Tuesday, dressed in her hospital scrubs and carrying a sign she painted at her apartment, Debrie met up with colleagues outside her hospital and together they marched towards the health ministry headquarters. 
They were protesting for better wages and working conditions from the French government. 
French health workers made the same demands before the coronavirus epidemic, but the outbreak has given their campaign new urgency. 
In recognition of their contribution, the government paid healthcare workers a 1,500 euro bonus. For weeks, people came onto their balconies every evening at 8 p.m. to applaud carers.
But for Debrie, these felt like empty gestures.
Debrie's basic pay is around 1,900 euros per month, only 200 euros more than she earned when she first started in nursing eight years ago. She said staffing levels were such that she and colleagues had to rush through their shifts and could not give patients the attention they needed.
""The management of the pandemic, of the crisis, within the hospitals was made possible because each hospital worker was devoted,"" she said. ""I'm angry because they're trying to appease us with charity."" 

The French government has promised a reform of the healthcare system which it says will involve massive investment and greater appreciation shown for healthcare workers.

British ministers originally said school food vouchers would not be available over the long summer holiday, prompting the 22-year-old Manchester United forward to take up the cause and reveal how he had relied on such support as a boy.
Before a debate in parliament, and as some lawmakers from the governing Conservative Party called for a change, Johnson's spokesman said the government would be providing a COVID summer food fund costing around 120 million pounds ($150 million). 
""Owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the prime minister fully understands that children and parents face an entirely unprecedented situation over the summer. To reflect this we will be providing a COVID summer food fund,"" his spokesman said.
Rashford used a column in the Times newspaper on Tuesday to argue that while he may not have the education of a lawmaker in parliament, he did have a social education. 
He has already helped to raise around 20 million pounds with charity Fareshare UK to supply meals to struggling families. 
""I don't even know what to say,"" he said on Twitter of the change in policy. ""Just look at what we can do when we come together, THIS is England in 2020.""
The move by the government was met with widespread praise for Rashford from fellow sports stars, politicians and the mayor of London. ""Well played, Marcus. Well played,"" said former England captain and pundit Gary Lineker on Twitter. 

""Good to see Marcus Rashford keeping up his record of scoring on debut in each new competition,"" one comment said.

Eateries in the capital Manila that can meet government safety protocols were allowed to reopen from Monday at 30% of their seating capacity, with strict hygiene and social distancing measures a must.
That won't be a problem for Lalaine Baja, even though her streetside Manila restaurant that serves Filipino favourites had only a trickle of diners on Tuesday.
""We are thankful when even one or two customers eat at our restaurant,"" she said. ""Since customers now have the option to dine in, our sales have been gradually picking up.""
The Philippines has so far reported 26,781 infections and 1,103 fatalities due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. That's the third-highest death toll in East Asia after China and Indonesia.
Metro Manila has been under lockdown since March 16, but restrictions have been loosened since June 1 after some grim forecasts for a normally resilient economy and record April unemployment of 17.7%.
Televised video footage showed happy staff at restaurants cleaning tables and cutlery, with some wearing masks and face shields and others in full-length protective suits and latex gloves.
Customers will be required to sit diagonally, or with a transparent plastic panel between them. 
President Rodrigo Duterte said on Monday some restrictions would remain in place in Manila for a further two weeks because the threat of contagion remained. These include bans on gatherings and sports, partial curbs on public transportation, and stay-at-home orders for the elderly.
His trade minister, Ramon Lopez, said the only way to get the economy going without risking further outbreaks of the virus would be through modified restaurants and the restricted reopening of barber shops, salons and malls.

""It is to our interest in government to really find that healthy balance in bringing back jobs while ensuring health protocols are followed,"" he said.

489,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 16, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Hat in hand: U.S. scientists scramble to support their COVID immunity research,"By Nick Brown
(Reuters) - It wasn’t easy to build a COVID-19 antibody test during Illinois’ statewide lockdown.
In April, when a key enzyme couldn't be delivered to his shuttered laboratory, Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University researcher Thomas McDade hunted for the package across the empty campus near Chicago, finally locating it at a loading dock. To verify the test’s accuracy, the biological anthropologist and his colleague, pharmacologist Alexis Demonbreun, asked friends and family if they’d be willing to spot them some blood. McDade took a sample from his wife over their kitchen table. 
The scientists' goal is to look for people with coronavirus antibodies - proteins that indicate possible immunity - in Chicago-area neighborhoods with vastly different death rates. They want to study why the novel coronavirus is deadlier for some groups, such as African Americans and Latinos.
In early May, the team arrived at a test they believed worked. “All the pieces are in place,” McDade wrote in an email to colleagues on May 20. “All we need now is funding to roll it out.”
Across the United States, academic and regional government researchers have embarked on antibody testing initiatives to determine how the coronavirus is spreading, how deadly it is and who is likely to suffer its worst effects. The results could help return the country to normalcy, scientists say, by revealing who is still susceptible and guiding prevention efforts and lockdown decisions..
Unlike clinicians focused mainly on diagnosing individual patients, these scientists study states, communities and other subgroups. But their jobs are made much harder, they say, in the absence of substantial federal funding, standards and coordination.
“It would be better to have a unified information sharing system, a unified testing strategy, and the resources to execute it everywhere in the country,” said Dr. Joe DeRisi, co-president of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a medical research nonprofit in San Francisco.
Instead, the success of coronavirus antibody studies often depends on luck, personal commitment and whatever resources researchers can muster, according to Reuters interviews with more than 20 scientists, public health officials and others.
In a statement, Mia Heck, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said the administration of President Donald Trump “continues to improve America’s testing capabilities and capacity. As part of these efforts, the Administration is working with diagnostics companies and academic researchers to develop the next generation of tests, testing platforms, and testing protocols. Antibody testing is a particularly important area of ongoing inquiry.”
Of the more than $35 billion allocated by the federal government for COVID-19 testing, relatively little has been earmarked for antibody testing and research. HHS has focused much more on diagnostic testing, which reveals active infections, as opposed to antibody surveillance, which seeks to identify people who have ever been infected with COVID-19, even if they showed no symptoms.
However, $306 million of the federal money has been set aside for the National Cancer Institute to expand antibody testing capacity and fund research projects, according to a public presentation last month by Dr. Dinah Singer, the institute's deputy director of scientific strategy and development. The institute will award money to private-sector clinical researchers and academic institutions, creating a coordinating center for sharing resources and data.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is overseen by HHS, plans to test for antibodies in 325,000 samples from blood donors in 25 major metropolitan regions over 18 months, beginning this summer.
ALL OVER THE MAP
So far, large-scale blood antibody tests, both by academic researchers and local or state governments, indicate that most people remain vulnerable to coronavirus infection. But results vary - sometimes widely.
Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston did one study based on a street corner in a Chelsea, Massachusetts, neighborhood with high COVID-19 hospitalization rates, finding that 31.5% of people had antibodies. In another study across several Boston neighborhoods, the same researchers found 10%.
New York state has tested more than 50,000 people since April, finding antibodies in 12.3% of the population statewide but 20% in New York City, according to Jonah Bruno, a state Department of Health spokesman.
Several antibody studies have been conducted in more affluent areas, where funding was more readily available. Academics from three universities in the San Francisco Bay Area, for instance, have launched at least four antibody blood test initiatives.
In Bolinas, California, a team from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), tested more than 1,800 people for coronavirus and its antibodies after locals crowdfunded the cost. The isolated beach community in Marin County, one of the country’s richest, is overwhelmingly white. Diagnostic testing in April showed zero infections, and antibody testing showed between zero and 0.3% had ever been infected.
“I wouldn’t have necessarily chosen Bolinas as the one community to test,” said Dr. Matt Willis, Marin County’s public health officer.
With little standardization, some early efforts at antibody testing have proved inconsistent, onerous and of questionable quality.
A study in April out of Stanford University found that the number of people positive for COVID-19 antibodies in Santa Clara County, California, was more than 50 times the number of infections confirmed through diagnostic testing. Critics derided the results, in part because subjects were recruited via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), potentially skewing participation toward those who had experienced symptoms. The authors argued they had adjusted for selection bias, but nevertheless revised their estimates downward.
Researchers seeking to make their own tests can face difficulty obtaining ingredients like proteins, test plates and color-changing enzymes.
The quasi-public Biodefense and Emerging Infections Resources (BEI), funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), provides free materials to registered researchers looking to make tests, including those for COVID-19 antibodies. But it’s first come, first served, and some scientists say they have waited weeks for the materials they need.
About 1,300 researchers have applied for registration at BEI since February - more than 90% for COVID-19 research - compared to a normal rate of about 70 applicants per month, a NIAID spokeswoman said. She said that, in general, registration takes three days and materials are shipped out within another three. 
Even with the proper materials in hand, scientists say it can be difficult to compare one researcher’s results with another’s.
“If I measure antibodies in my lab, using a method I cobbled together from available sources, and someone else cobbles theirs together with a different suite of sources, we’re going to get different results,” said Eleanor Brindle, a researcher at the University of Washington who is studying whether nursing mothers can pass the virus or its antibodies to their infants.
GOOD FORTUNE AND INGENUITY
McDade got lucky. He was able to join forces with Northwestern pharmacologist Demonbreun, who had a key ingredient on hand and helped him quickly assemble a blood antibody test.
The university helped pay for the initial work, and the team has applied for more funding. Decisions like that can take a while, given the competition for research dollars and the challenges posed by COVID-19.
“These days, when we’re wrestling with issues about how to bring research back to campus, how to plan for a fall quarter that brings students back to campus, we’ve really been swamped,” said Milan Mrksich, Northwestern’s vice president of research.
The team sought support from several other potential funders, so far without success. But last month, they secured a $200,000 grant from the National Science Foundation.
Even that wasn’t easy: The NSF initially told McDade the project was not a good fit, he said. He tweaked the proposal in May, focusing it on potential scientific innovations. That brought “the work more in line with NSF’s mission,” said agency spokesman Michael England, making it worth the investment.
McDade said the NSF money is enough to test 3,000 people - less than a third of the goal - but he hopes it can help leverage more funding. He just wishes the federal government would open the spigots more widely. 

“Why are academics like me trying to find little pots of money to do what we think is a basic public health surveillance effort?” he said. “It’s ludicrous.”

IDLIB, Syria (Reuters) - Providing for 16 children including four sets of twins is only getting harder for Ahmad Yassin al-Ali and his wife Fawza Umri, Syrians who were forced to flee their home nearly a decade ago and are now crammed into a tent at the Turkish border.
Ali, whose wife is eight months pregnant with more twins, says the little money he can scrape together gathering and selling scrap plastic buys less and less, reflecting soaring prices caused by the collapse of Syria's currency.
""Two of my children help me. The days I can sell, I buy bread, potatoes and tomatoes,"" Ali said. ""Because of the collapse of the Syrian currency, prices have increased to the point where we don't have the money to buy food and bread.""
The opposition-held area where Ali, 35, and his family live in Idlib falls outside President Bashar al-Assad's control, but the pound is still used there.
The U.N. agency OCHA says the halving of its value since the beginning of May has pushed the price of basic necessities to record highs and further out of reach of the 4 million people in the area.
Umri, 35, says the recent Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, was a time for despair rather than celebration. ""I hated my life,"" she said.
One of their daughters suffers from hearing difficulties and is unable to speak, and another is paralysed on one side, but they cannot afford medical treatment.
""Food is a big problem for us. We cannot buy vegetables and most days they eat bread and nothing else,"" she said.

The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, uprooting more than 6.6 million in Syria and forcing 5.5 million to flee to neighbouring countries.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO is seeking details on U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to cut U.S. troops numbers in Germany, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said on Tuesday, after the proposed reduction caught allies off guard.
Trump, who has criticized Germany for not spending more on defence, on Monday confirmed last week's reports of a cut of 9,500 troops in what may be the first time the U.S. president carries through on threats to reduce support in Europe.
""It's not yet decided how and when this decision will be implemented,"" Stoltenberg told a video news conference.
Stoltenberg said he had spoken to Trump, as well as other U.S. officials, and was also consulting with German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who said last week she had not been informed of the decision. 
""It's a bilateral arrangement between the U.S. and Germany but of course it matters for the whole alliance,"" Stoltenberg said. He said he told Trump that U.S. troops in Europe were not only protecting territory but allowing the United States to project power beyond the continent.
Last week, a U.S. official said the decision had stemmed from months of work and had nothing to do with tensions between Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who thwarted his plan to host an in-person Group of Seven summit.
The United States has yet to brief its NATO allies on the decision but may use a NATO defence ministers' meeting on Wednesday and Thursday, via video link, two NATO diplomats said.
While the United States will retain some 50,000 military personnel in Europe, retired U.S. general Ben Hodges, who commanded American army forces in Europe, described it as a ""colossal mistake.""

""If they go through with it, the damage to the relationship between Germany and the United States would be significant,"" he told Reuters.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's parliament on Tuesday revoked special powers granted to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government to tackle the coronavirus pandemic as the number of cases dwindles and the focus shifts to reviving the economy.
Orban, whose right-wing Fidesz party, has a large parliamentary majority, shut Hungary's international borders and imposed tough restrictions on citizens' freedoms to help halt the spread of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the virus.
Orban, 57, who has extended his influence over most walks of life in Hungary during his decade-long rule, faced accusations from human rights groups of making a power-grab after lawmakers granted him the open-ended mandate in late March.
Hungary, which has a population of around 10 million, had recorded 4,077 cases of COVID-19 as of Tuesday, including 565 deaths.
While revoking the government's special rights, parliament also passed a resolution to maintain some recent measures introduced by Orban, including a moratorium on all loan repayments until the end of this year. 
Orban now faces the toughest challenge of his rule as the pandemic is expected to push Hungary's economy, along with much of the world, into recession and drive unemployment higher.
The government has channelled significant tax revenues away from local municipalities and this measure also remains in place, prompting criticism from opposition parties.
Parliament also approved a measure whereby the government can declare a state of emergency in future based on a proposal from the surgeon-general if he or she deems that the public health situation requires it.

A joint statement, signed by nearly 50 independent experts, voiced dismay at U.S. support for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's ""unlawful"" plan to extend sovereignty, de facto annexation of land that the Palestinians seek for a state.
""The annexation of occupied territory is a serious violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the Geneva Conventions, and contrary to the fundamental rule affirmed many times by the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly that the acquisition of territory by war or force is inadmissible,"" it said.
What would be left of the West Bank after annexation of about 30% would amount to a ""Palestinian Bantustan"", it said.
There was no immediate reaction from the government of Netanyahu, who has set July 1 as the date to begin advancing his plan to annex Israel's settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, hoping for a green light from Washington.
U.S. President Donald Trump has unveiled a peace plan that includes Israel keeping its settlements and the Palestinians establishing a state under stringent conditions.
Palestinians have rejected the proposal and voiced outrage at Israel's proposed annexation.
""The United Nations has stated on many occasions that the 53-year-old Israeli occupation is the source of profound human rights violations against the Palestinian people,"" the experts' statement said.
Violations have included land confiscation, settler violence, home demolitions, excessive use of force and torture, restrictions on the media and freedom of expression, and ""a two-tier system of disparate political, legal, social, cultural and economic rights based on ethnicity and nationality"", it said.

""These human rights violations would only intensify after annexation,"" it added.

PARIS (Reuters) - The Pompidou Centre in Paris, home to Europe's largest modern art collection, will be left 20 million euros out of pocket by the coronavirus crisis but its director Serge Lasvignes has a more pressing matter on his hands - how to reopen safely. 
His plan includes online ticket sales to avoid queues at the gate, a one-way flow around the museum's cavernous interior demarcated by arrows and guided tours of the permanent exhibitions for groups no larger than 10 people. And masks.
""We've got to make a visit as fluid as possible,"" Lasvignes told Reuters, as staff cleaned public areas and moved works ahead of the July 1 reopening. 
As France accelerates the unwinding of what was one of Europe's strictest lockdowns, restoration work to the museum's external escalators has resumed. 
The Pompidou Centre was designed by British architect Richard Rogers (NYSE:ROG) and Italian Renzo Piano before either hit stardom. Many Parisians hated it at first - detractors said the ""inside-out"" building resembled an oil refinery - before slowly taking it to their hearts.
In normal times, French visitors make up 60% of the 3.5 million people who marvel at the paintings and sculptures of Pablo Picasso, Joan Miro, Wassily Kandinsky and others. 
That may help the Pompidou Centre recover faster than museums that draw a higher proportion of foreign visitors, like the Louvre. Even so, Lasvignes said the rebound would likely take until 2022.
""We're less exposed than a big museum like the Louvre, but we're exposed nonetheless,"" he said.
The museum's bookshop, restaurants and design shop will all open on July 1. The library, where normally the city's students queue to access the millions of books, will reopen later in the summer and quarantine each book for at least three days after it has been returned.
Researchers will have to book appointments and numbers allowed inside at any one time will be limited.

""We'll lose around 20 million euros in lost ticketing, membership and event revenues,"" Lasvignes said.

Walter Luebcke, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, was found dead in a pool of blood outside his house in the western state of Hesse in June 2019. He had been shot in the head at close range.
The defendant, identified only as Stephan E. to conform with German privacy laws, is charged with the homicide of Luebcke in Hesse by shooting him on the night of June 1-2 2019, the court said. 
A second defendant, Markus H., is charged with aiding and abetting the killing.
""Both defendants are charged with having committed these crimes based on extreme right-wing political convictions,"" the court said.
Luebcke was a figure of hate for the far-right because of his outspoken support for Merkel's open-doors migrant policy. 
Stephan E. initially confessed to shooting Luebcke dead but later changed his statement. Earlier this year he said he and Markus H. had gone to the house with a gun intending to threaten Luebcke but the gun went off while his friend was holding it. 
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has warned that the biggest threat facing Germany comes from the right and fears have mounted since February when a racist attack in Hanau left 11 people dead.

In 2018 Beate Zschaepe, a member of a neo-Nazi gang, was jailed for life for her part in the murders of 10 people during a campaign of racially motivated violence.

The unrest stemmed from ""a settling of scores"" between ethnic Chechens and local residents of Gresilles, a low-income district with a heavy North African immigrant population, said local prefect Bernard Schmeltz.
Regional radio news station France Bleu quoted Dijon prosecutor Eric Mathias as saying he had opened an investigation into attempted murder by an organised group and incitement to violence.
Mathias said Chechens had allegedly used social media to issue a France-wide call for vengeance over an attack on a member of their community by people from the Maghreb region of Northwest Africa.
Videos, whose provenance Reuters could not immediately authenticate, circulated at the weekend showing dozens of hooded Chechen men, some wearing balaclavas and brandishing handguns or knives, out in the streets of the Dijon suburb.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain is considering imposing a quarantine on British travellers when it reopens its borders next week, the foreign minister said, in response to a similar policy at London's end. 
Arancha Gonzalez Laya told the BBC she hoped Britain would lift its restriction, making a reciprocal Spanish one unnecessary. 
""We will be in a dialogue with the UK to see whether or not we should be introducing reciprocity as they have different measures than the rest of the European Union,"" she said in an advance excerpt from current affairs programme HARDtalk.
Britain, with more than 41,000 documented coronavirus-linked deaths, and Spain, with more than 27,000, have been two of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. 
Both, along with other European countries, are now easing lockdown restrictions, including border closures.
Spanish officials gave no mention of any quarantine curbs on Sunday, when the government moved forward the date for allowing European visitors back into the country to June 21 from July 1.
In recent weeks, Spain has caused confusion in neighbouring countries and exasperation in the travel industry by repeatedly changing the date and conditions for lifting the ban on foreign visitors it imposed in mid-March.
""I still don't know what I will do with my staff and it's June 16,"" Jorge Marichal, CEO of Canary Islands hotel group Inversiones Marylanza, said at a business event.
""We cannot work this way.""
Spain counts on tourism for about 12 percent of its economy and more than one in eight jobs, making it essential to try and salvage some of the summer holiday season.
Britain's Finance Minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday the quarantine was among measures it would review, saying the government could make changes such as introducing travel corridors with specific countries.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued two reports this year rebuking Iran for failing to answer questions about nuclear activities almost two decades ago before its 2015 nuclear deal at three sites and for denying it access to two of them.
A draft resolution, seen by Reuters and dated June 10, put forward by Britain, France and Germany calls on Iran to cooperate fully and promptly with the IAEA.
It asks Tehran to provide access to the locations specified and implement obligations under the Additional Protocol, referring to texts governing the IAEA's mission and activities. 
""The Europeans couldn’t sit back and not do anything,"" a Western diplomat said. 
U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Israel's obtaining of what it calls an ""archive"" of past Iranian nuclear work has, however, given the IAEA extra information on Iran's previous activities.
""If the three countries take such steps, Iran will have no other choice but to react accordingly,"" Iran's IAEA representative Kazem Gharibabadi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency.
The IAEA has also reported that Iran remains in breach of many of the restrictions imposed by its nuclear deal.
Iran began breaching the accord after the United States withdrew in May 2018 and reimposed economic sanctions on Tehran.
Britain, France and Germany, which remain in the deal, have accused Iran of violating the terms of its 2015 agreement, but hope to persuade Tehran to reverse course rather than join a U.S. maximum pressure campaign it imposed since withdrawing from the accord in 2018.
Russia and China, the other participants in the deal, are likely to oppose the resolution. It would be put forward this week at the IAEA board of governors meeting for approval either by consensus or a vote.

The single J-10 fighter was given radio warnings to leave before the Taiwanese air force jets ushered the intruder out of the airspace southwest of the island, the ministry said. 
On Tuesday last week, the ministry said several Su-30 fighters, some of China's most advanced jets, crossed into the same airspace and were also warned to leave.
On Friday, the ministry said a Chinese Y-8, a propeller aircraft based on a Soviet-era design some of which have been retrofitted as surveillance aircraft, was warned too by Taiwan's air force to leave the air space, again in the southwest.
The Y-8 flight came a few hours after Taiwan said it had carried out missile tests off its eastern coast.
Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.
China has not commented publicly on the last week of Chinese air force activity near Taiwan. Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country's determination to defend its sovereignty. 
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan becoming independent.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist intent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon is struggling to take the first steps out of a deep financial crisis, with hopes of reforms getting under way shaken by what government critics say is a sectarian carve-up of state jobs that has shown the political elite's reluctance to change.
The heavily indebted country has been sliding deeper into trouble since October, when a combination of slowing capital inflows and protests against corruption spilled into a political, banking and financial crisis. 
Hopes of a quick rescue deal with the International Monetary Fund have faded, with talks complicated by a row between the government and central bank over the scale of the losses in the financial system. 
Concerns about the absence of change have been compounded by appointments to several positions in the government and central bank last week that were criticised by opponents - and some allies - as based on sectarian ties rather than merit.
This has raised new questions about Prime Minister Hassan Diab's commitment to - or ability to carry out - pledges to deliver competence-driven governance which he made on taking office in January.
""The appointments were basically a signal that it is business as usual,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center. ""None of the grand reform promises that were made when the government was formed are actually being implemented.""
Underlining the growing concerns, a source familiar with the talks with the IMF said that before full negotiations on a rescue deal can begin, the Fund wants to feel comfortable that reforms have at least started - and to see progress in assessing the country's financial losses and a new capital control law.
The talks are still only at the diagnostic stage, the source said.
One important area where donors are still waiting to see any tangible change is the wasteful state-run power sector, a reform seen as a test of Beirut's political will to change.
With hopes of change fading, the threat of instability is growing.
""We are seeing a steady deterioration in the situation on the ground,"" an international diplomat said. ""The international community remains ready to support, but only the Lebanese authorities can deliver reform, and rebuild the economy.""
A collapse in the currency and soaring poverty have fuelled new protests, and commercial premises were attacked in Beirut and Tripoli at the weekend.
Sectarian tensions have risen and religious leaders intervened to defuse Sunni-Shi'ite Muslim confrontations in Beirut this month. 
As the crisis has worsened, nearly a quarter of a million people have lost their jobs, the labour federation says, the Lebanese currency has lost more than 60% of its value and savers have been locked out of their deposits. 
Some banks, repeatedly torched in rioting, have fortified their facades and locked ATMs behind iron curtains. 
""PRINTING MONEY""
Foreign donors say Lebanon must enact reforms to fix the root causes of the crisis, but Diab's government has not yet taken a new path.
Diab came to office with support from the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, the Christian President Michel Aoun and Shi'ite Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. 
Sunni politician, Saad al-Hariri, a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states, and Druze leader Walid Jumblatt stayed out of the government.
Critics say last week's state appointments showed who was really in charge.
Berri, long a pillar of the sectarian order, consolidated his influence, picking one of four deputy governors appointed at the central bank, and, among others, the new director general of the economy ministry, Mohammad Abu Haidar.
The Free Patriotic Movement headed by Gebran Bassil, Aoun's son-in-law, got the lion's share of Christian appointments, reflecting the power balance. 
An economic recovery plan unveiled by Diab in April which involved turning to the IMF had raised hopes that Lebanon was getting its act together, but there has been little progress since then, Capital Economics said in a research note on Monday.
Hurdles to overcome include the risk that IMF member states might veto a deal because of Hezbollah's role in government and rows between the central bank and government, it said. 
""It looks increasingly likely that these hurdles will be difficult to overcome,"" it added.
With the government struggling to prop up the pound, the price of food has soared in the import-dependent country, and state finances are in a parlous state.
""Nobody is going to lend to the Lebanese government,"" said Nasser Saidi, a former economy minister.

He said the central bank that has been ""monetizing the deficits"" and this meant ""you are ... printing more money to finance government.""

With Greece, Israel and Cyprus partnered up on energy projects in the eastern Mediterranean, Mitsotakis also warned against exploration efforts by ""neighbourhood bully"" Turkey.
Israel sees the visit as an opportunity to dilute European opposition to its planned annexation of occupied West Bank land which the Palestinians want for a state. 
Hoping to salvage its tourism sector this summer, Greece opened its main airports to mainly EU visitors on Monday. Israel has provided about 1 million tourists annually in recent years.
""I am certain that the flights from Israel will resume very soon,"" Mitsotakis told Israel's biggest-selling newspaper, Yedioth Ahronoth before he arrived in Israel. ""I aspire to make Greece the safe destination of Europe.""
Mitsotakis said the Greek-Israeli-Cypriot energy explorations arrangement ""is not directed against nor exclusive of anyone"", but accused Turkey of trying to exert political and military control over the region.
""Turkey is welcome to give up on its imperialistic pipeline dreams and cooperate with us as an equal and law-abiding partners – not as the neighbourhood bully,"" he said.
Turkey says it is within its sovereign rights. 
Israel says its planned annexation of Jewish settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley in the West Bank is in line with a U.S. plan for peace with the Palestinians, but the European Union has said it ""could not pass unchallenged"". 
""We expect Greece to be an anchor of support for us in the Union,"" Yossi Amrani, the Israeli ambassador to Athens, told Israel's Army Radio when asked about the annexation plan.

Mitsotakis told Yedioth he would also speak to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas after returning to Greece.

""The victim is reported to be in critical but stable condition,"" the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) said in a tweet, adding that the incident had ended.
The Albuquerque Journal newspaper reported that the shooting erupted during a clash between protesters trying to pull down a statue of Juan de Onate and several heavily armed members of a civilian militia group called the New Mexico Civil Guard.
Police chief of Albuquerque, Michael Geier, said in a statement that police were receiving reports about vigilante groups possibly instigating the violence. 
The confrontation occurred outside the Albuquerque Museum in the heart of the city's Old Town district.
According to the Journal's account, one man involved in a physical altercation with the protesters appeared to draw a gun and fire five shots after he was pushed onto the street, sending members of the crowd scurrying for cover as one person yelled, ""Somebody got shot.""
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently assisting APD violent crime investigators as they interview individuals who were involved in the shooting, the tweet said. 
""Police used chemical irritants and flash bangs to protect officers and detain individuals involved in the shooting. The individuals were disarmed and taken into custody for questioning."" 
Video footage posted to social media from the scene appeared to show one man lying on the ground as several other people tried to render assistance. A separate clip showed three men lying face down and spread eagle on the pavement as police in riot gear stood over them, apparently making arrests. Another officer appeared to be on the ground as well.
Anti-racism protesters venting anger over last month's death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, have taken to destroying statutes honoring the U.S. Civil War's Confederacy, as well as sculptures of imperialists, conquistadors and other historical figures associated with subjugation of indigenous populations around the world.

The statue at the center of Monday's protest in Albuquerque is part of a controversial sculpture called ""La Jornada,"" which depicts Onate, known for the 1599 massacre of a pueblo tribe, leading a group of Spanish settlers into what is now New Mexico.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The health minister in Delhi's state government checked into hospital with high fever and was being tested for coronavirus on Tuesday as India reported more than 10,500 new infections that are threatening to overwhelm hospitals. 
India has opened up businesses, public transport and shopping malls to resuscitate a battered economy but the ending of the nearly 70-day lockdown has come just as cases are rising at their fastest daily levels. 
The total number of infections stood at 343,091, the world's fourth most after the United States, Brazil and Russia, the health ministry data showed. At least 9,900 people have died, far fewer than the United States and Brazil, but more than Russia.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who initially won praise for imposing a vast lockdown on India's 1.3 billion population early on in the pandemic, called state chief ministers for a video conference to discuss measures to deal with the surge in cases.
The big cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai remain the worst affected.
""Due to high grade fever and a sudden drop of my oxygen levels last night I have been admitted to RGSSH (Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital). Will keep everyone updated,"" Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain said in a tweet. He would be tested for the disease and results were expected by later Tuesday, a member of Jain's party said.
Several senior officials from finance, foreign affairs and law departments that are all based in Delhi have tested positive over the past few weeks. Most have been working in offices from the beginning of the crisis.
Jain himself attended a meeting on Sunday where federal Home Minister Amit Shah and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were present. It was not immediately known if Shah, seen as the most powerful member of the cabinet after Modi, was going to test. 

Kejriwal had tested negative earlier in the month.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A diverse crowd of New Yorkers wearing masks and waving the rainbow pride flag gathered on Monday at the Stonewall Inn, an iconic gay bar in Manhattan, to celebrate the Supreme Court’s ruling making it illegal for employers to fire workers because they are transgender.
""Our Supreme Court did something!"" said Marti Cummings, a prominent nonbinary New York drag queen. ""It was a 6-3 ruling that said we are allowed to have jobs. That we are allowed to go to work and be ourselves, that we can show up at work and say that I am a gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, gender nonconforming, nonbinary, genderqueer, two spirit person.""
The landmark 6-3 ruling represented the biggest advancement for LGBT rights in the United States since the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.
Workplace bias against gay and transgender employees had remained legal in much of the country, with 28 U.S. states lacking comprehensive measures against employment discrimination. The ruling - in two gay rights cases from Georgia and New York and a transgender rights case from Michigan - recognizes new worker protections in federal law.
Speakers at the Stonewall Inn talked about the nature of labor in the transgender community, and advocated for protections for sex work. It is arguably the most famous gay bar in the world, where a 1969 police raid and subsequent protests launched the modern gay rights movement.
TS Candii, the founder of Black Trans News LLC, a news organization she said was recently created by transgender youth who are sex workers, led the crowd in chanting, ""Sex work is work!"" 
'HIGHLY EMOTIONAL'
Miss Peppermint, a black transgender drag queen and activist, said she was present for oral arguments at the Supreme Court case. “The ruling was highly emotional,"" she said. ""It meant one step towards true equality.” 
“I don’t know that there’s ever been a black trans woman in the Supreme Court, period. But there hasn’t been a case that has argued transgender rights so clearly in history. So it was a historic moment to behold.”
The protests and growing social movement in support of civil rights for Black Americans also loomed large over the rally. Speakers noted that the struggle for transgender rights had connections to other movements for social, racial, and economic justice currently roiling the city and the nation. 
Several speakers referred to the murders of two transgender women of color in the United States in the last week alone.

“I don't think it’s possible to really dismantle homophobia without dismantling sexism and misogyny, and I don’t think it’s possible to really dismantle racism without dismantling homophobia,” Miss Peppermint said. “I think that all of these things are connected. The intersection I was born at really does connect with all of those things in a very clear way.”

(Reuters) - Rights groups in Indonesia have complained of escalating intimidation and security threats in the run-up to the verdict in a high-profile treason trial against seven West Papuans that is expected on Wednesday.
Papuan demands for independence or greater autonomy is among the most sensitive topics in Indonesia, but campaigners said the latest intimidation reflects a worsening political atmosphere across the archipelago of 270 million people.
""We have recorded at least 20 incidents in which students, academics, journalists, and activists, have been intimidated for criticising the government and discussing politically sensitive issues, such as rights abuses in Papua,"" said Usman Hamid, local executive director of Amnesty International.
The claims of escalating intimidation come as a court in Balikpapan on Indonesian Borneo is expected to rule on a case against seven West Papuans who face between five and 17 years in prison on charges of treason for their purported involvement in anti-racist protests in August last year.
The demonstrations erupted across several cities in Indonesia after a group of Papuan students at a university dormitory in Java were reportedly taunted with racist slurs such as “monkeys”, “pigs” and “dogs”. 
In the provinces of Papua and West Papua some of the protests turned violent and deadly, with shops and government building set ablaze.
The defendants were arrested in Jayapura, Papua, last year but moved to a jail in Balikpapan for security reasons. 
Protests across several Indonesian cities on Monday called for all charges to be dropped. 
Activists have drawn parallels between the treason trial and the Black Lives Matter movement, which has sparked the hashtag #PapuanLivesMatter and led to a series of online forums about perceived racism in Indonesia. 
""Racism had no place in Indonesia, a multi-ethnic country with a motto and tradition of unity in diversity,” Teuku Faizasyah, a spokesperson for Indonesia’s foreign ministry told Reuters.
""The incident of mistreatment of Indonesians of Papuan origin are isolated and do not in any way reflect the policies of the government.”
Yuliana Yabansabra, a lawyer defending the seven West Papuans says she was attacked last week by an unidentified motorcyclist, who allegedly punched her in the head while she was driving.
“They didn’t try and take my bag or my wallet, so it seemed their plan was to try and make me crash,” said Yabansabra, “It felt like an act of terror especially directed at me.”
In early June an organiser of a discussion on West Papua was warned by his university in Lampung to cancel the event because it was “anti-government”. He later received anonymous threats on his WhatsApp, including a picture of his identity cards and his parents’ names.
Students have been similarly harassed in Jakarta and Bandung, according to research by Human Rights Watch.
In the past two weeks almost half a dozen forums on West Papua and racism have been obstructed, some by strange sounds such as clanging piano chords, while speakers have been spammed with robocalls from anonymous international numbers.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The deaths of two black men found hanged from trees 10 days and 50 miles (80 km) apart in California, one in a municipal park, gained deeper scrutiny on Monday amid a public outcry that authorities were ready to prematurely rule both cases suicides. 
Law enforcement officials acknowledged on Monday facing a furor of suspicion from community members surrounding the two hangings in light of heightened discontent with racial injustice aroused by George Floyd's death at the hands of police in Minneapolis last month.
Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villenueva and his counterpart in neighboring San Bernardino County, John McMahon, said separately they would work in cooperation with investigators from the California attorney general's office. 
Villenueva said the FBI would provide additional oversight of his department's probe - constituting the more recent and highly visible of the two cases.
The body of Robert Fuller, 24, was found hanging from a tree by a rope around his neck before dawn last Wednesday by paramedics called to Poncitlan Square, a park about a block from City Hall in the high-desert town of Palmdale, some 30 miles (48 km) north of Los Angeles.
During a televised community meeting two days later, officials said it appeared Fuller had taken his own life - drawing an angry response and chants of ""Speak the truth"" and ""No peace."" Villanueva said his office had since been flooded with phone calls and email queries.
The social media hashtag #JusticeforRobertFuller was trending on Twitter last week, with users calling for a full investigation of what some speculated was a cover-up of a lynching. 
At news conference on Monday with the sheriff, the county's chief medical examiner, Dr. Jonathan Lucas, said the preliminary assessment of apparent suicide had been based on a lack of any immediate evidence pointing to foul play.
""But we felt it prudent to roll that back and continue to look deeper,"" Lucas said. 
Adding to the mystery was the lack of anything near the body, such as a ladder, stool or chair, that could have been used to elevate Fuller before a hanging, authorities said. 
""There was nothing else found at the scene, other than the rope which was used to hang the victim and the contents of his pocket as well as a backpack that he was wearing,"" Captain Kent Wegener, head of the sheriff's homicide squad, told reporters.
Villanueva said his investigators would confer with the San Bernardino County sheriff's office on the death of Malcolm Harsch, 37, who was found hanged from a tree at a homeless encampment about 50 miles east of Palmdale in Victorville, California, on May 31.
Officials there said Harsch's death likewise appeared to be a suicide. But authorities are continuing an investigation.
Separate autopsies of the two men were performed on Friday, but final conclusions were awaiting toxicology results and further inquiry by homicide detectives, officials from both counties said.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - India's eastern Bihar state, one of the country's largest and poorest states, posted a steep rise in unemployment in the year ended June 2019 to record nearly double the national jobless rate, only months out from elections.
The latest state unemployment data released on Tuesday is a lagging indicator and the current jobless rate was expected to be much higher as millions of unemployed labourers return home due to a nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.
Unemployment in Bihar rose by 3 percentage points to 10.2% during the year ended June 2019, government data showed, even as the country's overall unemployment slowed to 5.8%, compared with 6.1% a year earlier.
The state, governed by regional party Janata Dal (United) - an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) - is the country's third most populous and is expected to go to polls in October this year.
India's Home Minister Amit Shah, last week began the BJP's election campaign claiming that the coalition had pursued development in the state.
Bihar's economy is largely dependent on agriculture and a low rate of industrialisation has pushed millions of labourers to migrate to different parts of the country in search of work.
Latest data from CMIE, a private research house, showed unemployment in Bihar was the highest among all large states in the country, with smaller eastern states of Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh showing higher joblessness.
The government does not release month-wise employment data, and economists have for long complained that India's joblessness data is out of date.

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus outbreak has prompted a significant increase in news consumption but the economic turmoil is forcing news businesses to accelerate their move to digital, The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism said.
The coronavirus lockdowns prompted a global rise in viewing of television and online news though concerns about misinformation remain high, with Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp seen as the main channels for spreading so called ""fake news"".
The broader picture is that the outbreak is accelerating the trends wrought by the technological revolution, including the rise of smartphones as an interface of news consumption, The Reuters Institute said in its annual Digital News Report (www.digitalnewsreport.org).
""The headline is that we see an accelerated move to digital media and mobile media and various kinds of platforms,"" Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute, said by telephone. 
""This is accompanied by a continued decline in trust in news and growing concerns over misinformation, in particular on social media and from some politicians.""
The biggest increase in concern over media misinformation was in Hong Kong - where anti-government protesters have opposed attempts by China to tighten its control of the former British colony.
The business of news remains bleak. Media across the world are cutting staff to cope with a dramatic fall in advertising revenue.
But a ray of hope may be that increasing numbers of people are willing to pay for news online, though that may also increase informational inequality as many cannot afford top quality journalism.
And a ""winner takes all"" process can be seen: Around half of those that subscribe to any online or combined package in the United States use the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) or the Washington Post, the Reuters Institute found.
A similar trend can be seen in the United Kingdom with The Times or the Telegraph.
And for those predicting the dominance of video news, the Reuters Institute found that in a number of countries including the United Kingdom, Australia, France, and South Korea, people under 35 preferred to read rather than watch news online. 

The Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism is a research centre at the University of Oxford that tracks media trends. The  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, the philanthropic arm of Thomson Reuters, funds the Reuters Institute.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo plans to meet a Chinese delegation at a U.S. military base in Hawaii this week to discuss bilateral ties that have soured deeply since the start of the year, sources familiar with the matter said.
In addition to an intensifying strategic rivalry, the world's top two economies have been at loggerheads in recent months over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China's move to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong. 
Experts say relations have reached their lowest point in years, and in mid-May President Donald Trump even went so far as to suggest he could cut ties with Beijing.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper cited an unidentified source as saying that Yang Jiechi, a state councilor and member of the Communist Party's powerful politburo, will lead the Chinese side in the meeting with Pompeo.
It is expected to take place at Hawaii's Hickam Air Force base, said a diplomatic source, who did not want to be identified. Another source said Pompeo was expected to leave Washington on Tuesday for the meeting on Wednesday.
It would be Pompeo's first known contact with Yang since they spoke by telephone on April 15 to discuss the coronavirus.
The sources said the likely agenda included coronavirus response, arms control, trade, Hong Kong, North Korea and tit-for-tat moves against journalists.
The State Department and White House did not respond to requests for comment about the trip, first reported by Politico on Friday.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian declined to confirm the reports at a regular briefing on Monday, but said: ""China and the U.S. have maintained communication through diplomatic channels. If there is any further information, it will be released in a timely manner.""
The U.S. China Business Council, which represents 200 companies doing business in China, said diplomacy helped bring about the first part a deal aimed ending a damaging trade war earlier this year and could help resolve other disputes.
""There are many important issues to discuss, but not enough discussions. Give diplomacy a chance,"" said its spokesman Doug Barry. 
Pompeo has been forceful in his criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus, which originated in China. He has said China could have prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths by being more transparent and accused it of refusing to share information.
Trump has initiated a process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China for curbing freedoms there, but has stopped short of immediately ending privileges that have helped the territory remain a global financial center.

The $700 million market for imported salmon in China is at risk after the fish was implicated in a new outbreak of coronavirus cases in Beijing, potentially dealing a blow to major exporters like Denmark, Norway and Australia.
Salmon has been taken off the shelves in supermarkets and grocery delivery platforms across major Chinese cities, while top experts are warning people not to consume the omega-3 rich seafood. The boycott came after the chairman of a major fruit and vegetable market called Xinfadi, the site of nearly 100 newly-detected infections, said that the virus was traced to the chopping board used by a seller of imported salmon.
Zeng Guang, a senior expert with the National Health Commission, said in an interview with state media on Sunday that “we have yet to find out whether human beings transmitted the virus to salmon, or salmon contracted the virus first.” He warned Beijing residents not to eat raw salmon or purchase imported seafood for the time being.
Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of China’s Center for Diseases Prevention and Control said on Sunday that the virus can survive on the surface of frozen food for up to three months and that the agency “highly suspects” contaminated goods as the source of the latest outbreak.
While it is unclear if the virus can be actually be transmitted through frozen food that’s later thawed, the swift shunning of salmon reflects China’s growing fears over the abrupt resurgence of cases in its capital city -- the cultural and political center of the country where 20 million people reside. About 20 housing compounds have been placed under lockdown and some schools closed while local officials race to track down people who’ve visited or had contact with the Xinfadi market.
Beijing Outbreak Grows to Nearly 100 Cases in Test for China
The salmon boycott is another blow to exporters of the seafood to China, after the coronavirus pandemic caused sales in the first four months of the year to plunge over 30%. Prior to the crisis, the four biggest exporters according to China customs data -- Chile, Norway, Australia and Denmark’s Faroe Islands -- had seen demand steadily grow to $686 million last year due to rising middle-class incomes and a shift to healthier diets.
The situation drove stocks of pork producers up on Monday, with Jiangxi Zhengbang Technology Co. jumping as much as 8.6% and Wens Foodstuffs Group Co. climbing as much as 4.7%. The gains were likely fueled by expectations that demand for the meat will rise as consumers shun seafood, said Ken Chen, an analyst with KGI Securities Co. in Shanghai.
In a study published in April, researchers with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations concluded that the coronavirus is not known to infect aquatic food animals or contaminate their products.
The risk “should be negligible” with “proper food handling and sanitation,” although their surfaces might potentially become contaminated when handled by people who carry the virus, scientists including Melba G. Bondad-Reantaso wrote.

519,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",Hong Kong Expats on Edge After the Toughest Year in Decades,"(Bloomberg) -- One of the toughest years in decades for Hong Kong is leading many expats to wrestle anew with the question: Do I stay or do I go?
The choice for Hong Kong’s foreign resident community, especially the 90,000 or so people who come from major economies outside Asia, is stark. If they stay, they face renewed disruptions arising from political turmoil amid efforts by China to impose a national security law. To leave is to risk relocation at a time when the global economy is crippled by the coronavirus.
After weathering a year of U.S.-China trade tensions, anti-government protests and the worst viral outbreak since the 2003 SARS crisis on top of the national security legislation announced in May, some are leaning toward the latter. That’s according to surveys and data from local business groups and mobility firms.
While once expatriates in Hong Kong typically worked in finance or law for Western companies and had generous relocation packages, the group is now more diverse so determining a consensus is difficult.
Robert Chipman, chief executive for Hong Kong with the global relocation service Asian Tigers Group, said he saw a spike in interest early this year as people made decisions to leave after eight months of political unrest and the onset of the coronavirus outbreak.
Chipman is concerned that further protests may not only push more foreigners to the exits, but also persuade some who are weighing a move to Hong Kong to avoid the city -- putting its future as an expat enclave at risk.
“If people feel Hong Kong is not a safe place, and there’s civil unrest, even the whisper about that will keep people out,” Chipman said. “On the civil unrest, I don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel there. There’s deep-seated emotions.”
American Worries
The estimated 25,000 Americans in the city face added pressure and uncertainty as a result of the U.S. declaration that Hong Kong is no longer largely autonomous from China, which could potentially strip the city of its special trading status.
A survey conducted June 1 and June 2 by the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong found 38% of about 180 members who participated were personally considering leaving in light of the new national security law. And about 30% said the law is causing their companies to look at moving assets including capital and business operations to other locations.
Joel, a former trader who until recently was based in Hong Kong and who declined to provide his full name, began making plans to leave the city in November after a taxi in which his wife and children were riding was flanked by protesters and police nearby were firing tear gas. The experience shook the family and he hunted for an alternative, settling on Singapore.
“In a calm world, it’s good to be in an exciting place like Hong Kong,” he said. “In a turbulent world, you want to be in a stable place like Singapore.”
Other issues such as the high cost of living in Hong Kong are also a factor. Hong Kong retained its crown as the most expensive city in the world for expats, according to the latest survey from global consultancy Mercer. Rival Singapore fell two spots to fifth.
Despite the growing pessimism there are valid reasons for expats to stay, especially with virus-related travel restrictions making a move difficult -- if not impossible -- right now.
“Am I concerned? I am concerned,” said Martha Collard, a Canadian who has lived in Hong Kong for about 40 years. She runs Red Doors Studio, leading meditation and wellness classes that include using gongs. “But I also feel I have to put things into perspective as well.”
Hong Kong has been successful in containing the coronavirus, with only four deaths and just over 1,100 confirmed cases. Until protests started again in May, it was seen as a safe haven of sorts in 2020. Investors haven’t headed for the exits, as the territory’s dollar-pegged currency continues to see inflows.
Wait and See
Simon Kavanagh, a managing director at investment banking firm BDA Partners, said he has no plans to leave Hong Kong as the national security law won’t affect his day-to-day life. He thinks the changes, however, will curtail future investment in the city.
“For entrepreneurs or executives looking to Asia, Shanghai and Singapore have a lot to offer,” he said. “Hong Kong continues to fall behind in terms of innovation and investment, making it harder to attract capital and talent.”
There is also the question of where to go if expats choose to move, especially for Americans -- with the U.S. grappling with widespread protests of its own as well as virus infections that have topped 2 million cases.
“It’s still an attractive place to live and work, so I don’t think expats are pulling the trigger immediately,” said Renee Conklin, founder of RC HR Consulting. “But I do think that what this has done is lead people to have more serious conversations about what their future looks like in Hong Kong.”

Alex Saab, a Colombian national who Maduro's government said was on a mission to secure food and medicine, was arrested on the island of Sal on Saturday as a plane taking him and others to Iran stopped to refuel. 
Cape Verde prosecutor José Landim told CV National Radio before the court hearing that a country asking for an extradition had 18 days to make the formal request but that the period could be extended to 40 days. 
State television in Cape Verde showed Saab, in handcuffs, being escorted into a building by two policemen.
A police source in Cape Verde said Saab was the only person detained when the private jet stopped to refuel on Sal, one of the most popular tourist destinations on the archipelago, some 670 km (420 miles) off the West African coastline.
The plane had come from Venezuela and continued to Iran without Saab, the police source said.
U.S. and Cape Verdean authorities said Saab was detained after an Interpol red notice had been issued for him. The United States has charged him with money laundering and imposed sanctions on him.
Venezuela, which has called the arrest an ""arbitrary detention"", said Saab was travelling as an ""agent"" of the state on a work trip to secure supplies to help the country tackle COVID-19.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>",Saudi-led coalition cut from U.N. blacklist of warring parties killing children,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday removed a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition from a United Nations blacklist, several years after it was first named and shamed for killing and injuring children in Yemen. 
The coalition killed or injured 222 children in Yemen last year, Guterres wrote in his annual report to the U.N. Security Council. He said the Houthis were responsible for 313 such casualties and the Yemen government forces 96 casualties and both remain on the annual children and armed conflict blacklist. 
Guterres said the coalition would ""be delisted for the violation of killing and maiming, following a sustained significant decrease in killing and maiming due to air strikes"" and the implementation of measures aimed at protecting children.
But he added that the coalition would be subjected to one year of monitoring and ""any failure"" to further decrease child casualties would result in it being listed again next year.
The Saudi mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report. 
""The Secretary-General is adding a new level of shame to his 'list of shame' by removing the Saudi-led coalition and ignoring the U.N.'s own evidence of continued grave violations against children,"" said Jo Becker, children's rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted the government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. The Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government. 
The Saudi-led military coalition has officially been on the blacklist for the past three years. 
It had been briefly added to the blacklist in 2016 and then removed by former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon pending review. At the time, Ban accused Saudi Arabia of exerting ""unacceptable"" undue pressure after sources told Reuters that Riyadh threatened to cut some U.N. funding. Saudi Arabia denied threatening Ban. 
When asked if the U.N. had come under any pressure to remove the Saudi-led coalition from the list this year, the U.N. envoy for children and armed conflict, Virginia Gamba, told reporters: ""I can answer that very, very clearly - absolutely not."" 
The U.N. report does not subject those listed to action but rather shames parties to conflicts in the hope of pushing them to implement measures to protect children. It has long been controversial with diplomats saying Saudi Arabia and Israel both exerted pressure in recent years in a bid to stay off the list.

Countries or groups can be blacklisted for killing, injuring or abusing children, abducting or recruiting children, denying aid access for children or targeting schools and hospitals.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to take up a series of cases seeking to expand gun rights, showing that even with its conservative majority it remains hesitant about wading into the contentious issue.
The court rejected 10 different appeals that had piled up in recent months challenging whether various firearms restrictions violated the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment right to bear arms.
Two conservative justices, Clarence Thomas and Brett Kavanaugh, said they would have heard one of the cases, a dispute from New Jersey over that state's concealed-carry gun permits. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority.
The justices left in place a lower court ruling that threw out a lawsuit challenging New Jersey's law mandating that people who want to carry handguns in public must show they have a special reason before they can obtain a permit. The court also turned down similar cases from Massachusetts and Maryland.
The court also declined to take up appeals challenging assault weapon bans in Massachusetts and Cook County, Illinois, a jurisdiction that includes Chicago. 
The Massachusetts ban, enacted in 1998, was modeled after a federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2004 and was not renewed, largely because of Republican opposition in Congress. Cook County enacted its ban in 2006. Both measures barred specific firearms including AK-47s and AR-15s.
The influential National Rifle Association and others have been seeking to expand gun rights by challenging the legality of firearms restrictions passed at the state and local level.
The Supreme Court on April 27 dismissed an NRA-backed challenge to now-repealed New York City restrictions on handgun owners transporting their firearms outside the home, sidestepping a major ruling over the scope of Second Amendment protections.

The court's last major gun-rights ruling came a decade ago.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - Gunmen killed 24 Malian soldiers in an ambush on their convoy in central Mali on Sunday, a spokesman for the west African nation's army said.
Eight survivors of the attack were found, Colonel Diarran Kone told Reuters, adding that four vehicles were destroyed.
The attack is the deadliest since November 2019 when 53 soldiers were killed during an assault on an army post in northern Mali.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, which took place in an area around 100 km (60 miles) south of the border with Mauritania.
But al Qaeda-linked Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) in known to operate around the area.
Jihadist groups with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda have carried out frequent attacks on the army and United Nations peacekeeping forces in Mali in recent weeks.
Two U.N. peacekeepers were killed on Saturday in a separate attack on a logistics convoy further north.
Mali has been in crisis since 2012 when al Qaeda-linked militants hijacked an insurrection by Tuareg separatists and seized the desert north.
Forces from the West African country's former colonial ruler France intervened the following year to drive them back. But the militants have regrouped and extended their operations into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.
Despite the presence of around 13,000 U.N. peacekeeping force some 5,100 French soldiers, the militants have expanded their attacks, hitting coastal nations such as Benin and Ivory Coast.
On Friday, France launched a coalition of West African and European allies to fight the militants in the Sahel, hoping more political cooperation and special forces would boost the military effort that has so far failed to stifle violence.

KABUL (Reuters) - Doctors Without Borders said on Monday it would close its maternity ward in Kabul due to fears of further attacks after three gunmen last month opened fire at the clinic, killing 24 people including new mothers and babies.
No group has claimed responsibility for the May 12 attack on the clinic run by the international health agency, which is also known by its French name Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF). 
The attack prompted worldwide outrage. The United States blamed Islamic State's regional affiliate, while the Afghan government blamed the Taliban, which denied involvement. 
Thierry Allafort-Duverger, MSF's director general, said that even in war-torn Afghanistan, his group never thought newborns and women giving birth could be targeted. 
""But it did happen. Today, we have to accept reality: higher walls and thicker security doors won't prevent such horrific assaults from happening again. To remain would mean to factor such loss of human lives as a parameter of our activity, and this is unconceivable,"" he said in a statement.
The maternity ward, where 16,000 deliveries took place in 2019, provided free specialist care for complicated pregnancies in a country where many live below the poverty line and neonatal deaths are high.
Akmal Samsor, spokesman for Afghanistan's health ministry, said the loss of the maternity ward was a blow and it hoped MSF would reconsider its decision.
Shabika, a midwife who has worked at the hospital for eight years and who asked to be known only by her first name, said the attack, on top of health fears due to the coronavirus, had left many expectant mothers anxious and she was now busy fielding calls from pregnant women about managing births at home. 
""Now the hospital is going to be closed forever, we may be losing mothers and patients,"" she told Reuters. ""The morale of pregnant mothers is very low and there are many negative effects.""

Venezuela's Supreme Court, which is dominated by Maduro loyalists, named the council last week. Opposition leader Juan Guaido called the electoral body ""false"" and said the opposition would not recognize it.
Venezuela's constitution grants the power to appoint electoral council members to the National Assembly, which Guaido leads, but the Supreme Court ruled that the legislature had failed to do so.
The United States and most other Western countries recognize Guaido as Venezuela's rightful leader, though Maduro still controls the state.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a statement, said Maduro was manipulating Venezuela's constitution and the new council would fail to implement the conditions required to hold free and fair elections.
""Without following this process, elections that represent the will of the people are impossible,"" Pompeo said. ""This step by the regime and its Supreme Court takes Venezuela even further away from a democratic transition.""
Guaido's allies have pledged to extend the term of the current legislature. An extension past the scheduled January 2021 end date would allow Guaido to remain in his role even if the opposition boycotts the parliamentary elections later this year.
In a statement late on Sunday, Guaido's opposition coalition said the conditions did not exist for elections to take place guaranteeing transparency, trust and public freedoms, including a ""trustworthy"" election council.
Maduro, a socialist, said on Saturday the new electoral board was necessary to elect a new National Assembly after what he described as ""five totally lost years"" under the opposition.

The new council held its first session on Monday, state television showed, though it did not give any details on the upcoming electoral process.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday handed President Donald Trump a defeat in his legal showdown with the most-populous U.S. state, declining to hear his administration's challenge to ""sanctuary"" laws in California that protect immigrants from deportation.
The justices left in place a lower court ruling that upheld the bulk of three laws in the Democratic-governed state that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement authorities. The Trump administration had appealed that ruling to the high court.
Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has made his hardline immigration policies a focus of his presidency, including a crackdown on legal and illegal immigration.
His administration sued California in 2018 in federal court, accusing the state of unlawfully obstructing enforcement of federal immigration law and saying the measures violate the U.S. Constitution's provision that federal laws take precedence over state laws.
The California ""sanctuary"" laws in question prohibit private employers in the state from voluntarily cooperating with federal immigration officials and bar local law enforcement authorities from sharing information with federal officials about the release of potentially deportable immigrants from custody. 
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, has argued that the laws protect privacy in the workplace and prevent the state from being coerced into enforcing federal immigration law
The Republican president has called California's sanctuary laws ""deadly and unconstitutional"" and said the state ""provides safe harbor to some of the most vicious and violent offenders on Earth."" 
While his administration has said such laws can impede the ability of U.S. agents to take immigrants charged or convicted of crimes into custody, advocates have said cooperation can unfairly ensnare immigrants in deportation proceedings.    
The lawsuit is part of Trump's feud with California, where he won only 32 percent of the votes in the 2016 election.
Trump has criticized California and other Democratic-led states and cities for their approach not only to immigration enforcement but to crime, homelessness and environmental regulation. 

The U.S. Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's opposition demanded answers on Monday over a government deal for medical ventilators to help combat the coronavirus, saying the contract was worth 250 million zlotys ($63.7 million) but the equipment had not arrived. 
Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski's handling of the pandemic had made him Poland's most trusted politician in April, but accusations over procurement have dented that. 
Szumowski, a member of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, has denied any wrongdoing and earlier this month survived a no-confidence vote in parliament over alleged irregularities in buying masks.
Last week, state-run news agency PAP quoted Szumowski as saying accusations over the ventilators were ""false"", with the first batch having arrived and the next due later in June. 
The controversies are swirling two weeks ahead of a presidential election, where PiS ally Andrzej Duda remains favourite though the race is becoming increasingly tight. 
Michal Szczerba, a lawmaker from the main opposition party Civic Platform (PO), and fellow opposition legislator Dariusz Jonski allege the Health Ministry signed an irresponsibly vague contract with a company in the city of Lublin, allowing the transfer of 250 million zlotys without specifying what goods were concerned.
""We are dealing with huge mismanagement,"" Szczerba said, after visits with Jonski to inspect documents at a government procurement agency and the Health Ministry.
Deputy Health Minister Janusz Cieszynski accused the opposition lawmakers of playing politics with the pandemic. 
""The accusation that it was not known what the contract was for is completely false ... the order from this contract specifies what it is for, the assortment of products, when and for what price it has to be delivered,"" he said.
Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza has identified the company as E&K and quoted an unnamed representative as saying via email that it had offered the lowest price and shortest delivery time. 
Reuters was unable to locate a working phone number or email address for E&K. 
Jonski and Szczerba said that Health Ministry had made prepayments of 100% or 65% for 1,241 ventilators, but none of them were yet in the ministry's possession.

France asks no questions about ethnicity, national origin or religion on its census, part of a national ideology dating back to the 18th century French Revolution that the state must avoid such distinctions to treat citizens equally.
But with French people taking to the streets in recent days in solidarity with anti-racism protests in the United States, spokeswoman Sibeth Ndiaye wrote in a newspaper that the policy made it more difficult to tackle racism in France.
""Because we can't measure and look at the reality as it is, we're letting speculation go wild,"" she wrote in Le Monde. ""Why not start the debate about ethnic statistics, in a peaceful and constructive way?""
Senegal-born Ndiaye is one of Macron's most prominent political allies, having served as his spokeswoman for years before he became president. Nevertheless, an official in the president's office swiftly shot down her remarks.
""This is not a debate that the president wishes to open at this stage,"" the official said.
France has large populations with origins in northern and sub-Saharan Africa, and the biggest Muslim minority in Europe. Many Muslim and black French citizens live in poor suburbs of big cities and complain of discrimination.
Macron is keen to keep racial issues in check and to focus on plans to rebuild the French economy after the coronavirus crisis. 

On Sunday, he promised to be unflinching against all discrimination, but expressed support for French police and said fighting racism should not lead to a ""hateful"" re-writing of the history of France.

    Poland was home to one of the world's biggest Jewish communities until it was almost entirely wiped out during World War Two by the Nazis who set up death camps such as Auschwitz on Polish territory.
    Jewish former property owners and their descendants have been campaigning for compensation since the fall of communism in 1989. But the nationalist ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says Poland itself was also a victim of Nazi Germany and that it is for Berlin to compensate former Polish Jews.
    The prime time news show on state-owned TVP suggested on Sunday that Trzaskowski, presidential candidate of the centrist Civic Platform (PO), would use public money to compensate Jews for their losses and fail to defend national interests if he beat the incumbent, Andrzej Duda, in the June 28 vote.
President Duda is close to PiS.
TVP quoted a 2015 interview with Trzaskowski saying Poland ""needs to talk with Jewish communities and try to solve this problem (of property restitution)"". It also suggested Trzaskowski's ""thinking is not based on Polish interests"".
Previously, the show has said Trzaskowski has close ties to George Soros, the billionaire financier who supports liberal causes in eastern Europe.
    ""(Trzaskowski) is a man (...) who represents foreign interests in our country,"" PiS MP Arkadiusz Mularczyk told Reuters, adding that the PO candidate took ""his mandate"" from Berlin or Brussels and would not stand up for Polish interests. 
A spokesman for PO said it was difficult to comment on such ""absurdities"".
""Public television in Poland is more similar to public television in Russia or Belarus than to public television in a democratic country,"" said Jan Grabiec.

Trzaskowski has said he will reform TVP if he wins the presidency.

A statement from the Vatican press office said Torzi, who was arrested in the Vatican on June 5, was granted provisional liberty after he cooperated with prosecutors. He was the first person arrested in the case, which came to light nine months ago.[nL8N2DI5GD]
The statement said Torzi had given investigators a long, detailed reconstruction of his version of events as well as many documents.
Vatican investigators have accused Torzi of extortion, embezzlement, aggravated fraud and money laundering. They will now have to decide whether they have sufficient evidence to ask a judge to order a trial.
Torzi was the Vatican's fiduciary for the deal, in which the Vatican's Secretariat of State purchased a building in London's posh Chelsea district several years ago for $200 million.
The investigation into alleged irregularities led to the suspension last year of five Vatican employees, the resignation of the Vatican's police chief and the departure of the former head of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF).

But Duterte reinstated strict lockdown rules in Cebu City, the country's fifth most populous city, following an increase in new infections there. 
""The battle against COVID-19 is not yet over,"" Duterte said in an address late on Monday. 
Restrictions were further eased in provinces and cities with low cases of the virus to help restore business activity in the Southeast Asian economy, which is expected to shrink for the first time in more than two decades this year.
The lockdown in the capital, Manila, which was one of the world's longest and strictest, was relaxed on June 1 to reduce the economic damage of the pandemic.
The relaxed rules, which allowed the reopening of more industries, some public transportation and movement in and out of Manila, were set to expire on June 15.
Schools, universities and tourist destinations, however, will stay closed, while stay-at-home orders will remain for the elderly and children, 
""We are gradually easing restrictions to make way for our economic viability as individuals and as a nation, but it does not mean we will forget our minimum health standards,"" Duterte said.
On Monday, restaurants in the capital were allowed to reopen dine-in services but on a limited scale, to allow more workers to go back to work. 
The country's unemployment rate surged to a record 17.7% in April as millions lost their jobs due to the lockdown.

While the capital accounts for half of the country's 26,420 confirmed coronavirus cases, authorities have recorded a spike in the number of infections in Cebu City after curbs were gradually eased there.

The rally in the eastern city of Lublin was attended by around 3,500 supporters of incumbent President Andrzej Duda, who is running for re-election on June 28.
LGBT rights have been major campaign theme in staunchly Catholic Poland since the main opposition candidate and Warsaw mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, introduced a sex education programme in the city's schools over a year ago that includes teaching about LGBT issues.
""We gathered in large numbers to show him (Duda) that we are not an ideology, as these are the words that we hear very often from PiS politicians in recent days,"" LGBT activist Bartosz Staszewski said of the protest.
Duda is an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS), which dismisses the promotion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights as a foreign influence undermining Poland's traditional values.
Last week, Duda vowed to ban teaching about LGBT issues in Poland's schools to avoid propagating LGBT ""ideology.""
Protesters carried signs saying ""We are people and not ideology"", ""I am a human"" and ""Duda, spare us shame"", footage from private broadcaster TVN showed.
Staszewski told Reuters that after the rally he spoke to Duda and asked to be invited to the presidential palace to talk about LGBT issues.
A presidential spokesman confirmed the conversation and said that the office was in touch with Staszewski to discuss a date for the meeting.
In his speech on Monday, Duda said that his recent comments on LGBT issues had opened him up to attack domestically and internationally.
On Sunday, Duda tweeted that his words comparing ""LGBT ideology"" to communist doctrine had been taken out of context by international media.

""I truly believe in diversity and equality,"" he wrote in English. He did not say how his remarks had been misrepresented.

The South Asian country lifted its countrywide lockdown on May 9, citing economic stress, and has since seen infection rates rise from 1-in-10 tests to more than 1-in-5.
""A total of 20 cities across Pakistan have been identified as having likely increase in ratio/speed of infection which needs restrictive measures for containment,"" a statement by the body that coordinates the national response to the virus said on Monday. 
Pakistan has reported 144,477 cases of the respiratory illness and 2,729 deaths so far.
However, the rate of daily cases has been rising fast in the country of 207 million, a point noted by the World Health Organisation in a letter to Pakistani authorities last week.
Prime Minister Imran Khan ruled out a nationwide lockdown on Saturday.
One of the cities that will see fresh restrictions is the densely populated eastern metropolis of Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's largest province Punjab.
A senior official told Reuters a number of areas of Lahore would be sealed for two weeks, with entry or exit barred, and government-issued safety guidelines would be enforced in markets using paramilitary forces.
Parts of Pakistan's capital Islamabad, as well as Peshawar, will see similar measures, provincial and national officials said, with more cities expected to follow suit.

On Sunday, Planning Minister Asad Umar said cases could double by the end of June to 300,000, and reach 1 million to 1.2 million by the end of July if current trends continued.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh/BANGKOK (Reuters) - People traffickers holding hundreds of Rohingya refugees at sea are demanding payments from their families before they will release them from boats off the shores of Southeast Asia, relatives and rights groups say.
Several hundred Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority from Myanmar fleeing persecution at home and refugee camps in Bangladesh, have been stranded for months after countries sealed their borders to block the spread of the coronavirus.
Three people who said their relatives were at sea told Reuters that traffickers had demanded money to release them from boats that have been off Southeast Asia since February, trying to find a place to land.
""Before, the deal was that if they were able to reach the Malaysian shore then they will take the money, but they're asking for it now,"" said Mohammed Ayas, who said his 16-year-old brother left a refugee camp in Bangladesh in February. 
Since then, the family has heard nothing from him, Ayas said.
Musha, whose two sisters are also at sea after leaving camps in Bangladesh in February, said brokers acting for the traffickers asked the family to pay 12,000 ringitt ($2,800) by a mobile banking service for their transfer to Malaysia. 
He said the family paid the sum but did not know the fate of the two teenaged girls.
For years, Rohingya have boarded boats between November and April, when the seas are calm, to get to Southeast Asian countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. But coronavirus lockdowns have left boats stranded at sea.
Dozens of people died aboard a boat that had to return to Bangladesh in April after running out of food and water, survivors told Reuters.
Authorities in Malaysia detained 269 Rohingya who came ashore from a damaged boat last week. Human Rights Watch said about 70% of them were too weak to walk.
""OFFSHORE CAMP""
At least one vessel remains at sea, according to rights groups, with as many as 300 people on board, some of whom are believed to be sick. Its location is not known.
""This boat has been turned into an offshore traffickers' camp,"" said Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, a group focusing on the Rohingya crisis. She described the people at sea as hostages and said the latest demands were for 5,000 Malaysian ringgit ($1,170) per passenger to get to Malaysia.
An official with the Thai marine police said the vessel was not in Thai waters but had sought provisions from fishing boats. A second Thai police official, who also asked not to be named, said three boats carrying hundreds of Rohingya were close to Koh Adang, a Thai island, but on the Malaysian side of the border.
Malaysian officials, including the country's maritime enforcement agency, did not respond to requests for comment. The agency said it turned away a boat carrying about 300 Rohingya last week, media reported.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled from Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017 following a military crackdown the United Nations has said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"". Myanmar denies genocide, saying it was responding to attacks on security posts by Rohingya militants. 
Nearly a million Rohingya now live in camps in southeast Bangladesh. 

During a crackdown on trafficking networks that led to a similar crisis in 2015, gangs cast passengers adrift with meagre food and water. Many died at sea.

The Investigative Committee, which handles probes into major crimes, accused Navalny of slandering a Russian World War Two veteran who featured in a video clip with other prominent Russians to express support for constitutional reforms set to be put to a national vote on July 1.
The reforms, among other things, would allow Vladimir Putin to run for another two terms in the Kremlin and potentially serve until 2036 instead of stepping down in 2024. Critics say the reforms amount to a constitutional coup.
In a social media post on June 2, Navalny, 44, an outspoken opponent of Putin, described the people in the video backing the reforms as traitors with no conscience and corrupt lackeys.
The Investigative Committee's statement said Navalny had circulated libellous remarks to a large number of people, for which potential penalties range from a fine of 1 million roubles ($14,255) to 240 hours of community service.
It said the investigation was still under way.
Navalny's spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Navalny has regularly accused the authorities of using criminal investigations against him and his allies to stifle his activities, something they deny
He was barred from running for president in 2018 because of a conviction on embezzlement charges, which he said had been trumped up. Putin won that election in a landslide.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>",What do new U.S. sanctions mean for Syria?,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - The toughest U.S. sanctions yet on Syria take effect this week, increasing the pressure on President Bashar al-Assad as he grapples with a deepening economic crisis after a decade of war.
Washington says sanctions will help hold Assad and his backers to account for war crimes in a conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Damascus says it is an escalation of economic warfare against its citizens. 
U.S. congressional aides said they expect an announcement as soon as Wednesday. 
WHAT IS CHANGING?
Syria has already been under U.S. and EU sanctions that have frozen the assets of the state and hundreds of companies and individuals. Washington already bans export and investment in Syria by Americans, and transactions involving oil and hydrocarbon products.
The new sanctions give U.S. President Donald Trump wider powers to freeze the assets of anyone dealing with Syria, regardless of nationality, and cover many more sectors from construction to energy.
The law also targets for the first time those dealing with Russian and Iranian entities in Syria, hitting allies of Assad.
The new legislation could label Syria’s central bank as a ""primary laundering concern"". 
Sanctions can be lifted if six demands are met, including ending the bombing of civilians, releasing tens of thousands of detainees and allowing ""the safe and dignified"" return of refugees.
WHAT WILL THE ECONOMIC IMPACT BE?
The sanctions are expected to further deter investment in Syria and deepen Syria's isolation from the global financial system. Syria experts say they end hope Damascus and Moscow once entertained of a global reconstruction effort before a political transition that satisfies the West. 
Lebanon, a traditional conduit of goods and finance for Syria, will be hard hit as businesses with links to Damascus will have to navigate the new risks, bankers say. Other business partners in neighbouring Jordan and in the UAE are already on edge, abandoning plans to invest in Syria, businessmen say.
A recent collapse of the Syrian currency is due partly to the prospect of the new sanctions being applied. Wealthy Syrian expatriates will be discouraged from investing back home.
As economic conditions worsen further, there is also the possibility of a new wave of unrest: rare demonstrations have recently broken out in Sweida, a government-controlled area that did not rise up against Assad in 2011. 
WILL ORDINARY SYRIANS BE HURT?
The new law exempts imports of essential food and humanitarian items but adds more scrutiny to U.N. and NGO aid to ensure they are not benefiting Assad's government.

Some Western non-governmental organisations, while saying Assad's government deserves to be punished, are wary of any impact on civilians.

Several other soldiers and around half of the dozen or so vehicles in the convoy were still missing after the assault near Diabaly, the residents added, asking not to be named.
An army spokesman confirmed an attack had taken place and saud several soldiers were missing, but gave no other details. ""An the assessment is still in progress,"" Colonel Diarran Kone said on Monday.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack which took place in an area around 100 km (60 miles) south of the border with Mauritania. 
But jihadist groups with links to Islamic State and al Qaeda have carried out frequent attacks on the army and United Nations peacekeeping forces in Mali in recent weeks.
Two U.N. peacekeepers were killed on Saturday in a separate attack on logistics convoy further north.
Mali has been in crisis since 2012 when al Qaeda-linked militants hijacked an insurrection by Tuareg separatists and seized the desert north.
Forces from the West African country's former colonial ruler France intervened the following year to drive them back. But the militants have regrouped and extended their operations into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.

The banner was hung on the front of the mission building on Saturday as the embassy tweeted a message in support of the anti-racism campaign across the United States and worldwide in response to the killing last month of George Floyd, an African American, in Minneapolis police custody.
Trump, who has responded to street protests by declaring himself a “law and order” president and urging U.S. local authorities to crack down, was unhappy about the banner when he learned about it, the two sources said on condition of anonymity.
The White House and State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The banner was seen as a rare show of open support for the Black Lives Matter movement by a Trump appointee. U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris had ordered that it be draped on the embassy.
After the banner was taken down, embassy spokesman William Coleman reiterated that Harris’s reason for putting it up was “to communicate a message of solidarity with Americans concerned with racism.” But he added: “The Ambassador’s intent was not to support or encourage donations to any specific organization.“
“To avoid the misperception that American taxpayer dollars were spent to benefit such organizations, he directed that the banner be removed,” Coleman said, adding ""this in no way lessens the principles and ideals expressed by raising the banner.”
Bloomberg News reported earlier that both Trump and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were displeased about the banner. 

Harris, a 40-year Navy veteran who started in Seoul in 2018, has privately said he is planning to exit his position before the end of the year.

The comments came after Turkey, which backs the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, cemented a foothold in the country helping repel an assault on Tripoli by the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, who is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
Paris has been accused of supporting Haftar politically, having previously provided him with military assistance to fight Islamist militants. France denies backing Haftar, but has repeatedly pointed the finger at Turkey, while stopping short of castigating Haftar's allies.
Speaking to Reuters on Monday, a French presidential official accused NATO ally Turkey of violating a U.N. arms embargo and raising its naval presence off the coast of Libya.
""These interferences are becoming very problematic and despite our efforts, the situation is getting bogged down. This increasingly aggressive posture is not acceptable,"" the official said.
""Turkey is supposed to be a NATO partner so this cannot continue."" 
When asked what Paris had in mind, the official said there would be talks in the coming days with Turkey and other NATO partners to discuss the situation. 
NATO defence ministers hold talks later this week.
Ties between Turkey and France are already strained on a number of issues ranging from Syria to oil exploration in the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan earlier this month said France's support for Haftar had ""really upset"" him.

PARIS (Reuters) - Paris restaurants reopened indoor dining halls on Monday as the government relaxed one of the last major coronavirus constraints, but with virtually no tourists and many French people still working from home, the mood was cautious.
President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday that restaurants and cafes in Paris could open fully from Monday, the same day France lifted border restrictions for European Union travellers, bringing much needed relief for the hospitality industry.
Restaurants outside the Paris region were allowed to open again from June 2, but in the city, where the virus struck hardest, venues could only serve customers on outdoor terraces.
At Le Mesturet, a bistrot between the Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) Garnier and the Louvre museum, owner Alain Fontaine said it was a relief to reopen, but he warned that without tourists and with many people still teleworking, restaurants should not operate at full capacity in order to avoid the risk of bankruptcies. 
""I am sure that by end of summer everybody will have reopened, but it may take six months to a year before business fully recovers to like it was before,"" he said. 
Customers were happy to visit old haunts again. 
""With indoor dining possible, I feel like eating out again. A terrace is not the same thing,"" said businessman Nicolas.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The top U.N. human rights body agreed on Monday to hold an urgent debate on allegations of ""systemic racism, police brutality and violence against peaceful protests"" in the United States and elsewhere on Wednesday.
The U.N. Human Rights Council's decision followed a request last week by Burkina Faso on behalf of African countries in response to the killing of George Floyd, an African American, on May 25 under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer. His death has ignited protests across the nation and worldwide.
""We think it is a moment to really discuss this issue, as you have seen with the demonstrations all over Europe, including here in Geneva,"" said Elisabeth Tichy-Fisslberger, Austria's ambassador who serves as current president of the Council. 
""This is a topic which is not just about one country, it goes well beyond that,"" she told a news conference.
African countries may prepare a resolution for consideration at the debate, Tichy-Fisslberger added.
The United States is not a member of the 47-member state forum in Geneva, having quit it two years ago alleging bias against its ally Israel.
The U.S. mission in Geneva had no immediate comment on the Council's decision, but last week issued a statement decrying the ""senseless death of George Floyd"" and saying that justice and transparency were ""core values"" of the United States.
The African group's request, in a letter made public by the United Nations, said: ""The death of George Floyd is unfortunately not an isolated incident. The numbers of previous cases of unarmed people of African descent who met the same fate because of uncontrolled police violence are legion"". 

The outrage provoked by the death underlines the importance of the Human Rights Council discussing these issues, the letter said, noting that 600 activist groups and victims' relatives had called last week for a special session.

MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Russian court convicted former U.S. marine Paul Whelan of spying for the United States on Monday and sentenced him to 16 years in jail, a ruling that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said outraged Washington.
Whelan, who holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports, was detained by agents from Russia’s Federal Security Service in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28, 2018 as he prepared to attend a wedding. 
Russia says Whelan, 50, was caught with a computer flash drive containing classified information. Whelan, who pleaded not guilty, said he was set up in a sting operation and had thought the drive, given to him by a Russian acquaintance, contained holiday photos.
""This is all political theatre,"" said Whelan, who watched proceedings from a glass box inside the Moscow city courtroom. 
He told the judge he had not understood the verdict as proceedings were conducted in Russian without translation.
Whelan had held up a piece of paper on which he denounced the proceedings as a ""sham trial"" and asked for U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Britain, Canada and Ireland to take ""decisive action"".
Whelan's lawyer, Vladimir Zherebenkov, said an appeal would be made against the verdict. Questioning the court's independence, Whelan's family said in a statement ""Russian judges are political not legal entities"".
Pompeo said Washington was furious and wanted Moscow to immediately free Whelan. 
""The United States is outraged by the decision of a Russian court today to convict U.S. citizen Paul Whelan after a secret trial, with secret evidence, and without appropriate allowances for defense witnesses,"" said Pompeo.
""The treatment of Paul Whelan at the hands of Russian authorities has been appalling. Russia failed to provide Mr. Whelan with a fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal; and during his detention has put his life at risk by ignoring his long-standing medical condition; and unconscionably kept him isolated from family and friends.""
John Sullivan, U.S. Ambassador to Russia, told reporters that no evidence had been produced to prove Whelan's guilt during what he called a mockery of justice. The ruling would not have ""a good impact"" on ties between Moscow and Washington - already strained by a range of issues - but that dialogue would continue, he said. 
PRISONER SWAP?
Zherebenkov said Whelan was told when he was detained that he would be part of a prisoner swap with the United States and that he believed this was what Moscow now wanted to do.
The Russian Foreign Ministry told the Russian news agency RIA it had proposed detailed prisoner swaps to Washington many times but gave no further details. 
Moscow has called for the release of two Russians jailed in the United States - arms dealer Viktor Bout, who agreed to sell weapons to U.S. undercover agents posing as Colombian guerrillas planning to attack American soldiers, and Konstantin Yaroshenko, who was convicted of conspiracy to smuggle cocaine.
Zherebenkov said he believed Moscow wanted to do a deal involving Bout and Yaroshenko. Whelan did not oppose the idea of formally asking Russia to pardon him, Zherebenkov said, but wanted to appeal against the verdict first. 
Bout's wife, Alla, told the RIA news agency on Monday she was ready to pen an appeal to U.S. authorities asking them to swap her husband for Whelan.
A New York court in 2012 sentenced Bout, subject of a book called ""Merchant of Death"" and inspiration for the film ""Lord of War"" starring Nicolas Cage, to 25 years in jail.

Whelan will serve his sentence in a maximum security prison, the court said. State prosecutors had sought an 18-year term.

ROUEN, France (Reuters) - A tear rolled down Mathilla Diagana's cheek as she sat in her student dormitory room in the northern French city of Rouen and watched an online video of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd.
""I feel anger, sadness,"" said the 19-year-old, one of tens of thousands who have joined anti-racism protests in France and beyond and turned the U.S. Black Lives Matter movement into a global rallying cry.
She lives far away from the streets of Minneapolis, but the issues raging around Floyd's death in police custody feel close to home, deeply personal.
Diagana's biological father is from Mauritania in northwest Africa. At the age of 10 months, she was put in the care of a white foster family who raised her in a village in Normandy.
As she grew older she said she was conscious of being different. She recalled being on a beach and someone insulting her foster mother for having a mixed-race child. 
She remembered boarding a bus, and a white women passenger pulling her bag in close, as though she feared Diagana was going to steal it. 
When she started working summer jobs, people made remarks about her skin colour and hair. When police checked up on a student party, she felt officers were especially aggressive towards her.
She and a friend drove to Paris to join a June 2 demonstration against police violence. It was Diagana's first protest. ""I felt people's anger and I realised I'm not alone."" 
""I'M SCARED FOR MY CHILDREN""
French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner acknowledged last week that there were cases of racism in the police and said he was determined to root them out.
""Racism has no place in our society, and even less so in our police,"" he said in a speech as he promised to ban the use of chokeholds to restrain suspects.
His assurances have done nothing to quell the French crowds. 
Carole, a 51-year-old woman who moved to France as a child from Cameroon, attended a ""Black Lives Matter"" protest in Paris on Saturday with her two sons.
""I'm scared for my children,"" she said in her home in a suburb north of Paris. Her kitchen is decorated with portraits of Nelson Mandela, Barack Obama, Martin Luther King, the Dalai Lama and Malcolm X.
She said she briefs her sons about how to behave if they are ever stopped by police. She tells them to always dress smartly, to have their identity documents with them and to be polite.
She said she did not want her family name published because she feared police reprisals.
Once, she said, one of her sons was walking in the street with some white friends. When police stopped them, only her son was questioned.

""We want for everybody to be treated in the same way, whatever the colour of their skin,"" she said.

Poland, the largest post-communist state in the European Union, has been in a long-running dispute with the bloc over judicial reforms which critics say limit the independence of the courts. 
Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party says its judicial reforms are needed to rid the system of the residue of communism.
The plaintiffs say the chambers of the Supreme Court which dealt with their cases were not sufficiently independent as they were made up of judges selected by the National Council for the Judiciary (NCJ), whose members have been appointed by the PiS majority in parliament.
One plaintiff, barrister Joanna Reczkowicz, had her appeal against suspension dismissed by the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court, the ECHR said in a statement.
Judges Monika Joanna Dolinska-Ficek and Artur Ozimek applied for posts elsewhere but the NCJ blocked their applications. They allege that the NCJ and the Supreme Court chamber which heard their appeals are not independent and impartial.
In April, the European Court of Justice, the EU's top court, told Poland to suspend its Supreme Court's Disciplinary Chamber, saying it was not independent and breached EU law.
The Supreme Court itself has been bogged down in conflict as it tries to appoint a successor to Malgorzata Gersdorf, a high-profile critic of PiS and its reforms, after her term ended in April.

Poland's Justice Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Monday.

Germany takes over the rotating presidency of the EU in the second half of this year. It has set out its policy plans for the presidency in a draft reviewed by Reuters on Monday, which supersedes an earlier draft compiled in March.
Among new elements, the 24-page document said: ""We want to develop cooperation with China and (to) work for more reciprocity in all policy areas.""
The reference to reciprocity follows complaints from German companies that they do not have the same access to markets in China as Chinese companies have in Germany.
""The China policy of all EU institutions and member states should be united and balanced and be oriented towards long-term common EU interests and values"", reads the 24-page paper.
The word ""values"" was omitted in the earlier draft, and its inclusion now could suggest a greater emphasis on issues such as democracy, human rights and autonomy for Hong Kong.
Germany said earlier this month a summit planned for September in Leipzig, Germany, between China and the EU had been postponed because of the coronavirus.

""The U.S. is our closest foreign and security policy partner outside the EU,"" the paper also said, a line that at most times would be seen as innocuous but could take on greater meaning at a time when Washington has announced plans to withdraw troops from Germany.

The bypass, called The American Road, will connect Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank that are north and south of Jerusalem. The central and southern sections of the road are already being built, and tenders for the northernmost stretch – at a projected cost of $187 million – will be issued toward the end of the year, a Jerusalem municipality official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
In total, the project, which will run along or near the outer rim of East Jerusalem, is forecast to cost more than a quarter of a billion dollars. Israel annexed East Jerusalem, in a move that has not won international recognition, after capturing the area, along with the West Bank and Gaza Strip, in a 1967 war.
The construction comes as the Israeli government is set to begin cabinet-level discussions from July 1 about implementing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's election promise to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank – a planned step that is sparking growing international criticism. Peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in 2014.
Israeli officials say the road, which will include a 1.6 kilometre (one mile) tunnel east of the Mount of Olives, will ease traffic congestion for both Israelis and Palestinians living in the area.
""It doesn't unite the settlements. It's not about uniting borders or municipal lines,"" said Arieh King, a Deputy Mayor of Jerusalem and a leading figure in the city's settler movement. ""But it does connect them more on the daily level - whether it's studies, tourism or commerce. And then in practice you create a huge Jerusalem metropolis.""
Palestinians say the new road will primarily benefit settlers, and will further undermine the feasibility of East Jerusalem as the capital of the state they seek in the West Bank and Gaza.
""This project cuts off Palestinian neighborhoods within the city from one another,"" Fadi Al-Hidmi, the Palestinian Minister of Jerusalem Affairs, said via email. Responding to questions from Reuters, Al-Hidmi said The American Road was part of Israel's ""illegal"" ring road project, which ""surrounds occupied East Jerusalem to further connect Israeli settlements and sever the occupied Palestinian capital from the rest of the West Bank.""
Israel's West Bank settlements were built by successive governments on land captured in the 1967 war. More than 400,000 Israelis now live there, with another 200,000 in East Jerusalem. Palestinians say the settlements make a future state unviable, and most of the world views them as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing its security needs and biblical and historical ties to the land on which they are built.
King said the highway would be a ""significant corridor"" from the Gush Etzion settlement bloc in the southern West Bank and settlements such as Har Homa south of the city centre, to settlements to the north and east of Jerusalem, including Maale Adumim, which is home to more than 40,000 people.
Arab residents in East Jerusalem neighbourhoods such as Umm Tuba and Sur Baher would also benefit, he said, because it would reduce their travel times.
Israel's transport ministry directed questions to the Jerusalem municipality.
Daniel Seidemann, an Israeli attorney who represented some Palestinian families affected by the construction, told Reuters the bypass fitted into a long-time strategy by Israel of using infrastructure projects to secure ""de facto annexation"" of territory.
""What we are seeing here is, again, the seamless integration of the northern West Bank, East Jerusalem under sole Israeli control, and the southern West Bank for the purposes of the settlers,"" said Seidemann, who specialises in the geopolitics of Jerusalem. ""That is the motivation, and the fact that it will benefit a Palestinian East Jerusalemite somewhat is collateral spinoff, but not more than that.""
Planning documents reviewed by Reuters and visits to the area to plot the route show the road will run for more than eight kilometres (five miles). Dozens of Palestinians living along the route of The American Road pointed to such factors as the scope of the construction and the proximity of the highway's northern and southern ends to major settlements as evidence that the bypass was designed primarily for settlers.
The scale of The American Road project, named after a decades-old narrow road that winds through southeast Jerusalem, is evident some four kilometres from the city centre, where a huge bridge is rising in a remote valley. The grey edifice, which can't be seen from outside the valley, towers over the rural landscape. At the site, cement-mixers rumble through the hill-hugging Palestinian neighbourhoods of Sur Baher and Jabal al-Mukabar toward the 230-metre-long structure.
Billboards advertise an August 2021 completion date for a section of The American Road nearest Har Homa, the settlement built by Netanyahu in the 1990s that overlooks the Palestinian town of Bethlehem.
""We lived in a paradise, and now we will live under a highway,"" said Khader Attoun, whose house looks directly over the bridge. ""Israel wants to squeeze us out of our land and confine us to our tiny homes, to let settlers drive on highways through the valley of our ancestors.""

Andrew Banks was photographed on Saturday urinating near a memorial which honours PC Keith Palmer, who was murdered while on duty at the Houses of Parliament during an attack in 2017 in which four other people were also killed.
Banks had been in Westminster with a group of far-right demonstrators and football fans who said they wanted to defend British culture, including historical monuments, but were criticised by Prime Minister Boris Johnson for their ""racist thuggery"".
Judge Emma Arbuthnot said she accepted Banks' explanation that he was so drunk he had no idea where he was urinating, that he did not intend to urinate next to the memorial and that he was remorseful.
""Your explanation for your behaviour is that you had drunk 16 pints that night and not been to bed,"" she said in sentencing remarks, adding that he had agreed to join a group of friends who wished to protect monuments in Westminster, but did not know what the monuments were. 
""The irony is that rather than protecting a monument you very nearly urinated on one of them. It was more luck than judgment as you had no idea what the memorial was.""
Arbuthnot sentenced Banks to 14 days immediate imprisonment and said he must also pay costs. 
""You have caused much shock and upset. The public have been truly outraged by what you did,"" she said at the sentencing at Westminster Magistrates Court.
""This is so serious that only a short custodial sentence is appropriate.""

Kono told reporters that Japan was halting the deployment due to technical issues as well as cost. The two proposed  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co radar sites, one in the northern prefecture of Akita and the other in Yamaguchi prefecture in southern Japan, had also faced opposition from local residents.
With radars more powerful than the ship-based version of Aegis that Japan already operates, the planned stations were meant to help counter recent missile advances by North Korea and relieve pressure on Japan's stretched navy.
""I made a decision on Friday to suspend the process... For the time being, Japan will continue to counter (the threat) with Aegis-equipped ships"" said Kono.
North Korea, which is threatening military action against South Korea unless it stops defectors from sending leaflets and other material to the North, last year tested a series of new ballistic missiles with irregular trajectories that Japan said appeared designed to penetrate Aegis defences.
The two planned Aegis Ashore systems would cost about 439 billion yen ($4.1 billion) for operation and maintenance for the next 30 years, according to defence ministry documents. 
That price tag comes as Japan faces an economy weakened by the coronavirus pandemic and unprecedented stimulus spending that is putting pressure on government finances.
According to the plans, the sites were to be initially armed with SM-3 Block IIA interceptor missiles designed to shoot down warheads in space. Japan, however, will have to pay to test those interceptors at a U.S. military test site in Hawaii before deployment, further adding to the cost of the Aegis Ashore system.

Tests for the SM-3 Block IIA missiles alone could cost at least $500 million, sources with knowledge of the programme told Reuters last year.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green parties struck a deal to form a new coalition government on Monday that if ratified by members will end a months-long stalemate and is expected to make Fianna Fail leader Micheál Martin prime minister.
Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar is expected to return as prime minister in 2022 for the second half of the government's five-year term.
""The leaders have signed off on the draft programme for government and it will issue later this afternoon,"" Fine Gael said in a statement. Varadkar earlier on Monday told journalists that the position of prime minister would rotate, but did not confirm widespread expecations that Martin would serve first. 
Ireland has been in political deadlock since an inconclusive Feb. 8 election pushed historic rivals Fine Gael and Fianna Fail together for the first time. The once dominant parties have swapped power throughout the nation's history since emerging from opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war.
The centre-right pair need the Greens to reach a majority in the fractured parliament that cannot pass new laws, including upholding a 6.5 billion euro package of support measures for coronavirus-hit businesses, until a new government is formed.
The agreement must be ratified over the coming ten days or so by grassroot members from each party, with the smaller Greens requiring two-thirds support, a higher bar than the larger parties and which could yet scupper the deal.

“It's a challenging time ahead economically as a result of COVID but the programme for government does represent a new departure,"" Martin told journalists after the talks.

Insulting the monarchy is a crime under Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
The suspected kidnapping of a Thai democracy activist in Cambodia this month ignited small protests by university students, with some questioning in online comments the ""lese majeste"" law.
""Before, we have Article 112 of the criminal code and we don't have a lot of problems, but now Article 112 has not been used because the king has kindly asked not to use it,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said.
""Now people are violating this. So what does this mean, what do you all want? I have to say this today to create peace in the country,"" he said.
The king is traditionally revered in Thai culture as the protector of the nation and the Buddhist religion. Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since 1932.
But recent months have seen an unprecedented surge of online questioning of the institution.
In March, a Thai-language hashtag that translates as #whydoweneedaking? was one of the top trending topics on Twitter in Thailand after an overseas activist commented online about King Maha Vajiralongkorn travelling in Germany during the coronavirus crisis.
King Vajiralongkorn, 67, who was crowned last year, has a second home in Germany. He spends much of his time outside Thailand.
Prayuth said the king has instructed him personally not to use Article 112 for prosecutions but people who questioned the monarchy could face difficulties in the job market.
""Those who have this kind of behavior may find it hard to find work, businesses do not want this sort of people to work for them, so how can they make a living? I am worried for them,"" Prayuth said.
Charges under the lese majeste law have been decreasing since 2018, according to the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights group.

But some rights groups say authorities use other laws, including a Computer Crime Act and a law against sedition law, more often.

With Turkish military support, Libya's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) has advanced for weeks against Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), which is backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.
Heavy clashes have emerged as the GNA has laid siege to LNA-held Sirte, close to major energy export terminals on the Mediterranean seaboard.
While Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov did not make the trip to Istanbul on Sunday for a scheduled meeting with his counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu, the Turkish official said background talks were continuing at expert level. 
""A result was supposed to come out (of the meetings), but that stage could not be reached. There are issues where the two countries are on opposing sides,"" the Turkish official said on condition of anonymity. 
""One of the main issues for the postponement of the Lavrov visit is the (GNA's) plan for an operation into Sirte. ""Once certain regions were taken as part of the...advances, Sirte emerged as a target.""
The United Nations said last week the warring sides had begun new ceasefire talks in Libya after GNA forces repelled a protracted LNA assault on the capital Tripoli.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Beirut loves to party, even when the going gets tough. Which is often. The city and its nightlife has weathered wars, bombing campaigns and assassinations, and prides itself on always bouncing back. 
But this time is different, say Beirut bar and restaurant owners, who fear that a devastating financial crisis, compounded by the global coronavirus pandemic, may finally be their undoing. 
At Le Pecheur, a 20-year-old seafood restaurant, a veteran waiter stood at the entrance, armed with a faceshield and antiseptic spray, on the first weekend after the government lifted restrictions on June 1. There were no customers.
""I have been through the civil war as a child...We saw dead people and shells exploding, but wherever you went, no one ever said they had no money or they can't afford to eat,"" said Ahmad Kassem, 49, Le Pecheur's owner.
""Now, we have people around us with empty stomachs. No work, no money.""
Since late last year, Lebanon's local currency has lost more than 60% of its value, as prices soar. The crisis has slashed jobs, fuelled unrest and pushed the government to seek aid it badly needs from the IMF. 
Hundreds of restaurants, cafes and bars have closed in a country where the service industry was long a pillar of the economy and employed a big chunk of the workforce.
Meanwhile waiters at Baron, a restaurant that can seat 200 people in a hip district of Beirut, served a lone table.
""We're living day by day, we're trying our best to plan ahead but every plan we have can change in a matter of seconds,"" said Baron's founder Etienne Sabbagh, 37. 
He said industry leaders had only received empty promises of help from the government as banks cut access to cash and credit facilities. 
Across the city in the Hamra district, home to some of Lebanon's oldest nightlife spots, Barometre was one of the few drinking holes open that weekend. The bar, open for 24 years, has lived through all that has befallen Beirut in that time, including two wars with Israel. 
A few customers relax at the bar, while some people have dinner and others sway to the music. Still, the mood is tinged with sadness.
As he pours drinks behind the bar, owner Rabih al-Zaher says he has come to terms with making less profit as a result of not hiking prices.

""You have to build a place that resembles the city, that is able to cope with its ebbs and flows...What can we do? Give up?"" he said. ""Now, shall I pour you a drink?""

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson came under pressure on Monday to deliver action on racism after he launched a commission on the issue following Black Lives Matter protests.
Johnson said a cross-government commission would examine racism and the disparities experienced by minority ethnic groups in education, health and the criminal justice system.
But he gave few details about the commission, leading to criticism that he was prevaricating rather than delivering concrete steps.
""It's the sort of morning that makes me slightly weary, because it feels like we're going round in circles,"" said David Lammy, an opposition Labour lawmaker whose own report into over-representation of black people in the criminal justice system is one of several whose findings have not yet been implemented.
""You can understand like it feels that yet again, in the UK, we want figures, data, but we don't want action.""
Johnson said he could not ignore the strength of feeling shown by tens of thousands of people who had demonstrated in British cities following the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.
""What I really want to do as prime minister is change the narrative, so we stop the sense of victimisation and discrimination,"" he said on Sunday.
""It won't be easy. We'll have to look very carefully at the real racism and discrimination that people face.""
HERITAGE
The commission was announced in a broadcast clip and accompanied with an article in the Telegraph, where Johnson also again said it was absurd that a statue of Winston Churchill should be under threat from protesters.
The statue of Churchill was boarded up ahead of a weekend of protest, although in the end police were attacked by far-right demonstrators who had assembled to protect the monument.
The protests have prompted a re-evaluation of the memorialisation of Britain's colonial and slave-trading past. Earlier this month, protesters in the southwestern port city of Bristol tore down a statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from the slave trade. 
Johnson said he was ""extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape"" by tearing down statues.
""Let’s fight racism, but leave our heritage broadly in peace,"" he wrote.
Simon Woolley, advisory chair of the UK government's Race Disparity Unit, said slavery's legacy needed to be confronted. 
""The 'Great' in Great Britain was predicated on slavery and colonialism,"" he told BBC Radio, adding that some of Johnson's language about a ""sense"" of victimhood was ""frankly unhelpful"".
Lammy echoed that sentiment.

""Black people aren't playing victim, as Boris indicates, they are protesting precisely because the time for review is over and the time for action is now,"" he said.

Diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Canberra became frayed after Australia called for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the new coronavirus, which emerged in China.
Gilespie's was sentenced a court in the southern city of Guangzhou on Wednesday, but it was only reported on Saturday. The death sentence for drug smuggling is not uncommon in China, where executions are usually carried out by firing squad.
Reading a statement in parliament, Morrison said he was sad and concerned and Australia remained irrevocably opposed to the death penalty. 
""We advocate consistently for the abolition of the death penalty worldwide by every diplomatic avenue available to us,"" Morrison said. 
""We will continue to provide Mr Gilespie with consular assistance and engage China on his case.""
Gilespie, a former actor, was arrested in 2013 with more than 7.5 kg (17 pounds) of methamphetamine in his check-in luggage while attempting to board an international flight from Baiyun Airport in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, according to media reports.
China's judicial institutions have proceeded according to Chinese law and in an independent manner, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said on Monday, denying that the case had any political overtones.
""The above case has no relation to the two countries' diplomatic ties,"" spokesman Zhao Lijian said at a daily briefing Monday. 
China has in recent weeks banned Australian beef imports and imposed tariffs on Australian barley. It has also urged Chinese students to consider avoiding Australia.
In a statement, Gilespie's family asked for privacy and called on friends and acquaintances to refrain from speculating on his case ""which we do not believe assists his case"". 
""Our family is very saddened by the situation,"" the statement said. ""We will not be making any public comment and ask that the media respects our privacy at this difficult time.""

The development followed the expulsion from the AfD last month of Andreas Kalbitz, the party's chief in the eastern state of Brandenburg, over links with right-wing extremist organisations - a decision by the AfD national executive committee still disputed by rank-and-file members.
Brandenburg Interior Minister Michael Stuebgen and Germany's domestic intelligence chief Joerg Mueller will give more details later on Monday on the decision, broadcaster RTL said, citing state government sources.
The AfD condemned the reported decision. ""(It) is just as wrong as the previous classifications of the AfD by the Office for the Protection of the Constitution,"" party Honorary Chairman Alexander Gauland said in a statement emailed to Reuters, using the official name of the BfV domestic intelligence agency.
The BfV decided in March to step up surveillance of a radical wing in the AfD, undermining its defence against accusations that it harbours racist views.
The AfD surged into second place last September in a regional election in Brandenburg, which surrounds the capital Berlin, building on its success in the 2017 national election when it came third to become the largest opposition party.
The AfD harnessed voter anger over the arrival of more than 1 million migrants and refugees in 2015 and the planned closure of coal mines in the formerly communist eastern states. But it has failed to keep up its momentum, losing popular support during the coronavirus pandemic.
A survey by pollster Forsa published on Saturday showed the AfD polling at 8% nationally, down from 11% in early March.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives have enjoyed a 14 point bounce in the same period to 40%, boosted by her handling of the coronavirus crisis.

Dozens of mask-wearing sunseekers queued at Duesseldorf airport on Monday morning to board tour operator TUI's flight to Palma de Mallorca, eager to test arrangements for socially distanced holidaymaking two weeks before Spain fully reopens.
Hotels are limited to running at 50% occupancy and will have infra-red cameras at their entrances to measure guests' body temperatures. The government is limiting to 10,900 the number of test participants. But few were deterred.
""It'll be quieter than normal,"" said one face-mask wearing holidaymaker, ready in a short-sleeved shirt. 
""But it's a good feeling that it's all starting up again. That we can travel again.""
On Sunday cleaners clad in protective face coverings wiped surfaces and laid out cutlery on buffet tables at a hotel in Palma de Mallorca, where newly installed floor markings directed guests to observe social distancing while moving around. 
European nations eased border controls on Monday as the number of coronavirus cases declined, but Spain's continued closure, a patchwork of quarantine rules and remote-working mean pre-crisis travel levels are a way off.
Spain, one of the world's most popular tourist destinations, started closing to international tourism after the epidemic triggered the declaration of a state of emergency on March 14. But the government has been under growing pressure to reopen a sector that employs one in eight Spanish workers.
In 2019, Germans made up a third of international tourists to the Balearic Islands, an archipelago off Spain's east coast that includes the iconic party island of Ibiza. But holiday life will be much more low-key than normal.
""Holidaymakers can be happy that the beaches in Palma have never been so empty,"" said Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesman for TUI.

""But there won't be parties in the same way this year. And we have rejigged the sport offerings in the hotels. There'll be more individual sports and no team activities.""

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - People in the Netherlands convicted of crimes related to alcohol abuse will have to wear a special ankle bracelet to monitor their drinking habits once the government has passed the necessary legislation.
The Dutch justice ministry has said the electronic bracelet or tag will keep track of any sign of alcohol consumption by analysing the sweat of the person wearing it.
Data from the bracelet will be sent to a central server once a day, giving probation officers a clearer picture of the wearer's behaviour than the current system which relies on blood or urine tests which are done twice a week.
""Clients are continuously aware of the fact that they have something that is measuring their alcohol consumption. That helps them to keep away from alcohol abuse,"" probation officer Tony Rubino told Reuters.
The bracelet can also help offenders to show they have changed their ways.
A mother of two boys, who took part in the government's pilot studies for the bracelet, who asked to remain anonymous, said: ""I have two young boys and had to show that I don't drink anymore.""
""The alcohol anklet was an excellent opportunity for me to show that I do not drink 24/7."" 
The justice ministry said its pilot studies showed that 71% of the participants did not drink alcohol during the test, even though some were allowed access to alcohol.
Around half of the participants said they did not drink for at least three months after the anklet was taken off.
Studies, cited by the justice ministry, have shown that 26% to 43% of all violent incidents in the Netherlands are related to alcohol, while the cost of alcohol abuse to Dutch society is estimated to run to 6 billion euros ($6.75 billion) a year.

Passengers arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union's aviation safety agency will be tested for the coronavirus and quarantined up to 14 days, depending on the test result. Restrictions remain for passengers from Britain and Turkey. Arrivals from other airports will be randomly tested. 
Restrictions on movement imposed in March helped Greece contain the spread of COVID-19 infections to just above 3,000 cases, a relatively low number compared with other EU countries. But it brought the economy to a standstill. 
The conservative government now faces the tough task of opening the country to foreign visitors while allaying public concerns about a new virus outbreak.
From the picturesque island of Santorini, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told reporters on Saturday that his priority is to make Greece the safest destination in Europe.
""You can come to Greece, you will have a fantastic experience, you can sit on a veranda with this wonderful view, have your nice Assyrtiko wine, enjoy the beach,"" Mitsotakis said, with a stunning sunset in the background. 

""But we don't want you crowded in a beach bar... There are a few things that we won't allow this summer."".

Deng Zhonghua, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office，also said while Beijing must be able to have jurisdiction over the most serious national security cases, the financial hub should be responsible for most enforcement work.
Beijing last month moved to directly impose the legislation on Hong Kong in a bid to tackle secession, subversion and foreign interference in the city. 
Speaking at a seminar in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, Deng said the law will comply with Hong Kong's legal and judicial system.
""Although there are differences in the legal systems of Hong Kong and the mainland, the principles followed by the Hong Kong and mainland criminal laws are not that great,"" Deng said.
""Both laws include principles such as presumption of innocence, the right for criminal suspects and defendants to have legal defence, and laws not being applied restrospectively. All these principles can be stipulated in this legislation."" 
Some people in the territory fear the legislation could be applied retroactively and target people for actions committed in the past that could carry a heavy sentence under the new law, details of which have not been revealed. 
Critics of the legislation fear it will stifle freedoms in the former British colony, including freedom of speech and an independent judiciary, which are seen as key to its success as a global financial hub. 
The law has reignited anti-government protests after a lull for much of this year due to coronavirus, although police have moved swiftly to stamp out recent rallies, in many cases citing a ban on groups of more than eight people to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong insist the law will focus on ""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security and have said the broader public have no reason to worry.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in urged North Korea on Monday to refrain from raising tension and return to dialogue, after threats trumpeted by state media in Pyongyang to cut ties and take military action. 
The recent flaring of tension between the neighbours stoked fear of a military provocation by the North, and posed another setback amid stalled talks to rein in its nuclear and missile programmes. 
Besides the threat to sever ties, state media over the past few days have aired the possibility of closing a joint liaison office in the North and retaliatory measures for a campaign by defectors to fly anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border. 
""The promises of peace on the Korean peninsula that Chairman Kim Jong Un made before our 80 million people cannot be turned back,"" Moon told a meeting with senior aides, referring to pacts struck at summit of the two leaders in 2018. 
""North Korea should not cut communications, raise tension and try to go back to the past era of confrontation,"" he added.
""I hope it will resolve uncomfortable, difficult problems through communications and cooperation."" 
Moon's remarks came as South Korea marked the 20th anniversary on Monday of the first summit between the two nations, which had pledged to step up dialogue and cooperation. 
At their own first summit in 2018, Moon and Kim signed a declaration to work for a ""complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and cease ""all hostile acts"".
But the North cut hotlines with its neighbour last week and vowed to suspend all contact if Seoul did not halt defectors from sending in leaflets and other material.

""I also regret that North Korea-U.S. and inter-Korean relations have not made progress as expected,"" Moon said. ""It's time for the South and North to find a breakthrough.""

The countries along Congo's eastern border have long been conduits for gold worth billions of dollars mined using rudimentary means by so-called ""artisanal"" miners.
Difficult to trace, trade in the precious metal has fueled regional wars, funded rebel fighters and led to UN sanctions on traders involved in a bid to staunch the flow.
North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces reported official production of just over 60kg of artisanal gold in 2019, yet exported a total of just over 73kg, the UN Group of Experts on the Congo found in its annual report.
The group estimated that at least 1.1 tonnes of gold were smuggled out of Ituri province alone in 2019. That would have earned the government up to $1.88 million in taxes had it been legally exported.
Across all gold-producing provinces the loss is likely much greater. Artisanal miners in Congo produce 15 to 22 tonnes of gold a year, Germany's Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources has estimated.
""The country remained one of the Great Lakes region's largest artisanal gold producers, and yet one of its smallest official exporters,"" the Group of Experts wrote.
Asked by Reuters about the report, Congo's mines minister, Willy Kitobo Samsoni, said he could not immediately share his figures on mineral smuggling from the east of the country.
The UN experts also found that Uganda and other neighbouring countries export far more gold than they produce, suggesting they might still be staging posts for smuggled Congolese gold.
More than 95% of gold exports from Uganda in 2019, which totaled just over 25 tonnes, were not of Ugandan origin, the group estimated, based on 2018 production and 2019 export data.
Uganda's gold exports more than doubled in 2019 compared with the previous year, central bank data showed in March.
Uganda's energy minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Smugglers told the Group of Experts that Kampala was a main trading hub for gold from Ituri. Smuggled gold from South Kivu went to Burundi, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates, and Tanzania, the report added.

576,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 15, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>","From crowded tubes to pedal power, London's COVID transport challenge","By Sarah Young and Paul Sandle
LONDON (Reuters) - The crowded daily commute in London has long been a source of misery for millions. But getting to work will be even more of a challenge following Britain's coronavirus lockdown.
Capacity on the transport network in one of the world's biggest financial hubs has been reduced by 85% to comply with social-distancing rules, protecting commuters by preventing them cramming into trains, the London Underground and buses.
Everyone using public transport must also now wear a face covering. 
As the lockdown restrictions are gradually eased, many now face the quandary of how to reach the City of London, Canary Wharf and other business areas both quickly and safely. 
""The COVID crisis is making us have to radically rethink the way we move around our city, how transport operates,"" said Will Norman, the London mayor's commissioner for walking and cycling.
It's a crucial issue. Even before the coronavirus outbreak, London faced increased competition for the title of Europe's most important financial centre from cities such as Paris and Frankfurt because it has quit the European Union.
""Forty years of public policy about transport has gone into reverse,"" said Tony Travers of London School of Economics. ""This is a big existential issue for cities.""
Even a small increase in the number of car journeys would lead to gridlock, Norman warned.
Before the pandemic, up to 5 million people a day packed onto the London Underground and 1 million arrived by train. 
After working successfully from home during the lockdown, some may continue doing so after all restrictions are lifted. Others will be considering alternative ways to get to work.
BIKES, BY FOOT OR BOAT? 
London authorities are adding new routes for cyclists and pedestrians, bicycle sales are soaring and boat operators are considering increasing their services on the River Thames which runs through the city.
Bike sales tripled in March and April compared to last year, said Terry Green of the Brixton Cycle co-operative in south London.
""Every time we order bikes, they just go straight out,"" he said. 
But Greater London is much larger than financial centres such as Hong Kong and New York, and is widely seen as less cycle-friendly than many other cities.
The number of cycle journeys has risen by 160% since 2000, following the introduction of cycle ""superhighway"" dedicated paths, but still accounted for only 2.5% of journeys in London before the pandemic, according to Transport for London, which is responsible for the transport system in Greater London.
""Even if cycling quintupled, which is very unlikely, or if it doubled or tripled, you're talking about making a tiny inroad in the amount of travel by railway,"" Travers said.
Distance is a problem for many -- 2015 data from the Greater London Authority put the average daily commute of people working in London at 11.2 miles (18 km).
Simon Munk, a campaigner for the charity London Cycling Campaign, called for a huge network of cycle roads reaching into outer London ""so that people feel comfortable riding from their home to work."" 
Tim Schwanen, Professor of Transport Studies and Geography at the University of Oxford, said the high cost of living in central London meant many workers with lower-paid jobs, who are less likely to cycle, live further out. 
""Good infrastructure alone is not enough to get many people to change their behaviour,"" he said.
Commuters already have the option of taking a passenger boat on the Thames, emulating King Henry VIII, whose preferred route between palaces in the 16th century was along the river.
Each year, more than 4 million people use Thames Clippers passenger boats, about 40% of them to commute. 
Sean Collins, chief executive of Thames Clippers, said the company was considering putting partitions between seats to raise capacity while adhering to social distancing. He also expects to add services to fit newly staggered working patterns. 

""It would make sense for us to provide additional services into the day parts where we would normally have ceased operating,"" Collins told Reuters.

MANILA (Reuters) - The head of a Philippine news website known for its tough scrutiny of President Rodrigo Duterte was convicted of libel on Monday and faces a lengthy jail term in what is being seen as a blow to media freedom in the country.
Maria Ressa, chief executive of Rappler (www.rappler.com) and a former CNN journalist, was charged with ""cyber libel"" over a 2012 article that linked a businessman to illegal activities.
In handing down the verdict, Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa said the exercise of a freedom ""should and must be used with due regard to the freedom of others"".
Ressa, a dual U.S.-Filipino citizen, faced up to six years in jail, the judge said.
Responding to the verdict, Ressa vowed not be silenced and accused the judiciary of becoming complicit in a campaign to stifle press freedom.
""Freedom of the press is the foundation of every single right you have as a Filipino citizen,"" she separately told reporters. ""We're at the precipice, if we fall over we're no longer a democracy.""
Reynaldo Santos, a former Rappler researcher and writer, was also found guilty in the case. Ressa and Santos were allowed to post bail pending an appeal.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said Duterte supported freedom of speech and expression and it was a previous administration that pushed for the ""cyber libel"" law.
""There was never an instance when the president filed a libel case against a journalist,"" Roque told a news conference.
The verdict comes after the telecoms regulator last month caused widespread shock by shutting down the country's leading broadcaster ABS-CBN Corp, which had regularly criticised Duterte, after its licence expired.
Duterte is also expected to sign into law soon an anti-terrorism bill, which activists fear could be used to suppress free speech and harass those challenging the government. The administration has said the bill is modelled on those used in countries that had dealt effectively with extremism.
PRESS FREEDOM INDEX
Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, who is part of a legal team representing Ressa, called the conviction ""an affront to the rule of law, a stark warning to the press, and a blow to democracy in the Philippines"". 
""I hope that the appeals court will set the record straight in this case. And that the United States will take action to protect their citizen and the values of their Constitution,"" Clooney said in a statement.
U.S. lawmakers have previously criticised what they see as harassment.
The cyber libel case is one of numerous lawsuits the government has filed against Ressa and Rappler that have drawn global concern about the intimidation of reporters in the Southeast Asian country.
Media watchdogs and human rights groups condemned Monday's verdict, which Amnesty International described as a ""sham"" that ""should be quashed"". 
""With this latest assault on independent media, the human rights record of the Philippines continues its free fall,"" said Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific Regional Director, Nicholas Bequelin in a statement.
The Philippines slipped two places in the World Press Freedom Index to 136 this year out of 180 countries, down from 134 in 2019.
Businessman Wilfredo Keng featured in a 2012 Rappler story, updated in 2014, linking him to illegal activities, citing information contained in an intelligence report from an unspecified agency.
In his complaint, Keng said the Rappler story included ""malicious imputations of crimes, vices and defects.""
Media watchdogs have said the numerous charges against Ressa, which include alleged foreign ownership violations and alleged tax evasion, were aimed at intimidating critics of Duterte.

Rappler has questioned the accuracy of Duterte's public statements and scrutinised his bloody war on drugs and his foreign policies. Duterte has lashed out at the news site in several public speeches.

Police in the southern Chinese city of Foshan said in a statement that they had received a report on Sunday evening that a private home had been broken into and that its residents' lives were under threat. 
They eventually rescued a person surnamed He and arrested five suspects at around 5 a.m. local time on Monday morning (2100 GMT), the statement said, adding no one was injured. A Foshan policeman told Reuters that the person was He Xiangjian. 
The 78-year-old He founded Midea in 1992 and stepped down as its chairman in 2012, but he continues to be the company's controlling shareholder. The 2020 Hurun Global Rich List ranked him as the world's 41st richest person with an estimated wealth of 182 billion yuan ($25.70 billion)
Midea Group thanked the police and the public for their concern towards the situation on its official account on the Twitter-like Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) platform, where thousands of users had been speculating over He's situation. 
The case is under further investigation, the police said.

""If we start purging the record and removing the images of all but those whose attitudes conform to our own, we are engaged in a great lie, a distortion of our history,"" Johnson wrote https:// in The Telegraph.
Johnson also defended Winston Churchill and said it was ""absurd and deplorable"" that the former prime minister's monument should have been in any danger.
""He was a hero, and I expect I am not alone in saying that I will resist with every breath in my body any attempt to remove that statue from Parliament Square, and the sooner his protective shielding comes off the better,"" he said.
Many monuments of historical figures have been boarded up as anti-racism protesters taking to the streets following the death of African-American George Floyd, have put statues at the forefront of their challenge to Britain's imperialist past.
Earlier this month, a statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from the slave trade, was torn down in the port city of Bristol and thrown into harbour.
Johnson is an admirer and biographer of Churchill, and some of those close to him say he wants to emulate him.

But Churchill expressed racist and anti-Semitic views and critics blame him for denying food to India during the 1943 famine which killed more than two million people - aspects of his legacy which some say are not scrutinised enough.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European countries ease some border controls on Monday after coronavirus lockdowns, but Spain's continued closure, a patchwork of restrictions elsewhere and new ways of working mean pre-pandemic levels of travel are a long way off.
The Schengen area of 22 EU countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland operates control-free crossings, but they have been mostly closed for three months to all but goods traffic and critical workers.
European Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson urged Schengen members last week to lift internal border controls by Monday, to allow a gradual reopening to other countries from July.
The move could help salvage the part of the summer season for Europe's battered travel and tourism industry. With recreation and culture, the sector makes up almost 10% of the EU economy and an even bigger chunk in Mediterranean countries, some hit of which were hardest by the pandemic.
From Iceland to Greece, many restrictions for EU and Schengen visitors will ease on Monday, but it will not be a return to unfettered travel for the Schengen area's 420 million inhabitants.
Spain will allow no foreign tourists until June 21, with exceptions on some Spanish islands.
Elsewhere, the right to travel will depend on where you live and where you are going.
Greece will mandate quarantines for those arriving from a string of airports in eight EU countries. The Czech Republic has a traffic-light system, barring entry for tourists from 'orange' or 'red' countries such as Portugal and Sweden.
Denmark will allow in tourists from Iceland, Germany and Norway, but notably not Sweden, on condition they book at least six nights' accommodation.
Britain's mandatory two-week quarantine for visitors means Brits will face the same confinement in France.
Before the crisis, an average of 3.5 million people crossed an internal EU border every day, according to a European Parliament report last year, some 1.7 million of the commuting to work.
Many of the latter are now working from home, while continued restrictions and health concerns are expected to curb tourism and business travel.

At Brussels Airport, day one of the reopening will see around 60 flights operating, 10% of the normal 600.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish political parties Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Greens will sign a deal on Monday on the formation of a new coalition government, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said after talks on Sunday aimed at ending four months of political deadlock. 
The talks will resume on Monday morning to resolve the final issues, negotiators for the three parties told reporters. Green Party leader Eamon Ryan said it was just a matter of ""crossing the 't's"" in the proposed policy programme.
""We've had good progress made, so we're going to sign off tomorrow on it,"" Martin said. ""We're nearly there.""
Martin, whose party has 37 seats in the 160-seat parliament after the closely fought February election, is widely expected to take over as prime minister from Leo Varadkar, whose Fine Gael party has 35 seats, if the deal is ratified by grassroot members of each party. 
Martin and Varadkar are then expected to rotate the role during the government's five-year term.
The policy programme includes plans for a July stimulus package for sectors most impacted by the coronavirus shutdown of the economy such as hospitality and the arts, a source involved in the talks told Reuters. A more comprehensive national recovery plan will follow alongside the budget in October.
The parties will also set up a unit in the prime minister's office to oversee all-island co-operation with British-run Northern Ireland, the source said. That stops short of Fianna Fail's election plan that such a unit would study how Dublin should approach the handling of an Irish unity referendum.
Historic rivals Fianna Fail and Fine Gael need the Greens' 12 seats to command a majority in the fractured parliament that cannot pass any new laws, including those needed to uphold a 6.5 billion euro ($7.3 billion) package of support measures for coronavirus-hit businesses, until a new government is formed. 

Any agreement would have to be ratified by rank and file members from each party, with the smaller Greens requiring two-thirds support, a higher bar than the larger parties and which could yet scupper the deal.

""The Claw-Eagle Operation has started. Our planes are bringing the caves down on the terrorists' heads,"" the Turkish Defence Ministry said on Twitter.
Turkey regularly targets Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants, both in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast and in northern Iraq, where the group is based.
A security source told Reuters the warplanes took off from various air bases in Turkey, notably in the southeastern cities of Diyarbakir and Malatya.
The defence ministry subsequently said the air operation targeted the PKK in the region of its stronghold at Qandil, near the Iranian border, as well as the areas of Sinjar, Zap, Avasin-Basyan and Hakurk.
""The PKK and other terrorist elements are threatening the security of our people and borders with attacks increasing every day on the areas of our outposts and bases,"" it said.
The PKK, designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict, focused in southeast Turkey. 
While Turkish warplanes frequently target PKK targets in northern Iraq, Turkey has also warned in recent years of a potential ground offensive targeting the PKK bases in the Qandil mountains.

Reuters photographer Dylan Martinez heard the words ring out during chaotic scenes in London on Saturday, when mostly peaceful anti-racist demonstrations turned into violent scuffles with counter-protesters in the area.
Then he saw the man who had uttered them - a black protester emerging from the melee carrying an injured white man in a 'fireman's lift' over his shoulder.
The picture he took has gone viral on social media and featured in news bulletins, capturing a moment of high drama that jars with the broader narrative - of anti-racist and far-right protesters fighting each other.
""I saw a skirmish and someone falling to the ground,"" Martinez recalled of the moment near Waterloo Bridge, in central London, as he covered anti-racism protests that have flared up in the city.
The two men then appeared through the crowd.
""The crowd parted right in front of me. I was in the right place at right time, and incredibly lucky from that point of view. He came towards me walking briskly.""
Martinez said the man being carried had injuries to his face, and Reuters journalists at the scene said he had been beaten in a skirmish with anti-racism protesters.
Some people in the crowd shouted out that the assault victim was a member of the far-right.
Reuters was not able to identify the victim or his political leanings. Police said they were aware of the incident and the photograph, but made no further comment when Reuters asked for details of the men's identity and what happened.
Protests have erupted across British cities and around the world after a black man, George Floyd, died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
In some cases they have sparked counter-demonstrations by people who do not agree with all of their aims and methods, and these have included people from far-right groups.
British media identified the black man as Patrick Hutchinson, a personal trainer. On his social media account, he wrote: ""We saved a life today"".
Reuters spoke to the partner of Hutchinson's best friend, who confirmed it was him. Hutchinson did not reply to calls to his mobile phone.
He told British Channel 4 News on Sunday it was a ""scary"" scene. ""It was pretty hectic, it was almost like a stampede.
""...The guys went in there, they sort of put a little cordon around him to stop him receiving any more physical harm. His life was under threat.
""So I just went under, scooped him up and put him on my shoulders and sort of started marching towards the police with him whilst all the guys were surrounding me and protecting me and the guy I had on my shoulder.""
In a statement on Sunday police said 113 people had been arrested over the weekend and 23 officers were injured in the violence, none of them seriously.
The reaction on social media to the picture and events it portrayed has been largely positive.
""Amid all the ugliness, a beautiful moment of humanity,"" wrote British journalist Piers Morgan in a Tweet accompanying the photograph.
Martinez, a veteran photographer who is Reuters' picture editor for the United Kingdom and Ireland, said the protests in London on Saturday had been fluid and unpredictable.
After witnessing sporadic, minor clashes between demonstrators and police in Trafalgar Square, Martinez said he switched attention to nearby Waterloo Bridge, where several hundred anti-racism protesters had gathered.
""They took over the whole of the bridge,"" he said. ""There was a traffic jam going from south to north, but the vibe was good - cars were honking and people were celebrating.""

The mood quickly turned ugly when they encountered a group of counter-protesters and clashes broke out, Martinez said.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The governor of the federal district in which Brazil's capital Brasilia is located closed the area around the presidential palace, ministries, Supreme Court and Congress on Sunday to keep right-wing supporters of President Jair Bolsonaro from gathering there.
Governor Ibaneis Rocha forbade car and pedestrian traffic along the main thoroughfare that houses Brazil's most important federal government buildings, preventing the protests held by Bolsonaro's supporters that have become a regular occurrence in the area. 
The state government issued the decree on Saturday night, after a small far-right group of the president's supporters tried to invade Congress. The decree said the area was closed due to the need to avoid large gatherings amid the coronavirus epidemic, as well as the threat made by some protesters against Brazil's democratic institutions.
With the closure of the Esplanada, as the central Brasilia area is known, Bolsonaro supporters met in other areas, including the main Army quarter in the city, according to images shown by CNN Brasil TV. 
The protesters, who Bolsonaro has greeted on numerous previous occasions, accuse the Supreme Court and Congress of blocking the president's ability to govern. 
Bolsonaro has increasingly clashed with the Supreme Court in recent weeks.
In Sao Paulo, the police only authorized simultaneous protests of Bolsonaro supporters and against the president and supporting him in different locations. Protests were largely peaceful. 
On Sunday, Supreme Court justice Gilmar Mendes tweeted that Bolsonaro may have committed a crime, when the president encouraged people to break into hospitals and film intensive care units to check whether or not beds were full, to prevent frauds in inflating the number of people with severe COVID-19.
Brazil has become the latest epicenter of the pandemic with more than 850,500 reported cases and over 42,700 deaths, both second only to the United States. 

""Its shameful, not to say ridiculous, that public officials stimulate conspiracy theories and put at risk public health,"" Mendes tweeted.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday he was accelerating France's exit from its coronavirus lockdown and that the crisis had laid bare the country's need for greater economic independence. 
In a televised address to the nation, Macron promised that the 500 billion euro cost of keeping companies afloat and people in jobs during the worst downturn since World War Two would not be passed to households through higher taxes.
Restaurants and cafes in Paris will be allowed to reopen fully from Monday, he said, the same day France lifts restrictions at its borders for European Union travellers, bringing sorely needed relief for the hospitality industry.
He said the coronavirus pandemic had exposed the ""flaws and fragility"" of France's, and more broadly Europe's, over-reliance on global supply chains, from the car industry to smart phones and pharmaceuticals.
""The only answer is to build a new, stronger economic model, to work and produce more, so as not to rely on others,"" Macron said.
The coronavirus has killed more than 29,300 people in France and forced Macron, a former investment banker, to suspend his economic and social reform drive aimed at spurring growth, creating jobs and deregulating the economy. 
The government expects the economy to shrink by 11% in 2020. Macron said he would lay out a detailed blueprint for the final two years of his mandate in July. 
STATUES
That will include a reorganisation of the way the French state works and a new phase of decentralisation. ""Not everything should be decided so often in Paris,"" he said.
Macron also addressed the anti-racism protests that have spread to France following the killing of George Floyd, a black man, by a police officer in the United States. 
The global outpouring of anger has forced France to confront allegations from ethnic minorities and rights groups of racism and brutality within France's own law enforcement agencies.
Macron said skin colour too often reduced a person's opportunities in France, promising to be unflinching against all discrimination.
But he expressed support for French police and said fighting racism should not lead to a ""hateful"" re-writing of the history of France, whose empire once stretched from the Caribbean to the South Pacific and included much of north and west Africa.

""I will be very clear tonight, compatriots: the Republic won't erase any name from its history. It will forget none of its artworks, it won't take down statues,"" Macron said.

The release of the kidnap victims on Sunday, including two police officers and four civilians, took place in a rural zone of Colombia's North Santander (MC:SAN) province, which is close to the border with Venezuela. 
""ICRC teams that visited the areas verified the six people were in adequate health conditions for their transfer,"" the human rights group said in a statement. 
The police officers were held captive for 75 days, while one of the civilians, a woman, had been held by the ELN for four months. 
On Friday, the group released two employees of an oil-services company in the province of Arauca, which is also close to the border with Venezuela. 
Made up of 2,000 fighters and considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, the ELN carried out an attack with a car bomb in January 2019 at a police academy in Bogota, killing 22 cadets. 
The attack ended the possibility of talks with the government of President Ivan Duque. 
The president has refused to enter negotiations with the guerrilla group until it stops kidnappings and recruiting minors, frees hostages it currently holds and stops attacking infrastructure - such as oil pipelines - in the Andean country. 
While the ELN has failed to reach a peace agreement with previous governments, its chief negotiator, Pablo Beltran, said in May the group was open to participating in a global three-month ceasefire being discussed at the United Nations as the world contends with the coronavirus pandemic.

In an interview https:// with the Guardian newspaper, Kluge also cautioned that Britain remained in a ""very active phase of the pandemic"" and warned against rushing into reopening the economy. 
Britain said on Sunday it was reviewing its two-metre (6.5-foot) social distancing rule ahead of the next stage of lockdown easing planned for July 4.
England's test and trace system identified nearly 32,000 people who had been in close contact with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 in its first week of operation, but the government admitted that the system is not perfect and would need to do better.
""Contact tracing is key especially as the UK starts to relax the social and physical distancing measures. There has to be a robust track-and-trace system in place of operation,"" Kluge told the Guardian. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, which has faced heavy criticism for its handling of the pandemic, has touted the system as the way to ease lockdown measures while keeping the coronavirus spread in check. 

Britain has reported 41,698 coronavirus-related deaths as of 1600 GMT on June 13, third highest in the world after the United States and Brazil, according to government data.

The talks, known as the intra-Afghan dialogue, will be the first high-level meeting between the two sides after years of fighting.
No date has been announced for the meeting, but it is expected to take place after the two sides settle differences on the release by the Afghan government of 5,000 Taliban prisoners, which could be as soon as the end of next week.
""The first intra-Afghan meeting will happen in Doha,"" Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told Reuters, adding that the Islamist group was ready to hold intra-Afghan talks within a week of the release of 5,000 prisoners.
The Afghan government has released 3,000 Taliban prisoners so far under an agreement signed between the United States and the insurgent group in February.
That deal outlined a roadmap for withdrawing foreign forces from Afghanistan and peace talks to end the 19-year war.
The government wants talks to begin as soon as possible but has issues with the release of a few hundred high-profile Taliban prisoners, a senior government official told Reuters.
The official said the government had offered an alternative prisoner release list to the Taliban. 
The spokesman for the Afghan Presidential Palace, Sediq Sediqqi, said on Twitter that Doha had been agreed as the venue for the first talks but said no permanent venue had been agreed.
The Qatari capital was the venue for signing the deal between the United States and Taliban. The insurgent group has had a political office in Doha since 2013.

Ricardo Monreal, senate leader of the president's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), said he would wait to move ahead with his proposal to combine energy regulator CRE, antitrust watchdog the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE), and telecoms regulator IFT. 
He did not say when he would revive the initiative.
""I've decided to postpone the presentation and start an open process of discussion,"" he said in a video on social media.
The merged body would be called the National Institute of Markets and Competition for Wellbeing, have five board members and would generate annual savings of 500 million pesos ($22.4 million), according to a document presented by Monreal last week. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has vowed to run an austere government, had backed the proposal, praising the effort to reduce spending. 
But the opposition National Action Party criticized the proposal as a power grab and a member of the central bank's board nominated by Lopez Obrador warned it could undermine oversight.

Monreal pushed back against such criticisms, saying, ""There is no intention to create a superpower, nor give way to authoritarianism.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Days into nationwide protests over the killing of George Floyd, demonstrators began to fill a tall fence in front of the White House with posters, flowers, paintings and photos in honor of black men, women and children who have lost their lives at the hands of police.
Placed on the recently renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza, the tributes have created a spontaneous memorial that are now being collected for a more permanent home at the Smithsonian Institution. 
Graffiti artists and mural painters have designed visuals on the site where many protesters congregate to begin nearly nightly demonstrations in Washington.
Memorials have also popped up in New York where muralists decorated the city's Chelsea neighborhood, as well as cities around the world, including Nairobi, Karachi and Berlin. (https://reut.rs/2YFci5s)
Block after block in Washington, office buildings and windows of upscale restaurants that normally cater to lobbyists and business executives have been sheathed in plywood to protect against the short-lived outbursts of arson and vandalism that struck the city's center earlier this month.
Levi Robinson, one of the many artists who got the call to design and paint atop the plywood, said he stumbled onto the idea of making his depiction of military medics.
""I decided to show black medics who serve in the military after speaking with some examples who were on site handing out water began to tell me their stories,"" said Robinson of his piece adorning a boarded-up exterior window of a restaurant on Black Lives Matter Plaza.
Aaron Bryant, a photography and social protest historian and curator at the African American History and Culture Museum, said unlike most of the protest artwork of the 1960s civil rights era, which were made by professional artists and graphic designers, this moment's artwork is different.
""Today, people are making signs by hand and running out of the door. There is more diversity in the signs you see,"" said Bryant, who is leading the team of curators collecting plywood murals, signs and objects such as gas canisters that might one day act as a portal to this moment in history. His museum is one of several making up the Smithsonian Institution on the National Mall in Washington.
""It's hard to talk about this moment's artwork with one common denominator, but what I see is this idea of humanity and community. People coming together to make positive, social change, messages that will last for generations.""
The Washington-based P.A.I.N.T.S Institute, in partnership with the Downtown DC Business Improvement District, organized some 42 artists and volunteers, including Robinson, to design protestor-inspired murals on the Black Lives Matter Plaza, an expansion of similar furnishings in downtown Washington.
Foot traffic, thinned by a two-month coronavirus lockdown, can be spotted taking selfies with some of the roughly 27 murals depicting black faces wearing masks that read, ""Let Us Breath"" and ""God is Love.""

Once such first-time public mural artist, Jemn Napper, said she hopes her downtown Washington pieces ultimately help people realize that ""even though we may have our differences, we can all play a part to come together and create change.""

The zoo, located in Regent's Park, closed in March as the country went into coronavirus lockdown. It opens again on Monday, albeit with restrictions such as limits on visitor numbers, one-way routes and paw-print markers to ensure social distancing.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A COVID patient lies shirtless on a gurney in a chill corridor of a hospital in Colombia's capital Bogota, oxygen tubes coiled on his chest. It takes five staff - in scrubs, masks and face shields - to wheel him into the intensive care unit.
His intubation takes time. To protect themselves from coronavirus-infected saliva during the complicated procedure, the medics place a large orb-like shield over the man's head.
ICU nursing head Fernanda Castaneda said her staff are used to tending to ventilated patients but they are finding that COVID cases often occupy beds for weeks, instead of the three to five day turnaround for other lung conditions.
Her 14-bed unit - one of three ICUs reserved for COVID patients at El Tunal hospital in Bogota's sprawling southern suburbs - is already filling up. 
COVID ICUs in Bogota - the epicenter of Colombia's outbreak - have seen their occupancy rates rise steadily over the past several months and last week reached 50% capacity, according to the city's mayor. 
While that remains low compared with some neighboring countries, such as Brazil - where some areas are using more than 80% of ICU capacity - medics say it is just the beginning. 
Staff here worry the epidemic is growing worse just as the government prepares to ease its national quarantine. 
""This is really going to get out of control,"" said Castaneda, shod of her surgical gown after the intubation. ""There will come a moment when this will collapse and neither doctors nor the government nor anyone will be able to control it if people don't at least follow the recommendations.""
Colombia, which has been in nationwide lockdown since late March, may reach 50,000 confirmed cases as soon as Sunday. A general quarantine is due to end on July 1, though hundreds of thousands of businesses have reopened under safety protocols as President Ivan Duque's government tries to mitigate the hardship.
Economic activity has plummeted and unemployment has soared during lockdown, with Duque's centre-right administration coming in for criticism from families scrambling to make ends meet.
Bogota's mayor Claudia Lopez and the health ministry have kept the city - which accounts for more than a third of Colombia's cases - under stricter rules, with updated measures expected on Monday.
Lopez has repeatedly sounded the alarm about ICU capacity, saying the city could have 1,000 more beds once the national government provides ventilators.
""Economic reactivation will advance if and only if it is guaranteed neither the health system nor the ICUs will collapse,"" she tweeted on Saturday. ""Without a guarantee of care we cannot take more risks.""
Nationwide only around 2% of patients with active coronavirus cases are in ICUs, but hospitals have continued to prepare ahead of an infection peak that may still be weeks away.
""The quarantine has been giving medical staff, the hospital, the government, the economy, time to prepare to see how we will handle this,"" Castaneda said, sitting on a mattress in a seven-bed unit which be another COVID ICU once ventilators arrive. 
""If it was up to us the quarantine would be extended, but we know the situation is precarious. People really need to work.""
VIDEO GOODBYES
To ease the distress of families unable to visit their loved ones, the hospital has launched a program to allow patients to watch videos sent by their kin on a hospital tablet. 
Jairo Velandia, whose 31-year-old cousin Miguel was intubated at the hospital in late May, was overcome by emotion and relief the first time they were able to speak via video call.
""There was very little talking, it was more tears,"" said Velandia, whose cousin is now off the ventilator and recovering in a general COVID unit. ""More than a cousin, I see him as a brother.""
Sometimes those videos serve as final goodbyes.
Great-grandmother Blancanieves Daza de Rodriguez, 85, died of COVID on June 3 after 52 days in the hospital.
Her sons Hernando and Joselin Rodriguez, two of her six children, said family videos always perked up their mother, a lover of cooking who hailed from Colombia's mountainous Boyaca province.

""Despite how sick my mom was you could see her spirit. You could see she wanted to grab the tablet and hug it,"" Hernando said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Women across Switzerland let loose with screams during a national protest on Sunday, demanding equal treatment and an end to violence at the hands of men. 
Last year half a million people marched to highlight the nation's poor record on women's rights. This year's version of what organisers call the Women's Strike was more subdued given coronavirus restrictions. 
    ""For me it is emotional. Because I scream for me, but I also scream for my sisters and brothers, I scream for all the other children who lost a mother or a father, and I also scream for my mother, who would have screamed if she was still here,"" said Roxanne Errico, a 19-year-old student who said her mother was killed by her violent boyfriend.
Another Geneva resident, Rose-Angela Gramoni, said she had joined all the women's strikes since 1991.
    ""Now I can die in peace, the next generation is here to take over. But for a while, I was very sad. I thought we fought for many things, but we did not finish the job and nobody was here to finish it,"" said Gramoni, who is in her 70s.
Switzerland has a high quality of life but lags other developed economies in women's pay and workplace equality. Women earn roughly a fifth less than men, better than 30 years ago when it was about a third less, but worse than in 2000, according to government data. 
Thousands of marchers in Geneva and other Swiss cities screamed for a minute at 3:24 p.m. -- the time of day when women technically start working for free given the wage gap.
They also staged a flash mob and held a minute's silence for women killed by husbands or boyfriends.
Demonstrators decried violence against women and the LGBT community, and called for recognition of often unpaid work caring for family and relatives. 

""I would love to walk at night wearing a skirt, shorts or leggings without being insulted, without being scared to be raped,"" said Geneva resident Vani Niuti, 20.

LGBT rights have become a hot-button issue ahead of a June 28 presidential election in Poland, with Duda arguing that the promotion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights needlessly sexualizes children and harms families. 
""Yet again, as part of dirty political fight, my words are put out of context. I truly believe in diversity and equality,"" Duda tweeted in English on Sunday, tagging media organisations including Reuters, the Associated Press and the Financial Times.
He did not say how his remarks had been misrepresented.
Duda is an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS), which dismisses LGBT rights as an invasive foreign influence undermining Poland's traditional values.
PiS has attacked Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw who is also the presidential candidate of the main opposition party Civic Platform, for introducing a sexual education programme in the capital designed to include teaching about LGBT issues.
On Saturday, Duda said such teachings were a form of ""neo-Bolshevism"" in a campaign speech in the southwestern town of Brzeg, saying his parents' generation had not fought communist ideology for decades only for Poland to face a ""new ideology (of LGBT rights) that is even more destructive"".
The comments were widely reported by the local and international press, including Reuters. 
""Truth has become a scared little creature,"" Duda said on Sunday in a series of English language tweets criticising the international media for their reporting of his speech. 

Duda said he wanted to see a world ""where we can speak our mind, where words are not twisted. I believe in tolerance to any views, so please stop distributing fake news"".

Russian Orthodox Church officials said last month neither would be depicted in the cathedral.
The richly decorated 95-metre high cathedral, dedicated to the 75th anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two, was built in less than two years in a theme park about 55 kilometres (34 miles) from Moscow.
The cathedral had been scheduled to open its doors in May when Russia was also planning to hold a military parade, but both events were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
At a ceremony attended by Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and military and church officials, Patriarch Kirill, head of Russia's Orthodox Church, thanked Putin and Shoigu for helping to get the cathedral built.
During his two decades in power, Putin has forged close ties with the Orthodox Church.
Originally, the new cathedral was meant to include a mosaic of Putin and Shoigu demonstrating their support for Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.
Another mosaic panel would have shown a group of women gathered in front of a sign reading ""Crimea is ours"".
The Church dropped the planned mosaics in line with ""the wishes of the head of state"", a priest told Interfax news agency last month. The Kremlin said Putin felt it was too early to celebrate the accomplishments of Russia's current leadership.
Russian media also reported that one of the cathedral's mosaic panels was originally designed to show a portrait of Stalin, who is widely held responsible for the deaths of millions of innocent people, many in the Gulag labour camps.

The Orthodox Church and other religious groups suffered persecution during Stalin's three-decade rule in the atheistic Soviet Union.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the man, without identifying him.
Australian and Chinese media have identified the man as Cam Gillespie, arrested seven years ago on charges of drug trafficking in southern China.
China's foreign ministry said on Sunday capital punishment was suitable for drug crimes that cause serious harm. 
""China law stipulates that the law must be equally applied to everyone who commits a crime. China judicial institutions handle the cases of criminals of all nationalities according to the law,"" said the ministry in a faxed reply to Reuters.
Attempts to reach Gillespie's family were unsuccessful.
""We are deeply saddened to hear of the verdict made in his case,"" the Australian foreign affairs department said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""Australia opposes the death penalty, in all circumstances for all people. We support the universal abolition of the death penalty and are committed to pursuing this goal through all the avenues available to us."" 
Cam Gillespie was arrested in 2013 with more than 7.5 kg (17 pounds) of methamphetamine in his check-in luggage while attempting to board an international flight from Baiyun Airport in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, according to several media reports. 
Diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Canberra have worsened since Australia called for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the new coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
China has in recent weeks banned Australian beef imports and imposed tariffs on Australian barley. It has also urged Chinese tourists to avoid Australia.
The death sentence for drug smuggling is not uncommon in China, where executions are usually carried out by firing squad.
Last year, the country sentenced two Canadians to death for drug-related crimes following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and said it was “not worried in the slightest” by mounting international concern over the verdict.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will reopen its borders to visitors from Europe's open-border Schengen area from June 21, 10 days earlier than previously planned, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Sunday, in a further easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.
Sanchez also said a planned aid package to rescue Spain's automobile sector, hard hit by the pandemic lockdown, would total 3.7 billion euros, adding that further details would be announced on Monday.
""We have been able to corner the virus in our country and on the European continent... but the risk has not disappeared,"" Sanchez told a news briefing after talks with leaders of Spain's 17 regions.
""Tourism is a key sector for the economic recovery,"" he said, announcing the opening of Spain's borders on June 21 to visitors from the Schengen area, which includes most of the European Union and some non-EU nations such as Norway.
Spain's state of emergency ends that same day. Limits on mobility will be lifted but wearing masks in public will remain mandatory until a cure or vaccine for COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the virus, is found.
However, Sanchez said Spain's land border with Portugal would remain closed till July 1, without saying why.
Visitors from outside the Schengen area will be able to visit Spain from July 1, though that will hinge on specific border agreements. Britain and Ireland are outside Schengen.
Spain's borders are currently closed to tourists and those exempted from the entry ban must then spend 14 days in quarantine as a precaution against the spread of COVID-19, which has so far killed more than 27,000 people in Spain.
In a small prelude to the wider opening of its borders, Spain will allow German tourists to start visiting its Balearic Islands from Monday in a test programme.
The government has said it will announce support measures for the tourism sector on Thursday. Together, tourism and automobiles account for over 20% of Spain's gross domestic product.

The lockdown has hammered car sales in Spain, and last month Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co (7201.T) said it would close its 3,000-workforce plants in Barcelona. The government has said it will try to reverse the decision.

For more than five years Libya has had rival parliaments andgovernments in the east and the west, with streets oftencontrolled by armed groups and sporadic fighting.

Demonstrators marched through the streets of the capital's Shibuya and Harajuku districts chanting and holding up signs spelling out slogans such as ""Racism Is A Pandemic"" and ""No Justice No Peace"".
""It is not enough to just send our prayers,"" Shu Fukui, a 22-year-old university graduate, told Reuters. ""We need to change society, not only for George Floyd, but also for those who died in the past.""
Organisers said about 3,500 people took part in the protest. Police did not disclose an estimate.
Protests have gripped major U.S. cities and spread around the world since footage from May 25 showing a white police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck to pin him to the ground for a whole nine minutes went viral. 
In Atlanta on Saturday more protests erupted after a black man was shot dead by police as he tried to escape arrest. Demonstrators shut down a major highway and burned down the Wendy's (NASDAQ:WEN) restaurant where he was killed. 
Some protesters at the Tokyo march said Japan needed to own up to its own problems with race.

ADEN (Reuters) - Southern separatists in Yemen seized a consignment of billions of riyals intended for the central bank in Aden on Saturday, in a further attempt to wrench control from the Saudi-backed government since declaring self rule in the south in April.
Forces loyal to the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which declared self rule in Aden in April, commandeered the convoy bearing the cash as it left the port, the central bank said in a statement on Saturday, warning of ""dangerous consequences"".
The convoy was carrying 64 billion riyals in banknotes printed for the Yemeni central bank in Russia, a government source said. Another government source said the cash was taken to a military base in what he said was ""piracy"".
""The action is part of several measures to end sources of corruption and to prevent the use of public money in supporting terrorism,"" the STC said in a statement.
This bold move could threaten a fragile peace between the STC and the Saudi-backed government, nominal allies in a war against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.
The government and the STC signed an agreement last year to end the their power struggle in the south, but the parties failed to implement the deal on the ground.
The STC accuses the Saudi-backed government of mismanagement and corruption, a charge it denies. 
The central bank did not disclose how much money was taken.

Hypersonic glide vehicles can steer an unpredictable course and manoeuvre sharply as they approach impact. They also follow a much flatter and lower trajectory than ballistic missiles.
Washington and Moscow have been expanding their defence capabilities as some Cold War-era arms control agreements collapsed during worsening of Russia's ties with the West.
Last year Russia deployed its first hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles, while the Pentagon has a goal of fielding hypersonic capabilities in the early to mid-2020s. 
""It's very likely that we will have means to combat hypersonic weapons by the time the world's leading countries have such weapons,"" Putin was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.

While Russia and the United States had broadly the same number of nuclear weapons, Putin said Moscow was ahead in advanced arms development.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov decided to put off the talks during a phone call on Sunday, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
""The two countries deputy ministers will continue contacts and talks in the period ahead. Minister-level talks will be held at a later date,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Lavrov and Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had been set to visit Istanbul for the discussions. The Russian foreign ministry said discussion will be held on the date of the ministers' meeting.
The United Nations said this week that warring sides had begun new ceasefire talks in Libya, where Ankara supports an internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), whose forces have in recent weeks repelled an assault on Tripoli by the Libyan National Army (LNA).
Moscow, along with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, backs the LNA in the long-running Libyan conflict. 
In Syria, Russia supports Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces, while Turkey backs opposition fighters. 
Although a Turkish-Russian brokered deal three months ago produced a ceasefire that halted fighting in northwest Syria's Idlib, air strikes have once again hit the region in the last week.

The man is in custody in Essex, east of London, after presenting himself at a police station, the police said.
Far-right protesters clashed in London on Saturday with anti-racist demonstrators and with police trying to keep the two sides apart.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the violence, saying ""racist thuggery has no place on our streets"".
The Westminster memorial honours PC Keith Palmer who was murdered while on duty at the Houses of Parliament during an attack in 2017 in which four other people were also killed. 
Met Police Commander Bas Javid said on Saturday: ""We are aware of a disgusting and abhorrent image circulating on social media of a man appearing to urinate on a memorial to PC Palmer.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is urgently reviewing its social distancing rule and might be able to relax quarantine for travellers to help its economy recover from a coronavirus crisis collapse, the country's finance minister Rishi Sunak said.
Progress in tackling the coronavirus pandemic meant Britain was able to take a ""fresh look"" at the two-metre rule, which many employers have said will make it harder to get back up to speed after the lockdown, Sunak said on Sunday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government, which says it has always followed scientific advice in its handling of the pandemic, faces the difficult balancing act of reviving the economy without allowing a second wave of coronavirus cases.
Britain has the third highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil, something critics of the government say reflects its response to the crisis. 
""It's important that we look at it comprehensively, in the round, and that's what we will do urgently,"" Sunak told Sky News about the social distancing rule, adding that preliminary work had already begun.
Reducing the distance people must keep apart from each other would mean three quarters of pubs could reopen, rather than about one third with a two-metre rule.
Sunak also said the government could make changes to a 14-day quarantine for people coming into the country, such as the introduction of travel corridors with specific countries.
Airlines have warned of huge job losses because of the quarantine introduced last week.
""The transport secretary is actively looking at options as we continue to make progress against the virus. We might be able to do more here as well,"" Sunak said.
Sunak said he would reopen the economy ""slowly and safely"", starting with the retail sector this week, and he hoped the hospitality sector would follow in early July.
The scale of the economic slump was laid bare by data last week which showed output shrank by a quarter over March and April, but the focus was now on the recovery phase.
Sunak said he wanted to encourage companies to hire workers and there needed to be more skills training, while higher levels of household savings represented a positive for the economy. 
Asked if he might cut value-added tax to spur spending, Sunak said it was something Britain had done previously.

""Before we have that conversation we need to actually reopen those sectors. There's no point in cutting VAT on a sector that is actually closed,"" he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. embassy in Seoul draped a huge Black Lives Matter banner on its mission building and tweeted a picture of it in support of an anti-racism campaign across America.
""The U.S. Embassy stands in solidarity with fellow Americans grieving and peacefully protesting to demand positive change. Our #BlackLivesMatter banner shows our support for the fight against racial injustice and police brutality as we strive to be a more inclusive & just society,"" the embassy tweeted on Saturday, along with the picture of the banner in black and white.
U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris retweeted the message, adding ""USA is a free and diverse nation... from that diversity we gain our strength.""
Black Lives Matter protests are being held across the globe as part of campaigns focusing on social injustice following the death of George Floyd in police custody, but the banner is seen as a rare, open support for the protest by an appointee of President Donald Trump after Trump linked violent protests to ""thugs.""
No comment was immediately available from the embassy on Sunday.
The embassy also made some waves last year when it displayed a rainbow banner in support of the LGBTQ community.
Harris, a 40-year veteran of the U.S. Navy who started in Seoul in 2018 after Trump appointed him, has privately said that he is planning on exiting his position before the end of the year.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - More than 100 people took part in the Shanghai's eighth annual Pride Run on Sunday, one of a series of events over nine days in China's financial hub to raise public awareness for the LGBT community. 
Waving banners with rainbows on them and sticking temporary rainbow tattoos on their cheeks, participants ran two routes through the city center, ranging from 6 to 12 kilometers (4-7 miles). 
""Raise The Pride"", which will also include talks and workshops, runs from June 13 to 21 and coincides with similar events in other cities around the world for Pride month. 
""It's my first time to join the Pride Run. I want to join because I am a cross-country racer in the school and I stand with equal rights as an LGBTQ member,"" said Jacky Zhou, 16, as she prepared for the run.
""I hope this running event can help us promote the power of the rainbow. I am so excited now and I hope I can finish it.""
Social distancing restrictions, imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, have largely been lifted in Shanghai in recent months after a sharp drop in nationwide cases, although the capital Beijing is grappling with a new cluster of coronavirus infections.

Homosexuality is legal in China and the country stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. However same-sex marriage is not recognized and concerns over stigma still dissuades people from coming out to their families.

New South Wales police were alerted to graffiti on Cook's statue in Hyde Park in the central district of Australia's largest city just after 4 a.m. (2000 GMT on Saturday) before the two women in their late 20s were arrested. 
The women were found with a bag containing a number of spray-paint cans, the police said in a statement. They were refused bail and will be charged with the destroying and damaging property, it said. 
Anti-racism protesters, who have taken to the streets following the death of African American George Floyd in police custody, are demanding that the legacies of some of the architects of Europe's empire building be revisited and their statues be torn down.
From Cecil Rhodes in England to Christopher Columbus in the United States and King Leopold II in Belgium, statues of empire builders have been under attack in recent weeks around the world, sometimes from the descendants of those they once colonised.
Cook's statute was promptly cleaned by Sydney council workers on Sunday morning, a police spokeswoman said. 
Police in the neighbouring state of Victoria are also investigating the weekend defacing of the statues of two former Australian prime ministers at a Ballarat park.
In New Zealand, thousands marched the streets of Auckland and Wellington chanting, ""I can't breathe"" - a phrase the handcuffed Floyd repeated before dying as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

The leader has imposed some of the toughest measures in the Americas against the pandemic, in which El Salvador has registered 72 deaths and 3,603 infections from the coronavirus.
Bukele had previously clashed with lawmakers who wanted an earlier end to the lockdown, saying it would be too risky to reopen. Upon announcing plans for the economy's reboot, he urged residents to stay in their homes a bit longer than required.
""The quarantine legally ends today at 2400 hours (local time), but we are asking people to stay in voluntary quarantine until Monday,"" he said. ""We can't avoid the re-opening.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong riot cop who was filmed chanting ""black lives matter"" and ""I can't breathe"" on patrol during a demonstration on Friday has been reprimanded by authorities, according to media reports.
A clip of the officer who was in Yau Ma Tei, in Hong Kong's Kowloon neighbourhood, was posted online, including the government funded public broadcaster RTHK's website, in which he was seen making the comments in reference to George Floyd's death in Minneapolis on May 25 while in police custody, which sparked protests across the United States.
The man was recorded saying ""black lives matters"" in English and ""I can't breathe"" three times each and ""this is not America"" in the 20-second clip that was published on the RTHK website on the weekend.
Police were carrying out identity card checks of the crowd, according to media, at the time the officer made the comments. 
A Hong Kong police spokeswoman told the South China Morning Post the officer had been reprimanded over the incident.
""The officer has been rebuked and reminded to always present himself professionally and enhance his sensitivity,"" the spokeswoman told the newspaper.
""Disciplinary action may ensue depending on the investigation result.""
A crowd had gathered in Yau Ma Tei on Friday night as part of protests across the city to mark the first anniversary of tear gas being fired during an anti government demonstration against the then proposed extradition bill.
The bill, which would have allowed Hong Kong citizens to be sent to mainland China for trial, has been shelved but tensions in the city remain high as Beijing moves to impose a national security law on Hong Kong.

The attacks, in the Monguno and Nganzai local government areas, came just days after militants killed at least 69 people in a raid on a village in a third area, Gubio.
Two humanitarian workers and three residents told Reuters that militants armed with heavy weaponry including rocket launchers arrived in Monguno, a hub for international non-governmental organizations, at roughly 11 a.m. local time. They overran government forces, taking some casualties but killing at least 20 soldiers and roaming the area for three hours. 
The sources said hundreds of civilians were injured in the crossfire, overwhelming the local hospital and forcing some of the injured to lay outside the facility awaiting help. 
The militants also burned down the United Nations' humanitarian hub in the area and set on fire the local police station. Fighters distributed letters to residents, in the local Hausa language, warning them not to work with the military or international aid groups. 
Militants also entered Nganzai at about the same time on Saturday, according to two residents and one Civilian Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Task Force (CJTF) fighter. They arrived on motorcycles and in pickup trucks and killed more than 40 residents, the sources said. 
A military spokesman did not answer calls for comment on the attacks. U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment. 
Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), have killed thousands and displaced millions in northeastern Nigeria. ISWAP claimed the two Saturday attacks, and the Gubio attack.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is working with Education Minister Gavin Williamson to ensure all schools can open in September and to provide support packages to help children catch up on lost learning, his office said on Saturday. 
Detailed work is underway with schools, councils and unions to make sure all children are able to return in September if it is safe to do so, a Downing Street source said. 
Schools shut to most pupils in March due to the coronavirus pandemic but selected age groups have been able to return since the beginning of June, although some educators decided not to re-open because they said it was not safe.
The decision to gradually re-open schools has divided opinion, with Britain suffering one of the world's worst death tolls from COVID-19 and some critics warning of the need for caution to prevent a second wave of the virus.

Johnson has asked for measures to be drawn up to help children over the summer and further into the future, said the statement. For social justice reasons help was especially needed for those who had less support at home, it added.

The U.S. ambassador to Poland, Georgette Mosbacher, reacting on Twitter to the report, said negotiations remained on track.
""President Trump @POTUS & @Prezydentpl Duda's vision for increased US presence in Poland will be even greater than originally outlined. Announcement coming soon.""
Mosbacher and the U.S. Embassy in Poland were not immediately available for comment to elaborate on the timing of the announcement and what the new plans would look like.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said in an email to Reuters on Saturday that talks were productive and on track.
A spokesman for Reuters said the company stood behind its reporting which accurately reflected the situation at the time.
Reuters was unable on Friday to determine what fresh efforts, if any, had been made since Wednesday's report to advance the negotiations and resolve major outstanding issues such as funding.
A year ago, Polish President Andrzej Duda and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed that an additional 1,000 U.S. troops would be stationed in Poland. Six locations were shortlisted for the troops when Vice President Mike Pence visited Warsaw in September.
The Reuters report published on Wednesday cited government officials in Washington and Warsaw saying they still could not agree where the troops should be stationed, and how much of the multi-billion-dollar deployment Warsaw should fund. 
In that story, Polish deputy foreign minister Pawel Jablonski told Reuters complex issues remained to be ironed out. ""There's the question of financing, of the placement, of legal rights, under what principles these soldiers will function here,"" he said.
""I do think we will come to a final decision, but this will still take some time.""

GUADALAJARA, Spain (Reuters) - Chanting ""We are culture"", matadores and bullfighting supporters demonstrated on Saturday across Spain, seeking government support for the sector after the coronavirus pandemic halted its season.
Major festivals such as Sevilla's April Fair and Pamplona's San Fermin in July have been cancelled and bulls have been sent from ranches straight to the slaughterhouse. The shut-down could deal a fatal blow to a controversial spectacle that has struggled for survival in recent decades. 
""The Covid-19 crisis has had an enormous impact ... It has reduced almost by 100% the scheduled events for the year and all the families that live of bullfighting have been too affected,"" said Juan de Castilla, 25, a Colombian bullfighter at a protest in the central city of Guadalajara.
There were also protests on Saturday in Seville, Madrid and Barcelona, among other cities. 
Several hundred masked people marched in Guadalajara, waving Spanish flags with bull figures and holding banners in support of the traditionally emblematic Spanish spectacle.
The Spanish government has allowed bullfights to resume but with only half occupancy and a limit of 800 attendees in regions with lesser lockdown restrictions. 
""We have come to proclaim that the bullfighting world is important for society, Spain and Guadalajara,"" said Jesus Romero, 58.
He said bullfights, also known as ""corridas"", should resume soon since Spain is gradually lifting its lockdown - one of the strictest in Europe. The country has now contained the coronavirus spread, which has killed over 27,000 people. 
Although the big festivals still draw crowds, public interest in bullfighting has dwindled considerably.

Over 56% of people were against bullfighting, 24.7% in favour and 18.9% indifferent in a poll published last year by news website El Espanol. Support was significantly higher among conservative voters, it showed.

""The biggest mistake in human sciences is to predict, especially in fluid and grave conditions. But allow me to venture a prediction that Mr Trump's re-election chances are still more that 50%,"" Zarif said in an interview. ""Of course his chances have seriously decreased compared to four to five months ago."" 
""But Mr Trump has a 30-35% base that has not moved and, as long as this base does not move, there is still a chance of his re-election,"" Zarif said in the live interview on Instagram with Iranian journalist Farid Modarresi, the first of its kind with a senior official of the Islamic Republic.
Relations between Iran and the United States have taken a turn for the worse since Donald Trump last year pulled Washington out of the nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy. Iran has responded by gradually scaling back its commitments under the agreement.
Trump said earlier this month that Iranian leaders would be wrong if they expected his defeat in the November elections. Recent opinion polls have seen President Donald Trump lose ground to Democrat Joe Biden.
""Don’t wait until after U.S. Election to make the Big deal. I’m going to win. You’ll make a better deal now!,"" Trump tweeted, addressing Iran.
Iran's Foreign Ministry responded that Iran would not base its policies on internal U.S. matters, such as elections.
Zarif said in the interview that Trump himself had likely reached the conclusion that his policies of ""maximum pressure"" against Iran had failed. 

""I don't think Trump believes anymore in talk that the Islamic Republic is about to collapse,"" Zarif said. ""But he keeps repeating his mistakes. It seems that they (U.S. officials) know they have committed errors but don't know how to correct them.""

Protests broke out on Thursday after the currency plunged to new lows over the past week, with rising anger over the government's inability to contain an economic crisis that has devastated living conditions.
The pound has lost some 70% of its value since October, when the debt-saddled country was plunged into a financial crisis that has hiked prices, slashed jobs, and brought on capital controls that have frozen people out of their dollar savings.
The currency, which had hit about 5,000 to the dollar, appeared to reverse its slide on Friday after a government announcement that the central bank would inject dollars into the market on Monday.
In a televised address on Saturday, Diab said political opponents looking to thwart government efforts to investigate and crack down on corruption were stirring the latest unrest.
""Some have tried to exploit the situation again...They have thrown lies and rumours, have contributed to deepening the Lebanese pound crisis, have caused a major crisis and have pushed people onto the streets,"" Diab said.
Diab, who took office in January with the backing of the powerful Iran-aligned Hezbollah, did not name the opponents.
Protesters returned to streets across Lebanon on Saturday, with demonstrations in Beirut, the northern city of Tripoli, and Sidon in the south, expressing outrage over the deteriorating conditions and many calling on the government to resign.

The renewed unrest could complicate Beirut's ongoing talks with the International Monetary Fund over a reform programme it hopes will secure billions in financing and kickstart a recovery.

PARIS (Reuters) - Riot police fired tear gas to prevent thousands of anti-racism protesters marching through central Paris on Saturday, as a wave of anger continued to sweep the world following the death of African American George Floyd.
The protesters gathered in Place de la Republique, where the crowd chanted ""No justice, no peace"" and some climbed the statue of Marianne, who personifies the French Republic. Police refused organisers permission to proceed to the Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) House.
The protest was generally peaceful but after three hours skirmishes broke out. Organisers urged protesters with children to leave as riot police charged pockets of protesters and projectiles were thrown at police lines. 
The outrage generated by Floyd's death in Minneapolis last month has resonated in France, in particular in deprived city suburbs where rights groups say that accusations of brutal treatment by French police of residents of often immigrant background remain largely unaddressed.
Assa Traore, sister of 24-year-old Adama Traore, who died near Paris in 2016 after police detained him, addressed Saturday's protest.
""The death of George Floyd has a strong echo in the death in France of my little brother,"" she said. ""What's happening in the United States is happening in France. Our brothers are dying."" 
Traore's family say he was asphyxiated when three officers held him down with the weight of their bodies. Authorities say the cause of his death is unclear.
One banner carried by the crowd in the Place de la Republique read: ""I hope I don’t get killed for being black today"". Another carried a message for the government: ""If you sow injustice, you reap a revolt.""
Earlier this week, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner acknowledged there were ""proven suspicions of racism"" within French law enforcement agencies. 
His remarks drew condemnation from police unions, which said officers were being scapegoated for deep-rooted social ills. Police have held their own protests in cities across France this week.
Ahead of the protest, in the ethnically diverse Paris suburb of Belleville, one man of Algerian descent said he had been the victim of police violence but he doubted institutional racism ran through the force. 
""I've been insulted, hit even. But the police aren't all the same,"" he told Reuters TV, identifying himself as Karim. ""Unfortunately, this minority is hurting the police.""
Far-right activists unfurled a banner with the words ""anti-white racism"" from the rooftop of a building overlooking the protest. Residents emerged onto their balconies and ripped it up using with knives and scissors, to cheers from below. 

Protests took place in other countries on Saturday, including in several Australian cities, Taipei, Zurich and London.

629,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 13, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",Venezuela's opposition says to extend congress' term after court appoints electoral body,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leaders pledged to extend the term of the current legislature past the end date of January 2021 after the government-friendly Supreme Court appointed an electoral body to oversee this year's parliamentary elections.
An extension would allow Juan Guaido, who is recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's rightful leader due to his position as president of the opposition-held National Assembly, to remain in the role even if opposition parties boycott the elections due by the end of the year.
Venezuela's constitution grants the power to appoint members of the national electoral council to congress, but the Supreme Court - widely viewed as loyal to President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government - on Friday named its own board after ruling the legislature had failed to do so.
Opposition leaders denounced the move as an attempt to rig the election. 
""The current legitimate National Assembly will continue as long as no valid constitutional electoral process to substitute it has been held,"" Henry Ramos, a senior lawmaker from the large Democratic Action block, wrote on Twitter on Friday night.
Jose Ignacio Hernandez, Guaido's chief overseas legal representative, wrote on Twitter that the constitution said the Assembly's mandate would last until conditions for a fair election were established. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The court's decision to name its own council has raised the likelihood that opposition parties would boycott the parliamentary election as they did Maduro's re-election in 2018.

A loss of control of the National Assembly, held by the opposition since early 2016, could complicate Guaido's standing.

Turkey supports Fayez al Serraj's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), whose forces have in recent weeks repelled a 14-month assault on Tripoli by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
Russia, along with the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, backs the LNA. The United Nations said on Wednesday that Libya's warring sides had begun to engage in a new round of ceasefire talks.
""During the visit, delegations are expected to have consultations and discuss coordination on regional issues,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said of the visit by the Russian delegation, which will include military and security officials.
Turkish state broadcaster TRT Haber said the ministers would also discuss the situation in Syria.

Russia backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces, while Turkey supports opposition fighters. A Turkish-Russian deal three months ago produced a ceasefire that halted fighting in northwest Syria's Idlib, but air strikes hit the region this week.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian officials on Saturday said they were offered $5 million in bribes to end a probe into energy company Burisma's founder, but said there was no connection to former board member Hunter Biden whose father is running for the U.S. presidency.
The Ukrainian company was thrust into the global spotlight last year in the impeachment inquiry into whether U.S. President Donald Trump improperly pressured Kiev into opening a case against his rival for the November election race.
Trump wants an investigation into the Democrats' 2020 candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son.
Artem Sytnyk, head of Ukraine's national anti-corruption bureau (NABU), said three people had been detained, including one current and former tax official, over the bribe offer.
The money was the largest cash bribe ever seized in the country, NABU said. It was put on display during a press briefing, brought by masked men in see-through plastic bags.
Burisma said in a statement it had nothing to do with the matter. It did not respond to a request for comment from the company's founder Mykola Zlochevsky, a former ecology minister now living abroad. 
""Let's put an end to this once and for all. Biden Jr. and Biden Sr. do not appear in this particular proceeding,"" Nazar Kholodnytsky, head of anti-corruption investigations at the prosecution service, told Saturday's briefing. 
The bribe related to a case of embezzling state money given to a bank, officials said. Some $5 million was offered to anti-corruption officials and a further $1 million was intended for an official acting as a middleman, Sytnyk said. 
The suspects were in a hurry to pay the bribe because they wanted to end the case against Zlochevsky in time for his birthday on Sunday, ""to close the criminal proceedings and ensure the return of Mr. Zlochevsky to Ukraine,"" he said. 
The country's former prosecutor general told Reuters in June that an audit he commissioned while in office of thousands of old case files had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Hunter Biden while he worked for Burisma. 
Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014, one of several high-profile names to join what the private company said was an attempt to strengthen corporate governance.

His role has been attacked as corrupt without evidence by Trump and congressional Republicans in Washington. The Bidens deny any wrongdoing and Democrats said Trump was trying to help his re-election prospects.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan families on the outskirts of Caracas are expanding a settlement of mud-and-bamboo homes lacking running water, power and sewer services, in another sign of declining living standards amid a six-year economic crisis. 
Sixteen families in the community known as ""Los Trailers"" have already built such huts, and another group of families is building 14 more. They say they cannot build brick homes, because bricks are too expensive.
""For an oil-producing country in the 21st century to experience this kind of situation ... is deplorable, degrading,"" said the opposition lawmaker Omar Avila, who led a visit to the area on Friday.
The families get water from a nearby well or fill a 150-liter (39.6 gallon) cistern for $1.
Without toilets, they relieve themselves in plastic bags that they throw into nearby weeds. Many cook with makeshift stoves, using paper or plastic to light damp firewood.
Venezuela's economy has collapsed under a hyperinflationary crisis. The United Nations says Venezuela in 2019 suffered the fourth most severe food crises in the world, with 9.3 million people suffering hunger or inadequate nutrition.
President Nicolas Maduro blames U.S. sanctions meant to oust him.
Solnelis Cedeno, 33, a mother of five, built her mud hut because she could no longer afford the $10 in monthly rent for a small room in a house near Los Trailers.
""Since we couldn't build with blocks, we had to cut bamboo and mud,"" said Cedeno.
The dwellings have sloping walls, low ceilings and sparse furniture.
""Everything is difficult right now because of the prices,"" said Jorge Luis Hernandez, 30, who has planted cassava, plantain and beans behind his home. ""We have a sad shack (... but) what can we do? Keep going.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - The sister of North Korea's leader has warned of retaliatory measures against South Korea that could involve the military, in the latest escalation of tensions over defectors from the North who have been sending back propaganda and food. 
Kim Yo Jong, who serves unofficially as one of Kim Jong Un's top aides, issued the warning in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA on Saturday. 
""By exercising my power authorized by the Supreme Leader, our Party and the state, I gave an instruction to the ... department in charge of the affairs with (the) enemy to decisively carry out the next action,"" Kim said. 
Her statement, which did not say what the next action could be, came days after South Korea took legal action against defectors who have been sending material such as rice and anti-North leaflets, usually by balloon over the heavily fortified border or in bottles by sea.
North Korea said it has been angered by the defectors and to mark its displeasure it has in the past week severed inter-Korean hotlines and is threatening to close a liaison office between the two governments.
As part of the effort to improve ties with the North, South Korean President Moon Jae-in's administration has sought to discourage the leaflet and rice campaigns, and defectors have complained of pressure to avoid criticism of North Korea.
Analysts say North Korea appears to using the leaflet issue to increase pressure on South Korea amid stalled denuclearisation talks.
""The leaflets are an excuse or justification to raise the ante, manufacture a crisis, and bully Seoul to get what it wants,"" said Duyeon Kim, a senior advisor at the International Crisis Group, a Belgium-based independent non-profit organisation. 
Pyongyang feels betrayed and misled by Seoul’s prediction that the United States would lift some sanctions in exchange for North Korea closing its nuclear reactor site, and is upset that leaflets and U.S.-South Korea military drills continue, Kim said.

""They’re upset that Seoul has done nothing to change the environment and is again telling Seoul to stay out of its nuclear talks with Washington,"" she added.

The contract is for up to 400 million doses of the vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford, the company said, adding that it was looking to expand manufacturing of the vaccine, which it pledged to provide for no profit during the pandemic. 
""With our European supply chain due to begin production
soon, we hope to make the vaccine available widely and rapidly,"" Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in a statement.
The experimentation phase of the vaccine is already advanced and expected to end in the autumn, Italian Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. 
AstraZeneca has agreed manufacturing deals globally to meet its target of producing 2 billion doses of the vaccine, including with two ventures backed by Bill Gates and a $1.2 billion agreement with the U.S. government.
There are no approved vaccines or treatments for COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.
""Many countries in the world have already secured vaccines, Europe has not yet. The rapid coordinated action of a group of member states will create added value for all EU citizens in this crisis,"" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said.

International flights to and from the country's main airports will resume on June 15, after a nearly three-month lockdown. Accounting for about 20% of Greece's economic output, tourism is vital for the Mediterranean nation, which emerged from a decade-long debt crisis in 2018. 
""It is a great pleasure to be here in Santorini... to send a message: Greece is ready to welcome tourists this summer by putting their safety and their health as a number one priority,"" Mitsotakis said.
Famous for its sunsets and black sandy beaches, the volcanic island draws millions of tourists each year. 
Greece has boosted numbers of medical staff on its popular islands. Mitsotakis, wearing a surgical mask, also visited health facilities and doctors on Santorini.
The country will conduct coronavirus tests on all visitors arriving from airports deemed high-risk by the European Union's aviation safety agency EASA from Monday. Visitors will be quarantined up to 14 days, depending on the test result. 
Passengers arriving from all other airports will be randomly tested. 
About 33 million tourists visited Greece last year, generating revenues of 19 billion euros.

Restrictions on movement imposed in March helped Greece contain the spread of COVID-19 infections to just above 3,000 cases, a relatively low number compared with elsewhere in the European Union. But it brought its business and tourism sector to a virtual standstill and the country now expects its economy to shrink by up to 13 percent this year.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - The lower house of Nepal's parliament on Saturday approved a new map of the country, including areas disputed with India, the speaker of the national legislature said.
The move signals a hardening of Nepal's position over a decades-long border row that has strained ties between the South Asian neighbours. 
India has rejected Nepal's new map, calling it an ""unilateral act"" that is not based on historical facts or evidence. 
Nepal published its revised map in May after India inaugurated a 80 km (50 miles) road connecting its northern Uttarakhand state with Lipulekh on the border with Tibet that passes through the land Nepal says belongs to it.
The map shows a sliver of land on the northwest tip of Nepal as the Nepali territory. 
Agni Prasad Sapkota, Speaker of Nepal's House of Representatives, said the new map was approved by 258 out of 275 members of parliament, exceeding the required two thirds majority. There were no votes against.
The map must also be passed by the National Assembly, the parliament's upper chamber, and approved by President Bidhya Devi Bhandari before it becomes a part of the constitution.
Prachanda, a former prime minister and chief of the ruling Nepal Communist Party, said Nepal did not want to complicate the matter and seeks a peaceful settlement.
""We want to resolve the issue with India through peaceful talks at the political and diplomatic levels,"" Prachanda, the former Maoist rebel chief, who still goes by his war nom de guerre, said in parliament on Saturday.
There was no immediate comment from India on the parliamentary vote.

It was the queen's first official public appearance since the country went into lockdown in late March. 
The 94-year-old queen watched a series of drills by the 1st Battalion Welsh Guards in the castle's quadrangle, instead of the Trooping the Colour event that traditionally marks the occasion.
The queen, who has been living with her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip at the castle west of London, has issued a number of rallying messages to the nation in the past three months, including televised addresses that have been a rarity during her 68-year reign. 
But she had not been seen in public until Saturday, when dressed in a jade coat and wearing a diamond Welsh Guards brooch, she observed soldiers adhering to the 2-metre social distancing rule, and listened to music performed by a Band of the Household Division. 
Earlier this week, Buckingham Palace released a new photograph of the royal couple to celebrate Philip's birthday. The gun salutes in London that normally celebrate that occasion were also cancelled.

The queen's actual birthday is April 21, but her birthday is officially marked in June.

LONDON (Reuters) - Anti-racism protesters rallied around Britain on Saturday, with scuffles breaking out in London where counter-demonstrators also came out to protect monuments targeted for their links to colonial history. 
Statues of historical figures including Winston Churchill - Britain's World War Two leader whom protesters call a xenophobe - were boarded up to try and minimize trouble.
In Trafalgar Square (NYSE:SQ), police separated two groups of about 100 people each, one chanting ""Black Lives Matter"", the other racial slurs. Some groups jostled, tossed bottles and cans and set off fireworks, as riot police lined up. 
Demonstrations have been taking place around the world over the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
In Britain, debate is raging over monuments to those involved in the nation's imperialist past, especially after the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was torn down and thrown into the harbour of Bristol port last weekend. 
Police said on Saturday that some people were bringing weapons to the London rallies. They imposed route restrictions on both groups and said rallies must end by 5 p.m. (1600 GMT).
""Anyone who thinks they can commit a crime or vandalise property will be arrested,"" Commander Bas Javid said in a statement.
'MY CULTURE UNDER ATTACK'
In and around Parliament Square, hundreds of people wearing football shirts, chanting ""England, England"", and describing themselves as patriots, gathered alongside military veterans to guard the Cenotaph war memorial. 
The group sang songs in support of right-wing activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, who goes by the name of Tommy Robinson.
""Winston Churchill, he's one of our own,"" they also chanted, near his statue which last weekend was sprayed with graffiti reading: ""Churchill was a racist"".
""My culture is under attack. This is my culture and my English history: why should Churchill be boarded up? Why is the Cenotaph attacked? It is not right,"" said David Allen, one of the protesters. 
About two miles away, around 20 anti-racism protesters gathered at Hyde Park, holding Black Lives Matter placards, even though organisers had told them not to attend fearing clashes. 

Hundreds of people also attended rallies in major northern English cities like Liverpool and Newcastle, with many protesters donning masks due to the coronavirus pandemic.

BRZEG, Poland (Reuters) - Poland's president compared LGBT ""ideology"" to communist doctrine in a campaign speech on Saturday, as LGBT rights become a hotly debated issue ahead of a June 28 presidential election in the staunchly Catholic country. 
President Andrzej Duda is an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS), which dismisses the promotion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights as a foreign influence undermining Poland's traditional values.
On Wednesday, Duda introduced a ""Family Card"" of election proposals, including a vow to not allow gay couples to marry or adopt children and to ban teaching about LGBT issues in schools.
""My parents' generation for forty years fought to eliminate communist ideology from schools, so it couldn't be forced on children. So youth, children, soldiers and youth organizations couldn't be indoctrinated,"" Duda told a rally in the southwestern town of Brzeg. 
""They didn't fight for this so that a new ideology would appear that is even more destructive.""
Opposition candidates and LGBT rights groups condemned Duda's speech. 
Love Does Not Exclude, a Polish rights group, told Reuters Duda's proposals were similar to the Russian government's decision to ban ""homosexual propaganda"". 
The Left's presidential candidate, Robert Biedron, the first Polish politician to openly identify as gay, called on Duda to ""be done with this hatred"" in a tweet posted after the speech. 

Poland is a former satellite state of the Soviet Union and was the first country to shed communism in the region in 1989. This year the country was voted the worst in the European Union for LGBT rights in a poll by Brussels-based NGO ILGA-Europe.

""There have been people like my dad and Aunty Mingelly who have been pushing for change since they were my age - you know that was 50 years ago,"" Jacinta Taylor, an organiser of the protest in Perth, told the rally. 
""I don't want to be having to be 80 years old and pushing for this kind of change for my children and my children's children.""

Cook said in a statement his wife was a private citizen and made her own personal choices. ""That's one of the many reasons why I love her,"" he said. ""I have great sympathy for the cause of ensuring Aboriginal people and minorities are protected from racism.""

Protesters also gathered in small numbers in Melbourne and Sydney, calling for freedom for refugees stuck in indefinite detention.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ""How dark! No! How ugly!"" a Mexican social media star exclaimed after accidentally using a filter that darkened her face during a live broadcast on Instagram, reigniting the country's longstanding debate about racism. 
The remarks by Barbara de Regil, a popular actress in movies and soap operas, came as Mexicans are engaging in their own conversations about racism after the death in the United States of George Floyd, an African American, under the knee of a white police officer. 
In Mexico, the debate has centered on discrimination against indigenous groups, who have long suffered from poverty, isolation and a lack of representation in politics and popular culture.
With many Mexicans still confined to their homes by the coronavirus pandemic, the discussion has played out largely online.
Amid the backlash to de Regil's remarks, some fans rushed to her defense, saying she had made an innocent mistake. Others called for people to stop following her on social media.
""We will not tolerate more racism. Neither in Mexico nor the world,"" one user wrote on Twitter, proclaiming that the actress was ""CANCELLED.""
The video is no longer available on de Regil's Instagram page. Neither de Regil or Instagram responded to a request for comment.
The success of Yalitza Aparicio, the indigenous Mexican star of the Oscar-winning 2018 film Roma, has helped bring conversations about race and ethnicity to the fore. She stands in stark contrast to the pale women and men with European features who dominate Mexican television and film, though they represent only a sliver of the country's overwhelmingly mestizo and indigenous population.
The actress, who was disparaged by a telenovela actor using crude and racially-charged language even as she was being feted during last year's award season, has spoken out in recent days about the importance of amplifying indigenous voices.
""Our voice is less heard because of our skin color,"" she said Thursday in a virtual event organized by the magazine GQ.
WIDESPREAD DISCRIMINATION
Roughly a quarter of Mexico's population is indigenous, and at least 7 million people speak an indigenous language, according to official data.
The isolation and poverty that indigenous people suffer was brought to international attention in the 1990s by the leftist Zapatista rebellion. But little progress has been made.
A recent study by global aid charity Oxfam found Mexicans who identify as indigenous and have darker skin tones suffer greater disadvantages.
Many Mexicans also face discrimination because of their dress, weight, height, religious beliefs and sexual preferences, experts say. 
According to a 2017 survey by the National Statistics Institute and the National Council to Prevent Discrimination (Conapred), 20% of respondents said they had experienced discrimination in the last 12 months.

""As in the United States, in Mexico there is a lot of discrimination and racism. No one here is exempt from being discriminated against,"" said Susana Reyes, who last week participated in a small demonstration in Mexico City over Floyd's death.

""This is the time to work on a clear project to come out of the crisis,"" Conte said in the opening speech of a nine-day policy consultation in Rome.
""We must take advantage (of the situation) to turn the crisis into an opportunity, and remove all the obstacles that have slowed (Italy) down,"" he added. 
Conte said his coalition government was preparing a plan of reforms to simplify bureaucracy, push digital investments and green energy, improve education, support the poorest and bring more women into the workforce.
Italy's government expects the national economy to contract by at least 8% this year. The country is among the worst-hit by the coronavirus in Europe, having reported more than 236,000 cases and more than 34,000 deaths.
Addressing Italian policymakers at the congress via video-link, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Italy must deliver planned reforms to access money from EU funds to help pull the country out of its coronavirus-induced slump.
""As we invest to shape the economy of the future, we must also work on ambitious reforms... Reforms will lead to recovery. And reforms need your leadership and ownership,"" von der Leyen said. 
The Commission has proposed a 750-billion euro recovery fund to help kickstart growth on the continent, which will be debated by EU leaders next week.
Italy is set to be the largest beneficiary, based on the Commission's proposed criteria for distributing the cash, expecting some 170 billion euros from the new fund.
Von der Leyen said that ""with the right reforms"", Italy can make the most of the EU funds, pointing to promises made by Conte to cut red tape, reform the country's tax system and deliver a more effective judicial system.

The EU also wants guarantees that countries will spend EU money in line with the bloc's priorities to shift to a greener economy and improve digital infrastructure.

After gradually relaxing its lockdown since mid-April, Iran has seen a sharp rise of new daily infections in recent weeks.
While compliance with health protocols was as high as 80% percent a month ago, it is now down to 20%, Rouhani said in a televised speech. He blamed the surge on travellers spreading the coronavirus to previously low risk provinces.
With 2,410 new cases on Saturday, the total has reached 184,955. With the death of 71 people in the past 24 hours, total fatalities stand at 8,730, the health ministry said.
Rouhani expressed concern about mass prayers at the recently opened Imam Reza shrine, Iran’s largest Shia Muslim religious complex in the northeast of the country.
""If there is no cooperation, we will have to reimpose the restrictions,"" Rouhani said, adding that adherence to the health protocols were needed ""in order to keep businesses open"".
Tehran faced stiff resistance from hard line clerics before it succeeded in closing holy shrines in mid-March. The closure sparked demonstrations with angry crowds storming the shrines of Imam Reza in Mashhad and Fatemeh Massoumeh in Qom.

Shia pilgrims from all over the world visit the shrines, which may have contributed to the initial spread of the virus.

The bill, opposed by human rights activists who fear it could be used to suppress free speech and harass those who challenge the government, is awaiting Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's signature.
Though the country's compliance with global rules had improved, the Anti-Money Laundering Council said, it must pass and show it could implement tougher measures to combat terrorism before the observation period set by the intergovernmental Financial Action Task Force expires in February. 
Failure to do so, it said, could lead to the Philippines being included in the global watchdog's grey list, which could hurt the economy, already reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""The Philippines' inclusion in the grey list will result in an additional layer of scrutiny from regulators and financial institutions,"" the council said in a statement, adding it will also put at risk the country's goal of getting an ""A"" credit rating. 
Duterte, who has drawn international criticism for his war on drugs and his human rights record, had been criticised for prioritising the passage of the anti-terrorism bill over an economic stimulus package to counter the impact of the pandemic.
But the council said, ""Fighting terrorism is just as urgent because it also concerns protecting life"".

While its main focus was to show solidarity with anti-racism protests triggered around the world by the death in police custody last month of African-American George Floyd, organisers also wanted to draw attention to some of Taiwan's own problems.
Savungaz Valincinan, an ethnic Bunun from central Taiwan, took to the stage to detail the difficult past of indigenous Taiwanese, who make up less than 3% of the island's population, and call for broad opposition to any form of discrimination.
While indigenous Taiwanese ""might not face as direct threats to our lives or fear like black Americans face in the United States"", many in Taiwanese society discriminate against them, for example by refusing to rent accommodation to indigenous people, said Savungaz, from the group Indigenous Youth Front.
""We don't want any special treatment. What we want are the most basic rights that we deserve as human beings,"" she said to loud applause.
""We are coming out today to support this movement not because of sympathy - it is because we have also gone through the hurt of being discriminated against.""
While Taiwan has made huge strides in recent years to protect indigenous people's culture and languages and ensure they are treated fairly, many still complain of ingrained prejudice.
The presidential office said last month it had received a letter suggesting Kolas Yotaka - a spokeswoman for President Tsai Ing-wen and an ethnic Amis - use her ""Chinese name"" rather than her ""English"" name. 

Kolas responded by pointing out she had the legal right to be referred to in her indigenous language.

Pompeo was planning the trip ""quietly"" and the arrangements were not yet finalized, Politico said. 
Pompeo has been vocal in criticizing China on a range of issues from the origins of the coronavirus pandemic to its Hong Kong policy to the treatment of its ethnic and religious minorities, 
The U.S. State Department and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Hong Kong's South China Morning Post newspaper cited an unidentified source as saying that Yang, a state councilor and member of the Communist Party Politburo, will represent the Chinese side for the meeting.
Relations between the countries have deteriorated in recent months, and U.S. President Donald Trump has said he could even sever relations.
Pompeo said last month that China could have prevented the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people around the world by being more transparent about the coronavirus and accused it of refusing to share information.
He also said Chinese plans to impose national security laws on Hong Kong would be the ""death knell"" for the former British colony's autonomy.

Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said it was providing consular assistance to the man, without identifying him.
Australian and Chinese media have identified the man as Cam Gillespie, arrested seven years ago on charges of drug trafficking in southern China.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday. Attempts to reach Gillespie's family were unsuccessful.
""We are deeply saddened to hear of the verdict made in his case,"" the Australian foreign affairs department said in an emailed statement to Reuters.
""Australia opposes the death penalty, in all circumstances for all people. We support the universal abolition of the death penalty and are committed to pursuing this goal through all the avenues available to us."" 
Cam Gillespie was arrested in 2013 with more than 7.5 kg (17 pounds) of methamphetamine in his check-in luggage while attempting to board an international flight from Baiyun Airport in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, according to several media reports. 
Diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Canberra have worsened since Australia called for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the new coronavirus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
China has in recent weeks banned Australian beef imports and imposed tariffs on Australian barley. It has also urged Chinese tourists to avoid Australia.
The death sentence for drug smuggling is not uncommon in China, where executions are usually carried out by firing squad.
Last year, the country sentenced two Canadians to death for drug-related crimes following the arrest of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou and said it was “not worried in the slightest” by mounting international concern over the verdict.

(Reuters) - Police in California on Friday said a young black man found hanging from a tree likely committed suicide, stirring outrage among community members who said authorities were too quick to draw conclusions about what could have been a hate crime.
The reaction to the death of 24-year-old Robert Fuller showed how high tensions around race and policing are running in the United States after George Floyd died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department (LASD) was still investigating the death of Fuller, who was found by a passerby hanging from a tree a block from the city hall in Palmdale, around 30 miles north of Los Angeles, at about 3:40 a.m. on Wednesday.
Captain Ron Shaffer told a televised community meeting on Friday that it appeared Fuller ""died by suicide."" 
That comment drew an angry response and chants of ""speak the truth"" and ""no peace,"" with audience members demanding to know why LASD called it a suicide when the coroner's report said the case had been ""deferred pending additional investigation."" 
On social media, the hashtag #JusticeforRobertFuller trended on Twitter with users calling for a full investigation of what some speculated was a cover-up of a lynching.
Palmdale City Manager JJ Murphy said in a statement on Thursday he received confirmation Fuller's death was a suicide. He did not give details, but said many people in the community were ""suffering extreme mental anguish"" during the coronavirus pandemic.
A GoFundMe page set up by Fuller's family to cover funeral expenses had raised more than $110,000 by Friday afternoon. A message on it read ""Thank you for standing with us during this difficult time.""

Mexico City and the adjacent urban sprawl are home to more than 21 million people, and the region accounts for more than 40% of some 139,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country. On Friday Mexico reported a record of more than 5,000 new cases.
""We think next week the city can begin a process of very orderly transition,"" said Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, noting there had been a slight drop in hospital occupancy rates and that the city's contagion alert level was close to coming down a notch.
Curbs on vehicle traffic and public transport are due to be eased on Monday and factories will start opening on Tuesday under strict sanitary protections, the city government said.
On Thursday, small shops will have permission to reopen, while professional services and scientific workers linked to ""industry"" can go back as of Friday, it added.

If conditions are deemed suitable, street markets and the historic center of the city will reopen the week of June 22-28.

At the Berlin Wall, a large portrait of Floyd is seen alongside yellow block letters spelling ""I CAN'T BREATHE,"" words he repeated before dying as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The May 25 incident, captured on video, prompted widespread protests across the United States and in other countries. The case was ruled a homicide by medical examiners, and Derek Chauvin, the white officer was charged with second-degree murder.
Syrian artist Aziz Asmar said he wanted to send a message of solidarity through his mural.
""After witnessing the increased racism against black people in the United States, and because it is our duty to stand with all humanitarian causes around the world, we painted today on a wall destroyed by Assad planes in Idlib,"" said Asmar, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Asmar said the images of Floyd reminded him of those of Syrian children killed by suspected chemical attacks in Damascus and Khan Sheykhoun.
In Afghanistan, a blast wall in Kabul was the canvas for Mehr Aqa Sultani, of arts activist group ArtLords.
""George Floyd is a global figure now and he was killed in the United States because of the blackness of his skin,"" he said. ""We want to say 'no' to discrimination because discrimination has no benefit for us.""
In Paris, street artist Dugudus depicted U.S. President Donald Trump as a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck while holding a Bible.
The mural referred to Trump's photo op in front of St John's Church in Washington last week, after police forcefully removed protesters in a nearby park to clear the area for him.
In Pakistan, where elaborately painted trucks are a common sight, Karachi-based artist Haider Ali, 40, painted Floyd on the wall of his house - until he can return to his usual moving canvas.
""I painted these candles and I made these flowers as garland around his neck to pay him tribute,"" said Ali, who is raring to paint on trucks again to spread the message of Floyd's death.

Protests erupted on Thursday in several Lebanese cities after a crash in the pound currency, which has lost about 70% of its value since October, when Lebanon was plunged into a financial crisis that has brought mounting hardship.
The pound appeared to halt its slide on Friday after a government announcement that the central bank would inject dollars into the market on Monday.
Protesters, however, returned later on Friday for a second night, throwing fireworks and stones at security forces in central Beirut and the northern city of Tripoli, prompting them to spray tear gas and rubber bullets to push them back.
The unrest comes as Beirut holds talks with the International Monetary Fund for a reform programme it hopes will secure billions of dollars in financing and put its economy back on track.

The crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and waste, has brought soaring food prices, unemployment and capital controls that have severed Lebanese from their hard currency savings.

KISUMU (Reuters) - Hundreds of Kenyans defied tear gas and riot police on Friday to carry off the body of a popular singer, trying to prevent a swift burial under rules for suspected coronavirus cases which the crowd said would be disrespectful. 
Mourners and fans of Bernard Obonyo, whose stage name is Abenny Jachiga, swarmed the cemetery, preventing the singer's funeral from taking place in Kisumu city in western Kenya.
The region has a tradition of lavish, well-attended funerals, but rules imposed for suspected cases of COVID-19 infection require bodies to be buried within 24 hours of death with only five relatives in attendance. 
Police fired teargas to disperse the crowd, which removed the body from the graveyard and took it to a mortuary.
Obonbyo, 33, died on June 11. His brother told Kenyan daily newspaper the Daily Nation that the singer was suffering from severe chest and abdominal pains, difficulty breathing and had been vomiting blood. The family and the authorities have not said whether he had been tested for the novel coronavirus.
Obonyo's family are now asking for a week to organise a proper funeral for the star. 
""As a family we are requesting, give us one week, let the fans plan, let the music industry plan,"" said George Oningu, the singer's brother-in-law.

VINCENTE CAMALOTE, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican soccer teammates of Alexander Martinez, a 16-year-old whose murder this week was blamed on police, mobbed his wooden coffin this week after kicking a ball off it and bouncing it into the goal so he could score one final time.
After one last match on home ground in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, Martinez was buried in his home village of Vicente Camalote on Thursday. A dozen teammates participated in the moving farewell on a plaza pitch where he used to play.
It was not immediately clear what caused the death of the teenager, a dual U.S.-Mexico citizen who returned from the United States four years ago. Local media reported he went out to buy soda on Tuesday afternoon and was shot dead by police in an apparent case of mistaken identity.
His death came after several other police killings in Mexico, fanning rage over rights abuses by police in a nation where authorities have long faced accusations of torturing, abducting and even killing citizens.
There have been street protests in the country's two biggest cities, the capital Mexico City and Guadalajara, inspired by similar demonstrations in the United States in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd, a black man.
The emotional funeral service was attended by about 300 people, a Reuters witness said. Video of the final winning ""goal"" by Martinez has gone viral on Mexican social media.
Flowers were later draped over his coffin along with two soccer shirts, including a yellow jersey of French soccer champions Paris Saint-Germain and blue and white stripes of Mexican outfit C.F. Monterrey. Martinez played for a team affiliated with Monterrey. 
Oaxaca State Governor Alejandro Murat promised to investigate. ""In Oaxaca, the law will apply, without hesitation, for those responsible for Alexander's (NYSE:ALX) case,"" he said on Twitter. 

Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said on Twitter she was also following the case.

SÃO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil has excluded complaints of police violence from an annual human rights report, sparking allegations on Friday of a cover-up amid global outrage over racial injustice and use of excessive force by law enforcement. 
Alleged incidents of police abuse are collected from a hotline in Brazil, with the data previously going into a broad report compiled by the federal government. But unlike 2017 or 2018, the information was absent from the 2019 edition - the first year of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's term in office.
Brazil ranks among the world's deadliest countries. Although the number of homicides has fallen for two years in a row, there were still over 40,000 murders in 2019.
Bolsonaro, a former army captain, campaigned for president on a law-and-order platform. He has repeatedly backed police crackdowns on criminality, drugs and gangland violence. Criminals should ""die like cockroaches,"" he has said.
Protests in cities around the world and across Brazil following the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in the U.S. city of Minneapolis on May 25, have refocused attention on the issue of police violence in Latin America's largest country.
The 2019 human rights report, published on May 21, made no mention of the excluded material. It went unnoticed until the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper flagged the missing information in a report on Friday.
The Ministry of Women, Family and Human Rights, responsible for publishing the report, said in a statement the information was left out for technical reasons. 
There were ""inconsistencies that were identified in its records"" and require ""in-depth study"" for disclosure at a later date, the ministry said.
Critics see things differently. 
""This government has huge difficulty with transparency,"" said Renato Sérgio de Lima, president of the Brazilian Forum of Public Security - a nongovernmental research group which collates detailed records on violence. 
""It was not published (the information) out of a political, ideological choice,"" he added. ""If it had been due to technical questions it would have been explained in the methodological notes.""
The outrage about the report comes the same week that Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the Health Ministry to restore detailed data on coronavirus deaths and infections that had been taken down amid allegations Bolsonaro's government was trying to mask the severity of the outbreak, now the second largest in the world.
""(Bolsonaro) does not think police violence violates human rights. He thinks that all police action is legal, legitimate and necessary, and that anyone who complains is a criminal,"" said Rio de Janeiro state prosecutor Andrea Amin, who investigates murders committed by police.
In Rio, a notoriously violent police force killed 1,814 people last year, according to official statistics. They killed 606 more in the first four months of 2020. 
One of those killings, on May 18, of 14-year-old João Pedro Matos Pinto led to protests in Rio.

Brazil's Supreme Court has since banned raids by Rio police during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The countries along Congo's eastern border have long been conduits for gold worth billions of dollars mined using rudimentary means by so-called ""artisanal"" miners.
Difficult to trace, trade in the precious metal has fueled regional wars, funded rebel fighters and led to UN sanctions on traders involved in a bid to staunch the flow.
North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri provinces reported official production of just over 60kg of artisanal gold in 2019, yet exported a total of just over 73kg, the UN Group of Experts on the Congo found in its annual report.
The group estimated that at least 1.1 tonnes of gold were smuggled out of Ituri province alone in 2019. That would have earned the government up to $1.88 million in taxes had it been legally exported.
Across all gold-producing provinces the loss is likely much greater. Artisanal miners in Congo produce 15 to 22 tonnes of gold a year, Germany's Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources has estimated.
""The country remained one of the Great Lakes region's largest artisanal gold producers, and yet one of its smallest official exporters,"" the Group of Experts wrote.
Asked by Reuters about the report, Congo's mines minister, Willy Kitobo Samsoni, said he could not immediately share his figures on mineral smuggling from the east of the country.
The UN experts also found that Uganda and other neighbouring countries export far more gold than they produce, suggesting they might still be staging posts for smuggled Congolese gold.
More than 95% of gold exports from Uganda in 2019, which totaled just over 25 tonnes, were not of Ugandan origin, the group estimated, based on 2018 production and 2019 export data.
Uganda's gold exports more than doubled in 2019 compared with the previous year, central bank data showed in March.
Uganda's energy minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

Smugglers told the Group of Experts that Kampala was a main trading hub for gold from Ituri. Smuggled gold from South Kivu went to Burundi, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates, and Tanzania, the report added.

OTTAWA/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday that newly released video showing a forceful arrest of a Canadian indigenous leader was ""shocking,"" saying it raised serious questions.
Chief Allan Adam of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation alleged last week that Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) beat him in March during an incident involving an expired licence plate.
This week, Adam's lawyer filed RCMP dashboard video in a court application to stay legal proceedings for resisting arrest and assaulting police.
In the 12-minute video, obtained by news outlets including Reuters, Adam approaches a police car parked behind him outside a Fort McMurray, Alberta, casino to complain of harassment. When the officer repeatedly orders him back to his truck, Adam warns that the two of them are going to have a problem.
Later, Adam exits his truck swearing, removes his jacket and assumes a fighting stance. 
After he leaves the vehicle a final time, he is held by one officer while a second tackles him to the ground. One of the officers then punches him in the face.
Adam is cuffed and led away bleeding.
""We have all now seen the shocking video of Chief Adam's arrest, and we must get to the bottom of this,"" Trudeau said in Ottawa. ""I have serious questions about what happened.""
RCMP was not immediately available for comment, but Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, who oversees the RCMP, said he would follow the investigation closely.
The RCMP, which previously reviewed the video, has said the use of force was reasonable. An independent Alberta agency has begun an investigation.
There have been global protests since the death in Minneapolis of a black man in police custody last month.
Indigenous people have also been outraged about two other recent incidents with Canadian police. 

Trudeau has said Canadian police should be equipped with body cameras.

In the report, seen by Reuters on Thursday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the Security Council that several items in U.S. seizures of weapons and related materiel in November 2019 and February 2020 were ""of Iranian origin"".
Iran's Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by state media that ""Iran denies allegations by the U.N. Secretariat that appear to have been made under political pressure from the U.S. and Saudi regimes"". 
""Interestingly, the ... report comes at a time when the United States is working to draft a dangerous resolution to extend an arms embargo against Iran,"" the statement said.
Iran on Wednesday called on Russia and China to resist a push by Washington to extend a U.N.-imposed arms embargo that is due to expire in October under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers.
U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew Washington from the deal in 2018 and his administration has been taking a harder line with the United Nations to extend and strengthen the embargo on Iran, saying lifting it would let Tehran acquire weapons that could fuel conflicts in the Middle East. 
Guterres said that in a May 22 letter, Iran's U.N. envoy said ""it has not been the policy of Iran to export weapons in violation of relevant arms embargoes of the Security Council"" and that it will ""continue to actively cooperate with the United Nations in this regard"". 

U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft has said she will circulate a draft resolution to extend the arms embargo on Iran soon. If Washington is unsuccessful, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under the nuclear deal, even though it quit the accord. Diplomats say Washington would likely face a tough, messy battle.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday it was ""absurd and shameful"" that a statue of Winston Churchill was at risk of attack by activists, his strongest statement yet on growing protests against the legacies of past leaders.
Anti-racism protesters, who have staged demonstrations since the death of African American George Floyd, have put statues at the forefront of their challenge to Britain's imperialist past. 
Politicians, police and activists sought to dissuade people from coming to Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) on Saturday, where statues were boarded up ahead of possible protests.
A statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from the slave trade, was torn down in the city of Bristol on Sunday, and authorities have acted to protect monuments they believe could be next.
They have now boarded up a statue opposite parliament of Churchill, Britain's prime minister during World War Two, after demonstrators defaced it last weekend.
""It is absurd and shameful that this national monument should today be at risk of attack by violent protesters,"" Johnson wrote on Twitter.
On Friday, around 500 people gathered in London's Hyde Park chanting ""the UK is not innocent"" and ""Black Lives Matter"", before marching through central London, with many saying that statues such as Colston's were legitimate targets.
""If we have these big images, and we're telling people that these people and what they stood for is OK, we're just allowing everything that they did to pass,"" said Samantha Halsall, 23, a student at the protest.
Organisers told the protesters not to turn up in central London on Saturday amid concern that there could be altercations with counter-protestors looking to defend statues. 
London police chief Cressida Dick echoed that call.
""It's clear that we're in the middle of a public health crisis. So it's not safe for them, it's not safe for the people around them,"" she said.
""Secondly, we do have information that people are intent on coming to cause violence and confrontation.""
The opposition Labour party warned that the weekend was likely to see ""major challenges"" and that far-right activists might ""exploit the situation and sow hate for their own divisive ends.""
Far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon said he would not turn up to the square on Saturday as he did not want to be responsible for more racial division.
Johnson is an admirer and biographer of Churchill, and some of those close to him say he wants to emulate him. 
But Churchill expressed racist and anti-Semitic views and critics blame him for denying food to India during the 1943 famine which killed more than two million people - aspects of his legacy which some say are not scrutinised enough.
""Yes, he sometimes expressed opinions that were and are unacceptable to us today, but he was a hero, and he fully deserves his memorial,"" Johnson wrote, calling on people to avoid the protests.

""We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history.""

Ireland's High Court approved the handover to Britain of Ronan Hughes, 40, on charges of manslaughter and immigration offences.
A separate court dismissed an appeal against extradition by Eamonn Harrison, 23, who also faces human trafficking charges.
The discovery of the bodies in the back of a refrigerated truck highlighted how poor citizens of Asia, Africa and the Middle East pay large sums to middlemen to make perilous, illicit journeys to the West.
Northern Irish truck driver Maurice Robinson pleaded guilty to 39 counts of manslaughter related to the deaths in March.
The victims, 31 men and boys and eight women whose ages ranged from 15 to 44, were discovered in October in a container at the back of a truck driven by Robinson to an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 30 km east of London.
Ireland's High Court heard that UK authorities allege that Hughes organised the drivers and travel. They also alleged in a separate case last year that Harrison delivered the trailer in which the people were found to a Belgian port before its onward journey to Britain. 
Irish broadcaster RTE reported that Hughes asked to be handed over to the UK authorities as soon as possible.

Neither Harrison nor Hughes have yet to enter a plea in relation to the substance of the allegations as their hearings have only concerned extradition.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday appeared skeptical of the Justice Department's unprecedented effort to drop a criminal case against President Donald Trump's former adviser Michael Flynn, signaling no quick end to the politically charged prosecution.
U.S. Circuit Judge Karen Henderson, an appointee of President George H.W. Bush, said the lower-court judge overseeing the case was not a ""rubber stamp"" and there was nothing wrong with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan hearing arguments about whether to let the Justice Department drop the case.
Flynn twice pleaded guilty to the charge the Justice Department is now trying to drop.
Lawyers for the Justice Department and Flynn argued that Sullivan had trampled on the executive branch's powers.
Attorney General William Barr ordered the department last month to dismiss the case against Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, following pressure from Trump and his allies, leading to criticism that Barr was using his office to help the president's political allies.
""We are here now today stop further impermissible intrusion into the sole power of the executive branch,"" said Sidney Powell, a lawyer for Flynn. 
U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Wilkins, an appointee of President Barack Obama, asked skeptical questions of Powell. Wilkins suggested that under the court's precedent Sullivan could conduct an ""independent evaluation"" of whether to drop the Flynn case.
Jeff Wall, a Justice Department lawyer, said Sullivan's handling of the case had harmed the integrity of the executive branch and the judiciary.
""This has already become, and I think is only becoming more of, a public spectacle,"" Wall said.
Beth Wilkinson, an attorney retained to represent Sullivan, argued it would be premature to force Sullivan to act before he has weighed all the facts before ruling.
""All this court is doing is getting advice,"" she said.
The unusual nature of the case has drawn national attention, with 27,000 people listening to the arguments online.
Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, was one of several former Trump aides charged under former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Flynn twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's then-ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. 
Flynn switched lawyers to pursue a new scorched-earth tactic that accused the FBI of entrapping him, and asked the judge to dismiss the charge.
Sullivan refused to go along and tapped retired Judge John Gleeson to present arguments for why the charge should not be dismissed.
U.S. Circuit Judge Neomi Rao, who was appointed by Trump, appeared skeptical about whether Sullivan has authority to sentence Flynn when prosecutors want to drop the case.
""Where the government decided to drop a prosecution and the defendant agrees ... who are they arguing on behalf of?"" she asked Wilkinson.
Henderson appeared to defend Sullivan's decision to tap Gleeson, noting that it may be premature for the appeals court to get involved.

""He may say ... you know, I asked for advice and I'm ignoring it,"" Henderson said. ""Shouldn't he be allowed to do that?""

Lina Mendoni said Tuesday’s ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had set a precedent and recognised countries' sovereign right to call for the return of artefacts. However the court has left unresolved the fundamental issue of who owns the horse.
The Greek government wrote to Sotheby’s auction house in 2018 asking it to stop a sale of the 8th century BC statue, saying it was Greek national property, according to the text of the appeals court ruling.
Later that year, Sotheby’s and descendants of art collectors Howard and Saretta Barnet took the unusual step of suing the Greek Ministry of Culture and Sports in the U.S. courts, seeking a declaration that the family owned the horse and that Sotheby’s could sell it. 
A year later, a US judge rejected Greece’s effort to dismiss that lawsuit. But the appeal court ruled on Tuesday that Greece had been pursuing its sovereign rights, not commercial interests, when making the claim. So under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, Greece could not face such a lawsuit.
The appeals court did not rule on who owned the statue. 
Culture Minister Mendoni told Reuters TV: ""Greece has clearly achieved a huge victory - a legal precedent, a judicial precedent, has already been created, and through Greece, it favours all countries from which cultural goods are illegally exported.
""In the same decision, it is recognised that the claiming of cultural rights by a country, by Greece in this case, concerns a sovereign issue, an issue of sovereign rights. This is very, very important,"" she added. 
Sotheby’s said on Wednesday it was disappointed by the ruling. ""There is, and remains, no evidence to support Greece's claim to ownership of the bronze sculpture. We, together with our client, are reviewing next steps,” it said.
Greece has been waging campaigns for decades for the repatriation of antiquities it says have been stolen or illegally excavated. 

Its biggest is for the return of the Parthenon Marbles which are on display in the British Museum in London. The British Museum says the marbles were acquired legally.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday said he would cut funding for local governments that fail to adopt reforms addressing excess use of force and bias in their police departments by April 2021. 
Cuomo said he would sign an executive order limiting state funding to municipalities with laws mandating their police departments ""reinvent and modernize"" to battle systemic racism.
""That should be done in every police agency in this country,"" Cuomo told a press conference, after weeks of nationwide protests following the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis.
He spoke alongside the mothers of Eric Garner and Sean Bell, unarmed black Americans who died in confrontations with New York City police.
Garner's death on a Staten Island sidewalk came after a white officer used a deadly chokehold on him during a 2014 arrest. His dying words, “I can’t breathe!”, became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement decrying police killings of unarmed black people.
Floyd, 46, handcuffed and lying face down on a Minneapolis street while an officer knelt into the back of his neck for nearly nine minutes, also cried out “please, I can’t breathe,” before falling silent and still.
Cuomo also signed a bill on Friday to repeal a decades-old law that shielded police officers' disciplinary records from the public, part of a package of police reform measures advanced by the Democratic-controlled state legislature this week.
""If there's no trust, the community is not going to allow the police to police. And there is no trust, or there is a breach of the trust, and that has to be restored and repaired,"" Cuomo said.
Tying state dollars to ""systemic reform of police departments"" is the only way to achieve dramatic changes to battle racism that protesters have been urging for decades, he said.

""Sit down at the table with the local community, address these issues, get a plan, pass that plan by your local government. And if you don't you're not going to get any additional state funds.""

MINSK (Reuters) - The leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, on Friday accused his political rival Viktor Babariko of corruption but denied trying to block Babariko from standing against him in the presidential election in August. 
Lukashenko has ruled the eastern European country with an iron fist since 1994 but faces the biggest challenge to his authority in years, with thousands of people taking to the streets recently to support opposition candidates. 
Public frustration with Lukashenko's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and grievances about the economy and human rights have reinvigorated opposition to his rule. 
Babariko, seen as Lukashenko's most serious rival, is the former head of the local unit of Russia's Gazprombank, whose offices were raided on Thursday in a tax evasion case. 
Babariko, who denies allegations of corruption, said the raid was designed to put political pressure on him. Lukashenko denied that the criminal case was related to the election, but he said Babariko could not wash his hands of the allegations and blame other officials at the bank.
""What struck me most is that this scoundrel, I cannot call him otherwise, says: 'I have nothing to do with this. They are the ones to blame',"" Lukashenko was cited by the state news agency BelTA as saying. ""Look, they were not only his deputies. They are one gang.""
Belgazprombank said on Thursday that it was continuing normal operations and that its financial stability had not been affected. 
On Friday, Russian shareholders of the bank, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) and Gazprombank, published a joint statement, saying the management board of Belgazprombank had made new appointments on Thursday, calling the move ""illegal"".
They said the shareholders plan to defend their interests ""by all the available legal means"" and they are making efforts to ""safeguard financial stability of the bank"".

Russia and Belarus, usually seen as allies, have been engaged in a number of rows recently, including over oil and natural gas supplies.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will take airline passengers' temperatures before they fly and anyone with a fever will not be allowed to travel, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday.
""Temperature checks will not be detecting people with COVID-19,"" Trudeau said in a news conference. ""It's an extra layer of safety to encourage people who might feel sick to stay home and not put others at risk.""
The screening will be phased in, with those arriving in Canada being screened by the end of June, and then for those leaving the country as well as for domestic travelers at the country's four biggest airports by the end of July.
If a traveler is found to have a fever after two separate measurements 10 minutes apart, they will be asked to rebook after 14 days have passed, the transport minister said. 
Canada and the United States are set to extend a ban on non-essential travel to late July as both countries seek to control the spread of the coronavirus, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier this week.
Canada last week said it would require most airport workers and flight crews to wear non-medical masks.
The spread of the coronavirus has slowed in Canada in recent weeks, and all the provinces have begun to ease restrictions and open up for business again. As of Thursday, Canada had recorded 97,530 total cases and 7,994 deaths, up from 7,960 deaths a day earlier, official data show.
More than 80% of the deaths have been in long-term care facilities and nursing homes, prompting Ottawa to send the military to help out.

Also on Friday, Trudeau extended the military presence in long-term care homes in both Ontario and Quebec until June 26. When the military pulls out, the Canadian Red Cross will be moving in to help, Trudeau said.

BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (Reuters) - German and British investigators looking into the disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann 13 years ago are relying on hundreds of tips from the public to firm up evidence against Christian B., a suspected rapist they believe murdered her.
The 43-year-old German with a string of prior convictions was living in the Algarve region of Portugal when 3-year-old Madeleine vanished from her bedroom, sparking one of Europe's largest-ever missing person investigations.
His emergence as a suspect in recent weeks has brought a the case back to the front pages of British newspapers.
Cellular phone data places the suspect near the holiday home where Madeleine was sleeping when she disappeared while her parents were at a restaurant in the holiday resort.
But more evidence is needed to be certain of keeping him in the prison in Kiel where he is currently serving a sentence for drug dealing, Hans Christian Wolters, a prosecutor in the central German city of Braunschweig, told Reuters on Friday.
Police broadcast a televised appeal for information last week in the hope that members of the public might turn up evidence needed to bring charges. Since then police in Britain and Germany have received ""hundreds"" of tips, Wolters said.
""Our investigation has turned up some evidence that was reason enough for us to go to the public, but it is an open secret that our suspicions are not firm enough to issue an arrest warrant,"" he said.
Under German law, police have not released the suspect's surname and media in Germany are not permitted to report it, although it has appeared in some British media. Calls to lawyers representing the suspect were not answered.
Braunschweig prosecutors are leading the investigation because the city was the last place the suspect had a fixed abode in Germany.
Wolters said the investigation would be more difficult if the suspect is released. He has already served two-thirds of his sentence, meaning a court could free him any day now.
Prosecutors have prepared another warrant for his arrest in a separate case over the 2005 rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Algarve, but the suspect is challenging the validity of that warrant at an EU court.
Wolters declined to comment on a report in Der Spiegel magazine on Friday that police had inadvertently warned the suspect they were investigating him over the McCann case as far back as 2013.

""I can't say if those investigations were optimal or if there were any shortcomings,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Sexual activity among young American men has declined sharply since 2000, with nearly a third reporting no sex with a partner in the prior year, according to a survey study published on Friday that suggests social media and electronic gaming might be filling the void.
The trend is concerning as sexual relationships are important for well-being and health, researchers note. 
The survey found that from 2000 to 2018, nearly one in three U.S. men aged 18 to 24 reported no sexual activity in the past year. Lack of sexual activity, or sexual inactivity, was also on the rise among men and women aged 25 to 34 years during the survey period, the report in the journal JAMA Network Open found.
Possible reasons for the decline in sexual frequency may also include stress of juggling work and intimate relationships, as well as the prevalence of other forms of solo entertainment. 
""There are now many more choices of things to do in the late evening than there once were and fewer opportunities to initiate sexual activity if both partners are engrossed in social media, electronic gaming, or binge watching,"" Jean Twenge, from the department of psychology in San Diego State University said in an editorial accompanying the report. 
By analyzing biennial survey data between 2000 and 2018 from nearly 10,000 men and women aged 18 to 44 years, researchers found that 16.5% of respondents reported less sexual activity in 2016-2018 versus 9.5% in 2000-2002, mostly among unmarried, heterosexual men.
Sexual activity was largely unchanged among unmarried women, along with no notable decline among gay men, researchers reported.
Men who were unemployed or had lower income were more likely to be sexually inactive, as were men and women who were students.
Given a preference for men of higher socioeconomic status and the larger number of college-educated women than men, some young men may find it difficult to form heterosexual relationships, the researchers note.
""Higher income could mean more resources to search for partners and could be considered as more desirable by such partners,"" study co-author Peter Ueda of the Karolinska Institute in Sweden said in an email.
While outside the study period, the COVID-19 pandemic that has left many unemployed and fearful of infection is likely to exacerbate the trend. The consequences of the outbreak on sexual relationships is an issue that warrants monitoring, Ueda said.

""This is fake news,"" Krzysztof Szczerski, a top aide to the Polish president, told public radio on Friday.
The U.S. ambassador to Poland, Georgette Mosbacher, reacting with a tweet to the report, said negotiations remained on track.
""President Trump @POTUS & @Prezydentpl Duda's vision for increased US presence in Poland will be even greater than originally outlined. Announcement coming soon.""
Mosbacher and the U.S. Embassy in Poland were not immediately available for comment to elaborate on the timing of the announcement and what the new plans would look like.
The State Department had no immediate comment.
A spokesman for Reuters said the company stood behind its reporting which accurately reflected the situation at the time.
Reuters was unable on Friday to determine what fresh efforts, if any, had been made since Wednesday's report to advance the negotiations and resolve major outstanding issues such as funding.
A year ago, Polish President Andrzej Duda and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed that an additional 1,000 U.S. troops would be stationed in Poland. Six locations were shortlisted for the troops when Vice President Mike Pence visited Warsaw in September.
The Reuters report published on Wednesday cited government officials in Washington and Warsaw saying they still could not agree where the troops should be stationed, and how much of the multi-billion-dollar deployment Warsaw should fund. 
In that story, Polish deputy foreign minister Pawel Jablonski told Reuters complex issues remained to be ironed out. ""There's the question of financing, of the placement, of legal rights, under what principles these soldiers will function here,"" he said.
""I do think we will come to a final decision, but this will still take some time.""
But Poland's defense minister said the deal was going ahead.
""We are currently agreeing the last details and discussions are taking place in a good atmosphere,"" Mariusz Blaszczak said in a tweet on Thursday.

The celebrations will offer a boost to ties between Britain and France at a time when talks with the European Union about a future relationship after a status quo Brexit transition period have all but stalled. 
In a statement from Clarence House, Charles and Camilla will formally receive Macron at their residence ""with a Guard of Honour formed by Number 7 Company Coldstream Guards accompanied by the Band of the Coldstream Guards"".
De Gaulle's radio appeal, broadcast by the BBC on June 18, 1940, was the founding act of the French Resistance to Nazi occupation during World War Two, although few people heard it at the time and no recording of it has survived.
However, the full text is preserved on a bronze plaque set into the ground near the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier below the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
Horrified by the collapse of the French army as German forces swept through France and by the defeatist attitude of the government, De Gaulle left for London, determined to continue the struggle.

In his radio appeal, he argued that, even though mainland France was mostly under German occupation, French soldiers could continue the war using the country's colonies as a base or by joining forces with the British.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Three months ago, the trip from Brussels to Warsaw involved a direct flight of about two hours, plus travel to and from airports.
After the coronavirus pandemic closed borders and grounded most planes, the 1,300 km journey across Europe took seven times as long and involved a cancelled plane, trains and an automobile ... and a walk across a revived border checkpoint.
Lockdowns to curb the spread of the virus have dealt a blow to easy movement across Europe, although restrictions are being lifted and some travellers' lives should become easier over the coming days.
The journey from Brussels to my home town of Warsaw started with a setback before it even began. 
On the evening of Tuesday, June 9, my flight to Frankfurt scheduled for the next morning was cancelled after a Brussels airport luggage handler went bust, the latest business to fold during the coronavirus crisis.
That put paid to plans to fly to Berlin via Frankfurt and take a train to the German-Polish border.
Instead, I booked Deutsche Bahn tickets from Brussels to Berlin and set off from home the next morning at around 9 a.m.
With a connection in Cologne, where the station platforms were unusually empty, the trip to Berlin took nearly seven hours.
Wearing face masks was obligatory on board, and coaches and train stations were marked with signs reminding travellers to stay at least 1.5 metres apart.
There were no special controls as the train crossed from Belgium to Germany, but at least 17 of the 26 countries inside Europe's Schengen zone have had emergency checks in place due to the coronavirus.
After another switch at Berlin's Hauptbahnhof, an afternoon train took me to Frankfurt (Oder), a German border town across the river from Poland's sleepy Slubice.
It was about a 2 km walk from the station to the middle of the bridge across the Oder, which marks the frontier between the countries. Polish border guards had set up a tent for passenger checks, and signs reminded pedestrians to keep their distance.
After a quick, contactless temperature check and a glance at my ID and documents confirming business travel, I was in.
With Poland reporting record numbers of daily cases of the coronavirus this month, the country was excluded from travel bubbles arranged between neighbours - Baltic nations to the north and Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Austria to the south.
The Polish government has since announced it would reopen its borders for EU travellers from June 13.
From Slubice, it is some 470 km to the Polish capital. Driving on new, EU-sponsored highways took more than four hours, and, as dusk fell, I arrived in Warsaw a few minutes before midnight - around 15 hours after setting off.

In some ways, the voyage was pleasant and interesting. But it also harked back to a time, several decades ago, when Europe was less accessible, less affluent and less open.

""Democracy is already dead,"" the 37-year-old editor-in-chief of Development Media Group (DMG) told Reuters from a location he asked to keep secret.
“They blocked media, restrict media agencies, banned news, punish journalists. Media is the lifeblood of democracy in the country. Without media, how can democracy survive?”  
When Suu Kyi was released from house arrest by a military junta in 2010, Aung Marm Oo was a student activist living in exile. Her release helped persuade him to return home and enter journalism.
The 2016 election that brought Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) to power ended half a century of military rule. But the generals retain strong influence under a constitution that reserves sweeping powers for the military, and 25% of seats in parliament for its appointees.
Aung Hla Tun, deputy minister for information, said the government had revoked some oppressive laws and was drafting both a right to information law and a hate speech law. 
Expectations of the first democratic government were ""very high and very unrealistic"" given ""accumulated bad legacies and challenges our predecessors had left us"", he said.
""We’re not capable of changing all these things drastically in three or four years,"" he said in an email, adding that there was a need to promote trust and cooperation between the media and the pillars of power. 
The interior ministry is controlled by the Tatmadaw, the official name of the armed forces, and the freedom of civil society and the media remains restricted in a country plagued by ethnic conflicts.
Suu Kyi's government has stressed the importance of media freedom for building democracy. Before she came to power, Suu Kyi spoke of the need for the law to protect reporters.
But her administration has brought charges against 31 journalists ranging from unlawful association to terrorism to criminal defamation since she came to power, according to local rights group Athan, and in recent months the civilian-led information ministry has blocked dozens of news websites, including DMG, accusing them of distributing “fake news” and “fearmongering”.
    
NO BYLINES
Many are reporting on regions inside Myanmar including Rakhine and Shan states that are beset by insurgencies. Aung Marm Oo is wanted on “unlawful association” charges after interviewing militants in his native Rakhine. If caught he faces a maximum three-year prison sentence. 
One of the most sensitive regions, Rakhine is where a military crackdown in 2017 prompted more than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee the country. Now, a new conflict has erupted there - this time between government forces and Arakan Army (AA) insurgents recruited from the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine majority. 
Four independent journalists who survived years working under the constraints imposed by the junta told Reuters they had hoped pen names, safe houses and smuggled footage would no longer be needed to report, but for some they have once again become the safest way to operate. 
To keep their reports flowing, DMG reporters upload stories directly to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and rely on a network of citizen journalists to smuggle photos out of conflict zones, according to Aung Marm Oo. 
Monywa Aung Shin, a senior NLD member and editor of the ruling party’s journal, disagreed that media freedom had declined but said it was correct to say that ""limitations"" on reporting existed.
He acknowledged a need to “correct people’s perspectives” towards journalists and said authorities should analyse the intent of journalists contacting a militant group before taking action against them. 
The safest place for journalists to write impartially, without fear, is in exile, said Lawi Weng, a reporter for online website Irrawaddy News, who moved back to Myanmar in 2013 after a decade in Thailand. 
“There is a conflict ... happening in front of our eyes. But we cannot really report on it,” he said.
DANGEROUS WORK
Before the junta began reforms, Myanmar lay at the very bottom of the World Press Freedom Index. Between 2010 and 2016, it climbed 20 places, but has slid back since and this year stood at 139 out of 180.
""In my opinion, the sense of freedom the reporters feel on the ground matters more than the ranking decided by others,"" said Aung Hla Tun, the deputy information minister, adding that Myanmar was higher than its neighbours, Thailand and Bangladesh.
The arrest in 2017 of two Reuters journalists while they were investigating a massacre of Rohingya Muslims was the highest-profile case involving media freedom. They were found guilty of breaching the Official Secrets Act and sentenced to seven years in prison.
The pair were freed after 500 days on a presidential pardon. 
Athan says at least four journalists are facing charges in connection with coverage of the conflict in Rakhine.
After his news website published an interview with an Arakan Army spokesman, journalist Nay Myo Lin, who returned from exile to found the Voice of Myanmar (VOM), was arrested and charged in March under the counter-terrorism act, which can carry result in a life sentence. 
He was released after 10 days but is still dealing with the consequences. 

“Even my wife, a journalist, thinks I should stop,” he said. “It’s dangerous, and we’ve lost our savings. Nothing good comes from doing my work.”

""Explosives placed inside the Sher Shah Suri Mosque exploded during Friday prayers,"" said a Ministry of Interior statement, adding that the West Kabul mosque's mullah was among the dead.
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the blast and the insurgent Taliban group condemned the attack. ""Such systematic killings have begun taking place as the Afghan people have started taking steps towards peace,"" Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said in a statement.
The United States is attempting to broker peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban to end almost two decades of war. After months of delay since the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, peace negotiations are expected to start in coming weeks. 
Islamic State also has a presence in Afghanistan and has claimed large-scale attacks in Kabul in recent months. 
Friday's blast was also condemned by the Afghan president's office, human rights officials, the United States and NATO.
Kabul resident Matin Momen, who was in the mosque compound during the attack, said security forces should examine mosques for explosives. They have been targets for blasts in recent months, especially on Fridays when many gather for prayers.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called on all countries on Friday to 
designate seafarers and other marine personnel as key workers, warning that travel restrictions to combat the coronavirus had left hundreds of thousands stranded at sea for months. 
""Unable to get off ships, the maximum sea time stipulated in international conventions is being ignored, with some seafarers marooned at sea for 15 months,"" Guterres spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. 
About 90% of world trade is transported by sea but lockdowns in many countries to stop the spread of the coronavirus have disrupted supply chains, especially for ship owners who rely on the free movement of crews to keep ships moving.
In April, the International Chamber of Shipping association (ICS) and the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF)told the Group of 20 major economies that there were 1.2 million merchant sailors out at sea at any point, with 100,000 crew members needing to be rotated each month.
Guterres is concerned about the growing humanitarian and safety crisis facing seafarers, Dujarric said. 
""The world could not function without the efforts of seafarers yet their contributions go largely unheralded; they deserve far greater support at any time but especially now,"" Dujarric said. 
U.N. agencies have worked with the ICS and ITF to develop protocols for crew changeovers and Guterres called on all governments to urgently implement them to allow stranded seafarers to go home and others to join ships, he said. 

The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, has infected some 7.5 million people globally and more than 421,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally. The virus first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - There is a strong possibility negotiators from Ireland's Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and Green parties will strike a deal over the next couple of days to form a new coalition government, acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Friday.
Any agreement to end a months-long political deadlock would have to be ratified by grassroot members from each party, with the smaller Greens requiring two-thirds support, a higher bar than the larger parties and which could yet scupper the deal.
The parties want the new government in place before the end of June as parliament is unable to pass any new laws, including those needed to uphold a 6.5 billion euro package of support measures for COVID-19-hit businesses, without a new administration.
""They are progressing. It seems that every day one or two new papers are signed off and I think there is a strong possibility that we will have a programme for government in the next couple of days,"" Varadkar told a news conference.
Varadkar said the government will review in two weeks' time whether to resume air travel to other European countries and urged European Union authorities to come up with a coordinated plan where so-called ""air bridges"" would be opened between member states depending on the coronavirus situation.
Ireland favours using a common set of rules for when, for example, the number of cases is below a certain number for a certain number of days in two countries and an air bridge can be opened between them, he said.
Ireland requires anyone entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days. Varadkar said the fatalities in neighbouring Britain and the higher rate of infection there were concerns for Ireland.

""There is a real risk of the virus being reimported into Ireland by people travelling here from Britain, and that's why the restrictions have to stay in place for now,"" he said.

Researchers have complained that only a fraction of classified French documents have surfaced and say a conclusive account on the role played by Paris has yet to be produced.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame has accused France of being complicit in the bloodshed in which Hutu militias killed around 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
President Emmanuel Macron has sought to improve ties with Kigali and last year appointed researchers to carry out a two-year investigation into the role of the French army in the genocide. 
Presidential archives are usually confidential for 60 years after they were signed, but under certain circumstances, such as public interest, can be made public earlier, the State Council said in a statement.
Notes from the president's advisers and minutes of government meetings are part of the archives.
The court ruled that the academic had a legitimate interest in consulting the archives to contribute to his historical research after access had been denied by the French culture ministry.
Mitterrand was president from 1981 to 1995.
While Paris has acknowledged mistakes in its dealings with Rwanda, it has repeatedly dismissed accusations that it trained militias to take part in the massacre.
However, during a visit to Rwanda in 2010, then president Nicolas Sarkozy acknowledged France had made ""a serious error of judgment, a sort of blindness when we didn't foresee the genocidal dimensions of the government"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The brother of Belgium's king joined a swelling debate about its past on Friday by saying that King Leopold II, under whose rule millions of Congolese were killed or maimed, could not have ""made people suffer"" because he never visited his colony.
Statues of Leopold, who ruled over what is now the Democratic Republic of Congo for 23 years until 1908, have been defaced by activists since anti-racism protests against the police killing of black American George Floyd turned global.
Prince Laurent, brother of King Philippe, told the Sudpresse agency that abuses had occurred in the Congo Free State, Leopold's personal fiefdom and source of wealth, but that Leopold was not to blame.
""He never himself went to Congo,"" he said. So I do not see how he could have made people there suffer.""
But Belgium has begun to debate what happened.
Adam Hochschild, author of the best-selling ""King Leopold's Ghost"", concluded that about half the population of the Congo Free State perished under the king. Villages that missed rubber collection quotas were made to provide severed hands instead.
Joachim Coens, chairman of the Flemish Christian Democrats, told the broadcaster VRT it was time for Belgium, and preferably the king himself, to address the issue.
""There must be an acknowledgement that this was a problem in certain aspects,"" he said on Thursday evening.
The national newspaper Le Soir led its Friday edition with the headline ""Leopold II, the king unnerving the palace"". 
The royal household said it never commented on statements by political leaders.
A chronology of Leopold II on its website does contain a reference to ""abuses"", adding: ""Following the excesses committed by the Europeans in Africa, Leopold's reputation and his overseas venture were questioned.""
A bust of Leopold in Brussels became the latest to be damaged, removed from its plinth by activists overnight.

""This is not how we proceed in a democracy. This is not how we put history back on the right track,"" Auderghem Mayor Didier Gosuin told RTBF.

The plebiscite will run from June 25-July 1 and, if approved, includes a change that would allow 67-year-old Putin, in power since 1999, to serve two more six-year terms in the Kremlin after 2024, when he would under current laws be obliged to step down.
""We have a common historical code, moral foundations... Respect for parents and family (and) love for our soil,"" Putin said at a flag-raising ceremony in Moscow to mark Russia Day.
""As you'd expect, there have been frequent requests to include these fundamental, core principals into the Russian constitution. I'm sure that the absolute majority of our citizens share and support such a position.""
With coronavirus curbs limiting his appearances, it was Putin's second public outing in just over a month. He attended a slimmed down Victory Day military parade on May 9..
The Kremlin has consistently cast the constitutional vote as a broad legislative exercise covering a range of issues that include defining marriage as between a man and a woman and enshrining the rouble as Russia's only legal currency.

Months of public television, online and poster advertisements have failed to highlight the fact that the amendments would also allow Putin to run again for president.

Lesotho, a tiny mountainous kingdom that is entirely surrounded by South Africa, has seen several coups and waves of unrest since independence from Britain in 1966.
Majoro, who was previously finance minister, said it is critical the country moves quickly to set up a stable government to serve its people better.
""The people of Lesotho have welcomed our government with opened hands and in the (next) two years they would like us to focus as much as possible on services to them and to stop quibbling,"" Majoro said during a courtesy call with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa in Pretoria.
Majoro will stay in charge until scheduled elections in June 2022.
Former premier Thomas Thabane bowed to calls to resign in May, three months after police named him and his current wife Maesaiah as suspects in the murder of his estranged former spouse in a case that plunged Lesotho into a political crisis.
A new coalition government under Majoro was formed just before he was sworn in on May 20.
""Our hope and our intentions in negotiating a new coalition is (to) let us come together and seek to stabilize Lesotho's coalition government, which has been fractious since 2012,"" Majoro said.

The advert features both gay and straight couples, and broadcaster TVP told Reuters its decision not to air the footage in the staunchly Catholic country followed ""a large number of complaints ...about advertising clips with intimate content."" It did not specify further.
But the ban, which took effect this week, roughly coincided with a promise by President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the governing right-wing nationalist PiS party, to allow no teaching of LGBT issues in schools if he wins a second term in office on June 28.
""When we found out (about the ban) ... we were honestly not surprised... We see Polish TV is becoming a government mouthpiece,"" Kwiecinski's partner Dawid Mycek, 35, told Reuters TV.
For Kwiecinski, 38, a former producer at TVP, there is ""some kind of paradox that in Poland where we don't have sexual education, TV commercials try to do what our government should do.""
Poland has refused to recognise any form of same-sex union - Kwiecinski and Mycek got married in Portugal - and the PiS labels what it terms lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ""ideology"" an invasive foreign influence that undermines traditional values. 
Several pro-LGBT parades became flashpoints for violence in the run-up to national elections last year, and the country was this year voted the worst in the European Union for LGBT rights in a poll by Brussels-based NGO ILGA-Europe.
Kwiecinski, who says TVP laid him off in 2017 two days after he published a video with a Christmas song featuring him and Mycek, is not hopeful that ranking will change any time soon.
""There is a concern about what will happen next,"" he said. ""First they remove you from the advert, and then they'll say that all the LGBT plots from the movies and series will be removed.""

Paris was due to host virtual meetings of 45 defence and foreign ministers to launch the revamped coalition, which was first announced at a summit in January.
France has deployed thousands of soldiers in the arid region south of the Sahara desert since 2013, and now has 5,100 troops there aiming to combat Islamist insurgencies. But violence by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State has risen and the security situation deteriorated last year.
Paris has long said it wants more support from other European countries and cooperation between states in the region.
The revamped coalition would provide more help from European special forces for regional armies, and financial aid from countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
""Today in the Sahel, victory is possible. Our partners are becoming aware of that,"" a senior official at the French president's office told journalists ahead of the launch. 
Although France and Sahel forces have made some recent gains including the killing of al Qaeda's North Africa chief Abdelmalek Droukdel, militants have continued attacks, pushing further south towards coastal countries such as Ivory coast.
Meanwhile, reported rights abuses including suspected extrajudicial killings of civilians by national armies have drawn condemnation.
""If there are exactions against civilians, you cannot expect their collaboration,"" Drissa Traore, a Malian human rights activist, told a news conference on Thursday.

The Ukraine International Airlines flight was shot down on Jan. 8 by an Iranian ground-to-air missile, killing 176 people in what Tehran termed a ""disastrous mistake"" at a time of heightened tensions with the United States.
The fate of the cockpit voice and data 'black-box' recorders has been the subject of an international standoff eclipsed by the coronavirus crisis, which Iran says has also contributed to delays in a probe by Iran's Air Accident Investigation Board.
Progress was discussed at a council meeting of the UN's International Civil Aviation Organization on Wednesday.
""Iran’s AAIB recently made a request to the BEA that the recorders should be taken by Iran to the BEA’s premises in France to be read in the presence of representatives of other involved countries and ICAO, if the BEA is in a position to accommodate this,” Farhad Parvaresh, Iran's representative to the UN agency, told Reuters by telephone.
The BEA said it had not formally received the request and remained in discussions with Iran, Canada and Ukraine on any involvement it may have. Canada had 57 citizens on board.
Iran has accused the United States, which built the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800, of refusing to provide software to decipher the recorders, while Canada and Ukraine have accused Tehran of dragging its feet over the probe.
Sources said earlier this week that Iran had told ICAO it would take the recorders to Paris once countries involved in the probe agreed.
Iran had earlier said it would send them to Ukraine.
Canada this week called on Iran to allow the recorders to be downloaded in a suitable facility as soon as possible.

The BEA last month read black-box data from a Pakistan-operated Airbus that crashed in Karachi on May 22. Pakistani investigators are expected to issue a preliminary report soon.

The government eased lockdown restrictions on June 2, allowing French restaurants, bars and cafes to reopen after weeks of coronavirus-enforced shutdown.
But in Paris, customers can only be served at outdoor seating. Several days of overcast and rainy weather have turned alfresco dining into a soggy proposition.
""We're too dependent on the weather,"" said Artru at his restaurant Le Garde Temps. ""We cannot let our clients come inside and lately since we've reopened the weather has not been good.""
Across Paris this week, some cafegoers were toughing out the weather by wrapping up in coats and scarves. Restaurant awnings kept some of the rain off.
But restaurateurs said customer numbers - already limited because of the restriction on indoor dining - were down, making it even harder to turn a profit.
""With terraces we fall victim to bad weather. If it's raining we cannot work any more, or maybe at 50 to 30 percent,"" said Jean Mathieu, representative in the Paris region of the UMIH restaurant and hotels union.
The hospitality industry is pressing President Emmanuel Macron to allow customers to be served indoors in Paris. 

Elsewhere in France, indoor dining is allowed, but the restriction was put in place in the capital because of its higher rate of coronavirus infection.

LONDON (Reuters) - Once feted as pioneers, some of the architects of Europe's empire building now face a backlash: anti-racism protesters are demanding their legacies be revisited and their often imposing statues be torn down and consigned to the trash heap of history.
From Cecil Rhodes in England and Captain James Cook in Australia to Christopher Columbus in the United States and King Leopold II in Belgium, the imperialists are under attack, sometimes from the descendants of those they once colonised.
The cause? A sweeping global reassessment of history and racism triggered by the May 25 death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him.
""Slavery is still very real history for black people - we are still living with the consequences of it, with a racial hierarchy that puts black people at the bottom,"" said Mary Ononokpono, who is doing a PhD at the University of Cambridge on the British-Biafran slave trade.
""Britain, Europe and America - and Africa - have to confront their history,"" said Ononokpono. ""We urgently need to have a long-overdue and honest discussion about the history of slavery and its legacy of impoverishment.""
Protesters pulled down a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th Century slave trader, in the English city of Bristol on Sunday and dumped it in the harbour. It has been retrieved and will be placed in a museum.
Such is the anger that the movement has broadened to target colonialists, monarchs and explorers, who in some cases destroyed or enslaved local populations across the world in the European scramble for empire and treasure.
It has also reignited debate in the United States over symbols associated with the South's pro-slavery Confederacy.
Opponents of the symbols, including monuments, memorials and the Confederate flag, consider them emblems of slavery, racism and U.S. xenophobia. Supporters say they represent the South’s heritage and culture, and serve as a memorial to Confederate casualties during the 1861-65 Civil War.
SINS OF THE PAST
Statues have long been toppled as the currents of history shift and empires rise and fall.
Just days after the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, revolutionaries felled a statue of George III. During the French Revolution, Louis XV was torn down.
Josef Stalin fell in Budapest in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution. Vladimir Lenin was toppled as first the Berlin Wall and then the Soviet Union itself crumbled.
'Iron Felix' Dzerzhinsky, who established what became the KGB, was pulled down in 1991 outside KGB headquarters in Moscow. In Baghdad, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's statue was felled after the invasion in 2003, with the help of American troops.
Moscow even has a cemetery for fallen statues: a museum littered with the crumbling heroes of a fallen superpower.
While revolutions may usher in sharp changes in historical perspective, rarely has one man's death triggered so much debate about racism and the sins of the past - which many black people feel have yet to be atoned for.
Some find the destruction of statues troubling.
Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott condemned demands to take down a statue of Rhodes at Oxford University.
""Pulling down statues of past heroes is cultural vandalism of the worst sort,"" Abbott, a Rhodes Scholar, told the Australian Financial Review. ""We should learn from their strengths and their weaknesses but we should never imagine that we have the last word in wisdom and insight.""
In Africa, too, there is caution.
Anthony Bouadi, 30, a tour guide at Cape Coast Castle in Ghana, where slaves were once held in windowless dungeons before being sent across the Atlantic, said it was wrong to tear down statues.
""They should have a specific museum for those monuments and statues - a museum that portrays the history of slave-owners,"" Bouadi said.
""The history of the transatlantic slave trade is very cruel, it's not a good thing. However, we have to remember what happened in the past so we don't repeat what happened."" 
NOT EVERYONE WANTS CHANGE
In the United States, the modern movement to remove Confederate memorials began with the 2015 murder of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, by a white supremacist.
Outrage over the massacre prompted South Carolina's governor to sign a bill enabling the removal of the Confederate flag from the State House grounds, and, according to a Southern Poverty Law Center estimate, led to the removal of more than 100 other Confederate symbols.
But resistance, both emotional and institutional, has been fierce.
The planned removal of two Confederate statues in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017 sparked a deadly white supremacist protest in that city.
On Monday, a Virginia judge temporarily blocked Governor Ralph Northam from taking down a Confederate monument in Richmond.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday rejected any proposal to rename U.S. military bases that are named for Confederate leaders.
EUROPE'S ORIGINAL SIN?
In Britain, a statue of wartime leader Winston Churchill was scrawled with the words ""was a racist"" and obscene language during an anti-racist protest in central London on Sunday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""absurd and shameful"" that a Churchill statue should be at risk of attack, and that we should not ""try to edit or censor our past.""
Italian explorer and colonialist Christopher Columbus was pulled down in Virginia on Tuesday.
In the northeastern French town of Lille, outrage over Floyd’s death has brought new energy to a campaign to remove a statue of General Louis Faidherbe, who played a role in the colonialisation of Algeria in the 1840s and was governor of Senegal under Napoleon III.
""He ruled Senegal through terror, burning villages and massacring people, yet despite that he continues to be glorified in Lille,"" said Nicolas Butor, an activist for Survie, which fights neocolonialism in France.
""We want the Faidherbe statue removed from public space. We need to stop glorifying racist colonial figures,"" Butor said. 
London has announced a review of street names and statues, many of which reflect the rapid expansion of London's wealth and power at the height of Britain's empire under Queen Victoria.
""Murderer"" and ""racist"" were scrawled on a statue of Victoria, who reigned from 1837-1901, in the English city of Leeds. 
So what is the solution?
Banksy, the street artist who hails from Bristol, had one suggestion for how to bridge the divide over the statue of Colston.

""We drag him out the water, put him back on the plinth, tie cable round his neck and commission some life-size bronze statues of protesters in the act of pulling him down. Everyone happy. A famous day commemorated.""

The opposition sought a confidence vote in parliament on Muhyiddin's leadership in May, accusing him of stealing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.
The vote was scuttled after Muhyiddin's administration limited parliament's first meeting of the year to half a day, citing the need to focus on the battle against the coronavirus.
Muhyiddin had told leaders of his Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia outfit of his election plans in several meetings this month, party sources were quoted as saying in the report.
""(The) PM has been meeting grassroots and has also instructed all party leaders to ramp up election preparation,"" Bersatu supreme councillor Wan Saiful Wan Jan was quoted as saying.
Muhyiddin's party holds a minority stake in the new Perikatan Nasional ruling coalition. The United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) holds the lion's share of parliamentary seats in the pact, which is also backed by the Pan-Malaysian Islamist Party (PAS).
Muhyiddin, who was part of a multi-ethnic coalition that defeated UMNO in 2018, was unexpectedly made prime minister on March 1 after a week of turmoil that saw the collapse of the previous administration sparked by the shock resignation of his predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad.

Mahathir said in May he would seek to oust Muhyiddin at every turn, scolding his successor for bringing back the graft-tainted UMNO into power.

Koike, 67, was Japan's first female defence minister and also held the environment portfolio. Though she failed in a bid to become prime minister, analysts say her recent popularity support could rekindle her ambition to try again.
Koike's approval ratings shot up to 70% in late May, climbing 20 percentage points from March, according to a poll by JX Press Corp. The poll found that 70% of respondents supported her leadership in containing the novel coronavirus.
Through her daily video briefings, Koike has taken a no-nonsense approach to getting Tokyo residents to stay at home and avoid an explosive spread of the coronavirus.
Her soaring support is in contrast with the largely negative public response to Abe's handling of the outbreak.
Abe's approval dwindled to 38%, with 60% saying they disapproved of how he has handled the epidemic, according to a Jiji news agency poll in May. Only 37% thought he had done a good job.
""The battle with coronavirus is absolutely not over yet. Maybe, I think this is a start,"" Koike told a news conference as she announced her bid for a second term in the July 5 election.
She said her campaign would be largely digital to avoid gatherings.
A former newsreader, Koike failed in a 2008 bid to lead the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which Abe now heads. She left the party in 2016 and went on to become Tokyo's first woman governor that year.
The LDP will not field a candidate for the Tokyo race because it could not find a good contender, the NHK broadcaster reported on Friday. 

Other contenders include Kenji Utsunomiya, a left-leaning lawyer.

The Knyaz Vladimir (Prince Vladimir) - designed to carry Bulava intercontinental nuclear missiles - was enrolled into the navy during Friday's Russia Day celebrations.
The announcement comes against the background of a rift with Western powers over Ukraine and fears of a burgeoning arms race following the demise of a landmark Cold War-era nuclear pact.
The Borei-A (Boreas) class submarine is named after a ruler of the medieval Kievan Rus, the territory in modern-day Ukraine from which the Russian state would later emerge.
The first upgraded 955A model to be produced in the Borei class is one of the centrepieces in President Valdimir Putin's plans to upgrade the nuclear-powered fleet.
The Borei submarine project, started shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, had long been plagued by shortages of cash and failures during tests of the Bulava missile.
The global arms control architecture erected during the Cold War to keep Washington and Moscow in check has come under strain since the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.
In August last year, the United States pulled out of the accord that banned the deployment of short and intermediate range missiles, accusing Moscow of flouting it, something Russia denies.

The last major nuclear arms control treaty between Russia and the United States, the New START treaty, is due to expire in 2021. It limits the number of strategic nuclear warheads the world's two biggest nuclear powers can deploy.

696,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Trump aims to sidestep another arms pact to sell more U.S. drones,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration plans to reinterpret a Cold War-era arms agreement between 34 nations with the goal of allowing U.S. defense contractors to sell more American-made drones to a wide array of nations, three defense industry executives and a U.S. official told Reuters.
The policy change, which has not been previously reported, could open up sales of armed U.S. drones to less stable governments such as Jordan and the United Arab Emirates that in the past have been forbidden from buying them under the 33-year-old Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), said the U.S. official, a former U.S. official and one of the executives. It could also undermine longstanding MTCR compliance from countries such as Russia, said the U.S. official, who has direct knowledge of the policy shift.
Reinterpreting the MTCR is part of a broader Trump administration effort to sell more weapons overseas. It has overhauled https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trump-effect-drones-exclusive/exclusive-game-of-drones-u-s-poised-to-boost-unmanned-aircraft-exports-idUSKBN1CG0F4 a broad range of arms export regulations and removed the U.S. from international arms treaties including the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and the Open Skies Treaty. 
Sidestepping the accord would allow U.S. defense contractors General Atomics Aeronautical Systems Inc and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) to break into new markets currently dominated by less sophisticated offerings from China and Israel, which do not participate in the MTCR.
Heidi Grant, the Pentagon's Director of Defense Technology Security Administration, declined to comment on the pending MTCR policy change but said the U.S. military is eager to see drone sales expanded to more countries. Such sales would bolster the militaries of allies and replace drones sales from other nations, she said. ""If we are unable to meet this growing demand, we shoot ourselves in the foot,"" Grant told Reuters.
She said the drones would help allies fight terrorism, establish border control and generally help stop threats before they reach the United States. Grant declined to name specific nations the Pentagon believes should get more U.S.-made weapons. 
The State Department, which makes final decisions on drone sales, declined to comment on the policy change. The White House also declined to comment.
U.S. agencies including the departments of Commerce, Energy, Justice and Homeland Security agreed to the change in May, and the State Department is expected to approve the first drone sales under the new interpretation as soon as this summer, said the U.S. official and industry executives. They said the administration has already notified Northrop Grumman and General Atomics, the two major U.S. drone makers, of its plans.
The change is scheduled for a review by the White House National Security Council at its June 16 meeting, said one of the executives and a former U.S. official with knowledge of the internal policy discussions. The council is expected to support the policy change and discuss a possible White House announcement, they said.
The Trump administration is pressing ahead with its revamp of drone export policy under pressure from American manufacturers and despite objections from human rights advocates, who warn of the risk of fueling instability in hot spots including the Middle East and South Asia.
Expanded sales of armed drones could increase global conflicts, said Rachel Stohl, a weapons expert at the Stimson Center in Washington, a think tank focused on security issues that opposes weapons proliferation.
""Once they leave U.S. control, we lose our ability to influence how and where they are used,"" she said. 
LOWERING THE BAR
Under the State Department's current interpretation of the MTCR, all sales of large drones are subject to what is known as a ""strong presumption of denial,"" which has made approvals rare. But the high bar to get a deal greenlighted will be removed, signaling to previously forbidden customers that their orders have much better chance of approval, according to the official, the former official and one of the defense executives.
Reuters could not determine what specific criteria the State Department will use in scrutinizing weapons deals under the new interpretation.
Until now, only England, France and Australia have been allowed to buy large, armed drones from U.S. manufacturers, according to data collected by The Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College in New York state.
Jordan, Romania, Saudi Arabia and UAE have shown interest in purchasing U.S. systems and will be among the first customers in line when the U.S. policy changes, one of the industry executives said. Officials from the Washington embassies of those nations did not respond to requests for comment.
The U.S. official and the former official said any country where U.S forces are operating drones in the counterterrorism fight, such as Kuwait, could be a potential customer for lethal drones. The Embassy of Kuwait in Washington did not return a request for comment. 
U.S. drone manufacturers, face growing competition overseas especially from Chinese and Israeli rivals who have far fewer rules limiting sales.The defense contractors are vying for a larger share of the global military drone market, which the Teal Group, a market research firm, forecast annual sales, research and development will rise from $15.8 billion in 2020 to nearly $20 billion by 2029.
Bart Roper, Senior Vice President for Strategic Development at General Atomics, said the firm has been limited under current policy and that a liberalization of the rules could result in ""hundreds"" of new sales. Roper, who did not confirm the policy change, said there is strong interest from Middle East and Southeast Asian customers that have been forced to purchase aircraft from the Chinese because of a lack of U.S. alternatives.
A Northrop Grumman spokesman added that increased drone exports would lead to closer work on the technology with allies, helping keep U.S. drones state-of-the-art.
MISSILE PACT
The MTCR agreement - originally signed in 1987 by the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and Britain - focused on stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The pact has been credited with slowing or stopping missile programs in countries such as Egypt, Argentina and Iraq. 
The MTCR policy shift has been under consideration by the Trump administration since 2017, but has been delayed several times as the United States has grappled with objections within the government and from other nations in the agreement, two of the executives and the current and former officials said.
Some state department officials objected to the change for fear that advanced weaponry would be sold to governments that have abused human rights, the former official said.
The U.S. plan is to reinterpret its treatment of drones that fly slower than 800 kilometers per hour, including Reapers and Global Hawks. Global Hawks, made by Northrop Grumman, are not armed and are typically used for surveillance. Reapers, made by General Atomics, are used for both surveillance and air strikes - including the recent U.S. strike that killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in January.
The MTCR currently classifies such drones as cruise missiles - and therefore subject to high export restrictions - because of the technical specifications for unpiloted aircraft in the 1987 pact. Under the reinterpretation, the United States will treat these drones as if they belong in a lower category that falls outside MTCR jurisdiction.
The Pentagon's Grant said boosted sales of sophisticated weaponry can strengthen U.S. alliances and help allied militaries safeguard U.S. interests. It also enables cooperation with allies when they use the same equipment, and would speed efforts to replace or repair drones in combat. 

Over time, she said, boosting sales of the drones could also lower their cost to the U.S. government by giving defense contractors economies of scale.

697,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 12, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","The Squad in the spotlight: AOC, progressive peers face primary challenges of their own","By Joseph Ax and Susan Cornwell
(Reuters) - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's stunning upset over a member of the Democratic congressional leadership in 2018 made her a household name and inspired similar insurgent campaigns around the United States.
Now the democratic socialist from New York City, best known by her initials AOC, must survive her own challenge from within the party in a June 23 primary election. Two other members of ""the Squad"" – four women of color who, in their first terms, have become the face of the U.S. House of Representatives' liberal wing – also face primary challengers.
Like Ocasio-Cortez, Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar face opponents who have accused them of prioritizing their celebrity over their constituents.
The contests – along with races like liberal Jamaal Bowman's challenge to 16-term Congressman Eliot Engel in New York – offer a new gauge of the strength of the party's left wing, months after Senator Bernie Sanders lost the presidential nominating battle to the more moderate Joe Biden.
A win over any ""Squad"" member would be an upset, and each has raised significantly more money than her opponents. But Engel appears to have a close fight on his hands, as Bowman – backed by liberal groups including MoveOn and Justice Democrats – has secured endorsements from both Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.
""The general rule of thumb in these primaries is the challengers almost always fail,"" said Kyle Kondik, an elections analyst at the University of Virginia.
In New York, Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, a former CNBC host, has sought to turn one of Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 arguments against her: that she is too focused on her own career to attend to the needs of her district.
Caruso-Cabrera, a former Republican, often says, ""AOC is MIA,"" and attacked her for helping to kill Amazon.com Inc's (O:AMZN) proposal to build its new headquarters in New York City.
""I can't believe a representative would throw away 25,000 jobs and brag about it,"" Caruso-Cabrera, 53, said in an interview. ""People of the Bronx are tired of the Bronx being appropriated for her personal power grab.""
Ocasio-Cortez, 30, has defended her opposition to the Amazon deal, citing the company's working conditions and the possibility that neighborhood rents would skyrocket.
""I am constantly home in this district,"" Ocasio-Cortez said during a recent debate, adding that she has attended more than 200 events, including 17 town halls.
A May poll conducted for her campaign gave Ocasio-Cortez a 73%-11% lead. Pollster Celinda Lake said the survey also showed most constituents ""think of her as fighting for them.""
MINNESOTA CHALLENGE, MICHIGAN REMATCH
In Minneapolis, which has been convulsed by protests since the death of George Floyd last month after a police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes, Omar faces several opponents.
She had a turbulent first year, engaging in high-profile spats with President Donald Trump and receiving condemnation from some Democrats for controversial comments on Israel.
Her most prominent challenger, lawyer Antone Melton-Meaux, describes Omar, 37, as too divisive to be effective.
""Congresswoman Omar is a divider,"" Melton-Meaux, 47, said in an interview. ""I'm not interested in celebrity; I'm interested in service.""
Omar's campaign spokesman, Jeremy Slevin, said in an email, ""Representative Omar lives and breathes the 5th District,"" adding that she and her team have held more than 1,000 constituent meetings and conversations.
In Michigan, Tlaib, 43, faces a rematch against Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones, 60, who lost by fewer than 1,000 votes in 2018.
Jones has also questioned Tlaib's commitment to her constituents, though she has largely refrained from direct attacks.
""I am one that works with people - even when I don't always agree with them - in order to get things done for my community,"" Jones said.
In response, Tlaib's campaign spokesman noted she had opened four neighborhood service centers, held dozens of town halls and helped residents secure unemployment benefits and protective equipment during the pandemic.
""Representative Tlaib is rooted in the community and has not stopped working for residents,"" the spokesman, Denzel McCampbell, said via email.
The fourth ""Squad"" member, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, has no primary opposition.
While their newfound fame has opened up the ""Squad"" to allegations that they are ""out of touch,"" the argument can resonate more with voters when it is aimed at lawmakers with decades in office, such as Engel, said Ian Russell, the former national political director of the Democratic congressional campaign arm.
The attack landed more squarely after The Atlantic magazine in May reported Engel did not visit his New York district for weeks after the coronavirus pandemic erupted. In response, Engel's campaign spokesman said he is ""laser-focused"" on helping his district and touted the billions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief that New York has received.
""If they knock off Engel, that's a game-changer in a lot of ways, because it demonstrates they've continued their momentum,"" Russell said of the left wing.

But Kondik noted that progressives already lost the biggest fight of the year: ""The Democratic Party as a whole was offered an establishment-versus-ideological choice in the primary, and the party pretty overwhelmingly picked Biden.""

The World War Two leader's statue on Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) was sprayed with graffiti declaring Churchill a racist during a fractious end to a mostly peaceful demonstration on Sunday over the death of African American George Floyd in Minneapolis. 
Boarding has also been placed around the foot of the Cenotaph on Whitehall, where the government and royal family attend Remembrance Sunday events each year commemorating those killed in World War One and conflicts since then. 
Floyd's death, after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him on May 25, has sparked protests across the United States and Europe and reignited a debate in Britain about monuments to those involved in the country's imperialist past. 
Sculptures of slave traders have been taken down and local authorities have said they may remove a statue of the founder of the worldwide scouting movement, Robert Baden-Powell, to protect it. 
Black Lives Matter protesters are due to gather again on Friday in central London. 

A loose grouping of soccer fans who describe themselves as patriots but are criticised by opponents as hooligans, and supporters of a right-wing leader, Tommy Robinson, have said they will gather in London on Saturday to protect statues.

The demonstration, spearheaded by anti-Duterte activists, was held as the Philippines marked the 122nd anniversary of its independence from Spanish rule.
Human rights activists have raised alarm over the bill pushed by Duterte, warning of draconian and arbitrary provisions, including arrest without warrants, that they say could be abused to target his detractors.
""It looks like we will lose our basic rights because of this anti-terrorism bill, especially our right to express our concerns with the government,"" said Ofelia Cantor, one of the more than 1,000 protesters at the University of the Philippines' main campus in the capital Manila. 
Wearing face masks and observing physical distancing to protect themselves from the coronavirus, the protesters held placards and chanted slogans such as ""Junk terror bill!"" and ""Activists not terrorists!"".
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque has defended the bill, saying elements were modelled on those used in countries that had dealt effectively with extremism.
Interior Secretary Eduardo Año said he had instructed the police to exercise maximum tolerance while monitoring the protesters, even as he warned mass gatherings are prohibited under the country's coronavirus quarantine rules.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong government and China's foreign ministry branch in the city hit back on Friday at a report by Britain criticising Beijing's plans for national security legislation, saying it was ""biased"" and intervened in internal affairs.
The British government said the proposed legislation was a clear violation of China's international obligations and a breach of the ""one country, two systems"" formula that has governed the former British colony since its handover in 1997. 
British Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said a solution to the year-long unrest in the Chinese-ruled city, which has been marked by sometimes violent clashes between protesters and police, must come from Hong Kong, not from Beijing.
The Commissioner of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong said Britain ""seriously trampled on the principles of international law including non-interference in other countries' internal affairs.""
In a typically strongly-worded statement, it told Britain ""Hong Kong returned 23 years ago"" and that it should stop ""distorting facts"" as it had no sovereignty or power of supervision over the territory.
Hong Kong's government said it firmly opposed the ""inaccurate and biased remarks.""
Local and Beijing authorities have insisted the legislation will focus on small numbers of ""troublemakers"" who pose a national security threat and will not curb freedoms or hurt investors.
The exchange over the legislation, expected to be implemented by September, came as Hong Kong marked the anniversary of a major turning point in the city's pro-democracy movement. 
On June 12 last year, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters rallying against a proposed bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
It was the first such response from police, who have argued the use of ""minimum"" force was necessary to restore law and order, a move that radicalised many moderates in Hong Kong.
While the bill was later withdrawn, the movement evolved into broader appeals for democracy amid fears Beijing was tightening its grip. 
STUDENT PROTESTERS
Rallies marking last year's pivotal moments are planned for later on Friday. Police urged people not to gather, citing illegal assembly laws and coronavirus risks, saying it ""will not tolerate any illegal or violent behaviour.""
In Taipei, the capital of democratically-ruled, Chinese-claimed Taiwan, dozens of people rallied in solidarity, chanting ""Free Hong Kong. Revolution now.""
A student group and several labour unions postponed this Sunday's vote on whether to hold a wide-scale strike to June 20, citing a storm forecast.
China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, which serves as a platform for Beijing to project its influence in the city, said schools should ""immediately discourage"" such activity. It blamed political groups ""with ulterior motives"" for ""shocking chaos in Hong Kong education.""
Students have played a major role in the protests, culminating in the occupation of a university campus, which led to a weeks-long standoff with the police in some of last year's most violent scenes.
The liaison office added that ""on the issue of cultivating qualified nationals and emphasising national feelings, there is only 'one country' and no 'two systems'.""
The student group responded, saying it would not ""concede to bullying.""
Diplomats, lawyers and business leaders fear national security motives will be used to curb academic, media and other freedoms in Hong Kong.
Britain has been joined by the United States and others in criticising the proposed legislation. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has singled out HSBC as one of the major companies backing the law, saying ""corporate kowtows"" got little in return from Beijing and criticising the Chinese Communist Party's ""coercive bullying tactics."" 

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he was working on measures that could restrict capital flows through the territory.

POLGARDI, Hungary (Reuters) - For Hungarian transgender couple Tamara Csillag and Elvira Angyal life is on hold, their wedding postponed, and they are angry.
Hungary last month banned people from changing their gender on identity documents, in a move LGBT+ advocates said was creating panic among transgender people who feared an increase in discrimination and attacks.
Tamara, 57, filed her paperwork two years ago, days before the government temporarily banned alterations to identity documents - that ban is now permanent.
Elvira, 53, completed her paperwork years before, but Tamara is forced to write ""Thomas"" on official documents. The couple have put their wedding plans on hold while Tamara is forced to remain legally male.
""This slope we are on is politically conceived,"" said Tamara in the house the couple share with 17 cats and four dogs. ""The government created this abyss ... It makes me so angry.""
Rights groups say hostility to LGBT+ people has increased since nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban won a third term in 2018. The European Union has long criticised Orban's right-wing government over its record on the rule of law and civil liberties.
According to ILGA, an international lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex advocacy group, Hungary slipped the most in Europe in terms of gay rights in 2019, although it is still ahead of nearly all eastern European countries.
HOSTILE RHETORIC
ILGA says Poland, where homophobia has been part of the ruling PiS party's ideology and election strategy, ranks last in the EU.
Hungary's ranking was primarily due to its handling of the transgender issue, ILGA said, as well as some hostile rhetoric from the ruling Fidesz party.
Tamas Dombos, a director of the LGBT+ rights group Hatter Society, said though gender change procedures numbered a few dozen per year in Hungary, there may be tens of thousands of trans people in the country. Most opt not to go through the process.
Gender change procedures are legal in Hungary and subsidised by the state to a small extent but are prohibitively expensive for many people. Gay marriage is not recognised, but legal partnership is.
Transgender people are the most at risk of suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts among LGBT+ groups, Dombos said. One in four attempt suicide before transition.
The new law, authored by Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjen, says: ""Since it is impossible to fully change biological sex, it is necessary to fix in law.""
In a statement sent to the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, at the time the law was passed in parliament, the government said it left everyone ""free to exercise their identities as they wish"".
Tamara disagrees. She says harassment forced her to leave a job, the five children she raised while suppressing her true self ignore her, and now the government is targeting her, preventing her from completing her documentation.
""We have fought ... for future generations,"" she said. ""We will fight on. We have to persevere.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - For doctors and healthcare workers in India's financial capital Mumbai who are grappling with surging coronavirus infections, the onset of the annual monsoon poses a serious threat - a new wave of patients with vector-borne diseases. 
Already stretched by a shortage of medics and critical care beds, the situation in Mumbai might turn uglier, health experts warn, as cases of malaria, dengue, leptospirosis and encephalitis are expected to soar in coming months.
""Mumbai will be dealing with a crisis in the monsoon,"" said Kamakshi Bhate, professor emeritus of community medicine at the state-run King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital in Mumbai, noting there is typically a surge in hospital bed occupancy due to such diseases during India's annual June-September monsoon season.
Water-logged streets are a common sight every monsoon across India. But in Mumbai, its most populous city, monsoons can often bring life to a standstill with flooding and water-logging, and result in a surge of diseases.
In a report, local NGO Praja Foundation said official data from only government-run hospitals showed Mumbai recorded about 32,000 malaria and dengue cases in 2018, but the NGO said its own household survey indicated more than 200,000 cases of just those two diseases in the city that year.
This year the city's hospitals are already overrun. Mumbai has been hit the hardest by COVID-19. About 25% of India's 297,535 coronavirus cases and roughly 29% of the 8,498 deaths recorded have come from the city and its surrounding suburbs.
Suresh Kakani, an additional commissioner at Mumbai's civic authority, said it was asking clinics and dispensaries, some of which had shut during a two-month long nationwide lockdown, to re-open.
Drains are being cleaned and stored water in houses were being inspected for larvae, Kakani said, adding that while major hospitals were on treating COVID patients, smaller nursing homes would be available to handle other cases. 
But, with local hospitals already strained by significant staff shortages, heath experts fear the spread of diseases in Mumbai's slums could compound issues for a healthcare network already reeling from COVID-19 cases.
""We have a number of slums in low-lying areas and they are prone to flooding and disease,"" said Brinelle D'Souza, a health activist with Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, a local non-governmental organization.

D'Souza said that while many isolation beds were available for patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms, the city, home to about 20 million people, needed substantially more critical care beds with oxygen supplies and ventilators.

In Paris on Friday, police unions parked dozens of vehicles at the foot of the Arc de Triomphe before processing down the Champs Elysees boulevard. One van carried a poster reading ""No police, no peace"". Another carried graphic images of injuries sustained by police officers attacked in the line of duty, with the words: ""Who is massacring who?"".
The protests followed a meeting between police unions and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner meant to try and allay the simmering police anger.
The unions told the minister the chokehold saved lives and was a technique that officers needed at their disposal until a suitable alternative was found, Fabien Vanhemelryck of the National Police Alliance said after the meeting.
""The second thing we told him was to stop buying social peace ... where we appease a certain part of the population at the expense of the police,"" Vanhemelryck told reporters. ""The police are not responsible for all the evils of society.""
In the Paris suburb of Bobigny late on Thursday evening, officers lined up outside the police station and threw their handcuffs to the ground. In Lyon, police parked their cars around the central Place Bellecour, blue lights flashing.
Accusations of brutality and racism against French police remain largely unaddressed, rights groups say.
A wave of anger has swept around the world after the death of Floyd, an African-American who died after a white officer knelt on his neck for more than 8 minutes.

OdaTV, an online news outlet, has been critical of President Tayyip Erdogan's government. Turkey ranks among the top jailers of journalists across the world. 
Since a failed coup attempt in July 2016, Ankara has cracked down on suspected members of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen's network, which it accuses of orchestrating the putsch. More than 77,000 people have been jailed and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others have been sacked or suspended.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will extend prevention and sanitation guidelines against the coronavirus until daily new infections drop to single digits, the health minister said on Friday, failing which he warned of a return to tough social distancing measures.
The announcement came as such cases persist in the mid-double digits following a series of new clusters in the area around Seoul, the capital, with 56 new cases on Thursday taking the national tally to 12,003, and 277 deaths.
Authorities will review whether to return to intensive social distancing if 50 daily infections persist for more than two weeks, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told a briefing.
""These guidelines are aimed at cutting the series of infections centered in the Seoul area that could result in a return to social distancing,"" he said.
More than 96% of new infections were in the Seoul metropolitan area in the last two weeks, he added. Of Thursday's new cases, 42 were from the Seoul area.
South Korea has limited gatherings and recorded every visitor to eight high-risk facilities, such as nightclubs and bars, since May 29, Park said.
At least 147 cases were linked to an outbreak at an e-commerce logistics centre near Seoul, the Korea Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) said.
Another Seoul outbreak of 139 infections was traced to a health product company that relied on door-to-door sales. 
KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong warned of school transmissions affecting students.
""Recent major clusters are in closed and tightly sealed spaces like basements and in situations where mask-wearing is difficult - where you sing, share food or work out,"" Jeong said.
Seventeen of 20,902 schools nationwide had to cancel classes on Friday, after a kindergartner and a teenager confirmed positive, the education ministry said, with schools closing after reporting infections among some students.
Schools and kindergartens had opened in phases from May 12, with four teachers and 12 students confirmed positive since.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A single mother in Thailand is doing brisk business out of face shields with characters from cartoons, games and sci-fi movies, hoping to cash in and promote safety for children as her country emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
From her small studio room, Maysa Talerd, 31, has been designing patterns and carefully pressing stickers of famous fictional superheroes and villains onto the face shields, aiming to blend safety and style and expand her new business.
""Normally, a face shield is transparent, so people might get bored. With these fun designs, they'll encourage people to wear them,"" she said.
""At least with the cartoon characters, kids will want to wear them and show off to their friends at school."" 
Orders are pouring in for shields with the faces from Darth Vader and his Stormtroopers from Star Wars films to Japanese superhero Mobile Suit Gundam and the heroes, villains and figures of Thai folklore.
Thailand is gradually easing restrictions in an effort to revive its economy, while keeping strict social distancing measures in place to prevent infections.
It has recorded 58 deaths so far and 3,125 confirmed cases - the majority of whom have recovered - and has not reported a local transmission in 17 days.
A few months ago Maysa had no income but is on her way to being financially stable, receiving orders of 50-100 shields at a time, which she sells for 180 baht ($5.77) each.

""I think this might become the main income for me in the future because toy stores are contacting me to do wholesale,"" she said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Protesters in the Thai capital held a small rally outside the prime minister's offices on Friday urging authorities to investigate the suspected kidnapping of an exiled activist by unknown gunmen last week in Cambodia.
Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, a previously little-known pro-democracy activist who fled from Thailand following a 2014 military coup, was seized on a street outside his apartment in Phnom Penh on June 4.
Cambodian authorities initially said they did not have enough information to investigate but later said they would. Thai government officials have denied any role in the disappearance. 
""It has been more than a week since this happened but there has been no progress in the investigation,"" Jutatip Sirikhan, president of the Student Union of Thailand, said at the rally outside Government House.
The rally was the latest in a series of small protests over the abduction in Bangkok. Public political dissent in Thailand is still rare even though democracy was officially restored last year after five years of military rule.
The leader of the military government, Prayuth Chan-ocha, is now a civilian prime minister with the backing of pro-military politicians.
Jutatip, reading from a statement, told the rally Prayuth was a dictator.
""The abduction of Wanchalearm is a heinous crime perpetrated by a dictatorial state, using its power to get rid of its political critics,"" she said.
On Monday, protesters outside the Cambodian embassy also demanded an investigation and accused the Thai state of orchestrating the kidnapping.
Wanchalearm was speaking on his mobile phone to his elder sister, Sitanun Satsaksit, when he was abducted, she said.
In recent years, at least eight Thai activists who fled after the 2014 coup have disappeared from Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam, with the bodies of two of them found floating in the Mekong River.

Thai authorities have said they had nothing to do with disappearances.

Some Israeli officials have dismissed the notion that applying sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank would slow a discreet opening between Israel and Arab countries - particularly with Gulf states who share Israeli concerns over Iran. 
But, in a rare appeal to the Israeli public by an Arab official, the UAE's ambassador to Washington, Youssef Al Otaiba, said the move would be what he called an ""illegal takeover"" of land Palestinians seek for a state. 
""Annexation would - certainly and immediately - upend all Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and the UAE,"" he wrote in an op-ed in Israel's best-selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, published in Hebrew.
Israel has no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries, but common concerns over Iran's regional influence have led to a limited thaw in ties. In May, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad made the first known flight by a UAE carrier to Israel, carrying coronavirus aid for the Palestinians.
""All the progress that you've seen and the attitudes that have been changing towards Israel, people becoming more accepting of Israel and less hostile to Israel, all of that could be undermined by a decision to annex,"" Al Otaiba said in a video that accompanied the article online.
Egypt and Jordan are the only two Arab countries with which Israel has formal relations. 
The Israeli government intends to begin debating annexation on July 1. While the move won support in U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, an Israeli minister on Thursday said there were gaps with Washington on the issue and that the two allies had yet to agree on a map of territorial lines.
Palestinians want the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem - territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war - for an envisaged future independent state. 
They say annexation would make that impossible, and have called for international sanctions against Israel. 

Arab and European countries have voiced concern over unilateral territorial moves that could jeopardise a two-state solution to the conflict.

Thailand is also planning to reopen to foreign visitors by creating so-called travel bubbles with countries that have also managed to contain the virus, though no target date was set, said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, a spokesman for the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration. 
""The curfew will be lifted effective on June 15 along with the easing of some activities,"" Taweesin said, adding that strict social distancing rules still needed to be observed in all public activities. 
Schools with less than 120 students, exhibition halls, music concerts, film productions, playgrounds, amusement parks, sports competitions without spectators and sales of alcohol in restaurants can resume next Monday, he said. 
Pubs, bars and karaoke outlets will remain closed, he said.
Travel could be reopened with countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand and some Middle East nations, Taweesin said, as well as neighbours like Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.
""The target group is business travellers as well as those wanting medical services and treatment in Thailand,"" he said. 
No date has been set on the easing of restrictions on international arrivals which are still banned until the end of June.
Thailand has been gradually easing restrictions in an effort to revive its economy and after appearing to contain the virus.

It has recorded 58 deaths so far and 3,129 confirmed cases - most of which have recovered.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia has eliminated the novel coronavirus in many parts of the country, its chief medical officer said on Friday, clearing the way for sports fans to soon return to stadiums and for foreign students to prepare to fly back to classes.
Australia recorded just 38 cases of the coronavirus over the past week, with travellers returning from overseas and already in quarantine accounting for more than half of them, said Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy.
""We have effectively achieved elimination at this time in many parts of the country,"" Murphy told reporters.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison last month announced a three-step plan to remove most lockdown measures by July. 
But with case numbers falling significantly, Morrison said restrictions on indoor gatherings would be loosened in July with crowds of up 10,000 people allowed in seated stadiums and a trial scheme to allow foreign students to return.
Details for students were being finalised but they would require quarantine, he said.
The return of international students would be a boost for universities facing big financial losses with the border closed. International education is Australia's fourth-largest foreign exchange earner, worth A$38 billion ($26 billion) annually.
The prospect of allowing international students back also reinforces Morrison's call for Australian states and territories to reopen internal borders.
He has grown frustrated by the reluctance of several states to open borders and he said if it continued the restart of international education would be delayed.
""If someone can't come to your state from Sydney, then someone can't come to your state from Singapore,"" he said.
But the path out of lockdown has been complicated by rallies to support the Black Lives Matter movement. Morrison said gatherings last weekend that attracted tens of thousands had delayed the process. 
A rally is scheduled in Sydney on Friday despite warnings of on-the-spot fines and arrest and more are planned.

Australia has had about 7,300 cases of the coronavirus and 102 deaths.

Statues glorifying colonialists and slave traders have come into focus as part of a broader movement inspired by the Black Lives Matter protests that started in the United States following the death of George Floyd. 
Floyd, 46, died on May 25 after a police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes, sparking anti-racism protests around the world.
Protests in Australia and New Zealand have focused on atrocities committed against indigenous people by European colonisers, with thousands of anti-racism protesters marching over the past week. 
The statue of British commander John Hamilton in the New Zealand city of Hamilton, named after him, was taken down a day after a Maori leader threatened to tear it down himself.
Mayor Paula Southgate said a growing number of people found the statue personally and culturally offensive.
""We can’t ignore what is happening all over the world and nor should we. At a time when we are trying to build tolerance and understanding between cultures and in the community, I don’t think the statue helps us to bridge those gaps,"" Southgate said.
Hamilton led a regiment at the Battle of Gate Pā between the colonial government and Maori tribes in the 1860s, where he was killed.
There had been repeated calls by the Maori community to remove the statue. It was vandalised in 2018. 
However, not everyone agreed with the idea of taking down statues. Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters called it a ""wave of idiocy"".

“A country learns from its mistakes and triumphs and its people should have the knowledge and maturity to distinguish between the two,” he said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Decades after she was sent for adoption in the United States, Kara Bos’ quest to find her birth parents in South Korea moved a step closer on Friday when a Seoul court ruled that a South Korean man was her biological father.
The ruling is the first of its kind in South Korea, which Amnesty International once dubbed the ""longest and largest supplier of international adoptees"".
It sets the stage for potentially thousands of other adoptees to be officially registered as children of their birth parents, with implications for inheritance and citizenship laws.
While laws vary widely from country to country, many jurisdictions are providing more information to adopted children about their biological parents. Advocates say South Korea's policies remain relatively restrictive. 
Bos, whose birth name is Kang Mee-sook, broke into tears as she left the courtroom. Removing a medical mask, she said in Korean: ""Mom. Can you recognise my face? Please come to me."" 
Bos is one of more than 200,000 Korean children adopted overseas in the past 60 years, and her struggle to identify her parents highlights the challenges for many adoptees, said Rev. Do-hyun Kim, who heads KoRoot, a charity that works with adoptees.
""I think Kara’s journey, Kara’s fight, is meaningful because it reminds us that parents, society, and the state itself has public responsibility to clearly inform a child born in South Korean society about their roots,"" he said.
The ruling officially registers Bos as the child of a man who, according to a DNA test ordered by the court earlier this year, is 99.9981% likely her biological father.
That designation could entitle Bos to inheritance. The ruling could also lead to more adoptees with limited or no records to apply for South Korea citizenship, according to the Justice Ministry. 
The man was identified only by his surname, with no contact details and Bos said the family wished to remain anonymous.
Bos said with the positive paternity test and the court ruling, the family finally agreed she could meet her father as soon as next week. 
LONG SEARCH FOR ANSWERS
In 1983, a two-year-old Bos was found abandoned in a market south of Seoul. Less than a year later, she was adopted by an American family. 
Bos, who now lives in the Netherlands with her Dutch husband, knew from childhood she was adopted. Her search for her biological parents only began after the birth of her own daughter, who made Bos realize what it would mean to abandon a child at that age.
“At that point I realized that there is trauma involved in adoption, and it is much more complex than the saviour story,"" Bos said.
After several years of searching archives in South Korea, a break came in 2016 when a genealogy website matched her to a young South Korean man, whose grandfather was found to be Bos' biological father.
Bos said she took the case to court after exhausting all other ways of trying to speak to him and his family to find out about her mother.
“I even went to one of their houses and begged, literally, on my knees. And they called the police on me.”
Bos said she would not sign away any rights to inheritance but her primary goal was to speak to her father and eventually identify her mother.

“Without that legal help, I would still be in the dark,” Bos said. “I would still have no options.”

""We are very sorry for the distress we have caused the PKKP in relation to Juukan Gorge and our first priority remains rebuilding trust with the PKKP,"" Jacques said in a statement, referring to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people.
The apology marked Jacques' first public comments on the event since it occurred more than two weeks ago. Head of iron ore Chris Salisbury had previously expressed the miner's remorse, although stopped short of saying Rio had done anything wrong in an interview with Australia media. 
With state government approval, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed two caves at Juukan Gorge that had previously contained evidence of continual human habitation stretching back 46,000 years as part of its Brockman mine expansion in the iron-rich Pilbara region.
Australia's Senate agreed on Thursday to begin a national inquiry into how the destruction of a cultural and historically significant site occurred. Under terms of the inquiry the joint standing committee on Northern Australia must report back by Sept. 30.
""Rio Tinto will fully cooperate with the inquiry,"" Jacques said his statement.
The miner said it would also continue to support reforms to Western Australia's Aboriginal Heritage Act, under which permission to disturb the sites was granted in a process that denies traditional owners right of appeal.
""Rio Tinto has a long history of working in partnership and creating shared value with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities around our operations and across Australia more broadly. We remain absolutely committed to continuing to do so,"" Jacques said.

716,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 11:22PM ET</span>",How a vaccine made of mosquito spit could help stop the next epidemic,"By Clare Baldwin
(Reuters) - Five years ago, in an office complex with a giant sculpture of a mosquito just northwest of Phnom Penh, Jessica Manning struck on a novel idea. Rather than spend more years in what felt like a futile search for a malaria vaccine, she would take on all mosquito-borne pathogens at once.
Her idea revolved around mosquito spit.
Building on the work of colleagues and other scientists, Manning, a clinical researcher for the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, believed she could use pieces of mosquito saliva protein to build a universal vaccine. 
The vaccine, if it pans out, would protect against all of the pathogens the insects inject into humans - malaria, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, West Nile, Mayaro viruses and anything else that may emerge.
""We need more innovative tools,"" said Manning. A vaccine like this would be ""the Holy Grail.""
On Thursday, The Lancet published the initial results of this work with her colleagues: the first-ever clinical trial of a mosquito spit vaccine in humans.
The trial showed that an Anopheles mosquito-based vaccine was safe and that it triggered antibody and cellular responses.
Michael McCracken, a researcher not involved in the study, called the initial results ""foundational.""
""This is big, important work,"" said McCracken, who studies immune responses to mosquito-borne viruses at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland. ""Mosquitoes are arguably the deadliest animal on Earth.""
Malaria alone kills more than 400,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Those deaths occur mostly in poor countries that do not receive as much vaccine research and funding. Because of global warming, however, those mosquitoes that thrive in the tropics are moving into more countries each year. 
The global disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought a sharp focus to infectious diseases and vaccine research. One of the key areas of concern are pathogens transmitted by mosquitoes.
The novel coronavirus, believed to have originated in bats, has so far infected more than 7.4 million people and killed nearly 420,000 worldwide. The Asian Development Bank estimates the pandemic could cost the global economy as much as $8.8 trillion.
TARGETING THE CARRIER
Manning's research is specific to mosquitoes, but is an example of how scientists are broadening their thinking about how to tackle infectious diseases, and the new types of tools they are developing. 
What Manning is looking for is called a vector-based vaccine. A vector is the living organism - like a mosquito - that transmits a pathogen such as malaria - between humans, or from animals to humans.
All existing vaccines for humans target a pathogen. Manning's goes after the vector.
The idea is to train the body's immune system to recognize the saliva proteins and mount a response that would weaken or prevent an infection.
Scientists have known for decades that mosquito spit helps establish mosquito-borne infections and enhance their severity. Just recently, scientists have begun to exploit this.
A study of macaque monkeys published in 2015 showed vaccination with sand fly saliva reduced leishmaniasis lesion size and parasite load. A study of mice published in 2018 showed immunization with Anopheles mosquito spit protected against malaria. Another mouse study published last year showed immunization with Aedes mosquito saliva improved survival against the Zika virus. 
The study published in The Lancet was conducted in 2017.
The Phase I trial conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, tested for safety and side effects in 49 healthy volunteers.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive one of two versions of the vaccine or a placebo. After a few weeks, hungry mosquitoes were placed on the arms of study participants. The study measured immune response to the mosquito spit proteins but did not involve pathogens. 
More trials are needed to determine the effect the mosquito spit vaccine would have against actual pathogens.
No systemic safety concerns were identified. One participant developed an 8-centimeter (3.15 inches) reddened area around the injection site and was treated with steroids and antihistamines.
""I'm not as worried about redness as I would be about something more systemic like fever, headache, muscle aches, nausea or vomiting,"" said Stephen Thomas, an infectious diseases expert at SUNY Upstate Medical University who was not involved with the study.
Thomas has previously worked on dengue vaccine programs for the U.S. Department of Defense and helped manage its response to Ebola and the Zika virus. 
Another scientist at the University of Maryland is running a follow-up trial with more mosquito spit proteins and a different vaccine formulation.
Meanwhile, Manning has returned to Cambodia and is running a field study to identify vaccine-candidate spit proteins in Aedes mosquitoes. She also has a separate project sequencing the genomes of all pathogens found in Aedes and Culex mosquitoes, some of which can infect humans. 

One worrying discovery so far? ""They carry a ton of different viruses that we are only just discovering.""

717,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>",'This is about livelihoods': U.S. virus hotspots reopen despite second wave specter,"By Andrew Hay
(Reuters) - Facing budget shortfalls and double-digit unemployment, governors of U.S. states that are COVID-19 hotspots on Thursday pressed ahead with economic reopenings that have raised fears of a second wave of infections.
The moves by governors of states such as Florida and Arizona came as Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the United States could not afford to let the novel coronavirus shut its economy again and global stocks tanked on worries of a pandemic resurgence.  
As Florida reported its highest daily tally of new coronavirus cases on Thursday, Governor Ron DeSantis unveiled a plan to restart public schools at ""full capacity"" in the autumn, arguing the state's economy depended on it.
North Carolina reported record COVID-19 hospitalizations for a fifth straight day on Thursday, a day after legislators passed a bill to reopen gyms, fitness centers and bars in a state where more than one in ten workers are unemployed.
Governors of hotspot states face pressure to fire up economies facing fiscal year 2021 budget shortfalls of up to 30% below pre-pandemic projections in the case of New Mexico, according to data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities think tank. Nevada, which has seen cases increase by nearly a third in the past two weeks, is suffering 28% unemployment, based on U.S Bureau of Labor statistics.
""This is about saving lives, this is also about livelihoods in the state of Arizona,"" Governor Doug Ducey told a news briefing, adding that a second shutdown of the economy was ""not under discussion"" despite official figures showing a 211% rise in virus cases over the past 14 days. 
About half a dozen states including Texas and Arizona are grappling with rising numbers of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds.
Ducey and Texas Governor Greg Abbott say their hospitals have the capacity to avoid the experiences of New York, where the system was stretched to near breaking point as some COVID patients were treated in hallways and exhausted workers stacked bodies in refrigerated trailers. 
'FOOT ON THE BRAKE'
A second wave of coronavirus deaths is expected to begin in the United States in September, the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation said on Thursday, citing a surge in mobility since April. Its latest model projects 170,000 deaths by Oct. 1, with a possible range between 133,000 and 290,000. 
A note of caution came from Utah, where Governor Gary Herbert said most of the state would pause its reopening after a 126% rise in cases over the past two weeks. 
Austin, Texas on Thursday also said it would likely extend stay-at-home and mask orders past June 15 after the state reported its highest new case count the previous day. Austin health officials blamed a record week of infections on easing business restrictions and Memorial Day gatherings.
There was no talk of new shutdowns.
In New Mexico, Health Secretary Kathy Kunkel pointed to outbreaks at the Otero County Prison Facility, as well as in nursing homes and assisted living facilities, as factors behind an uptick in cases.

""It means a little bit of a foot on the brake, watch carefully for the next couple of weeks, not much in the way of major changes in what we're doing,"" said Human Services Secretary David Scrase.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cruise missiles used in several attacks on oil facilities and an international airport in Saudi Arabia last year were of ""Iranian origin,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the Security Council in a report seen by Reuters on Thursday.
Guterres also said several items in U.S. seizures of weapons and related materiel in November 2019 and February 2020 were ""of Iranian origin.""
Some have design characteristics similar to those also produced by a commercial entity in Iran, or bear Farsi markings, Guterres said, and some were delivered to the country between February 2016 and April 2018.
He said that ""these items may have been transferred in a manner inconsistent"" with a 2015 Security Council resolution that enshrines Tehran's deal with world powers to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons. 
Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the U.N. report. 
Washington is pushing the 15-member council to extend an arms embargo on Iran that is due to expire in October under the nuclear deal. Council veto-powers Russia and China have already signaled their opposition to the move.
Guterres reports twice a year to the Security Council on the implementation of an arms embargo on Iran and other restrictions that remained in place after the deal. 
The U.N. chief said the United Nations examined debris of weapons used in attacks on a Saudi oil facility in Afif in May, on the Abha international airport in June and August and on the  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) oil facilities in Khurais and Abqaiq in September. 
""The Secretariat assesses that the cruise missiles and/or parts thereof used in the four attacks are of Iranian origin,"" Guterres wrote. Guterres also said that drones used in the May and September attacks were ""of Iranian origin.""
He also said the United Nations had observed that some items in the two U.S. seizures ""were identical or similar"" to those found in the debris of the cruise missiles and the drones used in the 2019 attacks on Saudi Arabia.
Guterres said that in a May 22 letter, Iran's U.N. envoy said ""it has not been the policy of Iran to export weapons in violation of relevant arms embargoes of the Security Council"" and that it will ""continue to actively cooperate with the United Nations in this regard.""
The Security Council is due to discuss Guterres' report later this month. 
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft has said she will circulate a draft resolution to extend the arms embargo on Iran soon. If Washington is unsuccessful, it has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran under the nuclear deal, even though it quit the accord in 2018. Diplomats say Washington would likely face a tough, messy battle. 
Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions. 

""I call upon all Member States to avoid provocative rhetoric and actions that may have a negative impact on regional stability,"" Guterres wrote in the 14-page report.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday authorized U.S. economic and travel sanctions against International Criminal Court employees involved in an investigation into whether American forces committed war crimes in Afghanistan.
In announcing the president's executive order, Trump administration officials said the Hague-based tribunal threatens to infringe on U.S. national sovereignty and accused Russia of manipulating it to serve Moscow's ends.
""We cannot, we will not stand by as our people are threatened by a kangaroo court,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in announcing the move.
""I have a message to many close allies in the world. Your people could be next, especially those from NATO countries who fight terrorism in Afghanistan right alongside us,"" he said.
In a statement, the ICC said Washington's move was the ""latest in a series of unprecedented attacks on the court.""
""These attacks constitute an escalation and an unacceptable attempt to interfere with the rule of law and the Court's judicial proceedings,"" the ICC said.
Foreign Minister Stef Blok of the Netherlands, a member of the Western security alliance, wrote on Twitter he was ""very disturbed"" by the U.S. stance, saying his nation supported the ICC, which he described as ""crucial in the fight against impunity.""
The sanctions that can be imposed under the order include freezing the U.S. assets of those who help the ICC investigate or prosecute American citizens without U.S. consent, as well as barring them and their families from visiting the United States.
Neither Pompeo nor any of the top officials who were present at the announcement - Defense Secretary Mark Esper, national security adviser Robert O'Brien and Attorney General William Barr - took questions from reporters.
ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians by the Taliban, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and, to a lesser extent, by U.S. forces and the CIA. The ICC investigation was given the go-ahead in March.
The ICC decided to investigate after a preliminary examination by prosecutors in 2017 found reasonable grounds to believe war crimes were committed in Afghanistan and that the court has jurisdiction. 
Rights activists assailed Trump's move. Andrea Prasow, the Washington director for Human Rights Watch, said the action ""demonstrates contempt for the global rule of law"" and represents a ""blatant attempt at obstruction.""
'LOW POINT'
The ICC was established in 2002 by the international community to prosecute war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. It has jurisdiction only if a member state is unable or unwilling to prosecute atrocities itself. The United States has never been a member of the court. 
The U.S. action is the latest under Trump taking aim at an international body. Trump, who has promoted an ""America First"" policy, late last month said he would end the U.S. relationship with the World Health Organization.
Afghanistan is a member of the ICC, though Kabul has argued that any war crimes should be prosecuted locally.
Speaking at the U.S. announcement, Barr said the Justice Department ""has received substantial credible information that raises serious concerns about a long history of financial corruption and malfeasance"" in the ICC prosecutor's office. He provided no details.
He also said the court was being manipulated by Russia, but did not elaborate on how.
John Bellinger, the State Department's former top lawyer under Republican former President George W. Bush, said the two sides could have avoided the conflict but chose not to. 
""It's unfortunate that the long-running U.S. dispute with the ICC has reached this new low point. ... It's not surprising that the Trump administration has reacted forcefully with threatened sanctions, especially in an election year,"" he said.

The Trump administration imposed travel restrictions and other sanctions against ICC employees a year ago.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea sees little use maintaining a personal relationship between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump if Washington sticks to hostile policies, state media reported on Friday - the two-year anniversary of the leaders' first summit. 
U.S. policies prove Washington remains a long-term threat to the North Korean state and its people and North Korea will develop more reliable military forces to counter that threat, Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.
Trump and Kim exchanged insults and threats during 2017 as North Korea made large advances in its nuclear and missile programme and the United States responded by leading an international effort to tighten sanctions. 
Relations improved significantly around the Singapore summit in June 2018, the first time a sitting American president met with a North Korean leader, but the statement that came out of the meeting was light on specifics. 
A second summit in February 2019 in Vietnam failed to reach a deal because of conflicts over U.S. calls for North Korea to completely give up its nuclear weapons, and North Korean demands for swift sanctions relief.
Ri said in retrospect the Trump administration appears to have been focusing on only scoring political points while seeking to isolate and suffocate North Korea, and threatening it with preemptive nuclear strikes and regime change.
""Never again will we provide the U.S. chief executive with another package to be used for achievements without receiving any returns,"" he said. ""Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.""
The U.S. State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
On Thursday, a State Department spokesperson told South Korea's Yonhap news agency the United States remains committed to dialogue with North Korea, and is open to a ""flexible approach to reach a balanced agreement.""
ELECTION PRESSURE
On Thursday North Korea criticized the United States for commenting on inter-Korean affairs, and said Washington should stay quiet if it wants the upcoming presidential election to go smoothly.
North Korea is likely to try to increase pressure on the United States ahead of the upcoming election, said Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until early in the Trump administration.
""Trump’s claim to have ‘solved’ the North Korea problem gives them leverage,"" he said.
Ramon Pacheco Pardo, a Korea expert at King's College London, said Ri's statement shows North Korea still sees all options on the table, from a proper diplomatic process to further developing its nuclear programme.
""North Korea continues to need a proper deal more than the U.S.,"" Pacheco Pardo said on Twitter. ""That hasn't changed.""
Ri said North Korea's desire to open a new cooperative era runs as deep as ever, but that the situation on the Korean peninsula is daily taking a turn for the worse.
""The U.S. professes to be an advocate for improved relations with the DPRK, but in fact, it is hell-bent on only exacerbating the situation,"" Ri said.

The official name of North Korea is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

The plans made by Buckland and Interior Minister Priti Patel will lead to offenders being jailed within 24 hours of arrest to defuse disorder if they are found causing vandalism, criminal damage or assault on police officers, the report said.
The British government will publish a consultation on plans to double maximum sentences for assaulting emergency workers to two years, according to the newspaper.
Anti-racism protests have swept across the United States, Britain and other parts of the world following the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, on May 25 after a Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
London was hit by a series of riots in the summer of 2011 after police shot dead a man who was a known criminal. An inquest found that police acted lawfully in that case.
In Britain, the protests over Floyd's death have reignited a debate about the country's imperialist past and a number of statues of those associated with that past have been taken down.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said earlier that more needs to be done to eradicate prejudice and create opportunity for all in Britain.

However, he added that such demonstrations should not lead to violence, unlawful actions or the disregarding of social distancing put in place to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian shoppers lined up for hours and crowded into malls as they reopened on Thursday in the country's two largest cities, epicenter of a still surging coronavirus epidemic in the South American nation.
Traffic jams formed in streets crowded with pedestrians outside shopping malls in Sao Paulo, where business resumed at 4 p.m. for four hours after 83 days of closed doors.
Inside stores, strict distancing rules were followed and most shoppers wore protective masks even though Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the gravity of the virus and pushed local authorities to lift quarantine measures.
According to the Brazilian shopping centers association Abrasce, lockdowns have cost the country's 577 malls more than 25 billion reais ($5 billion) in lost business. 
Tens of thousands of jobs have been lost and 10% of the shops have folded for good, the lobby group said.
In Rio de Janeiro, malls opened a week earlier than planned as businesses starved of income pushed authorities to lift restrictions even as public health experts warned it was too early to avoid a resurgence of contagion.
""I came to buy something quickly and them I'm leaving,"" said Mariana, in a well spaced line outside a mall on Rio de Janeiro's south side where a shopping chain manager said people were not lingering to window shop after purchases.
Brazil has had the world's worst outbreak of the pandemic after the United States, with 40,919 deaths and more than 802,828 confirmed cases as of Thursday. Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states have suffered 42% of the fatalities.
Many shops and businesses opened on Thursday even though it was the national holiday of Corpus Christi.
In the capital Brasilia, a mass was held in the Catholic Cathedral for the Corpus Christi feast, but attendance was cut to a third of the seats to maintain distancing. The priest handed out communion wafers but did not place them in the mouths of the faithful.
In Rio and Sao Paulo, shopping malls required masks and took people's temperature. Shops limited access to 20% of capacity and provided alcohol hand disinfectant for shoppers. Parking was also limited to 20% of car spaces.
Cinemas in the malls were not allowed to open yet and eateries in food plazas could only sell meals for delivery.
""The rules on hygiene and distancing have to be strictly followed because the pandemic is not over and all shoppers must be aware of that,"" said Vander Giordano, vice president of Multiplan, owner of 19 malls with 5,800 shops.
""We are not going to allow crowds to form,"" he told Reuters.

724,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Mexico's human rights commission calls for investigation into police custody death,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) on Thursday called for an investigation into the death of a man who they said died in police custody in the southeastern state of Veracruz last month.
Mexicans took to the streets of Mexico City and Guadalajara last week to protest police brutality following similar demonstrations in the United States. They called for authorities to be held accountable for police custody deaths in Mexico.
Carlos Navarro, 33, was detained by the police in Veracruz last month, according to his family, the commission said. They said his dead body was later returned to them, showing signs of beatings.
The CNDH called for an investigation and punishment for Navarro's death, calling it a ""reprehensible act."" The office of the governor of Veracruz did not immediately return a request for comment.
The rights commission also said it was concerned that ""authorities in charge of citizen security use force in a way that is incompatible with international human rights standards.""
CNDH also condemned a lack of training and supervision of police that it said had caused irreparable damage to the lives and personal integrity of detained people.
Earlier this week, local media reported that a 16-year-old boy was shot dead by police in the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca after he left home to buy soda. 
The office of the governor of Oaxaca did not immediately return a request for comment. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify the events in Veracruz and Oaxaca.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - ""Are you with anarchist groups?"" was one typical question. ""Are you in antifa?"" was another.
A group of lawyers say New York City police and federal agents may have violated a longstanding order limiting their investigations of a person's political beliefs by asking these and other questions of some protesters detained last week for violating an 8 p.m. curfew.
This could run afoul of the U.S. Constitution's protection of freedom of political expression, the lawyers said in a letter to the New York Police Department's legal counsel, seeking information about the interrogations. 
""Where police forces are allowed to maintain files about people's politics, it leads to fascistic control or attempts to control the population,"" said Martin Stolar, one of the lawyers who signed the letter. ""It's privacy of thought. If you erode that, you are in very dangerous territory.""
Stolar and his colleagues cited a 1985 federal court order aimed at ending an NYPD practice of building dossiers on political dissidents, which sharply curtails how police gather information on people's political or religious beliefs.
Stolar was one of the original lawyers involved in securing the court order, known as the Handschu consent decree, as part of the settlement of a 1971 class-action lawsuit that has remained active ever since in order to ensure compliance.
The city's Law Department, which represents the NYPD in litigation, said it was examining the concerns.
""The NYPD is committed to adhering to the Handschu Guidelines,"" department spokesman Nicholas Paolucci wrote in an email.
Officers from the NYPD's Intelligence Bureau questioned about 100 out of about 1,000 people arrested between June 1 and June 4 in connection with nationwide protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25, said Mary Frances O'Donnell, a police department spokeswoman.
""The interviews sought to determine if there was communication between, or coordination, with anarchists and looters,"" she wrote in answers in Reuters' questions.
The interviews were conducted ""after two nights of widespread looting, attacks on police officers resulting in injuries, and the vandalism of 235 police vehicles including 16 which were set on fire,"" she wrote.
She declined to answer questions about the Handschu guidelines and the role of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
FBI officials in New York and Washington declined to comment.
Stolar helped file the original lawsuit that gave rise to the Handschu order, which contended that the police department had been amassing secret dossiers on black power activists, anti-Vietnam War protesters and other dissidents.
Under the order, the NYPD agreed that it could only investigate someone's political activity if it had ""specific information"" that he or she had committed a crime, or were planning to. 
Such investigations can only be carried out by the department's Intelligence Bureau with authorization by senior police officials, and must be reported to an oversight committee that includes a civilian lawyer appointed by the mayor.
In recent years, the order has been used to bring legal challenges against the NYPD's questioning of protesters marching against the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the department's surveillance of Muslims after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
Both New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, and U.S. Attorney General Bill Barr, a Republican, have said that a small number of anarchists, antifa or other leftists harmed the nationwide protests by trying to stoke violence. 

Antifa refers to a nebulous international anti-fascism movement whose adherents seek to dismantle entities they see as racist or anti-Semitic.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - The United States is using the case of a senior Chinese telecoms executive who was arrested in Vancouver on a U.S. warrant 18 months ago to create friction between China and Canada, China's envoy to Canada said on Thursday.
""The U.S. has been taking advantage of Canada, and the U.S. is the trouble maker of China-Canada relations,"" the Chinese envoy to Ottawa, Cong Peiwu, told Reuters in a telephone interview. 
Huawei Technologies Co's Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese citizen and daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested on a bank fraud warrant issued by U.S. authorities. Meng says she is innocent.
Asked whether he thought Canada's judiciary was independent, Cong pointed to comments U.S. President Donald Trump made in December 2018, which he said showed the Meng case was ""a political incident rather than a simple judicial case.""
In that interview (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump/trump-says-would-intervene-in-arrest-of-chinese-executive-idUSKBN1OB01P), Trump said he would intervene with the U.S. Justice Department in the Meng case if it would help secure a trade deal with Beijing.
""We believe that actually this is a grave political incident plotted by the United States to bring down Chinese hi-tech companies,"" the ambassador said.
Cong did not say whether China would retaliate for a Canadian court's decision last month, which will prolong Meng's legal battle to avoid extradition.
Shortly after Meng's arrest, Beijing detained two Canadians on national security charges and halted imports of canola seed.
When asked about the Meng case, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has emphasized the country's judiciary is independent, while calling for the release of the two Canadians, businessman Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat.

The Chinese envoy said the two detained Canadians were ""in good health,"" but consular visits were still suspended due to coronavirus restrictions and ""will be resumed when the situation gets better.""

The pound slid to about 5,000 to the dollar on Thursday and has lost 70% of its value since October, when Lebanon descended into a financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to stability since the 1975-90 civil war.
From the northern city of Tripoli to the southern city of Sidon, Lebanese chanted against the political elite and set fire to major roadways across the country in the most widespread unrest since a coronavirus lockdown imposed in mid-March.
""We can't afford to eat or pay rent or anything like that, so we will stay here until the dollar rate goes down and we get all our demands,"" said Manal, a protester in central Beirut.
Protesters in Tripoli, Lebanon's second-biggest city, threw petrol bombs at a central bank building, setting it ablaze and prompting security forces to fire tear gas, according to witnesses.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab called for an emergency Cabinet meeting to be held on Friday to discuss the monetary situation, a statement from his office said.
The crisis, rooted in decades of corruption and waste, has brought soaring food prices and unemployment and capital controls that have severed Lebanese from their hard currency savings.
The unrest comes as Beirut holds talks with the International Monetary Fund for a reform programme it hopes will secure billions of dollars in financing and put its economy back on track.

The senate leader of Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), Ricardo Monreal, on Wednesday presented the plan to combine energy regulator CRE, antitrust watchdog the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE), and telecoms regulator IFT.
""If we're going to save money, I'm for it. Because there was a lot of waste in the creation of (regulatory) bodies,"" Lopez Obrador said at a regular daily news conference.
Lopez Obrador has promised to reduce public spending to free up more resources for the poor and his flagship projects.
The merged body would be called the National Institute of Markets and Competition for Wellbeing, have five board members and would generate annual savings of 500 million pesos ($22.4 million), according to a document presented by Monreal.
The opposition National Action Party criticized the proposal as a power grab and a member of the central bank's board nominated by Lopez Obrador warned it could undermine oversight.
""The autonomous bodies tasked with competition and regulation face powerful economic agents in the market,"" the board member, Gerardo Esquivel, said on Twitter.
""That's why we should think about how to strengthen them so they can do their jobs better, and not how to weaken them or undermine their authority,"" added Esquivel, whose wife, Graciela Marquez, is Mexico's economy minister.
Lopez Obrador criticized his predecessors for backing large, bureaucratic regulatory bodies.
They were ""supposedly autonomous, supposedly independent bodies, and most of the budget went there,"" he said.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Most weekdays since the coronavirus broke out in Bolivia, Harvard-educated Luis Fernando Ortiz leaves his job managing the country's biggest freight forwarding agent and dons a hazmat suit to go in search of a body. 
Ortiz, 37, is a member of the ""Goodbye Brigades"", teams of volunteers that have sprung up around the impoverished country to pick up bodies of people who have died from coronavirus but whose families are too poor to pay for their burials. 
The brigades, called ""Avei"" meaning goodbye in a local indigenous language, coordinate corpse collections with relatives and the police, and transport them to the nearest cemetery. 
They have also designed rudimentary coffins made from white cardboard, with an accompanying cardboard cross stuck on top, to donate to poor families and overwhelmed municipalities.
At burial sites, bulldozers toil overtime to keep up with demand for new graves. In Ortiz`s city, Santa Cruz, a verdant stretch of lawn fringed by palm trees where relatives used to congregate after funerals has been dug up to make way for a mass grave, into which the teams slide body after body. 
""This week alone we have picked up 13 bodies and the authorities say more infections and so more deaths are coming in the weeks ahead,"" Ortiz told Reuters as morgue workers swing one of a series of bodybags unloaded from a red pickup truck into the freshly-dug pit. 
Bolivia by Thursday had 14,644 confirmed coronavirus cases so far and 487 deaths, but as one of the countries where the fewest number of tests are being carried out, medical experts say the real numbers of those infected could be many times higher. 
The brigades were conceived by beneficiaries of a charity that gave grants to young Bolivians to help them study at universities in the United States or Europe, many of whom are now senior executives like Ortiz. 
Their founders were determined to avoid in Bolivia what happened to COVID-19 victims in Ecuador's largest city of Guayaquil, where bodies were sometimes left in the street or at relatives' homes after fatality rates spiked and the authorities could not work fast enough. 
Ortiz said everyone had a duty to help lessen the pain of the coronavirus outbreak. ""We are all being affected,"" he said. ""I have family members in intensive care. We`re trying to find a ventilator for my wife`s grandfather to save his life. Everything has collapsed.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - North Korea suggested on Thursday that United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres might be pretending to act like a drunk as the country slammed comments by his spokesman on Pyongyang's decision to sever hotlines with South Korea.
Guterres regretted North Korea's announcement on the hotlines, warning that such channels ""are necessary to avoid misunderstandings or miscalculations,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Wednesday.
""We cannot but express our astonishment over such reckless remarks - devoid of the common sense of judgment, let alone the basic knowledge of inter-Korean relations - coming out from the center of the United Nations,"" a spokesperson for North Korea's Foreign Affairs Ministry told KCNA state news agency.
Pyongyang's decision, announced on Tuesday, marks a new setback to stalled efforts to persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. For several days, North Korea had been lashing out at South Korea because it was not stopping defectors from sending leaflets and other material into the North.
""It is only the U.N. Secretary-General himself who would know whether he is pretending to blind himself to the articles of inter-Korean agreement on ceasing all hostilities against the other party or pretending to be knowingly drunken,"" the foreign affairs ministry spokesperson said. 
The spokesperson said the remarks from the U.N. ""cannot be overlooked"" and accused Guterres of siding with the United States by expressing inappropriate and biased views, adding: ""We never pardon anyone who dares to point a finger at our most precious and sacred Supreme Leadership.""
Dujarric declined to comment on the North Korean statement.
The United States said it was disappointed by Pyongyang's decision to cut the hotlines. North Korea said on Thursday the United States has no standing to comment on inter-Korean affairs, and it was in Washington's interest to stay quiet if it wants the upcoming presidential election to go smoothly.

North Korea has been subjected to U.N. sanctions since 2006. They have been strengthened by the 15-member Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

""International law requires that the authorities conduct prompt, effective and transparent investigations,"" it said in a statement. 
The Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations, retook control of Tarhouna on Friday after the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar pulled out. 
The GNA has said the Justice Ministry set up a committee to investigate the discovery of mass graves, but it has not yet said how many bodies have been found so far. 
Tarhouna had been held by the LNA-aligned Kani family, which controls a powerful local armed group known as the Kaniyat. When it was recaptured, dozens of bodies were also found in the town morgue, the GNA said. 
The town was captured during a sudden change in the military map that also drove the LNA from its last foothold in Tripoli and other northwestern towns 14 months after launching a campaign to capture the capital. 
The front line has since stabilised during recent days near the central coastal city of Sirte. 
Human Rights Watch Libya senior researcher Hanan Salah said the GNA should invite neutral international forensic experts to help preserve possible evidence of crimes and identify the remains. 
""We urge the GNA to follow through with their promise to investigate apparent mass graves in a speedy and transparent manner,"" she said.

Egypt's state press centre, which handles relations with foreign media, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mohamed Soltan, who was arrested in August 2013 and accused of crimes including spreading false information, filed a lawsuit against ex-Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi in the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia on June 1.
The complaint alleges Beblawi conspired to target Soltan because of his high profile role assisting international media covering political demonstrations in Egypt, and that he ""directed and monitored (Soltan's) illegal mistreatment"".
The lawsuit alleges that Soltan, who was released in 2015 and now works as a human rights advocate in Virginia, was tortured to the point of near death during 22 months of imprisonment. It seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages.
Beblawi, prime minister from 2013-14, resides in the United States where he sits on the board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). 
Efforts to contact Beblawi for comment, including through an IMF spokesman, were not immediately successful. The court docket did not list any legal representation for Beblawi.
U.S. law firm Lewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss said that about 20 officers from Egypt's National Security Agency raided and ransacked Soltan's uncles' homes in Berket el Sabaa city on Monday night, holding them and their families at gunpoint.
They demanded and obtained passwords and security codes to access their digital devices, emails and social media accounts, the firm said in a statement. 
""This is a clear attempt at interfering in a U.S. legal proceeding through retaliation, intimidation and harassment,"" lawyer Eric Lewis said in the statement.
Soltan, an Egyptian-American rights activist, was arrested in Egypt weeks after Muslim Brotherhood President Mohamed Mursi was deposed. 
Soltan had worked as an interpreter and assistant to Western media in Cairo's Rabaa Square (NYSE:SQ), where a sit-in to protest Mursi's ouster was violently dispersed, resulting in hundreds of deaths. His father is a senior Brotherhood figure who remains in prison in Egypt.

""The security raids at the homes of his relatives in Egypt follows a clear pattern of targeting relatives of dissidents abroad,"" said Joe Stork of Human Rights Watch, which also documented the raids.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leslie Batson, a white office administrator from Maryland, joined the thousands of marchers protesting the killing of George Floyd in Washington, D.C., last weekend after her children asked why the family had done nothing about racism. 
""This is my attempt to help elevate the voices of people of color, people who don't look like me and who don't benefit from the status quo,"" Batson, 42, said on Saturday, as her 9- and 11-year-old children hid shyly behind her. 
In recent days, white Americans have donned ""Black Lives Matter"" shirts, carried homemade signs, and shouted ""Hands up, Don't shoot"" in cities and small towns (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests-rural/protests-against-police-violence-sweep-across-small-town-america-idUSKBN23C28Z) across the United States. Sometimes they lay down in the streets, just as Floyd, an unarmed black man in handcuffs, lay face down and struggling to breathe as a white police officer knelt on his neck.
Books like ""White Fragility"" and ""The New Jim Crow"" are topping U.S. best-seller (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-books/books-about-racial-discrimination-become-best-sellers-as-u-s-protests-grow-idUSKBN23B1OT) lists, and social media is flooded (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-tiktok/tiktok-has-its-arab-spring-moment-as-teen-activism-overtakes-dance-moves-idUSKBN2392WX) with #BlackLivesMatter posts. Fortune 500 companies and sports franchises, predominantly run and owned by white Americans, voiced support (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-companies-insight/u-s-companies-vow-to-fight-racism-but-face-critics-on-diversity-idUSKBN23H1KW) for anti-racist activism, and the New York Stock Exchange held (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-nyse/nyse-holds-nearly-nine-minute-silence-in-honor-of-george-floyd-idUSKBN23G2IM) its longest moment of silence ever for Floyd. 
The United States has a long history of white participation in civil rights protests, but the current outpouring of support is unprecedented, historians and social scientists agree. 
That said, many question white Americans' long-term commitment to do the work to fight racism.
""Historically, when we see higher levels of participation from white folks in movements and moments like this, that participation falls off precipitously after we move away from the protest,"" said Charles McKinney, associate history professor and chair of Africana Studies at Rhodes College in Tennessee.
After civil rights activists leading protest marches in Selma, Alabama, in 1965 were beaten bloody by police, twice as many Americans polled expressed sympathy with protesters than with the state of Alabama, Pew Research noted (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/01/16/50-years-ago-mixed-views-about-civil-rights-but-support-for-selma-demonstrators). 
In a separate opinion poll at the same time, however, 45% believed the U.S. administration of President Lyndon Johnson was moving too fast on the voting rights and integration that protesters advocated.
McKinney is analyzing whether the high white protester turnout will translate into laws that aid the Black Lives Matter movement.
""In order for this to be the last racial inflection point... white America must end its sideline sympathy and assume full ownership of this problem,"" said Allyn Brooks LaSure, a former U.S. diplomat, and executive vice-president for communications at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a national coalition of civil and human rights groups.
That would include awkward conversations on family Zoom calls, in work conference rooms, and at Thanksgiving dinners, he recommends.

Reuters research shows (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-companies-insight/u-s-companies-vow-to-fight-racism-but-face-critics-on-diversity-idUSKBN23H1KW) some of the same U.S. companies have elevated few African Americans to top jobs; two centuries after it started, the NYSE's traders and management remain overwhelmingly white; an anti-lynching bill named after a black teen killed in 1955 failed to pass the U.S. Senate on June 5.
On June 8, senior Democrats, including House speaker Nancy Pelosi, donned kente cloth, a Ghanaian fabric that is a prominent symbol of African arts and culture, knelt in the U.S. Capitol building for nearly nine minutes of silence for Floyd. 
Charles Preston, a Chicago-based black activist and organizer, called the gesture ""ridiculous."" 
""I think it's a charade, it's hollow, it's empty and I don't understand what is the purpose of kneeling,"" he said. Politicians, he said, should push for policy changes that help African-Americans instead.
The very gesture, known as ""taking a knee,"" echoes the ""Black Power"" raised-fist salute that U.S. Olympic medalists Tommie Smith and John Carlos made on the medal podium at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics. 
Half a century later, it was still controversial when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest police brutality and racial injustice in 2016. Years after leaving (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nfl-football-kaepernick-timeline/playing-career-of-colin-kaepernick-idUSKBN1XR019) the team, he has yet to be picked up by another.
A NEW GENERATION 
Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, said veteran activists have doubts this phase will endure for long. But she said the level of anger and frustration after Floyd's death is new.
    ""This is a generation seeing mass shootings in schools, a divisive president, black people being killed and they are pushing back,"" she said.
And the demographics of the country itself are changing. 
One in 10 eligible voters in the 2020 electorate, about 22 million Americans, will be part of a new generation that is the most ethnically diverse in U.S. history, Pew reports (https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/on-the-cusp-of-adulthood-and-facing-an-uncertain-future-what-we-know-about-gen-z-so-far), with just 52% of the generation white.

""This is not an unsurmountable task,"" said Kyle Holman, a 21-year-old white student in Washington, D.C., who protested on Saturday. ""If we can just start by acknowledging that things can be really bad for people of color, have scales fall from our eyes, we will move this debate forward,"" he said.

Mercy Corps, which supports vulnerable communities in Congo with cash, vouchers and other aid, launched an internal investigation in 2018 after detecting signs of fraud, a spokesman said.
It has since ""terminated team members who were involved, complicit or who failed to report knowledge of potential corruption,"" a spokesperson said, estimating that some $639,000 may have been gone astray.
Mercy Corps, which is headquartered in Portland, Oregon, said it has pushed for a sector-wide response after its investigation found that other humanitarian groups running cash programmes in eastern Congo may have been affected by similar fraud. 
UK's Department for International Development (DFID), who contributed to the pool of funding used by Mercy Corps, declined to comment.
An unpublished review funded by DFID found ""exaggerated reports of displacements, collusion between aid workers and local communities, and distributions of aid to ineligible beneficiaries,"" according to reporting by The New Humanitarian news agency.
DFID was informed about the allegations in January 2019, a source from the UK government said, and immediately withdrew funding from the pool, which closed down some months later.
Mercy Corps established new fraud mitigation measures and tightened controls before resuming cash and voucher programmes in Congo in early 2019, the group said.
Corruption is endemic in the vast central African state. An aid worker with knowledge of DFID's review said there was a need to balance the risks of fraud against the urgency for rapid responses in emergency situations.
Some studies suggest losses from cash-transfers are around 2% on average, compared with up to 50% for some other forms of aid, according to the Cash Learning Partnership, a network of humanitarian groups focusing on cash and voucher assistance.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A divided Senate Judiciary Committee approved sweeping subpoena power on Thursday for a politically charged congressional probe of an FBI investigation into Republican President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and its contacts with Russia. 
The Republican-led panel voted 12-10 along party lines to grant its chairman, Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), authority to subpoena dozens of former Obama administration officials including former FBI Director James Comey and former national security adviser Susan Rice.
Republicans turned away multiple efforts by Democrats to gain authority to subpoena Trump advisers and former aides, including his current attorney Rudy Giuliani, former attorney Michael Cohen, former national security adviser Michael Flynn and former campaign advisers Roger Stone and Rick Gates. 
Trump and his Republican allies contend that the probe code-named ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" which led to the 22-month Russia investigation by then-U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller, was a corrupt effort to undermine Trump's candidacy and later his presidency.
""This is really unprecedented,"" said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the panel's top Democrat, who accused Graham of negating committee rules that require separate approval for individual subpoenas. 
Graham said Democrats were simply trying to stop his probe. ""I'm not going to be stopped,"" he said.
The Russia probe overshadowed Trump's presidency. A Justice Department watchdog said in December that investigators made numerous errors but found no evidence of political bias. 
Democrats view the current Senate probe as a political ploy to harm Trump political rival Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee in the Nov. 3 election, noting that Biden's campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, is among the Republican subpoena targets.

Thursday's vote came just over a week after former U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein defended the Mueller investigation before the same panel. Mueller found numerous contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia, but concluded there was not enough evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy.

The case has gripped the nation with Kamerhe, a top power-broker in Congolese politics for decades, appearing in court dressed in prison fatigues for a trial broadcast live on state television.
Kamerhe, who made a pact to back President Felix Tshisekedi in a 2018 election in the expectation of succeeding him, has denied all accusations of wrongdoing in the government's flagship building project, known as the 100-days programme.
Prosecutor Kisula Betika Yeye Adler asked the judge to sentence Kamerhe to a maximum of 20 years for embezzlement and other corruption charges.
Adler also requested Kamerhe be barred from holding public office for 10 years after completing his sentence, a move that would scupper his political ambitions and likely further destabilise the ruling coalition.
Kamerhe has become the most powerful politician to face graft charges in Congo. His supporters say the case is politically motivated, aimed at blocking his chances of challenging Tshisekedi at the next election in 2023.

The date of the verdict is not yet known.

According to the constitution the speaker of the House is supposed to take over, but there has been uncertainty as to who is in charge. The government announced on Tuesday that Nkurunziza, 55, had died of a heart attack although it was not clear which day he died.
Nkurunziza had been due to hand over power in August to President-elect Evariste Ndayishimiye, who successfully stood for the ruling party in elections last month.
The cabinet decided at an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Wednesday that the constitutional court should guide the country and ""show modalities of filling the post,"" the government statement said. 
Burundi watchers have been keen to see whether the country's powerful cabal of army generals and security chiefs who propped up Nkurunziza during his 15-year rule remain united over the succession.
Nkurunziza was a former rebel leader whose rule was marked by widespread brutality and repression against his opponents. The economy is also in tatters after donors, whose aid was a key source of government revenue, shunned it amid the human rights violations.

Authorities have not yet announced a date for Nkurunziza's burial.

One man has so far been charged with the murder that sparked outrage in the British region where a 1998 peace deal mostly ended three decades of sectarian violence that cost some 3,600 lives. Police say the man who fired the shot which killed McKee remains at large.
The New IRA, one of a small number of groups that oppose the peace accord, said one of its members shot the 29-year-old reporter dead when they opened fire in the direction of police during a riot McKee was watching. 
""I know who was involved. I know who the gunman is. The New IRA should not mistake a sensitive and quietly conducted investigation with one that lacks determination and energy,"" Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said in a statement. 
""As the net gradually tightens, those who fired the gun, transported it, moved it, stored it, carried it, hid it or interacted with it in any way, should expect the police at their door.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan detectives have arrested three police officers for allegedly whipping a woman and dragging her along behind a motorbike, the Directorate of Criminal Investigations said on Thursday, after footage of the incident went viral online.
""Three @PoliceKE officers were yesterday arrested by @DCI_Kenya Detectives following circulation of a video depicting a woman being whipped & dragged on a motorbike in Kuresoi South Sub-County,"" the police directorate tweeted on Thursday.
The video of police beating 21-year-old Mercy Cherono emerged after several days of small protests in the Kenyan capital over extrajudicial police killings in Kenya and against U.S. police for the death of George Floyd. 
Brutality allegations against the Kenyan police are common and the Independent Police Oversight Authority, an independent government watchdog supported by donor funds, has received thousands of complaints since it was set up in 2011. 
Last week the watchdog said preliminary investigations showed police appeared to be responsible for 15 deaths and 31 cases of injury since March 27, when Kenya imposed a dawn-dusk curfew to help stem the spread of COVID-19.
Among the dead was 13-year-old Yasin Hussein Moyo, shot by a stray bullet as he stood on his balcony. Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji has approved the arrest and prosecution of a police officer over Moyo's death.

The right-wing leader announced on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account late on Wednesday that he was preparing a decree reopening the ministry that had been closed by the previous government in 2016 and placed under the science and technology portfolio.
The new ministry will be headed by a political ally, Fabio Faria, of the Social Democratic Party (PSD) party and son-in-law of billionaire television presenter Silvio Santos, owner of Brazil's third network in audience.
Bolsonaro has courted the PSD, led by former communications minister Gilberto Kassab, as part of a strategy to build sufficient support in Congress to block any of two dozen requests to impeach him.
The new ministry will take over the government's 136 million reais ($27 million) budget for advertising that has been managed by the president's press office.
Bolsonaro has relied heavily on social media video and Twitter postings to communicate his views to supporters. On Wednesday, speaking to reporters, he said it was no secret that his government's communications strategy had not been effective.
He also announced that the new ministry's will have the task of privatizing the state-run radio and television broadcasting company EBC, saying it would be more efficient in private hands.
Brazil has become an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, with at least 39,680 deaths and 772,416 confirmed cases of infection as of Wednesday, the world's worst outbreak after the United States.
Yet Bolsonaro has continued to downplay the gravity of the health crisis and pushed local governments to lift quarantine measures, sending contradictory signals to Brazilians on whether to use masks and keep social distancing.

PARIS (Reuters) - People walking their dogs or sitting on a terrace in a quaint, quiet square, the scene could be anywhere in rural France, but it is Place des Abbesses in the Montmartre area of Paris, near the Sacre Coeur basilica and normally heaving with tourists.
Before the coronavirus crisis, Paris and the Ile-de-France region around it received around 50 million tourists per year. Since the end of lockdown a month ago, Parisians have had their city to themselves. 
Are they enjoying a break from the crowds? Most of the Parisians Reuters spoke to on an early evening in June said they missed the tourists. 
""It is much less busy than before the lockdown ... But the tourists have to come back quickly, we miss them, they are essential for the capital,"" said Sandy Four, sitting on a bench in the square. 
Eating a pancake at a terrace, Nadia Kadri, 36, agreed. 
""Tourists are part and parcel of Paris. I like it when there are tourists, especially in Montmartre, it is a melting pot where all cultures meet,"" she said. 
On the vast expanse of lawn around Les Invalides, the former military hospital where Napoleon is buried, groups of young people were enjoying a picnic, and many said they would welcome the tourists back. 
Thomas Michon, 25, who lives in a central district with many holiday rental flats, said he had enjoyed the post-lockdown calm but added that some areas of the city belonged to tourists, while others like the Buttes-Chaumont and La Villette parks in eastern Paris got virtually no foreign visitors. 
Marie Merlin, 24, said Paris belonged to Parisians right now, even if it was not by choice, but said she hoped the tourists would return. 

""This city is meant to be open and to offer its treasures to the whole world,"" she said.

The 45.5 trillion shilling budget ($12.2 bln), up from 40.1 trillion last year, includes 12.4 trillion shillings of external project support and general budget support compared with 10 trillion in 2019/20, said Finance Minister Matia Kasaija.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should gradually reopen its borders to non-EU travellers from July and draw up a list of countries outside the bloc for which restrictions can be removed, the European Commission said on Thursday.
The EU executive said the list of countries with access should be based on three criteria: countries should have COVID-19 under at least as much control as the EU average, have containment measures during travel and also be willing to let in EU visitors.
EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said decisions on borders were for individual countries to take but she hoped the Commission could help ensure a coordinated approach, something she believed member states themselves also wanted. 
The Commission proposed allowing entry from the outset for travellers from the western Balkans countries of Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.
Johansson declined to name any other country.
""This has to be done step by step. So I think this list will grow, maybe not from day to day but at least maybe from week to week,"" she told a video news conference.
Under the Commission proposal, travellers would be allowed in based on their place of residence, not nationality, and they would not have to go into quarantine on arrival.
It also recommended on Thursday that the countries of the Schengen area, which normally have no border checks, lift controls put in place to the control the spread of the coronavirus by June 15.
However, some countries such as Portugal and Spain have indicated they will not do so by Monday.
The EU executive also proposed that a ban on non-essential visitors from outside the area be extended until June 30.
The Schengen area comprises 22 EU countries and Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. EU members Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania, which are not yet part of Schengen, have also applied the ban on entry from outside the zone.

The travel ban has not applied to Ireland, which is not part of the Schengen area, and former EU member Britain.

Shadow, a 6-1/2 year-old Siberian husky, had been living with a foster family in Kent, southeast England, close to one of three shelters run by Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. 
""There was a big hole in our life when our previous dog passed away,"" John Waters told Reuters in an interview.
""Shadow... has given us a more positive outlook, where we can go out as a family ... and to help a rescue (animal) is very rewarding for both of us,"" he said.  
After registering their interest online in adopting a dog, they took part in a series of calls, including one video call where they ""met"" Shadow online, and the dog soon joined its new family in Leicester, central England.
Battersea Dogs and Cats Home had to close to the general public in March because of the lockdown, and has also had to sharply reduce the number of animals it takes in.
But it has continued the process of trying to rehouse hundreds of dogs and cats in its care, like Shadow, with the help of video calls.
While Shadow's is a happy story, however, the outlook for Britain's animal welfare charities looks bleak.
""We estimate that these organisations are going to suffer a 50 percent loss in revenue (due to the coronavirus lockdown),"" said Steven Craddock, Battersea's manager.
Entirely reliant on public donations, Battersea expects to suffer an 11 million pound loss over the next 18 months, he said, making it harder to continue rescuing, caring for and re-homing abandoned or stray animals.

""So if a number of rescue (centres) close across the UK, animals in need of help are going to be left with nowhere to go,"" he said.

(Reuters) - Floats, all-night parties and parades may be out, but the LGBTQ community is returning to its roots by teaming up with black activists for Pride month celebrations in the United States.
While the coronavirus epidemic has forced the cancellation of traditional Pride events in June, U.S. gay groups are using virtual gatherings to amplify the voices of people of color, whose demands for social justice are taking the nation by storm.
""Pride started as a riot that was led by two women of color at Stonewall 51 years ago,"" said Sarah Kate Ellis, chief executive of LGBTQ group GLAAD. ""It is part protest, part celebration. I am thrilled that we can really be an ally and can be a presenter of pushing for change and locking arms with the Black Lives Matter movement.""
Riots at the Stonewall Inn in New York in 1969 were spearheaded by transgender activists Marsha P. Johnson, who was black, and Latina Sylvia Rivera.
This year, GLAAD has turned plans for an online drag celebration into a ""more substantive discussion around black queer lives,"" Ellis said.
J. August Richards, a gay black actor on television's ""Council of Dads,"" said he doesn't mind missing out on the usual celebrations because of the momentum from protests sparked by the death of African American George Floyd after a white police kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
""Right now, this uprising that is occurring - my entire attention is consumed by it,"" Richards said.
Nevertheless, he is delighted that the LGBTQ community has thrown its weight behind black causes. 
""I think it's amazing and I pray it doesn't end here. I hope there is a continued conversation and a continued inclusion,"" he said.
Not everyone has been so welcoming. Plans by LA Pride to team up with Black Lives Matter for a gathering in Los Angeles were shelved after black activists said they hadn't been sufficiently consulted. Instead, black LGBTQ leaders are organizing a solidarity march to protest racial injustice, and LA Pride is supporting the effort.
But other initiatives are multiplying. Some 100 black, gay executives and entrepreneurs gathered this week for a virtual leadership forum on topics like health and social justice organized by Emil Wilbekin, founder of the Native Son black gay empowerment group. 

""Black gay men are stepping up and leading. And I think it's our time, not just to lead, but to actually be the light and to empower our own community,"" said Wilbekin.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Hundreds of Russian polling station officials, citing the risk of spreading the coronavirus, say they won't help organise a nationwide vote on reforms that could extend President Vladimir Putin's rule until 2036.
In the July 1 ballot, Russians will vote to approve or reject constitutional reforms including a change that would allow Putin to serve two more six-year terms, if re-elected, instead of stepping down in 2024. 
But around 350 election officials across the country say taking part is too dangerous at a time when authorities are still reporting thousands of new infections each day despite a drop in cases in the capital Moscow. 
The officials have started a petition to try to encourage peers to join the boycott. 
The ""July 1 vote poses a danger to our lives and health and to the lives and health of voters,"" the group said in a statement. ""We just don't understand why such sacrifices and risks are needed, why we need to hold such a vote now and at any price. We are not expendable.""
The boycott looks for now unlikely to severely disrupt the vote, which is administered by at least 1 million such officials. But it amplifies a complaint made by Putin's critics that he has scheduled the vote too early, from a health and safety viewpoint, for political reasons. 
""It is unclear what the urgency (of this vote) is,"" a member of a Moscow local election commission Sergei Romanchyuk said.
""Why can't we wait until September or even next year?""
The Kremlin has denied politics are at play and said all necessary safety precautions will be taken.
Critics say Putin is rushing to take advantage of a feel-good patriotic vibe often generated by the annual Red Square (NYSE:SQ) military parade - on June 24 this year - as well as good summer weather and the easing of lockdown restrictions. 
No opposition events are expected to be allowed before the vote, with critics saying coronavirus-induced bans on public events are an easy way for the Kremlin to avoid protests.

The vote is being held over seven days to reduce health risks, electronic voting is allowed in two regions including Moscow with its 7.3 million voters, and polling stations may be outdoors.

MEXICO CITY/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Fans of his uniquely Mexican take on high-end dining once packed a months-long wait list for Enrique Olvera's Pujol but the restaurant is grappling with a tough new reality as the novel coronavirus haunts Latin America's culinary upstarts. 
For now that reality means giving up on his tasting menu of intricate dishes priced at $95 in favor of selling ""baskets"" with produce and ingredients like eggs, cheese and honey from his suppliers, whose protection in tough financial times has become a priority. 
""We don't have the size or the means to save the country. Or even the neighborhood,"" Olvera said. ""But we can take care of everybody who works with us, with our farmers and our employees. If everybody who can do that commits to doing that, then we have a better chance of not collapsing as a society.""
Latin America's top restaurants are finding creative ways to keep the region's vibrant gastronomy culture alive. 
From combining kitchens to converting sleek haute cuisine temples into produce delivery operations, several are striving to pivot their reliance on foreign tourism and shifting to local comfort foods from gourmet meals to survive the coronavirus crisis.
But it has not been easy, especially since much of the region is still wrestling with surging cases that make full re-opening of dining rooms a distant dream. And it has seemed like a particularly cruel blow given that the region's high-end dining scene was just coming of age. 
In 2010 just two restaurants from Latin America made The World's 50 Best Restaurants list. By 2019 eight had made the cut, with two in the top 10, as eateries started forging their own paths and takes on cuisine, said William Drew, director of content for the closely watched list.
“There is a whole number of restaurants that are exploring their own indigenous produce and the traditional dishes of indigenous people,” Drew said. 
Now many are struggling just to stay alive.
DISTANCING PROTOCOL
When Pujol does open in a couple more months, Olvera expects it to offer just a third of its tables.
In economic crisis-stricken Argentina, Mariano Ramon, who helms Buenos Aires fusion hot spot Gran Dabbang, partnered with fellow chef Leo Lanussol of neighborhood favorite Proper to offer a combined delivery menu. 
By putting both staffs to work in single kitchen in shifts to ensure distancing protocol, the chefs - also longtime friends - were able to cut costs and stay afloat. Orders are prepared at Proper while Gran Dabbang, ranked as a top 50 restaurant in Latin America, sells wine and products from local vendors. 
Flexibility, Ramon said, is the key to surviving in Argentina, which recently marked its ninth sovereign default. 
""I think that in Argentina we have an advantage, which is that we have little memory and we are very used to crises,"" Ramon said. 
Chef Marsia Taha of Gustu in La Paz, co-founded by Danish celebrity chef Claus Meyer, quickly revamped her multicourse dining experience. 
""We are turning more towards a friendly offer for the local public, developing dishes that perhaps we did not make before, healthy, abundant, balanced and affordable food, which is what people from La Paz need right now,"" Taha said, adding that the restaurant posts tutorials on social media so clients can learn how to prepare their meals.
""The entire operating system has changed 100%,"" Taha said.
SURVIVAL EFFORTS
Technology is also playing a role at Mexico City's Rosetta, whose chef Elena Reygadas said her dining room is now full of staffers on laptops coordinating orders and deliveries. 
When Reygadas finally reopens Rosetta, whose tall walls inside an early 20th century mansion are adorned with leafy vines, she plans to use tall palms to create more distance between tables.
But she worries that foreigners, who comprised 60% to 70% of her clientele, will be slow to return.
“We were full of people trying to understand what Mexican food was,” said Reygadas. “Young people started coming to the city just to spend a few days going from one restaurant to the other.”
As Bogota's El Chato's dining room remains shuttered, its chef owner Alvaro Clavijo is putting on virtual cookery classes via Zoom to accompany ingredients ordered from the restaurant by diners who are keen to cook complex dishes.
As for many of his cohorts across the region, a key goal is protecting his suppliers.

“If we reopen and they aren’t around, we aren’t going to survive either,” he said.

756,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 07:54AM ET</span>",Special Report: Inside the proxy battle that keeps an Iraqi city on its knees,"By John Davison
MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Three years ago, the world rejoiced when Iraqi forces backed by the United States and Iran liberated this ancient city from the brutal rule of Islamic State. The people of Mosul hoped to rebuild their shattered lives.
Today, a different battle plays out.
Taking place largely behind the scenes, from legislative halls that overlook the city's bombed-out streets to hotel meeting rooms in Baghdad, it is a power struggle among parties, politicians and militiamen. Some are backed by Iran. Others favour the United States.
At stake: political control of Nineveh province, of which Mosul is capital – a region rich in natural resources and a link in a supply route from Tehran to the Mediterranean. The route serves Iran-backed militias, Washington's fiercest enemy here since the defeat of Islamic State.
Iran's allies had been winning. They installed a governor favoured by Tehran a year ago. But then anti-government protests, U.S. sanctions and the assassination of Iran's military mastermind Qassem Soleimani challenged Iranian influence. The pro-Western camp replaced the Nineveh governor with a longtime U.S. ally.
The contest mirrors a wider struggle over the future of Iraq itself.
Speaking to Reuters over the span of a year, around 20 Iraqi officials involved in the political tussle over Nineveh described how Iran and its allies developed the networks to influence local government, how pro-Western officials tried to hit back, and how this tug of war has crippled Mosul's recovery. If any side prevails, many of these insiders believe, it will ultimately be the side aligned with Iran. Iran helps its allies with money, political backing and sticks with them, explained Nineveh councilor Ali Khdeir. The United States, in contrast, ""has left no real mark on Iraq.""
Mosul, meanwhile, lies largely in ruins. Traffic snarls across battered bridges and disabled war victims sell tissues, cigarettes and tea at junctions - the kind of misery that Iraqi officials fear is the perfect breeding ground for Islamic State to reemerge.
Two changes of governor in 2019 meant contracts for projects worth at least $200 million were not awarded by the local government last year. They included building a new emergency hospital, procuring vehicles to clear rubble from bombed-out homes and bolstering the fleet for Mosul's under-equipped first-responder teams, according to officials and a local government document seen by Reuters.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State accused Iran of working ""overtime to dominate every aspect of Iraq's political and economic life."" The United States is committed to helping Iraq build its economic prospects and improve stability and security, said the spokesperson, Morgan Ortagus.
A spokesperson for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York, Alireza Miryousefi, insisted: ""Iran does not interfere in Iraq's internal affairs.""
The Iraqi government didn't respond to detailed questions for this article. Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi told Reuters in response to a question about Mosul that corruption and political infighting hampered the city's recovery, but denied it was part of a proxy contest.
""WE HAD A MODEST LIFE AND SIMPLE DREAMS""
Rasha Saeed's young family is one of thousands suffering from the failures of city hall.
Still mourning the death of their nine-year-old son, killed in a U.S. coalition air strike in 2015, the family returned to their neighbourhood after its liberation from Islamic State. They found their home had been destroyed by bombs and bulldozed over. Rasha, her husband Luay Shaker and their three remaining children live in debt and in limbo in a partially-repaired rented flat nearby. They watch grass grow on the earth where their old house stood. Residents say Islamic State fighters' bodies are buried beneath.
Luay, a manual labourer who ferried supplies before the war to stores in Mosul's historic Old City markets, cannot work while he recovers from an operation to remove a tumour from behind his ear. Limited space at the West Mosul medical complex nearby – where a new hospital was meant to go up – means follow-up treatment is sporadic and slow. ""It can be a long wait between appointments because Luay's doctor can take only three patients on site a week,"" Rasha said.
The medical complex is a cluster of portacabins on a vast bombed-out site that once boasted five fully-equipped hospitals with hundreds of beds. It currently has around 80 emergency ward beds for a population of more than a million people living in the area, doctors say. They describe a lack of equipment and medicine, including masks and gloves – a concern especially as cases of COVID-19 rise in Iraq. A spokesperson for Iraq's Health Ministry responded that protective equipment is available in all state health institutions.
Rasha's temporary home stands alone amid destruction on a hill above the Tigris River, overlooking Mosul.
""We had a modest life before Islamic State, simple dreams to live without violence, for our children to be educated and maybe one day to afford a bigger home. That is now impossible,"" Rasha said.
A CHANGE IN CITY HALL
The political contest for Nineveh is part of a wider picture across Iraq's northern Sunni-majority provinces, former strongholds of dictator Saddam Hussein which hold strategic value for Tehran - and where Washington wants to curb Iranian influence.
The fertile plains of Nineveh flank Syria to the west, where Iran's Revolutionary Guards have fought alongside President Bashar al-Assad's forces. Beyond is Lebanon, home to Shi'ite Iran's Hezbollah allies. The provinces of Anbar, bisected by the vast Euphrates River, Salahuddin, home to an important Shi'ite shrine, and Diyala, which borders Iran, form the rest of that mostly Sunni land corridor. Many of the 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq - a number that is being reduced - have been deployed at bases dotted through three of these provinces and are regularly harassed by rocket attacks that U.S. officials have blamed on Iranian proxies who want U.S. troops to leave.
Iran firmly established dominance over Baghdad and Iraq's southern Shi'ite provinces after the 2003 U.S. -led invasion that ousted Saddam. But the country's Sunni areas, home also to minority groups of Kurds, Christians, Shi'ite Turkmen and Yazidis, presented more of a challenge. They became hubs for a Sunni insurgency against U.S. forces in the mid-2000s and strongholds for Islamic State, which made Mosul its capital in 2014.
After Iran-backed militias helped drive Islamic State from Mosul in 2017, the militias stayed put. Their flags fly throughout northern Iraq, next to banners and billboards that honour their leaders, including the late Soleimani.
Twenty local government officials, Baghdad lawmakers and tribal leaders interviewed by Reuters described how Iran then deepened its political influence until it had allies in almost every provincial administration.
Central to such efforts in Nineveh, these sources said, were two powerful Sunnis - Khamis al-Khanjar, an Anbar businessman turned politician, and Ahmed al-Jabouri, widely known as Abu Mazen, a former governor of Salahuddin province, now sitting in the Iraqi parliament.
Khanjar was an outspoken opponent of Iran. He supported Sunni protests against the Iran-backed Baghdad government in 2013 and later accused Iran-allied Shi'ite militias of human rights abuses. Abu Mazen was once a U.S. ally. He described working closely with U.S. forces after the 2003 invasion.
In 2018, Khanjar and Abu Mazen unexpectedly joined a bloc of Iran-backed parties and militia leaders in the Iraqi parliament. Explaining this shift, Khanjar said: ""The strongest on the ground can get things done … I go with the bloc that's (strongest) on the ground. If that coalition has Iranian links, that's not on us."" He denied being an ally of Iran. Abu Mazen declined to comment for this article.
Then, in May 2019, Khanjar and Abu Mazen intervened in the selection of Nineveh's new governor, according to nine sources, including several members of the regional administrative council and relatives of the two men. A majority of Nineveh's 39 councilors, tasked with electing the new governor, initially favoured a candidate critical of Iran, these sources said. But two days before the council was due to vote, Abu Mazen and Khanjar invited nearly two dozen council members to a meeting in a hotel in nearby Erbil, said several people, one of whom attended.
The council members were promised local government posts or payments of up to $300,000 apiece from the men or their offices if they voted for a different candidate, Mansour al-Mareid, a Sunni favoured by Iran and its allies in Baghdad, these people said. One council member told Reuters he accepted money and used it to buy a new home.
Mareid was duly elected with the votes of 28 of the 39 council members.
Khanjar confirmed he and Abu Mazen met with councilors in Erbil to agree on the governor and negotiate over provincial posts. He also confirmed he supported Mareid, but denied that votes were bought. ""I didn't pay a single dinar,"" he said.
Mareid, the winning candidate, said he had no knowledge of bribes being given to councilors and he denied any loyalty to Iran, but he added: ""Council members can be bought, so it wouldn't surprise me, and nothing can happen in this country without Iran approving it.""
The gathering in Erbil wasn't the only meeting that took place around that time. Three of the councilors interviewed by Reuters described further meetings and contacts with senior Iraqi paramilitary officials who were trying to win support for Mareid.
Another Nineveh councilor recounted that he and a colleague were invited to a hotel in Baghdad shortly after the vote to meet a senior Iranian diplomat and an Iraqi militia leader loyal to Iran. The councilor, who had loudly criticized Mareid's appointment, said he was offered a post in the Nineveh government if he would drop his opposition to the new governor. He said he declined the offer. The Iranian embassy didn't reply to questions about the meeting. Reuters couldn't reach the militia leader. The Iraqi state paramilitary Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) that oversees militias didn't respond.
U.S. PUSHES BACK
Within a few months the pendulum had swung again.
The United States imposed sanctions on Iran-aligned militia leaders and on their Iraqi Sunni allies – among them Abu Mazen in July and Khanjar in December.
The U.S. Treasury said it was freezing Abu Mazen's assets because he had protected ""his personal interests by accommodating Iran-backed proxies that operate outside of state control."" It targeted Khanjar in a round of sanctions against Iran-backed militia leaders, accusing him of bribery and saying he had spent ""millions of dollars in payments to Iraqi political figures in order to secure their support.""
Abu Mazen and Khanjar denied any wrongdoing at the time and condemned the U.S. sanctions as interference in Iraq's internal affairs.
Abu Mazen felt under pressure as a result of the U.S. move, said a relative and five Nineveh councilors. The measures helped persuade Abu Mazen, these sources said, to withdraw support for Mareid and back a former military commander and U.S. ally, Najm al-Jabouri [no relation], to replace him as governor. In November, 23 of the council's 39 members voted to dismiss Mareid and appoint Jabouri.
Jabouri's appointment and the pressure on Iran's allies across the country from U.S. air strikes and sanctions have given militia groups pause in Mosul, local officials say. Their military presence has reduced on inner city streets where Shi'ite and militia flags once flew atop mosques and junkyards they controlled.
Pro-U.S. officials in Mosul hope that the government of Prime Minister Kadhimi, who is accepted by both the United States and Iran, together with fractures among Iran-backed militias following the death of Soleimani, will turn the tide against Tehran's influence. But they also complain that Governor Jabouri is mostly hamstrung against Iran's militia and political allies in Mosul.
""Jabouri is weak politically,"" said Mosul council member Ali Khdeir. ""Because of their power on the ground, he'll have to deal carefully with the militias at first.""
Jabouri told Reuters that any governor would face criticism and he defended his record. He conceded that political rivalries were impeding progress in rebuilding the city. ""It makes my work harder,"" he said.
Four local officials said some administrative posts have changed hands and are no longer controlled by allies of Iran-backed militias, but others are still held by officials with links to militia groups. The militias also have offices in Mosul, these local officials said, through which they win construction and other business contracts, even though such offices were banned by a central government decree last year. The militia groups did not respond to Reuters questions about their activities.
A CITY IN RUINS
Amid this chaos, reconstruction stalls.
The power vacuum between Mareid and Jabouri just weeks before the end of 2019 prevented contracts being awarded at a crucial time when the annual budget needed to be spent, a senior local administrator and a second official said.
A document signed by the head of municipalities, Abdul Qadir al-Dakhil, and reviewed by Reuters showed that provincial authorities failed to award contracts worth more than $200 million in Nineveh province in 2019. They included the new emergency hospital, equipment for another nearby hospital, providing additional vehicles for the civil defence rescue services and rehabilitating 13 schools, Dakhil told Reuters.
Dr Omar Hamudat, who helps run the West Mosul emergency medical complex, worked in Mosul hospitals under international sanctions in the 1990s and under Islamic State's occupation. Hamudat said healthcare infrastructure was the worst it had ever been.
""Once we could carry out 200 emergency operations a day here. Now, we manage about 15,"" he said, speaking in his cramped portacabin office at the complex.
Nineveh province had hospitals with a total of about 4,000 beds before the arrival of Islamic State. It has a little over 1,000 now, including in what Hamudat called his ""caravans,"" a reference to the portacabins.
Mosul's civil defence chief, Hossam Khalil, said a provision of emergency vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, expected in 2019, had not come through. ""Sometimes we have to use our own cars for work,"" Khalil said, ""but try not to do that for crucial life-saving work, or putting out fires.""
Residents of Mosul have praised Jabouri's handling of the COVID-19 crisis, where a lockdown has so far avoided a mass outbreak, but some worry he is not up to the task of rebuilding the city. Many just want a competent governor, regardless of political affiliation.
""Mareid began getting things done,"" said Safwan al-Madany, a 30-year-old activist who has been involved in voluntary aid projects for his city since 2011 and rebuilding work since the fall of Islamic State.
During Mareid's six-month tenure, some bridges in the city were fixed. ""He had the contacts, power and connections in Baghdad to make things happen, even if those were paramilitary-linked. He's an engineer by trade and understands construction. Jabouri is a military man. We wish Mareid would come back,"" said Madany.
ENDURING INFLUENCE
Across the rest of the Sunni provinces that lie between Nineveh and Baghdad, regional councilors, tribal chiefs and members of Iraq's parliament say Iran's efforts to entrench local political allies will likely outlast the U.S. tactics of air strikes and economic sanctions.
Potential friends of America lament what they see as a lack of U.S. interest or ability to blunt Iran's influence in the country allied troops invaded 17 years ago. In February 2019, the head of Salahuddin provincial council, Ahmed al-Krayem, travelled to Washington to drum up U.S. support for his region and help counter Iran.
""The visit wasn't fruitful,"" said a senior Iraqi lawmaker, a relative of Krayem.
""Whoever he met didn't seem interested in his proposals for a bolstered U.S. troop presence and U.S. investment.""
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which hosted Krayem at a private event during that trip, declined to give details about the gathering. Krayem also declined to comment.
A Salahuddin official said that by contrast, ""the Iranians, including their diplomats at the embassy, reach out to people you'd never expect them to, at a local level.""
Asked about U.S. engagement in Iraq, Department of State spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said: ""We will continue to stand with the Iraqi people in support of their calls for reform and change, and to help them achieve an Iraq that is economically prosperous, a pivotal country in the region, and free of foreign meddling.""
Other Salahuddin Sunni chieftains have met Shi'ite paramilitary officials to plead over the return of Sunni families displaced by the war with Islamic State and scattered in camps and temporary homes across northern Iraq. They worry about the drawdown of U.S. troops in Iraq, saying it opens up their regions to the danger of a resurgent Islamic State.
""A few years ago I would never have dealt with Iran-backed officials,"" said Sheikh Khalid al-Nasseri, a senior leader in Saddam Hussein's clan. ""Now I'll work with anyone to get services for our people and return families to their homes from miserable camps.""

Despite opposition from conservatives, legislators also voted to let lesbian couples use sperm donations to conceive children. The legislation will now move to the upper house for a final vote.
""By 132 votes to 52, with 13 abstentions, the National Council says YES to #Ehefüralle real equality!"" rights group Pink Cross wrote on Twitter, using a hashtag meaning ""marriage for all"".
Campaigners said the change had been a long time coming. Switzerland passed a law specifically protecting lesbian, gay and bisexual people from discrimination only in February.
""Finally, it was about time for this basic human right!"" wrote one Twitter user, using the name you_can_call_me_flower. 
The draft law is moving through parliament 13 years after civil partnerships became legal in Switzerland. 
A survey commissioned by Pink Cross in February showed more than 80% of Swiss support same-sex marriage.
However, the country's political institutions have tended to be more conservative than the general public.
""In the future, marriage should be open to all opposite- and same-sex couples, that is the core of the proposal,"" Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told the debate. 

""The Federal Council (the government) welcomes the fact that this will eliminate today's unequal treatment,"" he added.

The demonstrations sweeping across the United States and Europe have reignited a debate about monuments to those involved in Britain's imperialist past.
Poole council said the statue of Baden-Powell, a British Boer War hero, would be moved from its location on the quay of the seaside town to storage on Thursday while there were discussions with local communities about its future.
""Whilst famed for the creation of the Scouts, we also recognise that there are some aspects of Robert Baden-Powell’s life that are considered less worthy of commemoration,"" council leader Vikki Slade said.
Baden-Powell is widely hailed for setting up the scout movement which boasts 54 million members worldwide. In a poll in 2007, he was voted the 13th most influential person in the United Kingdom in the 20th century. But critics say he held racist views and was a supporter of Adolf Hitler and fascism.
His statue, which was erected just over a decade ago, currently looks across the harbour to Brownsea Island where he started the scout movement in 1907. 
A spokesman for the Scouts said the organisation was looking forward to discussing the matter with the council ""to make an informed decision on what happens next"".
""The Scout movement is resolute in its commitment to inclusion and diversity and members continually reflect and challenge ourselves in how we live our values,"" he said.
On Sunday, protesters in Bristol, western England, pulled down a statue of 17th Century slave trader Edward Colston and threw it into the harbour. It was retrieved on Thursday and the local council said it would be displayed in a museum.

Other memorials have also since been removed and councils run by the opposition Labour Party said they would review the ""appropriateness of local monuments and statues"" on public land.

Turkey supports Fayez al Serraj's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), whose forces have in recent weeks repelled a 14-month assault on Tripoli by Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
The LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. While Washington has said it opposes Haftar's offensive, it has not thrown its support behind the GNA. It has also lambasted Russian involvement in support of Haftar. 
Cavusoglu said the involvement of the United States, a NATO ally, was important to protect the alliance's interests, adding that Turkish and U.S. officials would discuss possible steps, as Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during a call on Monday.
""For some reason, the United States has not been that active in Libya, perhaps because of past traumas,"" Cavusoglu said in an interview with broadcaster NTV.
""The United States needs to play a more active role, both for achieving a ceasefire and in the political process.""
On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the resumption of U.N.-led talks between Libya's warring sides and urged speedy negotiations to achieve a ceasefire, as a new round of talks began after the GNA's rapid gains.
Cavusoglu, who dismissed a ceasefire proposal by Egypt as an attempt to save Haftar after losses on the battlefield, said on Thursday that only a lasting ceasefire under U.N. auspices would be acceptable.

Trump also discussed Libya with Egypt's Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Wednesday, and the two leaders discussed ways to resume U.N. ceasefire talks and the departure of all foreign forces from Libya.

762,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Israeli minister says still no consensus with U.S. on West Bank annexations,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has yet to bridge gaps with the United States and his main coalition partner over his pledged annexation of parts of the West Bank, a cabinet minister said on Thursday.
The remarks by Tzipi Hotovely, the minister of settlement affairs, pointed to difficulties Netanyahu could face in implementing the move in the occupied territory soon, with a formal cabinet debate on the issue due to begin on July 1.
In line with a peace plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January, Netanyahu has said he intends to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank.
Palestinians seek the region, along with Gaza and East Jerusalem, for a state of their own.
They have called for international sanctions against Israel, and Arab and European countries have voiced concern over unilateral territorial moves that could jeopardise a two-state solution of a decades-old conflict.
""There are gaps between the Americans and us on this issue and between us and our senior partner in the unity government, Blue and White,"" Hotovely told Army Radio, referring to the centrist party headed by Defence Minister Benny Gantz that has called for a broad international dialogue on the matter.
Sven Kühn von Burgsdorff, who heads the European Union's delegation to the Palestinian territories, said that annexation ""if it happens, will have consequences for the relationship between Israel and the EU"".
He did not spell out what those consequences might entail during a visit with other diplomats to an area of the West Bank where Israel has pledged to apply its sovereignty.
Palestinians have rejected Trump's plan, which envisages statehood, but with Israel keeping most of the settlements it has built on land captured in a 1967 war.
A committee of U.S. and Israeli officials is drawing territorial lines in the West Bank under the Trump proposal.
""There is still no agreed map on this issue. It has to be agreed by parts of the (Israeli) government and by the American side,"" Hotovely said.
A U.S. official said the coronavirus crisis had made it difficult for all members of the mapping committee to convene.

Most countries view Israel's settlements on occupied land as illegal. Israel disputes this.

China considers democratically ruled Taiwan its own territory and one of its most sensitive diplomatic issues, regularly denouncing the United States for its support of the island.
A U.S. C-40A, a military version of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737, entered Taiwan air space with permission, though it did not land at any Taiwan airports, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said on Tuesday. 
The U.S. aircraft took off from Japan's Okinawa island, where there is a major U.S. air base, and flew over northern and western Taiwan on its way to Southeast Asia, Taiwan media reported.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office said the U.S. aircraft had ""harmed our sovereignty, security and development rights, and contravened international law and the basic norms of international relations"".
""It was an illegal act and a seriously provocative incident,"" the office said in a statement carried by state media. ""We express strong dissatisfaction and resolute opposition.""
The U.S. Air Force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Taiwan is entirely separately governed from China and controls its own air space.
On the same day as the U.S. aircraft flew over the island, Taiwan's air force had to warn off several Chinese fighter jets which briefly entered Taiwan's air defence identification zone. Taiwan has repeatedly complained about Chinese drills near the island.
While Washington and Taipei have no formal diplomatic ties, the United States is Taiwan's strongest international supporter and main arms supplier, becoming another source of U.S.-China tension.
The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular U.S. Navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the island from China.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of children in Indonesia are believed to have died from COVID-19, giving the Southeast Asian country one of the world's highest rates of child deaths from the novel coronavirus that experts around the world say poses little danger to the young.
Paediatricians and health officials in the world’s fourth most populous country said the high number of child deaths from a disease that mostly kills the elderly was due to underlying factors, in particular malnutrition, anaemia and inadequate child health facilities.
""COVID-19 proves that we have to fight against malnutrition,"" Achmad Yurianto, a senior health ministry official, told Reuters.
He said Indonesian children were caught in a ""devil’s circle"", a cycle of malnutrition and anaemia that increased their vulnerability to the coronavirus. He compared malnourished children to weak structures that ""crumble after an earthquake"".
Since Indonesia announced its first coronavirus case in March it has recorded 2,000 deaths, the highest in East Asia outside China.
A total of 715 people under 18 had contracted the coronavirus, while 28 had died, according to a health ministry document dated May 22 and reviewed by Reuters.
It also recorded more than 380 deaths among 7,152 children classified as ""patients under monitoring"", meaning people with severe coronavirus symptoms for which there is no other explanation but whose tests have not confirmed the infection.
Even the official figure for children who have died of the coronavirus, at 28 as of May 22, would give Indonesia a high rate of child death, at 2.1% of its total.
Different countries use different age brackets in statistics but deaths for those under 24 in the United States are a little over 0.1% of its fatalities. 
In Brazil, the number of suspected COVID deaths under age 19 is 1.2%. In the Philippines, deaths of those under 19 are about 2.3% of its coronavirus toll.
'TRIPLE BURDEN'
Indonesia, a developing country of 270 million, suffers from a ""triple burden of malnutrition,” which includes stunting, and anaemia among mothers, and obesity, according to the United Nations Children’s Fund.
Nearly one in three Indonesian children under five is stunted, it says.
""The nutrition status impacts children's immunity,"" said Dr Nastiti Kaswandani, a paediatric pulmonologist in the capital, Jakarta.
""That's important in mitigating COVID infections.""
Paediatricians said the ill-equipped healthcare system was also a problem.
""The biggest discrepancy in Indonesia is the availability of paediatric intensive care units,"" said Shela Putri Sundawa, a paediatric doctor in Jakarta.
The health ministry declined to provide data on care units for children and a senior official said the system had not been overwhelmed.
Equipment shortages are more pronounced outside the capital.
Paediatrician Dominicus Husada said a hospital he worked at on Madura island, in East Java, did not have ventilators for children. An 11-year-old died from the coronavirus there in March.
One father, Iyansyah, whose nine-month old boy died from COVID-19 on Lombok island, told Reuters the hospital did not have care units for children. 

""Truthfully, if the hospital I went to had complete facilities, he'd probably have survived,” said Iyansyah.

Twelve people, who were part of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, were sentenced over the distribution of leaflets in supermarkets in eastern France and wearing T-shirts in 2009 and 2010 calling for the boycott of Israeli goods. 
Their legal team argued that the call for a boycott was a fundamental principle of freedom of expression.
The EHCR said there was little scope in European conventions for restrictions on political speech and that its very nature was to be controversial and virulent as long as it did not cross the line and call for violence, hatred or intolerance. 
""The Court considered that the applicants’ conviction had lacked any relevant or sufficient grounds,"" the ruling said.
France was ordered to pay 27,380 euros ($31,150) to each campaigner.
Israel has said the BDS movement, sponsored by pro-Palestinian intellectuals and bloggers, is motivated by anti-Semitism and a desire to paint Israel as illegitimate. 
The ruling comes at a time when Israel is considering annexing parts of the occupied West Bank, drawing criticism in Europe. Some countries, including France, say measures could be imposed on Israel if it went ahead with its plans. 

""It's a victory for freedom of expression and civic action,"" said Bertrand Heilbronn, president of the France Palestine Solidarity Association. ""(We) will continue to develop it (the BDS campaign) as long as Israel does not respect international law and human rights.""

770,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 11, 2020 05:31AM ET</span>","Norway mosque shooter jailed for 21 years for murder, anti-terrorism offence","OSLO (Reuters) - A far-right Norwegian man was jailed for 21 years on Thursday for the racially motivated murder of his Chinese-born stepsister and attempting to kill worshippers in a mosque shooting spree.
Philip Manshaus expressed strong anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim views before last year's attack and was unrepentant at trial.
Manshaus, now 22 years old, shot and killed Johanne Zhangjia Ihle-Hansen in their family home, later explaining he believed the adopted daughter of his father's spouse posed a risk to the family because of her Asian origin.
He then drove to the nearby al-Noor Islamic Centre and entered the building, firing several shots but hitting no one before being overpowered by a 65-year-old member of the congregation who wrestled away his guns.
""He went in with the purpose of killing as many Muslims as possible,"" judge Annika Lindstroem said.
Manshaus expressed admiration for the massacre of more than 50 people at two New Zealand mosques last year by a white supremacist who filmed and broadcast the killings live.
The attack also drew comparisons with the massacre of 77 people by far-right mass killer Anders Behring Breivik in 2011 in Norway's worst peacetime atrocity.
Manshaus wore a helmet camera, filming the mosque shooting, but failed in his attempt to broadcast the attack online.
In his first court hearing last August, Manshaus appeared with black eyes and bruises on his face and neck from the ensuing fight at the mosque.
The court rejected the defence's plea to declare Manshaus insane, relying instead on a psychiatric evaluation which found him fit to stand trial.

The 21-year prison term, the steepest available for the first-degree murder and breach of anti-terrorism law, also contained a provision that his release can be put off indefinitely should he still be considered a threat to society.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday he would not be intimidated by ""coercion"" after China restricted some Australian exports and urged Chinese tourists and students to avoid Australia.
Diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Canberra have worsened since Australia called for an international inquiry into the source and spread of the new coronavirus, which first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Lobbying by Australia and the European Union prompted the World Health Assembly last month to back an independent review into the coronavirus pandemic.
On Tuesday, China's Ministry of Education said students should reconsider choosing to study in Australia. International education is Australia's fourth-largest export industry, worth A$38 billion ($26 billion) annually.
""We are an open-trading nation, mate, but I'm never going to trade our values in response to coercion from wherever it comes,"" Morrison told radio station 2GB on Thursday.
China has in recent weeks banned Australian beef imports and imposed tariffs on Australian barley. It has also urged Chinese tourists to avoid Australia. 
In both cases, officials in Beijing said the warnings were due to racist attacks against Asians during the pandemic.
""That's rubbish. It's a ridiculous assertion and it's rejected. That's not a statement that's been made by the Chinese leadership,"" Morrison said in a separate interview on 3AW.
""POLITICAL PAWN""
Asked about Morrison's comments, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying denied accusations of coercion and said the warnings were based on facts.
China urges Australia to protect the safety of Chinese citizens, she told a daily news conference. 
Australia lodged a protest with China's foreign ministry and with its embassy in Canberra about Beijing's travel and student warnings.
A coalition representing Australia's elite universities, the Group of Eight, has said international education is ""being used as a political pawn"".
The Australian National University's chancellor, Julie Bishop, formerly Australia's foreign minister, said the university offered students from more than 100 countries a world-class education.
""Canberra is one of the safest cities in a country widely regarded as one of the safest in the world,"" she said.
Many international students have been unable to return to Australia because of travel bans to stop the spread of COVID-19, but ANU said most of its students remained enrolled and 65% of its Chinese students were in Australia.
Monash University's vice-chancellor, Margaret Gardner, told ABC Radio it was ""very tense times diplomatically between China and Australia and in fact in this case universities and their students from China are part of the collateral"".

China is Australia's largest trading partner, with two-way trade worth A$235 billion a year.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey granted wider powers on Thursday to a night-time neighbourhood guard force which dates back to the Ottoman era, drawing opposition warnings of potential rights violations as personnel with limited training join the security forces.
The guards, dubbed ""night eagles"", were revived by President Tayyip Erdogan and began patrolling urban streets in 2017, a year after an attempted military coup.
Under the law, pushed through parliament by Erdogan's AK Party overnight, they will have the authority to demand people identify themselves, to use force and carry weapons and to apprehend suspects.
""You cannot give someone a gun and send them into the street with broad authority after 40 days of training,"" Engin Altay, a deputy from the main opposition Republican People's Party, said last week.
Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu, a lawmaker from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), also criticised the level of guards' education, saying they would only have a few hours of training regarding human rights.
""This law is not about protecting the people or the district. It is a law to protect the state from the people,"" he said in a speech in parliament during debate on the law, warning of a rise in violent incidents involving security forces.
The return of the neighbourhood guards coincided with upheaval following the failed 2016 coup. Turkey has jailed tens of thousands of people and suspended or sacked 150,000 civil servants and security personnel in what critics call a crackdown on dissent and Ankara says is necessitated by security threats.
Police data shows that last year the number of police officers in Turkey rose 7.9% to more than 260,000 with the number of neighbourhood guards nearly doubling to more than 21,000. This year the number of guards is set to rise to 30,000, according to one AKP deputy.
The Interior Ministry has defended the increased role given to neighbourhood guards, saying the daily average of home burglaries nationwide had fallen by 47% to 151 since the force was revitalised.
It said guards undergo three months of training and then have two months of practical training, with 20% of them being university graduates.
Erdogan's AKP has 291 seats in the 600 seat assembly and had a comfortable majority to pass the legislation with the 46 deputies in the party of its nationalist MHP allies.

TAIPEI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Taiwan is gearing up to welcome Hong Kong people fleeing their city as China tightens its grip, but the island has little experience of handling refugees and is scrambling to prepare and to keep out any Chinese spies who might try to join the influx.
Year-long anti-government protests in Hong Kong have won widespread sympathy in democratic and Chinese-claimed Taiwan, which has welcomed those who have already come and expects more.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen last month became the first government leader anywhere to pledge measures to help Hong Kong people who leave due to what they see as tightening Chinese controls, including newly introduced national security legislation, smothering their democratic aspirations.
China denies stifling Hong Kong's freedoms and has condemned Tsai's offer. 
Taiwan, for decades just as wary of the mainland as many in the former British colony of Hong Kong are, is working on a humanitarian relief plan for the expected arrivals, officials say.
""Hong Kong no doubt is a priority for Tsai,"" a senior government official familiar with the president's thinking told Reuters, adding that the administration was setting aside resources to handle Hong Kong people.
The plan would include a monthly allowance for living and rent and shelter for those unable to find accommodation, said a second person with direct knowledge of the preparations.
It is too early to gauge how many might come but Taiwan does not expect the number to be more than the thousands of people who came from Vietnam from the mid-1970s, most fleeing the communist takeover of what had been U.S.-backed South Vietnam.
Nearly 200 Hong Kong people have fled to Taiwan since protests flared last year and about 10% have been granted visas under a law that protects Hong Kong people who are at risk for political reasons, said Shih Yi-hsiang of the Taiwan Association for Human Rights.
For now, anyone thinking of making the move has to wait as Taiwan has barred Hong Kong people as part of its effort to block the novel coronarvirus but Shih expects the number to jump once the ban is lifted.
'VERY COMPLICATED'
With little experience of refugees since the 1970s and with worries that China could infiltrate spies posing as activists, the government was urgently looking for experts to vet backgrounds, the second source said. 
""This is a very complicated scenario that Taiwan government has never dealt with,"" said the source who declined to be identified as the information about plans has not been made public.
""We didn't think such things would happen in Hong Kong even in our dreams.""
China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment.
A Taiwan government panel including security officials would scrutinise applications and issue visas allowing Hong Kong people to study or work in Taiwan, the second source said.
Shih said the government also needed experts in areas from case management to counselling.
A senior Taipei-based Western diplomat said Taiwan was most likely to get the most radical protesters and the less well-off, as those with the means would probably choose to go to countries such as Canada or Britain.
Tyrant Lau, 26, released last month from an eight-month sentence in Hong Kong for possession of weapons, welcomed Tsai's offer and said he aimed to make Taiwan home because of its democracy and low cost of living.
""It's the only hope for protesters who can't afford moving to other places,"" Lau said in Hong Kong as he waits for the border to open.

""I hope I can live a normal life in Taiwan. I've forgotten what a normal life is like.""

MABARHULE, South Africa (Reuters) - When Khimbini Hlongwane spent most of his small safari tour company's savings on the deposit for a new minibus in February, it seemed like a safe bet.
His revenues had doubled in the previous year. And bookings by American, British, and Brazilian tourists hoping to catch a glimpse of elephants, giraffes and lions at South Africa's famous Kruger National Park were up.
Now, with borders closed and airlines grounded due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Africa's multi-billion-dollar safari industry is unravelling and he can no longer afford the payments on the new 21-seater, which sits collecting dust in the parking lot. 
""It hasn't moved since the day we bought it,"" said Hlongwane, who has been forced to stop paying the salaries of his five employees. ""We could've been using that money to survive right now.""
From Kenya's Masai Mara to the Okavango Delta in Botswana, rural communities that depend on safaris for income are seeing their livelihoods and dreams shattered. Hundreds of thousands of people rely on the sector, not to mention their dependents.
A slump in tourist dollars has hit conservation projects hard. And even as countries around the world loosen lockdowns, game parks, lodges and travel agencies face a grim future.
The safari industry generates some $12.4 billion in annual revenues for South Africa, Botswana, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania Uganda and Zambia - Africa's top wildlife tourist destinations - according to an estimate by SafariBookings.
But a survey of over 300 tour operators conducted by the online safari travel platform this month showed that almost 93% reported a drop in bookings of at least 75% due to the pandemic. Cancellations have also spiked, the majority of them said.
'HOW LONG CAN WE CARRY ON?'
Leon Plutsick's Distinctly Africa lodge on the Manyeleti private game reserve bordering the Kruger National Park had been full in March.
Today, his employees are sitting at home and baboons have ransacked his unstaffed kitchen.
""We're getting to a point where we have to ask ourselves how long do we carry on?"" he said. ""A lot of us are living on reserves just to survive.""
Plutsick is not alone.
A survey of close to 500 businesses in the Kruger Lowveld district - South Africa's safari heartland - conducted by the local tourism agency last month, found 90% believed they would not survive even if international borders opened immediately.
Over two-thirds of them have laid off employees.
The lack of tourist dollars is forcing wildlife projects across Africa to make cuts, and beyond the human cost, conservationists worry that growing desperation in rural communities hit by COVID-19 could fuel a wave of poaching.
Three popular game parks in South Africa recently dehorned dozens of rhinos as a preventative measure, hoping that it would make them less attractive targets for poachers.
In Mabarhule, a community on the edge of Kruger National Park, roughly half of residents were already jobless before the pandemic. 
Freelance workers like Sipho Nkosi - a tour guide and father of four who typically makes around 550 rand ($33) per tour - have found themselves without a safety net.
""We'd saved some money. But its running out, so we'll start starving,"" said Nkosi, standing outside a half-completed community hall that was being built using tourist donations.
'A BIGGER HOLE?'
The Madilika Craft Centre sits so close to the boundary of the Kruger National Park that lions can sometimes be heard roaring in the distance.
A layer of dust now coats the pink walls of the women's cooperative, which shut when the private game lodges where it sold its traditional Xitsonga beaded jewellery closed down in March.
Now, with her income gone, co-founder Jane Mashele is hoping the sweet potatoes and spinach in her garden will be enough to feed her four orphaned grandchildren.
""We started the centre because we were tired of sitting at home with no jobs,"" she said. ""This is terrible."" 
In South Africa, which has recorded the most COVID-19 cases of any African nation, Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane warned parliament last month that up to 600,000 jobs were at risk if the sector remained shut until September.
Governments' relief initiatives - like South Africa's offer of 50,000 rand ($3,000) one-time grants to small tourism businesses - will do little to staunch the losses, some operators said.
In the face of looming financial calamity, the Tourism Business Council of South Africa - the industry's lobby group - is pushing for international tourism to resume as early as September.
With the pandemic's peak on most of the continent still predicted to be months away, that appears unlikely.
South Africa's government has instead said regional and international tourism are only expected to resume next year.
Kenya, Namibia and Rwanda also remain closed to international visitors, while in Zambia tourists are permitted but face a two-week quarantine upon arrival. Tanzania has dropped quarantine requirements and is welcoming foreign guests.
One East African tour operator said even if restrictions were eased, international travellers could be discouraged by the possibility of quarantines when they return home.
In the meantime, South Africa, for one, hopes domestic visitors can drive the first phase of a recovery. South African national parks are now opening for self-driving safaris. 
But overnight visits and travel across provincial borders remain banned under current restrictions. Even when permitted, some operators worry that local visitors will not be enough to save their businesses. 
""To open for two or four or six people, is it actually worth it?"" asked lodge owner Plutsick. ""I'll just be digging myself a bigger hole.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian officials warned Black Lives Matter supporters they could be arrested if they breach coronavirus restrictions to take part in public protests, as debate erupted over the country's own indigenous history.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison drew strong criticism on Thursday after he said ""there was no slavery in Australia"" during a discussion of the early days of British settlement, which he acknowledged was ""pretty brutal.""
Historians, Aboriginal activists and some lawmakers expressed shock and dismay at the comments.
""Slavery of indigenous, men, women and children is well documented,"" said Sharman Stone, a former federal lawmaker and now politics professor at Monash University. ""Slaves worked in pearling, fishing, the pastoral industries and as domestic labour."" 
The Black Lives Matter movement has refocused attention in Australia on the mistreatment of indigenous Australians, including Aboriginal deaths in custody.
Victoria state officials confirmed on Thursday that one of eight new cases of COVID-19 reported on Thursday was a man who attended the Melbourne weekend rally. More unauthorised protests are planned for Friday. 
""We will start writing tickets of A$1,000 ($700) and we can use all of our powers to move people on,"" New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told 2GB Radio. ""If you don’t move on, well then you'll be arrested."" 
Morrison rejected growing calls to remove statues of white leaders, including one of the country's first prime minister, Edmund Barton, which is located near an Aboriginal burial site. Barton played a key role in drafting the national constitution, which negated Aboriginal rights. 
Morrison said the initial motives of protesters were ""fair"", but the push for removal of the statues was being driven by political agendas.
Australia on Tuesday recorded its first day without any community transmissions of COVID-19 since the crisis began. It has recorded 7,285 cases, including 102 deaths.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Two North Korean defector-run groups targeted for legal action by South Korean authorities say they intend to continue sending propaganda leaflets and humanitarian aid into North Korea, despite criticism from governments in both countries.
South Korea, which is trying to improve ties with the North, on Wednesday accused the two groups, Kuensaem Education Center and Fighters for a Free North Korea, of violating the Inter-Korean Exchange and Co-operation Act by sending leaflets and aid such as rice and medicine.
On Thursday, the South's Unification Ministry said it had asked Seoul police to investigate the groups.
For the past week, North Korean state media have carried a series of reports and statements from senior officials expressing outrage over defectors, denouncing them as ""mongrel dogs"" and ""human scum little short of wild animals"".
Park Jung-oh, who defected to South Korea in 2000 and heads Kuensaem, said the organisation is still planning to send hundreds of bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and medical face masks to North Korea by throwing them into the sea near the border next week.
Fighters for a Free North Korea, which is run by Park's brother Park Sang-hak, has also said it plans to send more leaflets into North Korea by balloon over the heavily fortified border.
South Korean authorities have occasionally moved to stop such operations, including in 2018 during a series of summits between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
The two Koreas even traded fire in 2014 after the North's military fired machine guns at balloons launched by defector activists.
This week, the ministry said it was considering a law to ban the leaflets and aid, saying they raise tensions with North Korea, pose risks to South Koreans living near the border, and cause environmental damage.
South Korean residents near the border have complained about the two defector groups and they had failed to register the goods before sending them to the North, the ministry said when asked why they had been singled out from around a dozen groups which send goods over the border.
Over the weekend some locals stopped an effort by a separate group to send bottles of rice by sea.
In a poll released on Thursday by South Korean pollster Realmeter, 50% of those surveyed said they would support a ban on such operations, while 41% said they were opposed.
Heo Kwang-il, head of the defector-run Committee for the Democratization of North Korea, said defector groups had been doing work the Moon administration was failing to do to support human rights in North Korea.
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) called the leaflets a ""relatively harmless expressive act"" that should not be banned.
""It is shameful how President Moon and his government are totally unwilling to stand up for the rights of North Koreans,"" Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for HRW said in a statement.
Engagement with North Korea should incorporate South Korean values of democracy and freedom of expression, said Sokeel Park of Liberty in North Korea, which supports defectors.

""Ditching such hard-won values to comply with harsh threats from Pyongyang, just to preserve a veneer of improved inter-Korean relations, sets a terrible precedent and puts all future engagement efforts on a tenuous footing,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has turned down a travel request for members of a U.S. government panel seeking to review its religious freedom, saying such foreign agencies had no standing to assess the constitutional rights of citizens.
Since taking power in 2014, the Indian government has faced criticism for attacks on Muslims and the panel has called for the world's biggest democracy to be designated a ""country of particular concern"", along with China, Iran, Russia and Syria.
The call by the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) was made in an April report urging sanctions against officials of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government after it excluded minority Muslims from a new citizenship law.
Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said the government firmly repudiated the surveys of the commission, which had little knowledge of the rights of Indian citizens, describing it as biased and prejudiced.
""We have also denied visas to USCIRF teams that have sought to visit India in connection with issues related to religious freedom,"" he told a lawmaker from Modi's ruling group in a June 1 letter.
The step was taken because the government saw no grounds for a foreign entity such as the USCIRF to pronounce on the state of Indian citizens' constitutionally protected rights, he added.
Reuters has reviewed a copy of the letter to Nishikant Dubey, an MP who had raised the issue of the panel's report in parliament.
The U.S. embassy in New Delhi referred all queries to the commission based in Washington D.C., which was not immediately available to respond.
The commission is a bipartisan U.S. government advisory body that monitors religious freedom abroad and makes policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state, and Congress. However, these are not binding.

India would not accept any foreign interference or judgement on matters related to its sovereignty, Jaishankar added.

President Donald Trump has ordered the U.S. military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany, a senior U.S. official said on Friday.
The move would reduce the U.S. contingent to 25,000.
Richard Grenell, who resigned as U.S. ambassador to Germany on June 1, told Bild Live late on Wednesday: ""American taxpayers no longer feel like paying too much for the defence of other countries.""
""There will still be 25,000 soldiers in Germany, that's no small number,"" he added, according to a German translation of his remarks. 
The troop move is the latest twist in relations between Berlin and Washington that have often been strained during Trump's presidency. Trump has pressed Germany to raise defence spending and accused Berlin of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to its partial reliance on Russian energy.

Trump's decision to cut U.S. troop levels in Germany blindsided a number of senior national security officials, according to five sources familiar with the matter, and the Pentagon had yet to receive a formal order to carry it out, Reuters has learned.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Thursday the United States has no standing to comment on inter-Korean affairs, and it is in Washington's interest to stay quiet if it wants the upcoming presidential election to go smoothly, state media reported.
The statement comes after the U.S. State Department said it was disappointed at North Korea for suspending communication hotlines with South Korea on Tuesday.
""If the U.S. pokes its nose into others' affairs with careless remarks, far from minding its internal affairs, at a time when its political situation is in the worst-ever confusion, it may encounter an unpleasant thing hard to deal with,"" Kwon Jong Gun, director-general for U.S. affairs at North Korea’s Foreign Ministry, said in comments carried by state news agency KCNA.
The United States should ""hold its tongue"" and address its own domestic problems unless it wants to ""experience a hair-raiser,"" he said. 
""It would be good not only for the U.S. interests but also for the easy holding of upcoming presidential election.""
It is unclear what North Korea would do to disrupt the election or cause problems for U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, said James Kim, a research fellow at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.
""If anything, there’s a chance that provocation may even rally the country around the incumbent,"" he said.
After a series of historic summits in 2018 and 2019 between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, little progress has been made in dismantling the North's nuclear weapons programme, and Pyongyang has expressed increasing frustration with Washington's refusal to ease sanctions.
North Korea said on Tuesday it would sever hotlines with South Korea after days of lashing out at Seoul for not stopping defectors from sending leaflets and other material into the North.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Hundreds of Syrians in the mainly Druze city of Sweida took to the streets for a fourth day on Wednesday, protesting worsening economic conditions and demanding the downfall of Syrian President Bashar al Assad. 
Residents said demonstrators near a main square of the southwestern city called for Assad’s overthrow, echoing chants at the start of pro-democracy protests in 2011 that were violently crushed by security forces and sparked a violent, nine-year conflict.
Syria is in the throes of a deep economic crisis that has seen its currency hit a record 3,000 Syrian pounds to the dollar earlier this week in a rapidly accelerating free-fall. It traded at 47 pounds to the dollar at the start of the conflict.
Protests since Sunday have also called for an end to rampant corruption and the pullout of Iranian militias and Russian troops, whose support has helped Assad regain most of the territory once in hands of rebels seeking to end his rule.
""Protesters called for freedom and toppling of the regime as a result of popular anger over the deteriorating economic, social, security and political situation,"" said Noura al Basha, a resident and activist.
For the first time since the protests began, dozens of government supporters organised a counter demonstration in front of the provincial government offices, where they criticised a wave of new, tighter U.S. sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, which takes effect later this month. 
Syrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread hardship among ordinary residents, where the currency collapse has led to soaring prices and people struggling to afford food and basic supplies.
State media made no mention of the opposition protest.
Sweida city had been spared the unrest seen in other parts of Syria since the start of the conflict and remained in government hands. 
The majority Druze population have long resisted being drawn into the Syrian conflict that pits mainly Sunni rebels against Assad’s rule.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Some Chinese students returning to school after lockdown are grappling with familial conflict while others are stressing over how coronavirus disruptions have affected their academic performance, teachers and school counsellors say.
The heightened post-lockdown anxiety has become a matter of central government concern as domestic media report a spate of suicides by young people. It has also led to unprecedented measures by schools and local governments to focus on student mental health - a topic that like suicide has often been taboo in Chinese society.
""There have been some heartbreaking incidents as schools reopened,"" Yan Wu, vice mayor of the southern city of Zhuhai, said at China's annual parliamentary meeting last month.
""This highlights the importance and urgency of promoting mental health development in young students,"" he said.
At the parliamentary meeting, at least four delegates put forward proposals for more attention to be paid to students' psychological needs. 
In one Shanghai district, there have been 14 suicides by primary and secondary school students so far this year - more than annual numbers for the last three years, Li Guohua, deputy mayor of Shanghai's Pudong New Area district, told financial magazine Caixin in May.
""It's the tip of an iceberg,"" he was quoted as saying.
Reuters was unable to contact Li or confirm the number with local authorities.
The state-owned Health Times also reported on Sunday that nationwide, 18 students had jumped off buildings in the past three months and quoted experts calling for more focus on student mental health. The article was, however, soon deleted - a common occurrence in China when sensitive topics are raised.
LIFE EDUCATION
As China eased measures to stem the outbreak of the coronavirus, students began shifting from online classes back to classrooms in March.
One online survey of 1.22 million primary and secondary students conducted that month by the southern province of Guangdong's health commission and a university concluded that 10.5% were potentially grappling with mental health issues. Detailed findings were not published.
In late April, China's education ministry began telling schools to pay attention to mental health and adjust lesson plans so that students feel less academic pressure. Nearly a dozen local governments have since published measures, with the eastern province of Anhui scrapping some exams. 
The city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus in China, Hainan province and Shanghai are among local governments providing new ""life education"" classes aimed at helping students deal with stress and grief.
In one such class, students were divided into two groups who raced to form English words, but one group was given a much harder set of letters - a prompt for a discussion about stressful situations.
""The purpose was to make students aware that feeling stressed is natural, and that how you deal with that stress can lead to different outcomes,"" said the teacher. 
She was one of six Shanghai-based teachers and school counsellors interviewed for this story. All declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.
""Reopening after the lockdown was very different compared to a normal return by kids after winter vacation,"" said a counsellor at a Shanghai high school.
She said her workload has increased as students consult about academic pressure and study plans, and that she has online meetings with at least two families every week prompted by requests from students. 
""I am hoping the virus will teach kids how to deal with changes in life. Life is full of difficulties,"" she said.

The other countries involved are Ukraine, Canada and the United States. Canada previously pressed Iran to send the black boxes to France for analysis. 
Iran has refused to hand over the flight recorders from the Ukraine International Airlines flight, which was shot down on Jan. 8 near Tehran by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, killing 176 people including 55 Canadian citizens and 30 permanent residents.
In March, Iran told the U.N.'s aviation agency that it would send the black boxes to Ukraine. 
But on Wednesday, a representative from Iran told a virtual meeting of the agency's governing council that Tehran would now send the heavily damaged recorders to France's BEA air accident investigation agency.
""Iran said they will send them to Paris soon subject to agreement of the states involved in the investigation,"" said one of the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Iranian officials were not immediately available for comment. A spokeswoman for Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau declined to comment on discussion of the boxes being sent to Paris. 
""Iran made a commitment in March. They showed an openness to transferring the black boxes but we want to see concrete action on their part to see it through,"" she said. 

Under U.N. rules, Iran retains overall control of the investigation while the United States and Ukraine are accredited as the countries where the jet was respectively built and operated. Canada has also played a role as the home of many of the accident’s victims.

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus crisis is exposing Britain's existing inequalities - between low and high earners, young and old workers and for ethnic minorities - which could be aggravated without reforms, a leading think tank said on Thursday.
People on low wages are most at risk of losing income and their jobs because of the COVID-19 shutdown, while a gap in death rates between rich and poor neighbourhoods has widened, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.
British people of Pakistani or Bangladeshi heritage are most likely to work in sectors affected by the coronavirus shutdown. Black people have contracted COVID-19 at far-above-average rates, reflecting how they are more likely to be in jobs with a greater risk of exposure to the coronavirus, the IFS said.
""Government will need to be on the front foot in laying the groundwork for a strong and inclusive recovery even while still dealing with the immediate crisis,"" said IFS deputy director Robert Joyce, who co-wrote the report.
Reforms to consider included providing better training for workers, protecting small businesses, and catch-up teaching for children, especially from poorer families.
The IFS report saw some upsides from the shutdown, including increased remote working which could help mothers' careers while fathers spent more time with their children than before.
Remote working could also help spread high-paid and high-productivity jobs away from London, addressing Britain's regional productivity disparities.
The IFS's findings chimed with other research by academics who found black, Asian and minority ethnic people in Britain, and those with fewer qualifications, were hit harder by job losses than the population as a whole. [nL8N2DL44Z] 

The reports have come as the global protests at the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis have put renewed focus on the wider economic inequalities facing black people.

788,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 05:41PM ET</span>",U.S.-Polish Fort Trump project crumbles,"By Joanna Plucinska and Idrees Ali
WARSAW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fort Trump appears to have fallen. Poland's grand proposal in 2018 to name a military base in honor of Donald Trump, in return for the U.S. president placing a permanent presence there, has crumbled amid disputes over how to fund the deployment and where to garrison the soldiers, sources say.
A U.S. official familiar with the matter said the idea had been doomed from the start: ""There is no Fort Trump.""
On June 12 last year, Trump agreed, with Polish President Andrzej Duda beside him at the White House, to send 1,000 more troops to his NATO ally, bolstering its defenses against Russia to the east and cementing bilateral ties.
Many officials called the project ""Fort Trump"", although the name was never official, and the idea of building a new base for the troops was soon dropped.
A year on, government officials in Washington and Warsaw say they still cannot agree where the troops should be stationed, and how much of the multi-billion-dollar deployment Warsaw should fund.
Poland wants to put them close to its eastern border with Russia's ally Belarus, but on past form this is certain to antagonize Russia, and Washington would prefer to deploy them further west, the officials said.
Warsaw initially talked of contributing $2 billion, already a challenge now that the coronavirus has dented its economy, but the United States wants it to pay more, the officials added.
Then there is the legal status of U.S. troops permanently stationed in Poland for the first time; currently, around 4,500 troops are regularly rotated through.
Washington wants enhanced legal immunity, for example in situations where U.S. troops are accused of crimes on Polish soil, but Poland is balking.
""VERY COMPLEX""
Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Pawel Jablonski calls it all ""a very complicated process"".
""There's the question of financing, of the placement, of legal rights, under what principles these soldiers will function here,"" he told Reuters.
""The discussions are taking a long time because the subject matter is just very complex. I do think we will come to a final decision, but this will still take some time.""
And that time may just have got longer.
Last week, a senior U.S. official said Trump had decided to draw down 9,500 of the 34,500 U.S. troops currently deployed in Germany.
U.S. officials said some of these could be sent to Poland, which is dismayed that its gain might be at the expense of its NATO ally and neighbor, a key element in its own security plan.
""In general, every withdrawal of military forces in Europe is a risk, and it's not that we as a Polish government see this positively, because we think the American presence should be larger,"" Jablonski said.
Some of the U.S. troops currently in Poland were deployed by NATO after Moscow sent shivers through Warsaw in 2014 by seizing the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, which borders both countries.
For the additional U.S. troops, six locations were shortlisted when Vice President Mike Pence visited Warsaw in September.

High-level talks to deal with sticking points, scheduled for March, were called off after U.S. defense undersecretary John Rood left his post at Trump's request, the U.S. official said.

The Government of National Accord (GNA), which is backed by Turkey, and the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, have each met separately with U.N. negotiators, the U.N. Libya mission said.
It follows the sudden collapse of the LNA's 14-month offensive to capture the capital Tripoli, the seat of the GNA, and its retreat from most of its territory in northwest Libya. 
A GNA effort from Monday to push further east and capture Sirte, effectively wiping out all the LNA's gains since the start of its Tripoli campaign in April 2019, was repulsed with air strikes, an LNA military source said. 
""The Mission is particularly concerned by reports of escalation and mobilization in and around the city of Sirte"", the U.N. Libya mission said in its statement announcing the talks were under way.

793,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",J.K. Rowling reveals past abuse and defends right to speak on trans issues,"By Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - Author J.K. Rowling defended her right to speak about trans issues without fear of abuse in an intensely personal essay in which she explained the complex reasons for her interest in the subject, revealing painful details from her past.
The Harry Potter creator has long been a target of criticism by trans activists who have taken issue with some of her social media posts. At times, the criticism has taken the form of abusive language and threats of violence.
""I know it's time to explain myself on an issue surrounded by toxicity,"" she wrote at the start of her essay, published on her website on Wednesday. She said she had no desire to add to that toxicity.
In the latest of several controversies, a post by Rowling in which she criticised the use of the phrase ""people who menstruate"" drew negative responses, including from Daniel Radcliffe, who played Potter in a series of films.
Rowling, 54, explained in detail her research and beliefs on trans issues, and the concerns she has about how women's rights and some young people's lives were being impacted by some forms of trans activism.
Some of the reasons for her interest were professional, but some were rooted in personal experience.
""I've wondered whether, if I'd been born 30 years later, I too might have tried to transition,"" she wrote. ""The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.""
She said that as a teenager she had struggled with severe Obsessive–Compulsive Disorder (OCD) and that she now believes that had she found community and sympathy online, she could have been persuaded to turn herself into the boy her father said he would have preferred.
Rowling also revealed that she was a survivor of domestic abuse and sexual assault, and that the trauma of those experiences informed some of her beliefs and feelings about women's rights, and her fears that they were being eroded.
""The scars left by violence and sexual assault don’t disappear, no matter how loved you are, and no matter how much money you’ve made,"" she said, offering solidarity and kinship to trans women who had died at the hands of violent men.
""I have a visceral sense of the terror in which those trans women will have spent their last seconds on earth, because I too have known moments of blind fear when I realised that the only thing keeping me alive was the shaky self-restraint of my attacker.""
""I REFUSE TO BOW DOWN""
Rowling said that she believed most trans people not only posed zero threat to others but were vulnerable, and that they deserved protection.
At the same time, she said, she did not want girls and women to be less safe, and she gave some examples of where she thought demands by trans people were dangerous to women.
""When you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels he's a woman ... then you open the door to any and all men who wish to come inside.""
Describing some of the abuse she had received -- including being told she was ""literally killing people with your hate"" and being compared with Voldemort, the villain of the Potter series, Rowling said many women were terrified by trans activists.
""I refuse to bow down to a movement that I believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode 'woman' as a political and biological class and offering cover to predators like few before it,"" she said.
Addressing the specific issue of the use of phrases like ""people who menstruate"" as a way of including trans women, Rowling said such language was demeaning to many women.
""I understand why trans activists consider this language to be appropriate and kind, but for those of us who’ve had degrading slurs spat at us by violent men, it’s not neutral, it’s hostile and alienating.""
Rowling said she had not written the essay in the hope that anyone would get out a violin for her, and that she considered herself extraordinarily fortunate.
""I’ve only mentioned my past because, like every other human being on this planet, I have a complex back-story, which shapes my fears, my interests and my opinions. I never forget that inner complexity when I’m creating a fictional character and I certainly never forget it when it comes to trans people.

""All I’m asking – all I want – is for similar empathy, similar understanding, to be extended to the many millions of women whose sole crime is wanting their concerns to be heard without receiving threats and abuse.""

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's National Security Council (NSC) in a maiden news conference on Wednesday accused allies of the late former leader Robert Mugabe and some opposition officials of peddling rumours of an impending military coup and said the country was stable.
Zimbabwe's worst economic crisis in more than a decade and rising public anger have stoked concern the military, which ended Mugabe's more than three-decades rule in November 2017, might step in again.
Giving its first news conference since being formed in 2013, the NSC said speculation was intensifying that Mugabe allies living in exile were plotting a comeback with the help of elements in the military and the opposition.
The NSC is chaired by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and its members include security ministers and military chiefs, who were present at Wednesday's media briefing.
""For the avoidance of doubt, there is no coup in the making,"" Kazembe Kazembe, the home affairs minister in charge of the police and an NSC member, told reporters.
""We would like to take this opportunity and assure the nation and international community at large that Zimbabwe ... is peaceful and stable internally.""
The 2018 elections were supposed to end Zimbabwe's pariah status with the West, but Mnangagwa's government has been accused of resorting to Mugabe-era tactics of heavy handedness against opponents.
The main opposition accuses the government of using a coronavirus lockdown to erode political rights.
Kazembe said the authorities would tackle those spreading a ""medley of falsehoods"".
Without naming them, he accused some foreign embassies in Harare of misleading their capitals on affairs in Zimbabwe and relying on the opposition and former ruling party officials in their intelligence gathering. 

""They also have, in the process, brazenly jettisoned any semblance of diplomatic impartiality and finesse in blatant violation of the peremptory norms of international law,"" Kazembe said.

Rabat has eased some measures in regions with low infection rates but kept in place a ban on people leaving their homes without permits in areas with higher numbers of COVID-19 cases including some larger cities. Restaurants, cafes, cinemas and other businesses in the vital services sector also remain shut.
""Moroccans are exhausted...Their desire to end the lockdown reflects the shocking reality of social and economic confinement,"" said Abdellatif Ouahbi, head of the largest opposition party PAM. 
Abdellah Bouano of the Islamist PJD party that is part of the ruling coalition, said maintaining the lockdown showed ""a lack of vision"" and urged a return to normalcy.
The focus on COVID-19 had also been detrimental to the care of patients suffering from other diseases, he said.
Prime Minister Saad Dine El Otmani countered that the lockdown had helped to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed.
Only 1% of intensive care beds were occupied and only 2.5% of people who had caught the virus had died, he said. 
Authorities have released from lockdown all businesses except those in the service sector and has offered monthly stipends of up to 2,000 dirhams ($200) to those made jobless by the lockdown.
Otmani said the loosening of restrictions would proceed gradually and on a region-by-region basis but could be reimposed in full if infection rates resurged.
He gave no date to resume international flights, however, drawing criticism in parliament.
Morocco has increased its daily testing capacity to 17,500 and had confirmed 8,455 cases of COVID-19 infections including 210 deaths by Wednesday afternoon.

Consuelo Locati, a lawyer for the group, said around 40 requests were filed over the handling of the outbreak in Lombardy, the northern region which includes Bergamo and accounts for around half of Italy's 34,000 deaths.
""People want an explanation,"" Locati told Reuters. ""They have given a signal to the justice system and they want to have confidence in the justice system because there's a moral obligation in this.""
The aim was to identify those responsible for managing the response and determine whether criminal charges could be raised, she said, adding that once lawyers had time to prepare a case, a separate wave of civil lawsuits would be likely in September.
Regional authorities in Lombardy have faced angry criticism for failing to set up special isolated ""red zones"" quickly enough, and for leaving open a major hospital that became a centre of infection early in the crisis.
Bergamo prosecutors have already questioned Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, and its health chief Giulio Gallera over a decision not to seal off badly affected areas in the city's hinterland early in the outbreak.
This week they will question Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and top ministers on Friday.
Critics accuse the right-wing League party, which has dominated Lombardy's politics for decades, of weakening the system by putting too much emphasis on big hospitals and starving local health services of resources.
When the pandemic struck, critics say, too many patients died because they were funnelled into hospitals only after developing serious symptoms, or left in nursing homes with inadequate care while overstretched local general practitioners went without adequate support.

Fontana has defended his government's handling of the crisis, while admitting mistakes, saying general practitioners would henceforth receive more resources.

The prince, 28, who is the nephew of Belgium's King Philippe, travelled to the southern Spanish region of Andalusia from Belgium on May 24 for an internship. 
He has been penalised for failing to quarantine himself for 14 days on arrival, a requirement for anyone entering the country, the government official in Andalusia told Reuters.
Prince Joachim admitted breaching quarantine rules, and has 15 days to respond to the fine, the official said.

Prince Joachim, who is tenth in line to the Belgian throne, tested positive after attending a party in the city of Cordoba on May 26.
The official said the prince is now quarantined in Spain.
Spanish authorities are investigating the party, which Spain's El Pais newspaper reported last month was attended by 27 people. This would have breached lockdown rules in Cordoba, where restrictions capped gatherings at a maximum of 15 people.
However, a source close to the Belgian Royal Palace said on Wednesday that the prince had attended two separate gatherings, with 12 people at one and 15 at the other.

""The agreement between the GNA and LNA to re-enter U.N. security talks was a good first step, very positive,"" Pompeo said in a news conference, referring to the internationally recognized Government of National Accord and Libyan National Army, led by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar.
""Quick and good-faith negotiations are now required to implement a ceasefire and relaunch the U.N.-led intra-Libyan political talks,"" Pompeo said.
The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) on June 2 said Libya's warring parties had agreed to restart ceasefire talks.
Over the past couple of weeks, Libya’s conflict has taken a new turn. In a series of rapid victories, the GNA has, with Turkish support, suddenly brought most of northwest Libya back under its control, dashing Haftar's bid to unite the country by force with help from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia.
While the United States has said it opposes Haftar's offensive, it has not thrown its support behind the GNA. It has also lambasted Russian involvement, a stance reiterated on Wednesday by Pompeo.
""It’s time ... for all Libyans and all sides to act so that neither Russia or any other country can interfere in Libya’s sovereignty for its own game,"" Pompeo said.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Libya in a call on Monday. Erdogan said the two agreed on ""some issues"" on Libya.

Egypt has also called for a ceasefire starting on Monday, as part of a wider political initiative which was welcomed by Russia and the UAE. Turkey dismissed it as an attempt to save Haftar following the losses he suffered on the battlefield.

""The Dordogne is about castles and culture, wine and canoeing on the river, not beaches,"" she said.
From the Algarve in Portugal to Ayia Napa in Cyprus, empty beaches await any British holidaymakers, who Eurostat data shows are normally among the biggest spenders in Europe, after tourists from Germany and France.
Spain's Benidorm, which is a traditional hotspot for British sunseekers, is preparing for a year of transition.
""Benidorm is like Piccadilly Beach,"" Tony Mayor, head of the hoteliers association at the Spanish resort, said of its long association between British holidaymakers. 
""They are much loved and very loyal,"" Mayor added.
Meanwhile, British government ministers have said they are looking at whether travel corridors could allow Britons to go on holiday in destinations with a low coronavirus infection rate, an idea which does not yet appear to have gained traction.
In Italy, where hotels expect a slump in British arrivals, a spokesman for the hoteliers association said Britons would be ""welcomed with open arms"". 
'CAN'T LAST'
A pent-up desire to escape lockdown for a guaranteed sunshine-filled beach stay means airlines are seeing a spike in interest among Britons for overseas holidays from July onwards. 
Ryanair plans to have around 40% of its normal flying capacity in July and August, and has reported solid demand for outbound flights. The budget airline is offering flexible tickets in case of problems flying over the summer.
However, IATA Director General Alexandre de Juniac said an increase in British bookings despite the quarantine demonstrated confidence that it would prove short-lived.
""Passengers are expecting this relaxation to happen because it can't last too long,"" de Juniac told Reuters TV.
At the Sete Cafe in Vilamoura on Portugal's Algarve, any easing cannot come too soon for the business owned by soccer superstar Luis Figo and Portuguese jetsetter Paulo China.
""I think 70% of our customers are foreigners, especially British,"" said 27-year-old waiter William Costa. 

""We really need them to come back. It is very important the airports return to normal. We need to secure jobs.""

KIEV (Reuters) - For parents Jose Perez and Flavia Lavorino, the wait is finally over. On Wednesday, the couple from Buenos Aires met their baby son Manu for the first time, 71 days after he was born to a surrogate mother 8,000 miles (12,875 km) away in Ukraine.
""Joy, excitement, happiness, accomplishment,"" a beaming Perez told Reuters, when asked how they felt.
Lockdowns and closed borders imposed by governments around the world to contain the coronavirus pandemic had prevented the parents from travelling to Kiev to pick him up until now.
Before Wednesday, Perez and Lavorino had only seen Manu, short for Manuel, in videos and photographs as they waited for special government permission to travel.
Now Lavorino can cradle Manu in her arms. As Perez kisses his head, the baby gives a little yawn.
Taking two flights with a layover in Madrid, the couple brought clothes, sneakers, blankets and a soccer T-shirt from Argentine Club Atlético Independiente with them. Lavorino worried the tiny socks for Manu would no longer fit.
""Everything was a struggle ... I don't have many words to describe just what I feel inside, there is so much emotion,"" said Lavorino.
The Argentine couple was among dozens in Europe, the United States, China and elsewhere whose babies were stranded at the BioTexCom clinic in Ukraine. 
Perez, a 47-year-old doctor, and Lavorino, a 41-year-old social worker, had been trying to have a child for years before turning to surrogacy, which is legal in Ukraine.
""Every year is hard, but each year you also have the pain of the previous one,"" Perez said. ""It costs you more to keep your hopes up. You are worn out physically and mentally, so the last years were even worse than the first ones,"" Lavorino said.
They arrived in Ukraine at the end of May, along with eight other families from Argentina whose babies had been born or are due to be born at the clinic. 
On arrival, Perez and Lavorino were placed under quarantine for seven days at a hotel in the suburbs of Kiev before meeting Manu. They were not allowed to leave their rooms, and meals were left on a table outside their door.
""The coronavirus has shown that there are many things in life that can make you stronger – hugs, kisses, the touch of those you love – these things,"" Perez said.

""This pandemic has shown us that these things are feelings you have to hold onto more closely.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin's opponents agree a nationwide vote next month that could extend his rule is a sham, but are split over whether to campaign for a ""No"" vote or call for a boycott.
In the July 1 vote, Russians will vote to approve or reject constitutional reforms including a change that would allow Putin to serve two more six-year terms, if re-elected, instead of stepping down in 2024. 
Putin's approval rating, though still high at 59%, has slipped to its lowest since 1999, the Levada pollster says, and the coronavirus pandemic poses one of the biggest challenges of his more than 20-year rule. 
Even so, Putin's opponents believe the outcome is a foregone conclusion. Some, such as politician Alexei Navalny and the liberal opposition Yabloko party, have urged supporters not to vote. 
""Legitimising this 'fete for Putin' by increasing turnout is just helping the Kremlin,"" said Lyubov Sobol, a Navalny ally. 
Others, such as the Communist party, which usually backs the Kremlin on big decisions, have urged supporters to vote against. 
The Kremlin says constitutional changes are needed to strengthen the role of parliament and improve social policy and public administration, and that polls show the changes have wide support. Critics say the reforms amount to a constitutional coup. 
Proposed measures to reduce the risk of coronavirus infections, such as allowing voting over seven days and in tents outside polling stations, will complicate election monitoring and risk voter fraud, opponents say.
""There's no opportunity to uncover falsifications. All that remains is a circus with blow-up tents,"" Navalny said. 
Election officials deny such accusations, saying the vote will be free and fair.
A ""Nyet"" campaign led by several opposition politicians, which is also considering a boycott, says billboards advertising the vote are biased and opponents have been given no air-time.

One billboard in the city of Stavropol declares: ""Update the constitution!"" with ""Okay"" beneath it.

Duda is an ally of the ruling right-wing nationalist Law and Justice Party (PiS), which brands lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) ""ideology"" as an invasive foreign influence undermining traditional values in the staunchly Catholic nation.
His main opponent is liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski of the main centre-right opposition Civic Platform (PO) party. Trzaskowski has drawn criticism from religious conservatives for introducing education about LGBT matters in Warsaw schools.
""Parents are responsible for the sexual education of their children,"" Duda told a gathering of supporters. ""It is not possible for any institutions to interfere in the way parents raise their children.""
Signing a ""Family Card"" of proposals including pledges to preserve special benefit schemes for families and pensioners, he also said he would not allow gay couples to marry or adopt children. ""It's a foreign ideology. There is no consent for this phenomenon to happen in our country in any way.""
Trzaskowski has said he is in favour of civil partnerships for gays but, according to PO, he would not approve adoptions.
""This ('Family Card') is a radical document which divides Polish society, introducing standards reminiscent of the most brutal...times of Polish and European history,"" Robert Biedron, the Left party's presidential candidate and Poland's most high-profile gay politician, was quoted as saying by state news agency PAP.
The PiS is keen to secure Duda's re-election as it would cement its grip on power to complete reforms to the judiciary and media sectors that the European Union has challenged, saying they violate EU standards on democracy and rule of law.

Duda remains the frontrunner but his lead has shrunk as the coronavirus crisis has damaged the economy, with one recent poll conducted for right-wing portal DoRzeczy.pl showing him just 2.2 percentage points ahead of Trzaskowski.

Statues of the monarch, whose troops killed and maimed millions, have been burned and sprayed since protests over the police killing of black American George Floyd turned global.
Congo Free State was Leopold's personal fiefdom and source of wealth from 1885-1908, when he was forced to cede it to the Belgian state.
Adam Hochschild, author of the best-selling ""King Leopold's Ghost"", concluded that about half its population perished under the king. Villages that missed rubber collection quotas were made to provide severed hands instead.
Pascal Smet, state secretary for city planning and heritage for the Brussels region, said discussions should include experts and people with African backgrounds, and finish by next year.
""We have all the movement of Black Lives Matter, we are this year 60 years of independence of Congo. We are in a different timeframe now,"" he told Reuters TV on Wednesday.
If the conclusion was that the statues should go, he would make this happen, although another option could be to accompany them with explanations about Belgium's colonial past.
""We take time, but not too long because there's always a danger with that kind of debate that you start talking and you never stop talking.""
Smet said in any case he wanted a memorial to decolonisation in Brussels, Belgium's capital and home to European Union institutions.
The city has an equestrian statue of Leopold beside the royal palace - its hands now painted blood-red and its chest reading ""Pardon"" (Sorry) - along with three busts and a Leopold II road tunnel.
A statue in the city of Mons has been put into storage, and campaigners have demanded the removal of a bust from Leuven University's library.

Colonialism is now to be taught compulsorily in secondary schools in the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders.

808,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 09:57AM ET</span>",Germany voices concern over Israeli annexation plan but no mention yet of sanctions,"By Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Germany's foreign minister on Wednesday expressed serious concern to Israel about its plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, but he stopped short of threatening sanctions.
Minister Heiko Maas was speaking on a visit to Israel one month before Berlin assumes the European Union presidency, a role which gives it great influence in guiding EU policy.
Israel's new unity government next month intends to begin discussing extending sovereignty to its settlements in occupied land that Palestinians claim for an envisaged independent state.
The plan has been criticised by Arab and European powers as likely to finish off long-moribund efforts to make peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Israel says annexation would be in keeping with a unilateral plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January.
""I repeated here today the German position as well as our serious concerns as a special friend of Israel of the possible consequences of such a step,"" Maas told reporters alongside his Israeli counterpart Gabi Ashkenazi.
Last September, Germany was one of five European nations to say that if the annexation plan was implemented, it would constitute a serious breach of international law. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in February that such a move would not go unchallenged.
Asked on Wednesday about possible sanctions against Israel by the EU, Maas said: ""I did not set any price tags.""
Maas is the first senior foreign official to visit Israel since its new coalition government was sworn-in on May 17.
Israeli-Palestinian talks aimed at agreeing on a two-state solution broke down in 2014 and Palestinian leaders have boycotted the Trump administration over its perceived bias towards Israel.
They say their statehood goal is irreconcilable with Israeli territorial moves which would take chunks of land and leave fragmented, diminished areas for the Palestinians. 
Washington's proposal envisages a Palestinian state in up to 70% of the West Bank, but with overall Israeli security control.
Ashkenazi said Israel would take Germany's perspective into consideration.
His centrist Blue and White party joined Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative Likud in a coalition in May and some of its ministers have expressed misgivings about a unilateral West Bank annexation. 
But Ashkenazi played down any sense of intra-government feuding, saying the discussions had yet to begin in earnest. 
""The (Trump) plan will be pursued responsibly, in full coordination with the United States, while maintaining Israel's peace agreements and strategic interests,"" he said.
Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki on Wednesday called on countries to form an international front to isolate what he called ""the Israeli colonial system"".
Speaking to a virtual meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, he urged countries to boycott Israel, ban its products, and impose economic and political sanctions. 
Israel captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem in the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and most countries view the settlements on occupied land as illegal.

Palestinians now exercise limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank while Palestinian Islamist group Hamas rules the coastal enclave of Gaza.

Wearing face masks and gloves to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, senior government officials, foreign ambassadors and religious leaders lined up to sign a condolence book opened in his memory at the presidential palace.
Nkurunziza's wife, Denise Bucumi, appeared to be absent. Air ambulance service AMREF told Reuters they had flown her to Nairobi on May 21 for medical treatment, but declined to confirm widespread reports in Kenyan media that this was for treatment for COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
Calls seeking comment on Bucumi's health to Willy Nyamitwe, Nkurunziza's close ally and adviser, went unanswered.
There was little public show of mourning on the streets. 
""He leaves behind a country whose economy is in a very bad shape,"" said a hospital employee who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals. 
Burundi's economy is mired in poverty and cut off by international donors after the United Nations documented the widespread rape, torture and murder of political opponents by ruling party activists and state security forces.
It remains unclear whether the powerful cabal of army generals and security chiefs who propped up Nkurunziza during his 15-year rule remain united over the succession. 
Nkurunziza had been due to stand down in August, making way for retired general Evariste Ndayishimiye, who won an election last month that the opposition said was marred by violence and rigging. The constitutional court last week rejected the rigging charges.
Pascal Nyabenda, a civilian who heads the national assembly, is now meant to take over until Ndayishimiye, his former rival, starts his seven-year term at the end of August.
Authorities have not commented on the succession or Nkurunziza's burial date.

Burundi expelled the representative of the World Health Organization (WHO) last month amid criticism of the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. It has carried out very few tests and held large rallies during the election period.

Poroshenko, who became a lawmaker after losing the presidential election last year, said the case related to the appointment of a deputy head of the foreign intelligence service and described the accusation as politically motivated.
The bureau said the former president was suspected of ""issuing a clearly criminal order"" when ""he persuaded an official ... to exceed his authority and official powers"", without giving further details about the incident.
""The issue of determining a pre-trial detention for the suspect is currently being resolved,"" the bureau said in its statement.
Ukrainian law enforcement bodies are investigating more than 10 different cases in which they suspect Poroshenko is involved.
The former president denies all the accusations, saying they are part of a political campaign against him.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a comic actor and political newcomer who beat Poroshenko in the 2019 race, promised during last year's election campaign to pursue criminal investigations against top officials in the previous administration.
""What is happening now has nothing to do with the rule of law, democracy or crime investigation. These are double standards, prosecution of the opposition and accusations against the leader of the opposition,"" Poroshenko wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
He said he had the right to make leadership appointments to the foreign intelligence service.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venedyktova said the authorities were ""acting under the criminal code"" in making the accusations.
The bureau said last month it was investigating the shipment to Ukraine of 43 paintings by famous artists and which were in Poroshenko's collection.

Poroshenko, who has been repeatedly summoned for questioning as a witness, said the paintings were imported by him legally and that he had personally paid all taxes and customs duties.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Hairdresser Beauty Matunhira arrives at her client's home in Johannesburg armed with dye, relaxer and gel, ready to tackle her next case of lockdown hair. 
Discreet house calls have become routine for Matunhira, who found herself out of a job when salons and barber shops were forced to close under South Africa's coronavirus lockdown, now in its 11th week. 
At times she is even forced to sneak into apartment buildings to avoid detection by security guards, but it's either that or going hungry.
""It's better because we're managing to buy food,"" Matunhira said as she applied black dye to her client's faded blond hair. 
Unable to pay her rent or send money to her parents back home in Zimbabwe, she is also worried about the future. Before lockdown she was saving up for her son's university tuition.
""I don't know if I'll manage to budget for him to go to university next year.""
Matunhira is risking jail time by visiting clients at home, as hairdressers are still banned from working under the lockdown rules, even as the government has begun to relax restrictions to allow for a partial re-opening of the economy.
The lockdown restrictions are being challenged in court by barbers and beauty specialists who depend on an industry that consumer data firm Statista says is worth $3.84 billion in sales.
Mariska du Plessis, Northern Gauteng divisional manager at the Employers Organisation for Hairdressing, Cosmetology and Beauty (EOHCB), said an industry survey in April showed that around 70% of businesses were contemplating closures and job cuts, and up to 21% had already closed.
Last week the government told EOHCB it was drafting guidelines for the re-opening of the personal care sector but did not provide a time frame.
In the Johannesburg central business district, some hairdressers are operating on the roadside, offering to do clients' box braids and dreadlocks.
They declined to be interviewed. 
Other businesses are trying to survive through online retail, but this is proving tough.
Standing in her empty hair and beauty salon at Johannesburg's Northgate shopping mall, Cola Mthembu said online retail sales only account for about 20-30% of her overall turnover, which is not enough to cover monthly expenses.
""(The lockdown) has been really detrimental for our business,"" she said.

Hundreds of soldiers have been ranged against each other in the remote snow desert of Ladakh since April in the most serious border flare-ups for years after Chinese patrols advanced into what India deems its side of the de facto border, Indian officials say. China claims the territory to be its own and has objected to the Indian construction of roads in the area.
The two sides made headway in their talks on Wednesday, officials in Delhi said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation. 
After weeks of tension including an incident in which patrolling soldiers from the two sides came to blows on the banks of Pangong Lake, resulting in injuries, friction has eased somewhat, one of the Indian officials said. 
The two armies have since thinned out some forces in a positive signal but soldiers, tanks and other armoured carriers remained heavily deployed in the high-altitude region, the official said. 
""There has been some kind of disengagement, there will be more talks to resolve this over the next days, it could be weeks even,"" the official said. Another Indian official said the Chinese military had moved back some tents and vehicles from the forward areas but there was still a large presence. 
China's state-run Global Times quoted Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying as saying the two countries were communicating through diplomatic and military channels over issues concerning the border and that a ""positive consensus"" has been reached. It did not elaborate. 
India and China fought a brief border war in 1962 and have not been able to settle their border despite two decades of talks. Both claim thousands of kilometres of territory and patrols along the undemarcated Line of Actual Control - the de-facto border - often run into each other, leading to tensions.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Jakarta's motorcycle taxi drivers have a new weapon in the battle against the coronavirus - a plastic shield they can strap on backpack-style to isolate them from passengers. 
Usually the most efficient way to get around the Indonesian capital's traffic-clogged streets, its thousands of motorcycle taxis have been restricted to transporting goods during the city's COVID-19 lockdown, eating into many drivers' incomes.
With the easing of those curbs, they can now carry people again too, with the added reassurance of the see-through plastic partition to protect against the risk of infection.
""When the driver coughs the droplets won't spread to the back with the wind, (and) when the passenger coughs they (the droplets) will not reach the driver,"" said Gusti Afiandi, 40, receiving a shield for his taxi from his ride-hailing company Grab.
""With this tool I feel safe from the spread of coronavirus, because I use motorcycle taxis every day,"" agreed customer Andre Saputra.
The loosening of Jakarta's lockdown coincides with record daily rises in coronavirus infections nationwide this week. Fatalities from the Indonesian epidemic have reached nearly 2,000, the highest toll in Southeast Asia.

Turkey supports Fayez al Serraj's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), whose forces have in recent weeks repelled a 14-month assault on Tripoli by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
Egypt called for a ceasefire starting on Monday, as part of an initiative which also proposed an elected leadership council for Libya. Russia and the UAE welcomed the plan, while Germany said U.N.-backed talks were key to the peace process.
However, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu dismissed the proposal as an attempt to save Haftar following the losses he suffered on the battlefield.
""The ceasefire effort in Cairo was stillborn. If a ceasefire is to be signed, it should be done at a platform that brings everyone together,"" Cavusoglu told Hurriyet. ""The ceasefire call to save Haftar does not seem sincere or believable to us."" 
Cavusoglu said Turkey will continue talks with all parties for a solution in Libya, but that such a solution would require the agreement of both sides.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed Libya in a call on Monday. Erdogan said the two agreed on ""some issues"" on Libya, and that the GNA would continue fighting to seize the coastal city of Sirte and the Jufra air base further south.

Cavusoglu said Erdogan and Trump had delegated their foreign and defence ministers, intelligence chiefs and security advisers to discuss possible steps in Libya.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Travelling in convoy through the Chinese city of Wuhan last September, Angela Merkel called a halt. As her party crossed a bridge over the Yangtze river, the German Chancellor wanted to hear about a grand gesture by revolutionary leader Mao Zedong.
She posed for a picture on the bridge over the river where, in 1966, Mao joined an annual swim down the river in a symbolic demonstration of his vigour and leadership. It was only a quick photo opportunity, but Merkel and her delegation were visiting what was to become ground zero of a pandemic that has killed more than 400,000 worldwide.
That Wuhan visit helped shape Merkel's response to COVID-19, three people close to the chancellor told Reuters.
To many in the West, Wuhan is a remote place, renowned for an open-air market where the new coronavirus may have crossed into humans. Merkel saw at first hand a major thoroughfare and busy hub of China's industrial power. If the disease was serious enough to force a metropolis of 11 million people to quarantine itself and come to a complete stop, people close to her said, she saw it must be serious.
Merkel - unlike leaders including British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and U.S. President Donald Trump - supported a quick lockdown and widespread testing. These are two elements that have been widely credited by epidemiologists for keeping Germany's reported fatalities lower than many countries, especially outside Asia. Germany has reported almost 9,000 COVID-19 deaths, versus more than 110,000 in the United States and over 40,000 in the United Kingdom, according to a Reuters tally. On a per capita basis, the German toll is one-third that of America and one-sixth that of the UK. 
Her response boosted her image: Around 66% of Americans think Germany has done a good job of tackling the virus, according to a survey from late April and early May by the Pew Research Center. At home, support for her conservative bloc has risen from 26% in early March to 40% now, surveys by pollster Forsa show. The ecologist Greens have been the main casualty. The nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) has also slipped back, to 8%. 
Merkel declined to comment for this story. But accounts from business leaders, regional heads and those close to the chancellor give a rare inside view of how she handled the pandemic. It's a story that shows how, in Germany as in the United States and elsewhere, COVID-19 is exposing deep tensions between states' nationalist and collaborative styles of leadership. 
Trump, after initially praising China's reactions, changed tack as the pandemic progressed and said he would cut ties with the World Health Organization (WHO), which he said was unduly pressured by Beijing. 
Germany also briefly turned inwards, banning exports of medical supplies, but then reversed that. Merkel, while agreeing the WHO needs to be reformed, spoke out to defend international alliances which are working to develop a vaccine.
""The difference between these approaches is stark,"" said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, Vice President at the German Marshall Fund of the United States, which promotes U.S.-European ties.
""It represents the difference between nationalism and internationalism.""
Asked for comment, a senior U.S. administration official said the WHO cannot credibly carry out its mission until it reforms. ""The United States remains committed to working with our strong ally Germany across the range (of) important global and bilateral issues of mutual concern, including coordination on anti-pandemic efforts,"" the official said.
CHINESE LINKS
As a scientist with a doctorate in quantum chemistry, Merkel was already concerned about pandemic risk: In 2014, she and her chief-of-staff, Helge Braun, were closely involved in trying to help West Africa contain an outbreak of Ebola, those close to her said. They worked then with the United States, Norway and others to strengthen the WHO to handle such a crisis. 
When the virus hit Europe, its early outbreaks were in Italy and France. ""The virus did not come unnoticed to Germany,"" said Braun. ""We could prepare ourselves.""
To fight the virus at home, though, Merkel had to calibrate her actions with the interests and views of the leaders of 16 regions. This is because under Germany's federal system, almost all responsibility - and power - in a health crisis is held at state or municipal level. 
Everyone was concerned about the economy. China is Germany's biggest trading partner, and goods worth 206 billion euros ($230 billion) were traded between the two countries in 2019, German Statistics Office figures show. 
Merkel's recent state visit to Wuhan helped those who were with her - two dozen CEOs of small and large companies - understand the potential consequences of the disease, said Joe Kaeser, CEO of manufacturing group Siemens AG (OTC:SIEGY), who was among them.
He said that as early as Jan. 12, on the top floor of the Axel Springer high-rise in Berlin, the subject came up in talks on the sidelines of a meeting among business leaders and politicians. ""We were mentally prepared because we deal with China more intensively than, say, the U.S. or many of our European partners,"" he told Reuters.
On Jan. 22, a day before Wuhan shut down completely, Merkel had a phone call with China's President Xi Jinping to discuss Germany's coming presidency of the European Union and trade issues.
Days later, its first known cases of COVID-19 arose in a Bavaria-based company that Merkel had visited in Wuhan. 
On Jan. 27, German car parts maker Webasto Group, whose Wuhan office Merkel had opened, went into full containment mode after a visiting Chinese colleague tested positive. She inquired about how many people in Webasto were infected and how, the people close to her said.
In February, Merkel met privately with China's foreign minister in Berlin. He informed her of the measures China had taken, sources close to her said. Germany sent protective gear and clothing and disinfectant to China.
Berlin kept up this dialogue. Meanwhile, as America's outbreak intensified and the White House came under fire over its response, Trump ramped up criticism of Beijing, calling the disease ""the China virus"" and threatening new tariffs. 
Asked to comment, China's foreign ministry said it and Germany had worked together and helped each other in the fight against the coronavirus, adding that the WHO as an international institution cannot serve only one country. ""At present, the suppression or even blackmail of the WHO by some countries lacks the minimum humanitarian spirit and will not be accepted by the international community,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.
""QUIET AS MICE""
In early March, an explosion in COVID-19 cases strained Italy's health service and prompted a nationwide lockdown. German infections were growing more slowly and there was no consensus for dramatic action. The German media criticised Merkel as slow to speak out about the virus while her health minister and chief-of-staff took the lead. Regional leaders were at odds over how seriously to respond, those involved told Reuters. Eastern states wanted stricter measures than the others. 
Then on March 11, the WHO declared the disease a pandemic. 
The next day, Merkel called the heads of Germany's regions to a meeting in the international conference room on the first floor of the chancellery. She also invited Germany's top virus experts, asking them to present their views first, people who were at the meeting said.
Three scientists warned that even Germany's well-supplied hospitals could be overburdened as early as June if the pace of new infections continued.
""When the three gave their lectures, the others in the room were quiet as mice,"" recalled one participant.
After the presentation, all 16 state leaders agreed that only restrictions to public life could contain the virus. Merkel and the leaders announced steps including bans on travelling in coaches, religious meetings, visiting playgrounds and tourism.
Those close to Merkel said she had waited to step in publicly until the problem justified a nationwide response. 
On March 18, she hit hard. For the first time in 15 years in office, she made a TV address other than her traditional New Year's Eve speech. Some 25 million viewers tuned in to hear her defend the measures.
""Since German reunification, actually, since World War Two, there has never been a challenge for our country in which acting in solidarity was so very crucial,"" she told them.
Merkel, who said in October 2018 she would not seek re-election as chairwoman of her Christian Democrats party, saw her approval ratings shoot above 80%. Mass-selling daily Bild asked on April 3 whether she could run for a fifth term - speculation she has since repeatedly dismissed.
""In the past three months I have learned a lot from Merkel about how to act in crises,"" said one state premier who is not generally a fan of the chancellor.
""SHOT IN THE FOOT""
Nevertheless, as countries worldwide realised the risks of infection, many – including Germany – joined a self-interested scramble for protective gear. 
On March 4, Germany's economic and health ministries were among those banning the export of protective equipment such as masks, gloves, and suits, to try to stem panic and take control of supplies. When Italy first asked for urgent medical supplies, no EU country would help. 
This ran counter to the internationalist principles Merkel had stressed. Politicians across Europe started calling on each other to be less selfish - France's President Emmanuel Macron said the European Union risked collapse as a political project. 
As these protests mounted, the European Commission, the EU's governing body, stepped in, pressing countries to lift bans and trying to organise supplies for smaller member states. Germany and France dropped their export bans, and the direction of discussion shifted back from inward-looking debates. Several German regions opened their intensive care beds to Italian and French patients.
With the export ban, Merkel later told parliament, ""We shot ourselves in the foot"" by erecting barriers to supplies between EU partners. 
Since then, her focus has been firmly on beefing up alliances - up to a point. In April, her government told a German member of parliament it had not complied with requests by Chinese diplomats for Germany to make ""positive public statements"" on China's coronavirus management. 
In May, in a departure from decades of frugality, Merkel agreed with Macron on a plan to create an additional 500 billion euros of spending power, via EU-level borrowing, as economic relief for countries most hit by the crisis.
She also set out Germany's support for global cooperation through the WHO, the international health body that Trump dumped. 
On May 4, she co-hosted with the WHO and the EU a conference pledging funds to develop a vaccine to be available to the world. Germany said it would contribute 525 million euros to a global fund to search for vaccines and a treatment. 
""The WHO is the legitimate international organisation (to combine all these efforts),"" she told a May 18 teleconference of its governing body, the World Health Assembly, in a direct contradiction of the U.S. position. 

""This crisis can't be solved by one country alone,"" she said. ""We have to act together.""

As the coronavirus crisis in many European countries eases somewhat, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Germany does not yet have systems with the rest of the world to assess and coordinate travel without entailing potentially incalculable risks. 
""We cannot and will not risk Germans being stranded all over the world again this summer or holidaymakers returning to Germany with the virus undetected,"" said Maas in a statement.
Aware that many holidaymakers want to travel to destinations including Turkey, the United States, northern African and south-eastern Asia, Maas said the government would keep looking at the travel warning before September.
Germany had already announced it would lift a blanket travel ban for EU members, Britain, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland from June 15, opening the way to separate travel advice for individual regions.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said on Wednesday Germany was going further and would lift border controls with its by June 15, while cautioning it would reconsider if the virus situation worsens.

Seehofer also said existing rules for non-EU citizens wanting to come to Germany would be extended until the end of June.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A Swedish prosecutor closed the case of the 1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme on Wednesday, accusing an insurance company graphic designer who died 20 years ago of the country's most notorious unsolved crime.
Palme, who led Sweden's Social Democrats for decades and served two periods as prime minister, was one of the architects of Scandinavia's model of a strong welfare state, and a fierce Cold War-era critic of both the United States and Soviet Union.
He was shot dead in central Stockholm in 1986 after a visit to the cinema with his wife and son. The failure of the police to find a killer has sparked decades of conspiracy theories, unlikely to be silenced by Wednesday's accusation against a long dead suspect with no political profile.
Prosecutor Krister Petersson, who has led an investigation into the case since 2017, said the killer was Stig Engstrom, a suspect long known to Swedes as ""Skandia man"" after the company where he worked, with offices near the scene of the shooting.
Engstrom, known to have been at the scene, was repeatedly questioned in early investigations but dismissed as a serious suspect at the time. He died in 2000 in what Swedish media reported as a suspected suicide.
A 2018 book by an investigative journalist brought to light a range of previously overlooked evidence, including time stamps showing Engstrom had left his office earlier than he had told police, in time to commit the crime.
""Because the person is dead, I cannot bring charges against him and have decided to close the investigation,"" Petersson said.
He did not announce any major investigative breakthroughs, and said the technical evidence was not new. He felt confident the evidence would have been sufficient to arrest Engstrom, but ""would not, in itself, lead to a conviction"" without more evidence that it was no longer possible to obtain.
Palme's son, Marten, told public service radio he also believed Engstrom was the killer, ""but unfortunately there is no real conclusive evidence"".
COLD-WAR CRITIC
Palme was prime minister from 1969-1976 and again from 1982-1986. Supporters hail him as the architect of modern Sweden, while conservatives denounced his anti-colonialist views and criticism of the United States.
For decades, conspiracy theories around his killing have blamed a range of forces, from the CIA and Kurdish separatists to the South African security services.
Petersson said several witness accounts of the likely killer were in line with Engstrom's appearance, while witnesses also contradicted Engstrom's account of his movements at the scene. 
Engstrom's family have repeatedly dismissed accusations that he was the killer. Daily Expressen quoted his ex-wife as saying in an interview in February that he was too timid to have carried out the murder. A childhood friend, Olle Madebrink, told the paper Engstrom was ""the most normal person in the world. I can't believe anything else.""

Reuters was unable to immediately reach members of Engstrom's family.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - British doctor Jihan Mohamud travelled to Somalia for the first time last year to bury her father in the land of his birth. 
Finding solace from her grief, she stayed on, and she is now on the frontlines of the fight against COVID-19 in the city he loved.
""During the times of health crisis, there are only two things people look up to in the hope of life: God and doctors,"" said the 25-year-old from Coulsdon, south of London. ""It's a blessing to be able to help someone in pain.""
She spends her 16-hour work days analysing data in a government call center in Mogadishu, a lifeline for people seeking advice and treatment for coronavirus in a country whose healthcare system has been ravaged by violence and poverty.
""If it were not for this call center... people would go to every hospital and spread the virus,"" she said. 
The center gets between 6,000-7,000 calls per day, she said, data the health ministry uses to track COVID-19 outbreaks, allocate scarce resources and respond to emergencies. 
Somalia has documented 2,416 confirmed coronavirus cases and 85 deaths. Fighting between government forces and Islamist al Shabaab insurgents means testing has been sporadic at best, suggesting the true figures are far higher.
Mohamud is aware of the risks.
Last month, masked gunmen killed seven healthcare workers in a town near the capital.
In December, she was working at a private Mogadishu clinic when a truck bomb killed more than 90 people and wounded scores more, and she spent her holidays treating victims with horrific burns and other injuries, many around her own age. 
After a meeting with a government advisor, she switched to the call center and a job she loves, not least for the chance it offers to inspire young local women who also work there.
""I'm a deputy director,"" she told Reuters, laughing. ""Make sure you put that in. More women should be deputy directors in Somalia.""
But most precious to her is the feeling that she belongs in her father's homeland after the decades he spent abroad. Despite the violence and the pandemic, she has found her refuge. 

""I brought him home to bury him and I didn’t want to leave him behind in a country that I’d never been to,"" she said. ""Now I know ...the places you can go when you want to be alone.""

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has been taking a harder line with the United Nations to extend and strengthen the embargo on Iran, warning that its lifting would let Tehran acquire weapons that could fuel conflicts in the Middle East.
""Americans are already angry, upset, and wanting to take this issue to the Security Council. We want four permanent members of the (U.N. Security) Council to stand up to America,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised speech.
""Particularly, we expect Russia and China to resist this U.S. plot. America will not succeed ... and we will increase our defence capabilities as we have been doing so even under sanctions.""
Tehran and its rival Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally, have been involved in proxy wars and political confrontations in the region for decades, from Iraq and Syria to Bahrain and Yemen.
Council veto-powers Russia and China have already signalled they are against re-imposing an arms embargo on Iran. 
If the U.N. Security Council does not extend the embargo, Washington has threatened to trigger a so-called snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, using a process outlined in the nuclear deal.
However, Russia and China, both parties to the deal, have already started making the case at the United Nations against Washington's claim that it can trigger a return of all sanctions on Iran at the Security Council. 
The United States withdrew from the deal in 2018, arguing it was flawed to Tehran's advantage, and has reimposed sanctions crippling Iran's economy. Under the deal, Iran agreed to halt its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief.

Iran has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord since the United States quit. The nuclear deal allows for a return of sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, if Tehran violates the deal.

Delfin Lorenzana was on Thitu island on Tuesday to launch a beaching ramp for construction of much-needed infrastructure on the Philippines' most strategically important South China Sea island.
The ramp will allow movement of construction materials and heavy equipment to the 37-hectare (91-acre) island, home to a handful of soldiers and a small civilian population https://reut.rs/2SVUy1h that helps to prop up the Philippines' claim to sovereignty. 
Lorenzana said the $26 million of planned upgrades include improvements to Thitu's landing strip but stressed the island would not become a military installation.
""The purpose of this is to develop this area into a viable community,"" said Lorenzana, adding that he was confident that Beijing would not view Tuesday's visit as a provocation.
""We will not militarize this. I call it militarization if we bring in other weapons that are heavy, like canons or missiles, everything. We will not do that here.""
China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Thitu, known as Pagasa in the Philippines and located 451 km (280 miles) from the mainland, is the biggest of the eight reefs, shoals and islands it occupies in the Spratly archipelago.
The Philippines is playing catch-up with China and Vietnam, which have been busy developing islands they occupy or have built from scratch on submerged reefs.
China has six artificial islands, some equipped with radar, runways and surface-to-air missiles. Those include Subi Reef just 24 km (15 miles) away and visible from Thitu.

During Lorenzana's last visit in 2017, Chinese authorities warned his plane to leave, but on Tuesday he said there was ""no word from them anymore"", adding that China knew Manila's intentions were peaceful.

Reconciliation Australia, the lead body for promoting better ties between the wider Australian community and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, announced the move after Rio Tinto destroyed the two Aboriginal caves in late May.
""The blasting activity in Juukan Gorge by Rio Tinto exposes a broken relationship with the Puutu Kunti Kurama and Pinikura (PKKP) Peoples and a breathtaking breach of a respectful relationship,"" Reconciliation Australia said on Tuesday.
Rio Tinto was expanding its Brockman mine in the Pilbara region, where one of the caves showed evidence of continual habitation dating back 46,000 years. 
The mining company, which is a major employer of indigenous Australians and prides itself as being a top supporter of them, said in a statement that it would continue dialogue with the NGO as it focused on rebuilding trust with the PKKP people.
Rio won state government approval to disturb the sites in 2013 under laws that cannot be appealed by traditional owners. The PKKP say Rio, whose head of iron ore Chris Salisbury later offered his apologies, knew the cultural and historic significance of the site before it was blasted.
The NGO said that it had met with Rio Tinto executives to convey its ""extreme concern"" and that a review of the suspension will depend on how it engages with the Traditional Owner groups.
It is also dependent on Rio Tinto releasing a full and public review into the matter, sustained action in light of the review, and ""meaningful accountability."" 

""Our heritage processes will be comprehensively reviewed, with board and indigenous leader oversight, to help identify, understand and recommend ways to improve,"" Rio Tinto said.

(Reuters) - Asylum applications in Europe fell to the lowest level in April for over a decade as borders closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, European Union figures show, compounding the challenges of people fleeing conflict and persecution.
The number of asylum applications declined to 8,730 during April, an 86% drop from 61,421 in February, according to figures obtained by Reuters from the European Asylum Support Office (EASO). The EU had shut its external borders in March and many of its 27 member states suspended registration of applications. 
The EASO figures also show a 44% drop in asylum applications from February to March, when states began imposing lockdowns. 
""It is clear the access that potential asylum applicants had was severely restricted over the past few months, especially initially,"" EASO executive director Nina Gregori told Reuters. ""The situation for those in need of asylum has undoubtedly been very challenging. Already fleeing violence and persecution, the COVID-19 crisis has certainly compounded their situations.""
Most applications during 2020 through April were by Syrians followed by Afghans, Venezuelans and Colombians, EASO data show. 
It had already become more difficult for asylum seekers to reach Europe in recent years. The bloc has blocked off previous overland migrant routes and provided aid to Libya and Turkey to inhibit crossings by sea into the EU.
In April, Italy said it would not let migrant boats operated by charities dock as its ports could not be considered safe because of the coronavirus pandemic. Malta also said it could no longer guarantee the rescue of migrants or allow their disembarkation during the coronavirus emergency.
Those who made it to Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic but were unable to apply for asylum are now more at risk, said Petra Baeyens, senior legal officer at the European Council on Refugees and Exiles (ECRE), a network of more than 100 non-governmental organisations across 40 European countries. 
""They have limited access to health care, and are considered to be irregularly on the territory as long as they have not made their asylum application,” Baeyens told Reuters.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 10, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",North Korean leader's sister emerges as policymaker in spat with South Korea,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is taking a leading role in a new, more hard-line pressure campaign against South Korea, highlighting what analysts say is a substantive policy role that goes beyond being her brother's assistant.
Believed to be in her early 30s, Kim Yo Jong is the only close relative of the North Korean leader to play a public role in politics. 
During the 2018-2019 flurry of international diplomacy, Kim Yo Jong garnered global attention by leading a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Later, she was often seen dashing about to make sure everything went well for her older brother, including holding an ashtray for him at a train station on his way to a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam.
But this year, Kim has taken on a more public policy role, cementing her status as an influential political player in her own right.
""Prior to this, Kim Yo Jong was portrayed in state media as Kim Jong Un's sister, his protocol officer, or one of his accompanying officials,"" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea open source intelligence analyst in the U.S. government. ""Now, North Koreans know for sure there is more to her than that.""
Kim has worked behind the scenes in North Korea's propaganda agencies, a role that led the United States to add her to a list of sanctioned senior officials in 2017 because of human rights abuses and censorship.
In March, state media carried the first ever statement by Kim, in which she criticised South Korean authorities. That was followed by several more, including a response to comments by Trump, and last week, a warning that the North would cut communications with South Korea.
Lee said Kim's statements have a unique style, showcasing her wit and underscoring her powerful position.
""In addition to the harsh words and sarcasm, they can be bitingly witty in ways that the other statements are not,"" Lee said. ""She seems to have more leeway in crafting her statements, which of course is not surprising.""
When state media announced on Tuesday that the hotlines between North and South Korea would be severed, they said Kim Yo Jong and a longtime hard-liner, Kim Yong Chol, championed the decision at a meeting.
This rare explanation of a policymaking process portrayed Kim Yo Jong as ""a very substantive person,"" said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre, a U.S.-based think tank. 
Madden said this new portrayal of Kim in state media may be a subtle dig at international analysts who have cast doubts on her ability to wield influence in the North's male-dominated society.

""They clearly have high hopes and expectations for her,"" he said. ""Not necessarily the next leader, but something of a king maker nonetheless.""

The protests, called to mark a year of sometimes violent pro-democracy rallies in the former British colony, also came amid heightened tensions due to a proposed national security bill backed by the central government in Beijing.
Police said on Wednesday that 36 males and 17 females were arrested for offences including unlawful assembly and participating in unauthorised assembly. Protesters had defied a ban on gatherings of more than eight people introduced by the Hong Kong government to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
More protests are planned in coming days, with pro-democracy supporters fearing the proposed national security legislation will dramatically stifle freedoms in the city.
While details of the security law or how it will operate have yet to be revealed, authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have said there is no cause for concern and the legislation will target a minority of ""troublemakers."" 
The standing committee of the National People's Congress, the top decision making body of the Chinese parliament, will meet in Beijing later this month to deliberate on various draft legislation, official Chinese media reported on Wednesday. The reports did not specify whether any laws regarding Hong Kong were on the agenda for the June 18-20 meeting.
Hong Kong Security Secretary John Lee told the South China Morning Post in an interview published on Wednesday that local police were setting up a dedicated unit to enforce the law and it would have intelligence gathering, investigation and training capabilities. 
Companies including HSBC (L:HSBA) and  Standard Chartered  (L:STAN) have backed the security law without knowing the details of it, drawing criticism from some investors and U.S. and British officials.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo singled out HSBC on Tuesday, saying such ""corporate kowtows"" got little in return from Beijing and criticising the Chinese Communist Party's ""coercive bullying tactics."" 
Hong Kong's year of pro-democracy protests was sparked by a government bill that would have allowed people to be extradited to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, for trial. 

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam withdrew that bill as the protests gathered pace but activists remained concerned that China is reneging on an agreement signed with Britain ahead of the 1997 handover to allow Hong Kong to retain a high level of autonomy for 50 years from that date.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Labor rights advocates in Mexico called on Tuesday for the release of activist Susana Prieto after her arrest on a charge of threatening public officials, raising questions about worker protections ahead of a new North American trade deal.
Prieto, a labor lawyer, organized strikes last year at several dozen manufacturers in the northern border city of Matamoros in Tamaulipas state, urging better wages.
A central aim of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which will take effect on July 1, is to improve labor rights and union independence in Mexico. 
In recent weeks, Prieto, who has criticized traditional union leadership, has led protests at factories that she has accused of not taking proper measures to protect workers from the coronavirus.
The Tamaulipas prosecutor's office said in a statement that the arrest was on charges of inciting riot, threats and coercion against public officials. 
Prieto could not be reached for comment.
In a video she livestreamed of her detention on Monday in Matamoros, Prieto said she was unaware of the charges, before being given a copy of the complaint by law enforcement during the video. The document named a local labor court in Matamoros as one of the ""offended"" parties. 
""I knew that sooner or later, the state governor would do this. I am being arrested,"" she said.
Prieto's supporters protested in Matamoros, the northern industrial hub of Ciudad Juarez, and in the capital, Mexico City, according to news outlets and social media.
""This is a direct affront to all the workers that historically have seen their rights and dignity crushed,"" said a statement signed by dozens of rights groups. 
Labor attorney Cuauhtemoc Estrada said the arrest struck a blow to a sector that has long needed better rights protections.

""It's not acceptable for the authorities to shut down efforts to dignify rights using criminal charges against social leaders, lawyers or workers,"" he said.

Security forces in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger launched fresh offensives this year against militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State, who are threatening to overrun vast swathes of the Sahel region south of the Sahara Desert.
Those offensives have led to repeated accusations by human rights groups that security forces have committed atrocities, including executing displaced civilians - charges the authorities have alternately denied or promised to investigate.
Amnesty researcher Ousmane Diallo said it was not clear if the rights abuses, documented in a new report published on Wednesday, were occurring more frequently than in years past but said they took place amid a flurry of activity by national armies after suffering significant losses in militant attacks. 
""There is a very large desire to achieve military results,"" Diallo said. 
In southwestern Niger, 102 people disappeared after being arrested by the army at a market fair and in villages in late March and early April, the report said. Several mass graves were later discovered in the area, it said. 
Niger's Defence Minister Issoufou Katambé said the military and national human rights commission were investigating the events but that the people who had made the accusations ""could not produce the proof"" when interviewed by investigators.
Government spokespeople in Burkina Faso and Mali did not respond to requests for comment, but Mali's defence minister issued a statement on Tuesday vowing to investigate repeated allegations against the army, including charges that soldiers killed 43 people during attacks on two villages last week. 
Rights groups say investigations promised by governments rarely lead to criminal sanctions.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia and China have started making the case at the United Nations against Washington's claim that it can trigger a return of all sanctions on Iran at the Security Council, with Moscow invoking a 50-year-old international legal opinion to argue against the move.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and the Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, both wrote to the 15-member council and U.N. chief Antonio Guterres as the United States threatens to spark a so-called sanctions snapback under the Iran nuclear deal, even though Washington quit the accord in 2018.
Lavrov wrote in the May 27 letter, made public this week, that the United States was being ""ridiculous and irresponsible.""
""This is absolutely unacceptable and serves only to recall the famous English proverb about having one's cake and eating it,"" Lavrov wrote. 
Washington has threatened to trigger a return of U.N. sanctions on Iran if the Security Council does not extend an arms embargo due to expire in October under Tehran's deal with world powers to prevent it from developing nuclear weapons.
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft said last week that a draft resolution on the embargo would be circulated soon.
Council veto-powers Russia and China have already signaled they are against reimposing an arms embargo on Iran. If they block the U.S.-drafted resolution, then Washington will have to follow through on its sanctions snapback threat. 
""The United States, no longer a participant to the JCPOA (nuclear deal) after walking away from it, has no right to demand the Security Council invoke a snapback,"" Wang wrote in his June 7 letter. 
The 2015 Iran nuclear deal, enshrined in a U.N. resolution, allows for return of sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, if Iran violates the deal. U.S. President Donald Trump quit the deal in 2018, branding the accord from Barack Obama's presidency as ""the worst deal ever.""
Lavrov cited a 1971 International Court of Justice opinion, which found that a fundamental principle governing international relationships was that ""a party which disowns or does not fulfill its own obligations cannot be recognized as retaining the rights which it claims to derive from the relationship."" 
Iran has breached parts of the nuclear deal in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions. 

The United States argues it can still trigger the sanctions snapback because the 2015 U.N. resolution still names it as a participant. Diplomats say Washington would likely face a tough, messy battle.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedes may get an answer on Wednesday to the mystery of who shot Social Democrat Prime Minister Olof Palme when the Swedish prosecutor in charge of the case presents his conclusions to an investigation that has lasted 34 years.
Palme was shot dead in central Stockholm in 1986 after a visit to the cinema with his wife and son. The murder sparked a massive manhunt and a plethora of conspiracy theories involving shadowy forces ranging from the CIA and Kurdish separatists to the South African security services.
While a petty criminal was convicted of Palme's killing, the judgement was later overturned and the police's failure to identify the culprit has left a scar on the psyche of a country that still prides itself on how safe it is to walk its streets.
Palme was prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and between 1982 and 1986. Some hail him as the architect of modern Sweden, but conservatives hated his anti-colonial views and criticism of the United States.
So many years after the killing, few Swedes had expected a resolution of the nation's most high-profile murder case, and prosecutor Krister Petersson's announcement in February that he was close to wrapping it up ignited a storm of debate.
He has been tight-lipped since then, but on Wednesday, Petersson will announce his conclusions at a news conference that has attracted huge media attention, knocking coronavirus updates off many newspaper front pages.
A comment by Petersson that he may not be able to bring a prosecution has been seen as a suggestion that the suspected killer is already dead.
And naming a suspect may not end put an end to the conspiracy theories.
""If we get a clear answer, it will mean that one of the biggest political and judicial mysteries in Sweden has finally been solved,"" Gunnar Wall, a journalist who has written several books about Palme's killing, said.

""If what is put forward now is another uncertain hypothesis ...it will just strengthen the feeling that many people have that the Swedish justice system does not work very well.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean senators on Tuesday reopened a debate over a bill to tighten migration at the behest of the government after a report last week suggested Chile could again become a migration hotspot after the coronavirus pandemic subsides. 
The bill seeks to tighten rules on how prospective immigrants can enter Chile, how they are taxed, the recognition of their qualifications, and how they can be deported if they do not meet the requirements. 
More than one million people have migrated to Chile since 2014, bringing the foreign-born population to a total of 1.5 million, according to government figures.
The comparatively wealthy Latin American nation is a popular destination for migrants from poorer regional countries such as Haiti and Venezuela.
Migration levels fell in mid-2019 after the center-right government of President Sebastian Pinera announced a campaign to register undocumented migrants and said migrants would have to obtain visas in their home countries before entering Chile.
The coronavirus pandemic and lockdown have left thousands of Venezuelans, Bolivians and Peruvians who were already in Chile without work, and many have chosen to return home.
But a report by Chile's Department of Migration predicted that, without the new law, migrant numbers could reach up to 250,000 people a year once the crisis is over, pointing to an International Monetary Fund report that suggested Chile's economy would rebound quicker than most.
""The migration pressure on the country will pick up once the pandemic ends, especially in 2021,"" it said.
Juan Francisco Galli, the Interior Ministry undersecretary, told local El Mercurio newspaper he hoped the legislation would be passed by the end of the year.
Legislating in the current context was ""idiocy,"" Hector Pujols, who heads an immigration advocacy group, said in an interview. 

""They don't have any proof (of a likely increase) and even if they did, you can't formulate laws based on what is happening now. This requires long-term thinking,"" he said.

Some 4.9 tonnes of the drug were seized in two containers at Colombia's most important Pacific port, anti-narcotics police director General Jorge Luis Ramirez said. 
While there were no arrests, the operation represents the largest cocaine seizure in Colombia this year. 
Authorities did not disclose the owner of the seized cocaine. 
Colombia is a leading producer of cocaine, with output of around 951 tonnes a year and cultivations of coca - the drug's main ingredient - covering more than 200,000 hectares (494,211 acres), according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Drug trafficking has long fed the Andean country's internal armed conflict. Leftist rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents from the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas - who demobilized under a 2016 peace deal - and criminal groups all make money from the trade, according to security sources.

OXFORD, England (Reuters) - More than 1,000 protesters converged on a college at Oxford University on Tuesday, chanting ""take it down"" and ""shame on you"" to demand the removal of a statue of 19th century British colonialist Cecil Rhodes.
A wave of anti-racism protests sweeping across the United States and Europe has reignited a debate about monuments glorifying Britain's imperialist past, which many people see as offensive in today's multi-ethnic society.
Dramatic images on Sunday of protesters in the port city of Bristol tearing down a statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston and throwing it into the harbour inspired campaigners in Oxford to seize the moment.
""Rhodes represents such a violent legacy of colonialism, imperialism, slavery, particularly in southern Africa,"" said protester Morategi Kale, a South African graduate student at Oxford. ""The beginning is to take down a statue that celebrates that.""
Many academics and public figures oppose the removal of such monuments, arguing they merely reflect history and should be used as points of discussion.
But demonstrators said the statue of Rhodes should no longer have pride of place on the facade of Oriel College, which overlooks Oxford's High Street.
""I think what he did should be in the museum, but not on an institution of higher education. It's just the wrong place,"" said Butch Smith, a chef, who had brought his young daughter to the protest.
Jeevan Ravindran, a student, said the statue showed the university was failing to engage with issues faced by students from ethnic minority backgrounds.
""For black and brown students to have to walk around this university and see these symbols of slavery and colonisation is frankly quite abhorrent,"" she said.
CONTESTED HERITAGE
A previous student campaign in 2015, modelled on the ""Rhodes Must Fall"" movement in South Africa that led Cape Town University to remove its statue of Rhodes that year, failed to convince Oriel to follow suit.
In a statement ahead of Tuesday's demonstration, the college said it abhorred racism.
""We understand that we are, and we want to be, a part of the public conversation about the relationship between the study of history, public commemoration, social justice and educational equality,"" it said.
""As a college, we continue to debate and discuss the issues raised by the presence on our site of examples of contested heritage relating to Cecil Rhodes.""
A mining magnate, Rhodes was a central figure in Britain's colonial project in southern Africa, giving his name to Rhodesia, present-day Zimbabwe, and founding the De Beers diamond empire.
He made his fortune from the exploitation of African miners, secured power through bloody imperial wars and paved the way to apartheid with his beliefs and measures on racial segregation.
A student at Oriel in his youth, Rhodes left the college money when he died and also endowed the Rhodes Scholarships, which have allowed more than 8,000 students from countries around the world to study at Oxford over the past century.
The demonstration was peaceful, and there was no attempt to remove the statue, which stands in a niche high up on a building whose construction was partly funded by Rhodes.

As Turkish drones helped drive eastern Libyan forces back from Tripoli this month, Russia was said to be reinforcing the forces with warplanes, raising the stakes in a stalemated civil war that has partitioned the African country.
Recent weeks have marked a turning point in a complex conflict between two uneasy coalitions that are each backed by an array of foreign states whose competing regional agendas make them unwilling to countenance defeat.
In a joint statement with the foreign ministers of Germany, France and Italy issued on Tuesday, the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called on the conflict parties in Libya to swiftly agree on a ceasefire and withdraw all foreign forces, mercenaries and military equipment.
The joint statement followed increased diplomatic efforts by Germany to push for a political solution to the Libya crisis.
Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier on Tuesday expressed her concern in a telephone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the recent escalation of fighting in Libya.
On Monday, Merkel discussed the situation in conflict-wracked Libya with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.
Merkel told Sisi that United Nations-backed negotiations must remain the key aim of a peace process in Libya, where the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) is fighting General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army in the east.
On Saturday, Sisi proposed a new ceasefire after the Turkish-backed GNA won a series of rapid victories over Haftar's forces, dashing Haftar's bid to unite the country by force with help from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia.

Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, will spend the day privately at Windsor Castle, west of London, where he and the 94-year-old monarch have been staying during Britain's coronavirus lockdown.
That means the rest of the royal family will have to send their best wishes to him by video calls.
""I haven't seen my father for a long time. He's going to be 99 next week,"" heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and the oldest of his four children told Sky News last week. ""Facetime is all very well ... You really want to give people a hug.""
The royals make little fuss about their birthdays in public but this year celebrations have been even more muted.
Traditionally, the prince's birthday would be celebrated with gun salutes in London but with social gatherings banned, the queen felt it would be inappropriate for such royal ceremonies to go ahead and cancelled such tributes for her own birthday in April for the first time in her 68-year reign.
However, Buckingham Palace did release a new photograph of the royal couple to celebrate Philip's birthday, taken last week at the quadrangle inside Windsor Castle. 
Philip, a former naval officer renowned for his sometimes brusque manner and occasional verbal gaffes, married the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947, five years before she became queen. He is now by far the longest-serving consort of any British monarch.
He stepped down from royal duties in August 2017 after completing more than 22,000 solo engagements but in recent years he has been increasingly rarely seen in public.
He did, however, break his retirement silence in April to issue a statement thanking those involved in the fight against COVID-19.

The 71-year-old defendant, who has not been named and whose trial in Salzburg was held behind closed doors on national security grounds, denied handing over secret information but admitted explaining open-source material ""like a foreign correspondent"", his lawyer said when the trial opened in March.
Prosecutors said that in the course of his at least 25-year career as a spy for Russian GRU military intelligence, with which he first came into contact during a foreign assignment in 1987, he was paid hundreds of thousands of euros.
The court found him guilty of charges including ""betraying state secrets"", working for or helping ""a foreign intelligence organisation to the detriment of Austria"" and ""premeditated divulgation of a military secret"", the court said in a statement late on Tuesday.
Those charges carry a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison but he was sentenced to just three and released for having served half that in pre-trial detention.
""The court took into account the recognition of the facts, the (defendant's) advanced years and the absence of previous convictions as mitigating factors. The court came to the conclusion that the defendant no longer poses a threat,"" a court spokesman said.
The case is embarrassing for neutral Austria, which conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has positioned as one of Russia's closest allies in the European Union, aiming to act as a bridge between east and west.
Austria was in the minority of EU states not to expel any Russian diplomats over the poisoning in Britain of Russian former spy-turned-British-mole Sergei Skripal and his daughter, which London blames on Moscow. Russia denies the accusation.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada and the United States are set to extend a ban on non-essential travel to late July as both countries seek to control the spread of the coronavirus, according to three sources familiar with the matter.
Washington and Ottawa introduced month-long restrictions in March and renewed them in April and May. The ban, currently due to expire on June 21, does not affect trade.
Canadian and U.S. sources said although the governments had not yet taken a final decision, a further extension was highly likely.
""It's going to be a clean rollover"" on June 21, said a U.S. source who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation. ""We will want to look at it again in July.""
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security was not immediately available for comment.
Data show that while the outbreak is slowing across the 10 Canadian provinces, new cases show little sign of abating in Toronto and Montreal, the country's two largest cities.
A majority of provinces have privately told Ottawa they are reluctant to resume non-essential travel, said a second source. 
Several provinces have clamped down on travel within Canada, and a third Canadian source said these inter-provincial restrictions would make it hard to lift the ban on non-essential travel with the United States.
More than 110,000 people have died of the coronavirus in the United States, one of the world's worst-hit nations. Canada reported 7,835 deaths, and 96,244 coronavirus cases on June 9.
A spokeswoman for Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland, who has overall responsibility for ties with the United States, said both sides agreed the ban had worked well.
Extending the measures would hurt Canadian airlines and the tourism industry. 
Carriers, including Air Canada, have been among the worst hit as travel bans resulted in thousands of flight cancellations, forcing carriers to cut jobs and costs.
""There is a push from some sectors for reopening (the border), like Air Canada,"" a Canadian government source said.

Asked about reopening the border, Air Canada said in a statement that governments around the world are relaxing restrictions and said it was working with tourism and industry groups to ""streamline and clarify rules around travel"".

HOUSTON (Reuters) - George Floyd, the African-American man whose death in police custody roused worldwide protests against racism, was extolled on Tuesday as a ""gentle giant"" and a symbol of the oppressed's struggle for justice at a funeral in his hometown of Houston.
Family members and friends, most dressed all in white, stepped up to a microphone to describe Floyd as a loving, larger than life personality who deserved justice after his death while in the custody of Minneapolis police officers on May 25.
A 46-year-old African American who grew up in Houston, Floyd died after a white police officer pinned him with a knee to the neck for 8 minutes 46 seconds. The policeman, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been charged with second-degree murder and three others with aiding and abetting. 
Floyd's death was captured in excruciating detail on a bystander's video, with his words ""I can't breathe"" shocking the world and triggering a wave of demonstrations against racism and police brutality against minorities.
Floyd's niece Brooke Williams (NYSE:WMB) said in a eulogy that drew applause inside the Fountain of Praise Church, “I can breathe. And as long as I’m breathing, justice will be served.”
Advised to guard against the coronavirus pandemic by wearing masks over their mouths and noses, some mourners and onlookers wore ones that also said, ""I can't breathe.""
""This was not just a tragedy - it was a crime,"" the Reverend Al Sharpton, a prominent civil rights leader, said in the main eulogy, referring to Floyd's death. 
""Until these people pay for what they did we will be there with them because lives like George Floyd will not matter until somebody pays the cost for taking their lives.""
About 500 people were invited to the funeral, which followed memorial services last week in Minneapolis and Raeford, the North Carolina town where Floyd was born.
""This is a home-going celebration,"" Reverend Mia Wright, co-pastor at the church, told mourners. Banners featured pop art illustrations of Floyd wearing a baseball cap with a halo above it. 
'BIG FLOYD'
The ceremony was much more than a simple funeral for a deceased loved one. The church was filled with the sounds of soulful gospel song, and video was played of shared memories about the life of the 6 foot 6 inch man known as ""Big Floyd.""
Underscoring the impact his death had on the world, the funeral was broadcast live on every major U.S. broadcast and cable news channel and the New York Stock Exchange observed 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence that was broadcast in silence on business news channel CNBC.
“I would like to thank the whole world for what it has done for my family today, especially George,” Floyd’s aunt, Kathleen McGee said at the funeral. “I have gained such a huge family all over the world.”
Sobbing in grief, Floyd's brother Philonise said, ""George was my personal superman.""
American flags lined the streets outside the church. Flowers and bouquets were placed around a photograph of Floyd.
Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner thanked the Floyd family “for seeking justice for George while at the same time asking people all around the world to do it respectfully and peacefully.”
Former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate in the Nov. 3 election, spoke via a video recording.
""Why in this nation do too many black Americans wake up knowing that they could lose their life in the course of just living their life?” Biden said. “We must not turn away. We cannot leave this moment thinking we can once again turn away from racism.” 
Outside the church in hot, humid, 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) temperature, two voter registration tables were set up.
MOURNING FAMILIES
Family members of other black men who died in confrontations with white men attended. 
The mother of Eric Garner, the New York man who died in a police chokehold, was at the church as was the family of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Georgia man who was shot and killed in February while jogging. Three white men were charged.
Floyd's death ignited a wave of protests across the United States and cities in other countries against racism and the systematic mistreatment of black people, reinvigorating the Black Lives Matter movement.
The case also thrust the administration of President Donald Trump into a political crisis. A Republican, Trump repeatedly threatened to order the military on to the streets to quell protests, which have mostly been peaceful. 

Trump has resisted calls by activists and some politicians to slash police budgets and redirect the money, saying 99% of police were ""great, great people"". Biden has said he does not support moves to ""defund the police.""

The May 25 death of the unarmed, handcuffed African-American in Minneapolis, after a police officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes, has sparked anti-racism protests in other parts of Switzerland, including Lausanne, Basel and the capital Bern - as well as around the world over the past two weeks.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Venezuelan migrants are camping in an array of tents along a major Bogota highway as they wait to make their way back home, even as tightening border restrictions strand returnees fleeing Colombia's ongoing coronavirus lockdown.
Colombia's migration agency says Venezuela has curbed daily entries by 80%, slowing the journeys of tens of thousands of migrants.
Migrants are heading home because quarantine measures have largely destroyed their means of making a living. More than 71,000 have so far returned.
Although their own country faces social and economic upheaval, returning Venezuelans said their lives will be better back home.
""Although the situation is worse there, we will have somewhere to live. We won't sleep like this,"" said Hilda Herrera, 63, gesturing to the tent where her family of five sleeps.

The 27-nation EU and Britain have reported some 1.4 million cases of the new coronavirus, or about a fifth of the global total. At the height of the crisis, many EU states resorted to protectionist measures, raising trade barriers to hinder the export of medical equipment to their neighbours.
In a joint paper sent to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen on Tuesday, the leaders of Denmark, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium and Poland backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment.
""A broader, holistic EU strategy could be more efficient than each member state attempting to enhance preparedness on their own,"" they said in the paper.
The proposals included maintaining a three-month stock of critical medicines, supplies and equipment across the EU as well as collaboration between states and companies to produce key products in times of crisis.
Reuters earlier reported that EU member states drastically underestimated their capacity to respond to the coronavirus and had told Brussels in February there was no need to order more medical supplies. 
The paper emphasised the need for greater European research and development capacity for vaccines, through funding large-scale clinical trials and a ""preparedness platform"" that would reduce the risk for companies to develop vaccines by guaranteeing public purchases.

Research results could be shared on a European COVID-19 data platform, said the paper, which also called for joint monitoring and analysis of different testing strategies.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean Women's Minister Macarena Santelices has resigned from her post, just a month after being sworn into office and amid growing questions about her aptitude and performance.
Santelices, a former mayor with no track record of involvement in gender issues, is the great niece of former dictator Augusto Pinochet and a member of the right-wing Independent Democratic Union (UDI) party. 
She took office amid significant opposition from Chilean women's groups in early May and since then feminist organizations, political groups and ordinary citizens have criticized her commitment and cited old interviews in which she appeared to defend Pinochet's rule.
Her resignation is a blow for center-right President Sebastian Pinera, who saw his popularity plummet to the lowest ever for a Chilean president since the Pinochet era amid protests that have wracked the country for months since October last year. 
""The day it is understood that the cause of women has no political color, it belongs to all and for all, is the day we will move forward,"" Santelices wrote on her Twitter account on Tuesday.
Santelices was forced to pull a controversial social media advertisement last month which featured an old man telling his granddaughter he regretted abusing her grandmother after she revealed to him her boyfriend had beaten her.
Women's groups said it victimized abusers. Santelices said she ""profoundly regretted"" its airing.
Her resignation comes as Chile grapples with a surge of calls to emergency services over domestic violence during the quarantine imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus.

The government has named Monica Zalaquett, the tourism subsecretary who advised Pinera on women's issues for his 2017 election campaign, and also of the UDI party, to replace Santelices.

The Sangay volcano has had moderate eruptions for over a year that have had little impact because of its remote location, but a recent change in wind patterns has pushed ash toward the coast and affected areas including the largest city, Guayaquil.
""The ash comes out of the Sangay volcano and spreads into the Guayas province, and we see a quantity of ash that is arriving near Guayaquil,"" Benjamin Bernard of the Geophysical Institute of Ecuador told reporters, referring to the province where Guayaquil is located.
The institute said it expects minor volcanic eruptions to continue in the coming days but does not expect a major eruption.
The Guayaquil airport halted flights to clean the runway, and authorities began clearing ash from public spaces to avert potential respiratory problems. Roads were closed to traffic in some parts of the provinces of Los Rios and Chimborazo.
""Now we have to wear the mask not only because of the coronavirus but also because of the ash that covers all of Guayaquil,"" said homemaker Karen Figueroa, 30, who was removing ash from the patio of her Guayaquil home.
Guayaquil in March and April suffered one of the region's worst coronavirus outbreaks, which overwhelmed the health system and forced authorities to collect corpses in homes. 

The health ministry this month said the spread of the disease had slowed significantly and that deaths have dropped below 10 per day from a peak of 194 per day.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court struck down a law on Tuesday that had retroactively legalised about 4,000 settler homes built on privately owned Palestinian land in the occupied West Bank. 
A nine-judge panel voted to repeal the 2017 measure, under which settlers could remain on land if they built there without prior knowledge of Palestinian ownership, or if homes were built at the state's direction. Eight voted in favour and one against.
Rights groups say the measure, which was frozen soon after passage while the court heard petitions against it, had legalised more than 50 settler outposts built without government approval. 
The law ""unequally infringes on the property rights of Palestinian residents while giving preference to the proprietary interests of Israeli settlers,"" Chief Justice Esther Hayut wrote in the panel's ruling. 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party said it was ""unfortunate"" that the court had intervened on ""an important law for settlement activity and its future"" and that it would work to re-enact it. 
But Likud's new coalition partner, Blue and White, said the law ""in its format runs counter to the constitutional situation in Israel, and its legal problems were known at the time of its approval"".
""We respect the High Court's ruling and (will) ensure it is implemented,"" Blue and White said.
Under Netanyahu, the government has pledged to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek for a state.
The government is due to begin discussing the de facto annexation on July 1, but it is unclear whether Israel's main ally, the United States, will give the step the green light.
The Palestinians have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's peace blueprint, under which most of Israel's settlements would be incorporated into ""contiguous Israeli territory"".

Holding placards reading ""stop police violence"", ""stop racism"" and ""I can't breathe"", the final words of Floyd as he lost consciousness, the protesters bowed heads beneath the statue of Marianne, who personifies the French Republic, in Place de la Republique.
Some raised a fist as a mark of respect for victims of police brutality.
""We’re here to fight against police violence, against all this racism that has been going on for generations. We cannot continue like this. This should be punished,"" said Kathleen Mergirie, a 30-year-old black woman.
Floyd's killing in Minneapolis two weeks ago ignited worldwide protests against racism and police brutality, including in France where people of African and Arab descent often complain that the police's record of violence remains unaddressed.
Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said France had at times in its history failed to live up to the challenge of meeting Republic's founding principles, liberty, equality and fraternity.
Police kept a low profile at the Paris protest. Scores of protesters also gathered peacefully in the western city of Nantes.

On Monday, the French government banned a dangerous chokehold used to detain suspects and promised zero tolerance of racism among law enforcement agents.

Now one of Bristol's most influential figures, the secretive street artist Banksy, has proposed a new presentation of the statue of Edward Colston that he said would capture the drama and the debate.
In scenes broadcast around the world, anti-racism protesters taking part in the global Black Lives Matter movement tore down the statue on Sunday and threw it into Bristol harbor.
""Here's an idea that caters for both those who miss the Colston statue and those who don't,"" Banksy said on Instagram.
""We drag him out the water, put him back on the plinth, tie cable round his neck and commission some life-size bronze statues of protesters in the act of pulling him down. Everyone happy. A famous day commemorated.""
Colston made a fortune in the transatlantic slave trade, and later donated to a range of charitable causes in Bristol. Several streets and buildings in the city bear his name.
Known for witty artworks that often make powerful points on world affairs, Banksy had already reacted to the event that triggered the global protests, the death of black American George Floyd after a white police officer knelt on his neck.

Banksy published an artwork on Saturday depicting the United States flag being set alight by a candle that forms part of a memorial to an anonymous, black, silhouetted figure.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As calls to disband police departments grow nationwide, Michael Eric Dyson, a professor at Georgetown University and author of 21 books including ""We Cannot Stop: A Sermon to White America,"" joined the #AskReuters Twitter chat series to talk about police, protests and politics. 
Below are edited highlights of his conversation with Lauren Young and April Joyner of Reuters. 
April Joyner: How will recent protests shape the future of policing in the U.S.? 
Michael Eric Dyson: I think policing will be dramatically different. With Congress today proposing legislation to ban chokeholds, that’s a major step forward. Arguments about defunding the police are also on the horizon. 
For instance, in New Jersey, we’ve seen examples of the defunding of the police and getting rid of police departments. Whether it’s outright abolition or not, at least the conversation is on the table. 
People are thinking seriously about restraining police and keeping them from murdering innocent people, especially unarmed black folk. I think it will make a huge and profound difference in how we view policing in this country. 
Lauren Young: Companies are donating money to organizations like Black Lives Matter. What are your thoughts on these contributions, and what is the best way for that money to be put to work to produce socio-economic change?
MD: It’s a beginning, it’s not an end, and it means that people are taking seriously what needs to be done — not just individual charity, but systemic change. That can be fostered by changing the corporate atmosphere and making sure that these things occur not episodically but on a routine basis. 
The best way for that money to be put to work to produce change is to allow the people who are making the change to be supported — people on the streets or people behind corporate desks who are black and brown who understand the need for change in America and then ultimately funding those organizations that have been at this for a long time. 
LY: How can white people respond to racial injustice now?
MD: I discuss these issues in the last chapter of my book. ‘Individual reparations account’ means that white brothers and sisters don’t have to wait for the government to engage in thinking about ideas to help those most in need of help. 
Educate yourselves. Think critically about the issues that are prevailing. Talk to many black people, not just one. And then talk to white people yourselves. The greatest thing that I think a white person can do is to convince another white person that they have to address these issues. 
Go to Thanksgiving dinner, eat your pumpkin pie first, then get down to business. Talk to granny and the nephews, aunts and uncles, too. 
AJ: What are you optimistic about now?
MD: The great theologian Reinhold Niebuhr said ‘Optimism is a shallow virtue.’ Hope is different. It’s deeper. It digs into the resources of our collective will to be better. Hope begets hope. 
Even when it looks dark, the stars are shining. So as a Baptist preacher for 41 years and as a professor, I think we’ve got to hope. I think this is a great time. People are taking this seriously. White brothers and sisters are asking serious questions; they’re in the streets with black people and Latinx people and others. 

We must take advantage of this. I am more hopeful now, despite the misery and the crisis that has occurred, because I believe that together, ‘E Pluribus Unum’ (out of many, one). We will prevail.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations chief Antonio Guterres on Tuesday told staff they were not banned from joining anti-racism demonstrations sweeping the United States and other countries, in a letter that aimed to clear up any confusion on the world body's guidance. 
""It does not in any way indicate that staff are to remain neutral or impartial in the face of racism,"" Guterres wrote in a letter to staff. ""To the contrary, there is no ban on personal expressions of solidarity or acts of peaceful civic engagement, provided they are carried out in an entirely private capacity.""
In the letter, obtained by Reuters, he said recent guidance by the Ethics Panel ""was meant to emphasize the need to balance such activities with one's best judgment as international civil servants and our official duties.""
The largely peaceful U.S. protests over the past two weeks were sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis with a white policeman's knee on his neck. Some cities have had to deal with arson, looting and clashes between protesters and police.
Earlier this month Guterres urged Americans protesting racial inequities and excessive police force to do so peacefully and called on U.S. leaders and authorities to listen to them and show restraint.
People have also taken to the streets in countries including Britain, France and Australia for anti-racism protests. 

""The position of the United Nations on racism is crystal clear: this scourge violates the Charter and debases our core values,"" Guterres wrote to staff. ""Every day, in our work across the world, we strive to do our part to promote inclusion, justice, dignity and combat racism in all its manifestations.""

867,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",Explainer: Untangling the conflict in Libya,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Libya's conflict has taken a new twist after an attempt by eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar to seize the capital, Tripoli, crumbled rapidly in recent weeks.
WHO'S BEEN FIGHTING WHO?
Haftar's self-proclaimed Libyan National Army (LNA) has been battling forces aligned with the Tripoli-based, internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). Both sides are built from local armed factions, whose shifting loyalties have at times helped determine the course of the conflict. 
Both have also depended heavily on foreign allies pursuing strategic and political agendas in Libya. Turkey stepped up its military support for the GNA in January, while Haftar has long enjoyed backing from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia and Jordan. 
HOW DID WE GET HERE?
Libya's fault lines began to surface nine years ago as local groups took different positions in the NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi.
An attempted democratic transition following his overthrow slid out of control as armed groups established local power bases and coalesced around rival political factions.
After a battle for Tripoli in 2014, one faction moved east where it set up a parallel government and branches of key institutions. It recognised Haftar as military chief as he began a long campaign against Islamist groups and other opponents in Benghazi. 
The GNA emerged from a December 2015, U.N.-backed agreement that gave the international community a partner in a country where Islamic State was ascendant and migrant smuggling into Europe had surged. But eastern factions spurned the deal.
Instead, Haftar consolidated control of the east and swept through the south in early 2019 before launching his offensive on Tripoli in April last year.
WHO CONTROLS WHAT?
Current positions look very similar to those two years ago, with a dividing line on the northern shore at Sirte, roughly the midpoint of Libya's Mediterranean coastline. 
The GNA and affiliated groups control Libya's densely populated northwest and the LNA holds the east. Allegiances in the south are more tenuous. 
WHAT'S THE DAMAGE?
Nearly 400,000 Libyans have been displaced over the past nine years, around half of them since the Tripoli offensive began. Thousands more have died.
The conflict has cost the country tens of billions of dollars in lost oil revenue, caused extensive damage to infrastructure and homes, and led to rapid inflation and frequent power and water cuts. 
WHAT CHANCE OF PEACE?
A weakened LNA may seek a deal. As Haftar's forces retreated last week the United Nations resumed indirect military talks to broker a ceasefire, and Egypt launched an initiative calling for a political solution.
The U.N. talks are part of a broader process aimed at resolving issues including the distribution of oil revenue, the make-up of a unity government and the future status of armed groups. 
But previous efforts to end the conflict have stalled, with lulls used to regroup and rearm before fighting resumes. 
GNA hawks have talked of pushing eastwards now they have momentum, while some in the east, where Haftar's future has been thrown into doubt by his military setbacks, have raised the prospect of partition. 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE OIL?
OPEC member Libya holds Africa's largest oil reserves, and produced 1.6 million barrels per day before 2011. Output has fluctuated sharply since, as factions blockaded facilities to press their demands and infrastructure was damaged.
Production climbed to around one million barrels from late 2016, before plunging to less than 100,000 bpd as the LNA's allies closed ports and pipelines in January.

That blockade has been partially lifted as GNA forces have advanced, with the southwestern fields of Sharara and El Feel reopening.

Nearly 38,000 minors were victims of violence in Spain in 2018 - but the government estimates that only one in five crimes committed against children is reported, meaning the number could be five times higher. 
""It is a landmark step for current and future generations of children and teenagers to grow up free of violence,"" said vice-president Pablo Iglesias, who is responsible for social rights, after a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
Under existing legislation, once a victim turns 18 they have a limited time window in which to report the abuse they endured, ranging from five to 20 years depending on the crime's severity.
The new law would delay the start of this countdown until victims turn 30 for the most serious crimes, effectively giving victims more time to report severe abuse.
The decree, which now has to be approved by parliament, is named ""Rhodes Law"" after the British concert pianist James Rhodes, who was raped as a child and wrote his testimony in an autobiography with harrowing details.
Rhodes now lives in Spain and has advised the Spanish government on the legislation.

RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Israel must face consequences if it annexes land in the occupied West Bank, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Tuesday, pointing to possible European sanctions.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, territory Israel took in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek for a state.
Netanyahu's new government is due to begin discussing the de facto annexation on July 1, but it is unclear whether Israel's main ally, the United States, would greenlight the step.
The Palestinians have rejected U.S. President Donald Trump's peace blueprint, announced in January, under which most of the settlements Israel built would be incorporated into ""contiguous Israeli territory"".
At a news conference, Shtayyeh said annexation would kill any possibility of peace with Israel and erode ""the Palestinian, regional and international consensus"" on a two-state solution.
He said Israel must now ""feel the heat of international pressure"".
European states, Shtayyeh said, were debating ""sanctions on Israel and freezing association agreements, as well as cancelling some research programmes"" and ""recognising Palestine"" as a state in the West Bank and Gaza.
Most countries view Israel's settlements on occupied land as illegal. Israel disputes this. Palestinians now exercise limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank while Palestinian Islamist group Hamas rules tiny Gaza.
But Shtayyeh said the 27-nation European Union's consensus decision-making was ""a bit complicated"", and one or two countries were not in line with others on the issue. 
An EU spokesman in Jerusalem declined comment on Shtayyeh's remarks but pointed to an earlier statement from EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell which said that annexation, ""if implemented, could not pass unchallenged"". 
Without giving details, Shtayyeh said the Palestinians submitted a counter-proposal to Trump's plan to the Quartet of Middle East mediators - the United States, Russia, the European Union and United Nations.

The Palestinians have declared agreements with Israel void in protest against annexation. Shtayyeh said his government's rejection of taxes collected by Israel on its behalf meant salaries would not be paid to some 130,000 public workers.

(Reuters) - Spared the worst of COVID-19, the largest for-profit hospital chains in the United States are pursuing a speedy recovery backed by billions of dollars in federal aid, while other hospitals say they have been harder hit and left wanting.
HCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) Inc, the biggest chain, has received $5.3 billion in loans and grants thus far from the federal government to offset lost business and higher expenses from the coronavirus pandemic.  Tenet Healthcare  Corp (NYSE:THC), the second-largest chain by revenue and beds, has disclosed more than $2 billion in similar loans and grants.
Meantime, the two chains, which own hundreds of hospitals, outpatient surgery centers and clinics, are telling investors that COVID-19 wasn’t as severe as expected in most of their markets, and that business is ramping back up. Shares in Tenet have doubled since the market lows in mid-March, while HCA shares have soared more than 70%.
The two companies and other big health systems appear to be benefiting disproportionately from the initial government relief as some other hospitals struggle to stay afloat, according to industry analysts and health-policy experts.
Many smaller competitors face virus-related financial losses. Twelve rural hospitals in the United States - many on shaky financial ground already - closed this year, including four in April, according to the National Rural Health Association.
“These large for-profit hospitals have access to capital that smaller facilities and safety-net hospitals don’t have,” said Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation who is tracking the federal relief effort.
Roseland Community Hospital, a 134-bed hospital in Chicago, took on $4 million in debt to conduct COVID-19 testing on thousands of low-income people and to purchase more hospital equipment while receiving less than $1 million in federal grants so far, Tim Egan, Roseland’s chief executive, told Reuters.
“We have been in this war on the frontlines for months without reinforcements while hospitals which are not under the same strain and stress are getting a lot of money,” he said.
Federal officials told Reuters that hospitals and other providers receiving relief funds will have to submit documentation showing money was used appropriately. They say additional money will be allocated to safety net hospitals and clinics hurt by the pandemic.
William Rutherford, HCA’s chief financial officer, said during an online investment conference on May 19 that “we didn’t necessarily see the surge” in demand for services that had been anticipated in most markets.
Similarly, while Tenet faced an influx of COVID-19 patients in Michigan, Massachusetts, California and Florida, Chief Executive Ron Rittenmeyer told analysts and investors last month that they were never overwhelmed. The company remained profitable in the first quarter, though it took about a $73 million hit due to COVID-19.
However, both companies said that federal aid has been critical as they rapidly adapted their operations to serve COVID-19 patients and minimize harm to employees.
In a statement to Reuters, HCA said the “funding our hospitals have received to date represents only a fraction of our anticipated lost revenue and increased expenses resulting from the pandemic.”
Tenet referred to previous statements its executives have made to investors. The company has said its federal funding was appropriate and said that more is needed because all of its hospitals stepped up to serve an unpredictable number of COVID-19 patients while revenue dropped significantly.
The financial challenges for hospitals may persist as some Americans postpone medical care and others lose employer health benefits during the economic downturn, industry experts say.
As shutdowns of many normal hospital services extended into April, Tenet said its admissions declined by about 30% for that month compared to a year ago, while procedures at its surgery centers dropped by 80%.
At HCA, inpatient admissions dropped by 30% and hospital surgeries by 50% during the first half of April, according to the company.
“I think a substantial portion of that will be recaptured,” HCA’s Rutherford told investors in May.
‘SHARE THE LOVE’
Labor unions representing HCA and Tenet workers question why senior executives haven’t sacrificed more of their own pay to help frontline workers.
“We are the ones taking all the risk,” said Shirley Caston, an endoscopy technician at HCA’s Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri. “The company should share the love.”
Caston, a member of the local Service Employees International Union, told Reuters that her hours were cut temporarily during the pandemic. Although the company is paying employees 70% of their regular pay for the lost time, the 63-year-old said she still lost several hundred dollars in a recent paycheck.
In April, HCA’s chief executive, Samuel Hazen, announced he would donate two months of his salary, or about $240,000, to a company relief fund for workers and other senior executives would take a 30% pay cut during the pandemic. Hazen’s donation amounted to about 1% of his total compensation of $26.8 million last year.
In a statement to Reuters, HCA said the company has spent $138 million to provide continued paychecks for more than 120,000 employees facing reduced hours, which it said avoided layoffs and furloughs.
Rittenmeyer, Tenet’s CEO, said he’s donating half of his salary for six months to an employee assistance program. That amounts to about $390,000, or 1.6% of his $24.3 million in total annual compensation last year.
Tenet put about 10% of the company’s employees, or 11,000 people, on furlough when the pandemic hit, and some are still waiting to be called back.
Rittenmeyer “needs to show more shared sacrifice,” said Michael Pryce-Jones, senior corporate governance analyst at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents some Tenet workers. “It’s not just the paycheck people are going without. It’s the risk some workers are taking with COVID-19.”
Caston and other employees at HCA and Tenet echoed complaints from frontline workers nationwide that their employers were not investing enough in protective equipment.
The company “seems to forget that it cannot make money for shareholders if workers like me do not have the equipment we need to care for patients,” Caston said.
Both HCA and Tenet told Reuters they had gone to great lengths to ensure staff have the appropriate protective gear, in accordance with government guidelines.
ASKING FOR MORE
Overall, Congress has allocated $175 billion to hospitals, doctors and other medical providers to compensate them for higher expenses during the COVID-19 response and for the revenue lost through suspension of surgeries, cancer screenings and routine care.
Federal officials paid an initial $50 billion from the relief fund in proportion to providers’ share of net patient revenue, which analysts said favored larger hospitals and health systems.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the next $50 billion in relief, which has been partially distributed, is focused more on providers significantly affected by COVID-19 cases, rural hospitals and those serving low-income patients on Medicaid.
In a statement to Reuters, HHS said that “While we understand there is great urgency to distribute this funding, HHS is also balancing concerns that these distributions be allocated fairly, transparently and with appropriate oversight.""
The agency added that it was working to ""address the unique needs"" of hospitals that serve large numbers of low-income people on the federal and state Medicaid program. 
Tenet, based in Dallas, has received more than $500 million in grants that don’t have to be repaid, and Nashville, Tennessee-based HCA said it has received $1 billion.
The bulk of their federal aid is advances on future Medicare payments that must be repaid starting in August. HCA received a $4.3 billion advance from Medicare; Tenet received $1.5 billion.
Amid a national outpouring of goodwill toward doctors, nurses and others caring for COVID-19 patients, a bipartisan group of more 90 U.S. lawmakers has proposed that Congress waive repayment industrywide.
“The hospital industry has a great interest in getting as much as possible with the fewest strings attached,” said Dan Skinner, an associate professor of health policy at Ohio University.
Executives at for-profit hospitals say they deserve more money still for dealing with another possible surge in infections and other uncertainties.

During a presentation to investors last month, Rittenmeyer, Tenet’s CEO, said the federal aid has been helpful, but “we believe that more is needed from the government.”

874,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 09:35AM ET</span>",Bahrain releases prominent activist Nabeel Rajab: lawyer,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Bahrain has released prominent human rights activist Nabeel Rajab after a court agreed to pass an alternative sentence to the jail term he is currently serving, his lawyer said on Tuesday.
Rajab, an outspoken critic of the Bahraini government who played a prominent role in pro-democracy protests in 2011, is serving a five-year sentence over social media posts criticizing Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen.
Bahrain introduced new legislation in 2018 allowing its courts to convert jail terms into non-custodial sentences. Hundreds of prisoners have been released but Rajab is the only major opposition and activist figure that has been freed so far.
""The court has finally agreed to grant Nabeel Rajab an alternative sentence,"" his lawyer Mohamed Al Jishi told Reuters. 
It was not immediately clear what the alternative punishment would be for Rajab but authorities said non-custodial sentences include community service, electronic monitoring and repairing criminal damage. 
Rajab was sentenced in 2018 over social media posts criticizing Saudi Arabia's air strikes in Yemen and accusing authorities of torture.
He was convicted of ""spreading false news and rumours in time of war"", ""insulting foreign countries"" and ""insulting publicly the interior ministry"", according to a court filing by his lawyers during his trial.
In his mid-50s, Rajab has been in jail since 2016 and served another two-year term for torture allegations he made in a news interview. He also faces a number of other cases, including over a column he wrote in the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT).
Bahrain, led by a Sunni Muslim royal family, has been clamping down on dissent since 2011 when it quashed the Arab Spring-like protests, led mainly by Shi'ite Muslims, with the help of Saudi Arabia.
Home to the U.S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, the small Gulf kingdom prosecuted and revoked the citizenship of hundreds of people in mass trials and banned leading opposition groups. Most of the main Shi'ite opposition figures and human rights activists are imprisoned or have fled the country.

The government denies repressing the opposition and says it is protecting national security from groups it calls terrorists backed by Iran.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>","After George Floyd's death, a groundswell of religious activism","By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - George Floyd's death has triggered a groundswell of outrage and activism by religious leaders and faith-based groups across the United States, reminiscent of what occurred during the civil rights movement in the 1960s.
Conservative and mainstream religious leaders are joining with Black churches, progressive Catholics and Protestants, Jewish synagogues and other faith groups in calling for police reforms and efforts to dismantle racism. 
Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes on May 25. The officer has been fired and charged with second-degree murder, but protesters and activists around the world are pushing for deeper change. 
""We're seeing it at the grassroots level. We're seeing rabbis walking alongside Muslim leaders, walking alongside Catholic priests and religious sisters,"" said Johnny Zokovitch, executive director of Pax Christi USA, a national Catholic peace and justice group. ""We are seeing that race cuts across all religious denominations.""
More than 1,000 rabbis, pastors, imams and other religious leaders held an online conference last week to brainstorm ways to address systemic violence against African Americans. 
There is a new ""breadth and depth"" in the faith-based response, said one participant, Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, citing a great hunger for connection after months of social distancing and lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Folks are just so angry. They're angry about enduring racism, they're angry about the incompetent response to COVID, they're angry about bigotry and racism, about anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, and white supremacy,"" he said.
Progressive (NYSE:PGR) religious groups had an important role in shaping the emerging movement, much as they did in the civil rights movement, but today's actions are attracting a more diverse set of participants, Pesner said.
ELECTION ISSUE
Republican Donald Trump won the 2016 presidential election with strong support from evangelical Christians and Catholics. But Floyd's death and Trump's criticism of protesters may be a factor when members of those religious groups go to the polls in November. 
While federal tax rules prevent houses of worship from taking an overt partisan stance, clergy are not banned from expressing their personal opinions.
Trump was sharply criticized by mainstream Catholic and Episcopal leaders after protesters were forcibly cleared for a staged photo of him last week in front of Washington's historic St. John's Episcopal Church across from the White House. 
Some right-leaning religious leaders have since called him out or joined protests, unlike in the 1960s when some white evangelical leaders, including the Rev. Billy Graham (NYSE:GHM), did not https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-people-billy-graham/billy-graham-preacher-to-millions-adviser-to-presidents-dies-at-99-idUKKCN1G51M4 take part in the civil rights movement. 
Televangelist Pat Robertson chided the president last week for threatening to send in military troops if governors did not quell violent protests. ""He spoke of them as being jerks. You just don't do that, Mr. President. It isn't cool!""
Joel Osteen, the senior pastor from Texas megachurch Lakewood, marched with protesters last week in Houston. ""We need to stand against injustice and stand with our Black brothers and sisters,"" said Osteen. 
Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a Mormon, joined hundreds of Christian evangelicals at a march in Washington on Sunday, and tweeted https://twitter.com/MittRomney/status/1269758561720156160 out ""Black Lives Matter."" 
Some churches have also stepped up efforts to boost voter registration in recent weeks, much as churches did in the 1960s.
Data collected after Floyd's death from the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute showed https://www.prri.org/research/trump-favorability-white-catholic-and-non-college-americans-national-unrest-protests 37% of white Catholics held favorable views of Trump, down from 49% in 2019, and a drop from the 60% who voted https://www.prri.org/spotlight/religion-vote-presidential-election-2004-2016 for Trump in 2016. 
POOR PEOPLE'S CAMPAIGN
Religious leaders held an online eulogy for Floyd and interfaith service on Sunday, https://www.facebook.com/events/2154673621324315 staged a day of fasting on Monday, and observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence to mark the exact amount of time Floyd was held down as he pleaded: ""Please, I can't breathe.""
A June 20 online ""assembly"" including 16 religious denominations seeks to revive the ""Poor People's Campaign"" launched after the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Subtitled ""A National Call for Moral Revival,"" it will also focus on Floyd, organizers say.
""We are in a deep moral crisis,"" said the Rev. William Barber, pastor of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, who is one of the key organizers.
""What we have to do at this moment is not only address what happened to George Floyd, but the interlocking problems of systemic racism, police brutality, the lack of healthcare, poverty and militarism,"" he said.
Najuma Smith-Pollard, a Black pastor and community activist in Los Angeles, said the protests had already triggered action that once seemed impossible - the Los Angeles mayor yanked $150 million from the police department's budget and diverted it to programs for youth jobs, healthcare and trauma recovery.

""I don't think it's a blip,"" she said. ""Too many things are at stake and too many people are engaged. This is no longer a local matter - it's national, it's global.""

LARNACA, Cyprus (Reuters) - Cyprus reopened its airports on Tuesday after almost three months of lockdown, hoping its record in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic and a pledge of free medical treatment for any COVID-19 cases will lure tourists back to its beaches.
Heavily reliant on tourism, Cyprus announced a lockdown soon after its first cases on March 9. By Monday, it had recorded 970 cases and just 18 deaths, and its daily count of new infections was down to a handful.
Transport Minister Yiannis Karousos welcomed 22 arrivals from Israel at Larnaka Airport, saying Cyprus was in effect free of the virus.
""I miss Cyprus, Cyprus is a brother of Israel, it's very nice, very quiet,"" said Israeli visitor Joseph Amkri, 50. 
Savvas Perdios, the deputy tourism minister, said: ""Our target is to reach 30% of where we were last year.""
The white sands of Ayia Napa's Nissi Beach are normally packed with sunseekers, but were empty on Tuesday. ""It's the first time I've seen the beach this empty,"" said lifeguard Xenios Charalambous.
""We're trying to pull through and hope more people come now that the airports are open. We'll be here waiting for them."" 
Perdios said health protocols had been tightened and authorities would cover the medical costs of any visitor who tested positive for COVID-19 while on the island: 
""This is really important to us. To show people this is a safe destination, with a dependable health system.""
Initially, arrivals will be restricted to people who have tested COVID-19 free from a few countries including Germany, Israel and Greece. The requirement will be dropped for that group on June 20.

Cyprus says decisions about who to let in are based on the epidemiological data. Vistors from Russia and Britain, which are Cyprus's main markets, are not yet included, though Perdios said he expected that to happen in mid-July.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian government prosecutors withdrew corruption charges on Tuesday against an ally of former premier Najib Razak, whose party returned to power in a new coalition three months ago after having lost the last election amid massive graft scandals.
The Kuala Lumpur High Court acquitted Musa Aman, a senior figure in Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) and former chief minister of Sabah state in Malaysian Borneo, after the prosecution dropped all 46 charges of alleged bribery in timber concession deals and money laundering.
The opposition Pakatan Harapan coalition described the decision as ""confusing and disappointing"".
""The attorney-general's chambers must immediately provide a full explanation for the decision as it would reflect on the true face of today's administration,"" it said in a statement.
Attorney-General Idrus Harun, appointed by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who depends on UMNO's support, said he withdrew the charges due to a lack of documentary evidence from the companies and banks allegedly involved.
Idrus said in a statement some prosecution witnesses had also either ""passed away, suffered serious medical ailments or are not in Malaysia anymore"".
Musa's lawyer, Amer Hamzah Arshad, said the charges, which involved a total of 403 million ringgit ($95 million), had been akin to ""political persecution"".
Najib himself faces multiple corruption charges in three separate trials linked to the siphoning off of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysian Development Bhd (1MDB) and other cases.
He has pleaded not guilty and will know the verdict of his first case in July. Najib has described the cases against him as politically motivated.
Outrage over the 1MDB scandal was one of the main factors why UMNO lost the 2018 election, its first defeat since Malaysia emerged from British colonial rule over 60 years ago.

The victors' multi-ethnic coalition splintered in February, paving the way for Muhyiddin to patch up with UMNO to form a new, Malay-dominated coalition.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Manage a global team of 3,500 people? No problem, says Katrin Lehmann, head of customer innovation and maintenance at German business software company SAP.
Do it while looking after four kids, including home schooling 10-year-old Benno? It almost finished her off.
""I was going nuts,"" she said. ""All of them eat different things and they all complain, whatever you do. I said, right: cornflakes for lunch.""
Germany experienced far lower death rates than other large European countries from the coronavirus, and has been quicker than many to begin easing lockdown measures. But schools have been slow to reopen, and working parents are getting fed up.
Dozens of parents, many with young children in tow, protested outside the Berlin city hall on Tuesday to call on the local government to do more to help families, carrying placards including: ""Open the schools or mum will lose her cool.""
""We can't carry on like this. We need relief,"" said Sabine Ponath, a parliamentary researcher and mother of two.
German schools started slowly reopening in late April, but many pupils are still back only for a couple of hours a week as schools split classes to observe social distancing rules. Daycare provision for younger children is even more limited.
A survey published by the DAK health insurance group last week showed that 81% of parents and 62% of children support the gradual reopening of schools, with about half of parents reporting feeling exhausted most days due to home schooling.
Schools should reopen, ""not for myself to be able to work, but more for the kids. Their routine is totally messed up,"" said Michael Stempin, head of brand management at price comparison firm Idealo, who spends two hours a day home schooling.
The Institute for Employment Research estimated that by the end of April some 56 million days of work were lost in Germany due to the closure of nurseries and schools.
WOMEN'S CAREERS UNDER PRESSURE
Women are bearing the brunt of home schooling and extra housework, according to surveys. That hurts efforts to promote diversity and narrow Germany's gender pay gap.
Job satisfaction of mothers has fallen by 5 percentage points more than that of fathers during the crisis, and they are more likely to have cut their hours or stopped working, according to a survey by the Berlin Social Science Center (WZB).
""Just as before the crisis, it is often the women who are putting back their careers to be there for the children,"" said WZB's social science Professor Lena Hipp, herself trying to fit in work around caring for three young children.
At SAP, co-CEO Jennifer Morgan, a mother of two, stepped down in April after only six months as the first female head of a German blue-chip company, leaving Christian Klein in charge.
SAP gave no reasons for her departure though Chairman Hasso Plattner suggested one leader was needed in this time of crisis. Klein, for his part, has made a point of mentioning his children at board meetings.
SAP has been monitoring the gender impact of the crisis. It says more women than men received promotions during March and April.
""Productivity has stayed the same but people are paying a higher price than in non-corona times, and how long they can keep it up will depend on relief for parents when schools can restart,"" said Cawa Younosi, the company's head of human resources in Germany.
Lehmann, working from home in Heidelberg in southern Germany, sees one positive upshot: the crisis has encouraged people to be more honest about the challenges of juggling a career and family.
""It is OK that you have a screaming kid in the background or a dog running around,"" she said. ""Now I am talking about my kids with my team quite a lot so they can see it is possible to have kids and responsibility in the company.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - A United Nations human rights expert voiced alarm on Tuesday at ""widespread food shortages and malnutrition"" in North Korea, made worse by a nearly five-month border closure with China and strict quarantine measures against COVID-19.
Tomas Ojea Quintana, U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, urged the U.N. Security Council to reconsider sanctions imposed on the isolated country over its nuclear and missile programmes, so as to ensure food supplies.
North Korea, where a famine in the mid-1990s is believed to have killed 3 million people, does not report COVID-19 cases to the World Health Organization.
The pandemic has brought ""drastic economic hardship"" to North Korea, Ojea Quintana said, with a 90% fall in trade with China in March and April leading to lost incomes.
Expressing concern about reports of an increase of homeless people in large cities and skyrocketing medicine prices, he said in a statement: ""An increasing number of families eat only twice a day, or eat only corn, and some are starving."" 
Ojea Quintana urged Pyongyang to allow humanitarian aid to be delivered ""without restrictions"". Operations have been suspended outside the capital, leaving vaccine stocks and other aid ""stranded"" at the border. 
He urged North Korea to free prisoners during the pandemic, citing accounts of prisoner deaths caused by hard work, lack of food, contagious diseases and overcrowding.
Elisabeth Byrs, spokeswoman for the U.N.'s World Food Programme, told reporters the humanitarian situation in North Korea remained ""bleak"".
More than 10 million people, or 40% of the population, need humanitarian aid, she said. The WFP hopes to reach 1.2 million people there with food rations this year.

Byrs said widespread malnutrition had damaged the health and development of children - with one in five under the age of five stunted - as well as pregnant and nursing mothers.

882,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Special Report: COVID deepens the other opioid crisis - a shortage of hospital painkillers,"By Lisa Girion, Dan Levine and Robin Respaut
(Reuters) - As opioid pills and patches fueled a two-decade epidemic of overdoses in the United States, hospitals faced chronic shortages of the same painkillers in injectable form - narcotics vital to patients on breathing machines.
For years, hospitals chased supplies, sometimes resorting to inferior substitutes. The shortfall grew so dire in 2018 that a drugmaker sent letters advising hospitals they could use batches of opioid syringes potentially containing hazardous contaminants - so long as they filtered each dose.
Then the novel coronavirus struck, and demand for injectable opioids exploded. By April, more than 16,000 COVID-19 patients a day were on ventilators, the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation estimated.
After a highly public battle to secure enough ventilators, hospitals say they must scramble to obtain the powerful painkillers needed to use them. Opioids help keep patients in severe distress from reflexively ripping out the tubing that forces oxygen into their lungs.
(For a graphic on ventilators, see https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/VENTILATORS/oakvekyxvrd/index.html)
Underlying the persistent shortages - and the present crisis - are the basic economics of the American drug industry. The market discourages production of low-margin hospital injectable opioids in favor of high-profit prescription versions, according to interviews with dozens of government officials, medical practitioners and industry participants, as well as an analysis of government data.
Though deficiencies in the supply of injectable opioids had long been recognized, U.S. drug makers, hospitals, regulators and lawmakers failed to fix the problem and were caught unprepared for a pandemic that suddenly and dramatically escalated demand, Reuters found.
Janet Woodcock, senior adviser to the FDA’s commissioner,
told Reuters that when hospitals in Wuhan, China, began filling with patients on ventilators, she and her colleagues knew a wave of American cases would overwhelm shallow U.S. supplies.
""We recognized this was going to happen,"" she said, adding, “We’re just trying to get every last vial of product into the system that we can.”
Among the thousands of COVID-19 patients wheeled into American intensive care units, some have been intubated for weeks, far longer than is typical. Demand for injectable opioids more than doubled between January and early April, rapidly depleting what hospitals and drugmakers had on hand, according to Vizient, a large hospital purchasing organization. Orders for the commonly used injectable opioid fentanyl roughly tripled, but suppliers were able to ship only half of what hospitals asked for, said Amanda Forster, a spokeswoman for Premier Inc, another large hospital purchasing organization.
Although ventilator use has fallen from the April peak, more than 7,000 COVID-19 patients are estimated to be relying on them each day. Several states are seeing a surge in cases, and many hospitals are resuming elective surgeries that were postponed early in the pandemic - further straining opioid supplies.
For injectables, the supply chain is slow and fragile. Aging plants operated by a small group of manufacturers chug along at nearly full capacity, with little room to ramp up production. The risk of a mechanical breakdown or contamination runs high, and adding another production line or opening a new plant can take a year or more, industry experts said.
""This is no way to run an army,” said Jacob Sherkow, a Harvard University research fellow on biotechnology law. “But fixing it is incredibly difficult and extraordinarily complex.""
The marketplace, Sherkow and others told Reuters, is hard-wired to reward innovation - new, ostensibly improved products - over older workhorse medications, no matter how vital. According to a October 2019 report by a task force led by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the price for injectable drugs can dip below the cost of production. By comparison, sales of prescription opioids in pill and patch form such as OxyContin, Opana and Duragesic each exceeded $1 billion annually before their patents expired.
Production of pills and other prescription opioids used outside hospitals began to explode in the late 1990s as drugmakers pursued new patients, patents and profits. By 2006, production of outpatient prescription opioids was at least nine times that of the low-margin injectable opioids most widely used by hospitals, according to a Reuters analysis of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration data. The findings were adjusted to account for differences in potency among the drugs.
Through at least 2014, as addiction and overdoses escalated, prescription opioid production grew more than twice as fast as that of widely used hospital injectables, the data show. More recent DEA data show that outpatient opioid production continued to dwarf that of the narcotics most used by hospitals through 2019. The gap persisted even as physicians grew cautious about prescribing opioids to outpatients.
Multiple government agencies, from the FDA to the Department of Defense, knew about the chronic shortages of injectable opioids and other critical care drugs well before the coronavirus pandemic, according to federal documents and interviews with public officials. Injectable opioids in syringes and various vial sizes, including fentanyl, have been on the FDA's list of drugs in short supply at least since 2017.
After releasing its task force report in October, FDA leaders blamed injectable shortages on “a broken marketplace” in which production is often disrupted and prices remain low, regardless of demand, because of inflexible hospital contracts. Yet proposals for far-reaching changes - such as creating incentives for production of drugs in short supply - have not made it past the discussion stage in Congress.
Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican from Maine, said she had pushed for new incentives to encourage manufacturing of drugs at risk of shortage earlier this year, but federal agencies told her they did not want to pursue substantive action amid the pandemic. “This is a really important issue, and the coronavirus has really shined a light on it,” Collins told Reuters.
The shortages have a direct impact on patients. Pharmacists, anesthesiologists and other frontline medical professionals told Reuters they have had to sub in less effective drugs, some with problematic side effects, or to inject crushed opioid tablets into feeding tubes.
The harm to patients is difficult to measure and most likely underestimated, the FDA-led task force found. Fighting for their lives and unable to speak, most patients are sedated and unconscious while ventilated and often have no recall of their experiences afterward.
Several doctors said they were using paralytic agents to keep patients from involuntarily fighting the ventilator. But the powerful drugs also prevent patients even from flinching in pain. Nurses said they must closely watch for signs of pain or distress - such as increased heart rates - when supply problems force them to switch patients from one drug to another.
Patients can have hallucinations and become agitated on a second-line drug, said Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, regional director of critical care at Northwell Health, a 23-hospital system in New York. “You can tell they are really uncomfortable.”
For now, hospitals cadge injectable opioid drugs as best they can.
In Cleveland, the University Hospitals group has designated “SWAT teams” to move what supplies it has among its 18 facilities. And they are constantly shopping for more.
“If you don’t buy it, you miss it,” said Shawn Osborne, vice president for pharmacy services. “If you miss it, you're not going to get to next week.”
ONE DRUG, TWO MARKETS
Fentanyl, a pain reliever up to 100 times more powerful than morphine, exemplifies how the same drug, fashioned from the same molecule, can fare very differently in the marketplace depending on the form it takes.
Invented in 1960, fentanyl was long reserved for surgical, cancer and terminally ill patients. But in the late 1990s, drug companies and doctors launched a war on the chronic pain often experienced by outpatients.
The main weapons in this war were old, generic opioids manufactured in novel configurations that allowed their makers to win lucrative patents. Cheap and easy to synthesize in the lab, fentanyl was refashioned in one newly patented form after another - as a lollipop, a fast-dissolving disc and a nasal spray.
Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals Inc began promoting fentanyl for this new market in 1997, decades after its invention. J&J’s patented, slow-release fentanyl skin patch, Duragesic, competed for blockbuster profits against another old opioid, oxycodone, which Purdue Pharma LP had re-launched in a patented slow-release pill called OxyContin.
In a statement, J&J told Reuters that prescription opioids “are an important option” for pain relief and that U.S. government policies and regulations “recognize the ongoing medical need for these medications.”
After patents on prescription opioids elapsed, generic drugmakers have piled in to profit off volume sales.
Unlike the crowded marketplace for prescription opioids, the injectables sector is highly consolidated, with only a few companies producing the lion’s share of each narcotic. (For the most part, the companies making injectables are not making prescription opioids.)
Still, large hospital chains and purchasing groups have enough market power to drive hard bargains, the FDA-led drug task force found. Generic injectables are largely seen as interchangeable, so hospitals shop by price, not brand. For drugmakers, the report said, it’s “a race to the bottom.”
This week, for instance, the internet-advertised price for a box of 25 small injectable fentanyl vials - enough for a single bedside drip bag for a COVID-19 patient - was $76.99. By comparison, the price for a single prescription of a new fentanyl nasal spray for breakthrough cancer pain is $985. That means hospitals are paying 3 cents per microgram for injectable fentanyl. At $1.23 per microgram, the nasal spray is roughly 40 times higher.
Despite bargain-basement prices, drugs injected directly into the bloodstream are more expensive and more difficult to make than pills, which are mass produced. Injectable drugs are made batch-by-batch, and the risks of contamination are greater. They require a sterile environment, post-production “quarantines” to allow for the growth and detection of any possible bacteria and, finally, testing for any other contaminants.
“Manufacturing a sterile product requires a totally different investment,” said Siggi Olafsson, chief executive of Hikma Pharmaceuticals (OTC:HKMPY) PLC, which makes 17% of generic injectables used in the United States.
He and other injectable manufacturers told Reuters they remained in the U.S. market because they believed it was the right thing to do. Hikma is still seeing sales growth, reporting that revenues from its injectables business rose 5% in the United States in 2019.
A SHAKY SUPPLY LINE
When the novel coronavirus landed in the United States, the supply line for hospital opioids was still recovering from a setback three years earlier.
In February 2017,  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE), one of the nation’s biggest injectable drugmakers, received an FDA warning about several shoddy sterilization procedures at its McPherson, Kansas plant. By the summer, Pfizer warned of extended production delays as it sought to fix the problems, according to a letter the company sent to customers.
As a result, Pfizer’s output of injectable fentanyl, hydromorphone and morphine - three key hospital opioids - was thrown into disarray as other manufacturers were stepping away from the market.
Purdue, for instance, had sharply reduced its injectable hydromorphone output over several years. By 2017, the company made a “business decision” to license production to another drugmaker with better capabilities, the company told Reuters in an email.
The shortfalls across the country underscored the vulnerability of the injectables supply chain. In a February 2018 letter to U.S. drug regulators, hospital administrators warned that surgeries might be postponed or canceled. “In some cases, this could prove life-threatening,” they said.
Then Pfizer took an unusual step. In May and July of 2018, the company sent out letters warning hospitals, doctors and pharmacists that cracked needle hubs and unspecified contaminants had been found in some glass syringes filled with morphine and hydromorphone after they had been shipped to hospitals.
In the letters, reviewed by Reuters, the company said that the contaminants could result in inflammation, tissue injury and respiratory problems. But the letters said the affected batches could be used, so long as hospitals filtered out any contaminants. Pfizer said it was coordinating with the FDA “to help alleviate the critical drug shortage.”
In a statement to Reuters, Pfizer said it determined the syringes “posed a negligible risk” if filtered as instructed. The FDA confirmed in an email that it provided the manufacturer “discretion so the product could continue to be used” and that it works with firms to ensure patient safety during shortages.
“Sterile injectables are quite complex and costly to consistently manufacture,” Pfizer told Reuters. The company said it is now operating “without significant disruption” and has increased production of injectable opioids. It did not say by how much.
The status of injectable drug supplies at any given time can be a mystery.
The FDA requires manufacturers to update the agency on disruptions and shortages of necessary drugs. But those notices may be filed up to five days after a problem is identified - keeping the agency from taking action before a shortfall. On an FDA web page listing backordered drugs, the FDA said in early June that the ""estimated recovery"" for some injectable opioids made by Pfizer was not expected until early 2021.
Because drug companies hold information close to the vest, Woodcock said her agency had little visibility into what supplies companies had on hand or in production as the pandemic approached. She said the agency was encouraging - but couldn’t force - companies that once made injectable opioids to resume production.
But some manufacturers are plainly not interested in returning.
Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX), once a large injectable opioid maker, has no plans to start up again, citing the lead time involved, pharmaceuticals president Sumant Ramachandra told Reuters.
""To do that from scratch again, you're talking about over a year plus,"" he said, adding that his company is focusing on other critical care drugs.
NO ‘EASY BUTTON’
As in the past, hospitals have been left to improvise.
At her Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fresno, California, ICU nurse Amy Arlund said she has had to swap ventilated COVID patients’ drugs in the middle of the night as the staff navigated shortages. “When you’re told to switch from drug-A to drug-B, it’s not as easy as flipping a switch,” she said. “It requires careful monitoring.”
Switching from one drug for another can raise the risk of dosing errors and side effects. At the peak of the surge in coronavirus cases in New York, some hospitals couldn’t get enough fentanyl, prompting physicians to go to second- and third-line drugs, such as ketamine, a drug that studies have shown can cause agitation and a racing heart.
Even when hospitals are able to get enough injectable opioids, they often are not in the form they need.
Colorado-based SCL Health Hospitals & Clinics pulled nine people from other jobs to work the phones in search of injectable opioids, said Jennifer Davis, system pharmacy director. When unable to find fentanyl vials large enough to fill a bedside drip bag in one shot, they have bought any size available, including syringe-sized ampules.
Working in head-to-toe protective gear to prevent contamination, pharmacy techs have had to crack as many as 25 thumb-size glass bottles and draw out the clear liquid, syringe by syringe, to make a single 50 milliliter intravenous bag for a ventilator patient.
The process adds about 12 minutes to the preparation of each bedside bag, Davis said. A single COVID-19 patient may need two or more bags a day.
Such onerous workarounds are likely to continue as no permanent solutions to the shortages are in sight.
“If there was an easy button, it would have been pressed ages ago,” said Michael Ganio, senior director of pharmacy practice and quality at the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian restaurant owners stripped of their income by the coronavirus lockdown are campaigning for their businesses to be allowed to reopen by posting pictures of themselves naked on social media.
Hundreds of bar, restaurant and cafe employees have posted photographs of themselves naked with carefully positioned plates, cups, saucepans, bottles, bar stools and napkin holders.
Their demand is for authorities to allow them to start serving clients as the country gradually eases measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
""We are naked because we are left with nothing,"" said Arthur Galaychyuk, owner of the Relab Family bar chain in the city of Kazan, whose 20 employees took part in the campaign.
Restaurants in Kazan will be allowed to open their summer terraces on June 11 after more than two months of lockdown.
""We don't want to stage a strip show or to fool around, we only want one thing - to work!"" said Pavel, a chef from the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, in a post with a group picture of his colleagues wearing only masks and holding kitchenware.
""We don't pose more of a risk then supermarkets, shopping malls, hair salons or public transport,"" the post said. 
Authorities in Novosibirsk have not announced when local restaurants can open.
President Vladimir Putin ordered strict lockdown measures at the end of March shutting all businesses except food stores and pharmacies. The country's regions were allowed to adjust the measures depending on the situation on the ground.
Moscow is in the process of lifting the lockdown and many businesses, including shopping malls, book stores and beauty salons have reopened.

The Russian capital plans to allow cafes and restaurants to open their outside terraces later in June before reopening fully from June 23. Indoor restaurants and bars remain closed in other parts of Russia.

DUBAI (Reuters) - An Iranian who spied for U.S. and Israeli intelligence on slain Revolutionary Guards commander Qassem Soleimani has been sentenced to death, Iran said on Tuesday, adding the case was not linked to Soleimani's killing earlier this year.
On Jan. 3, a U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Soleimani, leader of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force. Washington blamed Soleimani for masterminding attacks by Iran-aligned militias on U.S. forces in the region. 
""Mahmoud Mousavi-Majd, one of the spies for the CIA and the Mossad, has been sentenced to death ... He had shared information about the whereabouts of martyr Soleimani with our enemies,"" judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said in a televised news conference.
""He passed on security information to the Israeli and American intelligence agencies about Iran's armed forces, particularly the Guards,"" Esmaili said. 
Esmaili said Mousavi-Majd's death sentence has been upheld by a supreme court and ""he will be executed soon.""
Later, the judiciary said in a statement that Mousavi-Majd's conviction was not linked to ""the terrorist act of the U.S. government"" in Soleimani's killing in Iraq. 
""All the legal proceedings in the case of this spy ... had been carried out long before the martyrdom of Soleimani,"" the statement said, adding that Mousavi-Majd had been arrested in October 2018. 
Officials have not said whether Mousavi-Majd's case is linked to Iran's announcement in the summer of 2019 that it had captured 17 spies working for the CIA, some of whom it said were sentenced to death. 
Nor have they said whether Mousavi-Majd's case is linked to Iran's announcement in February of this year that Iran had sentence to death a man for spying for the CIA and attempting to pass on information about Tehran's nuclear program. 

Soleimani's killing led to a peak in confrontation between Iran and the United States. Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on an Iraqi air base where U.S. forces were stationed. Hours later, Iranian forces on high alert mistakenly shot down a Ukrainian passenger airliner taking off from Tehran.

Nine out of 13 analysts and traders polled this week andlast said the bank would hold the rate steady when its executive board meets on Thursday. Four predicted a 25-basis-point cut.
After also keeping the rate on hold last month, the bank said that two rate cuts and a government plan to invest 5.1 billion euros ($5.74 billion) to boost economy were the main factors in holding the rate steady.
Serbia, which is due to hold a national election on June 21, is expected to enter a recession this year, despite growing 5% in the first quarter, and to rebound in 2021 according to the government, World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
Last year, the economy grew by 4.2%.
Djordje Djukic, a economics lecturer at the University of Belgrade, said the bank may cut the main rate to boost lending and growth, taking advantage of low inflation and a stable exchange rate of the dinar (EURRSD=D1) versus euro, which is the preferred foreign currency.
""Positive effects (of a rate cut) could be bigger than an increase in inflation,"" Djukic, who was not surveyed in the poll, told Reuters.
Inflation fell to 0.6% in April from 1.3% a month earlier, far below the bank's target band of 3%, plus or minus 1.5 percentage points. The Statistics Office will announce inflation data for May on June 12.
As the rate of infection slowed, Serbia last month abolished the state of emergency imposed on March 15, which included the closure of borders, a daily curfew and weekend lockdowns.
Serbia has so far reported 11,896 confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease and 250 deaths.

There will be no restrictions on visitors from Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.
Slovakia last week reopened borders with neighbours Czech Republic, Austria and Hungary.
Slovakia had imposed relatively strict restrictions including border closures before it reported any coronavirus cases, and has moved cautiously in reopening.
Matovic also said that compulsory quarantine upon arrival from abroad will be dropped for countries on the safe list, and people will not have to activate ""smart quarantine"" on their mobile devices.
Slovaks returning from countries outside the safe list should still quarantine themselves and take a coronavirus test.
""We are switching from bans to personal responsibility,"" Matovic said at a televised news conference.
The government will also relax the obligation to wear face masks, which will be required only indoors from Wednesday, Matovic said.
The country of 5.5 million people has recorded 1,531 cases of the COVID-19 illness, with 28 deaths.

Cambodia had previously denied knowledge of the incident involving Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, which sparked outrage and protests in neighbouring Thailand, where demonstrators urged both governments to investigate. 
""Cambodian authorities will investigate this case...we will investigate whether this information is true or not,"" the spokesman, Chhay Kim Khoeun, told Reuters.
The comments came after dozens of protesters outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok on Monday demanded an investigation into the disappearance and accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping.
Thailand's police and government have denied the accusation, and Cambodian authorities have also denied any role.
On Tuesday, Wanchalearm's family petitioned the Thai government and parliament to help investigate.
His elder sister, Sitanun Satsaksit, has said he was speaking to her on his mobile phone last week when the line was abruptly cut. After 20 minutes of frantic calls, she was told by a friend that her brother had been kidnapped from the street.
Thailand will help the family by supporting Cambodia's investigation, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said.
""Whatever we can cooperate we will do so,"" he added. ""We will not interfere with the authorities of another country. They have their own investigation mechanism.""
Wanchalearm fled Thailand after being summoned by military authorities following a 2014 military coup led by Prayuth as army chief that aimed to restore order after a cycle of mass protests and violence.
In 2018, Thailand issued a warrant for his arrest over violations of a Computer Crime Act, as he ran a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page critical of the military government.

At least eight other activists who fled Thailand after the coup have disappeared from Cambodia, Laos or Vietnam, with the bodies of two later found floating in the Mekong River.

The state-owned carrier made the first known flight to Israel by a United Arab Emirates airline on May 19. It transported supplies to help the Palestinians combat the new coronavirus after the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO) coordinated a 16-tonne shipment from the UAE. 
However, Palestinian authorities refused to receive that shipment because they said it had not been coordinated with them.
It was not immediately clear what has since happened to the first shipment. A Palestinian Authority spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Like the first flight, Wednesday's flight from Abu Dhabi will be cargo-only with no passengers onboard, the Etihad spokeswoman told Reuters by email. 
""Etihad Airways continues to operate humanitarian flights providing much needed aid to nations within its network and beyond,"" she said. 
Israel does not have diplomatic relations with the UAE or any of the other five Gulf Arab countries, and there are no commercial flights between them. 
However, shared concerns over Iran's influence in the region have led to a discrete thaw in ties between Israel and the Arab Gulf in recent years. 

An Israeli official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told Reuters Wednesday's Etihad flight was completing a shipment of aid from the UAE to the Palestinians.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court on Tuesday sentenced a Jehovah's Witness to six and a half years in prison after finding him guilty of organising the activities of a banned extremist organisation, his lawyer said.
The ruling at the Pskov City Court, handed to 61-year-old Gennady Shpakovskiy, was the harshest sentence for a Jehovah's Witness in Russia since a Supreme Court decision in 2017 ruled the Christian denomination was an extremist organisation and should disband, the group said.
Shpakovskiy, who denied the charges, would appeal the decision, said his lawyer, Arly Chimirov.
The U.S.-headquartered Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject.
Jehovah's Witnesses say 30 members of their faith are currently serving time in prison or pre-trial detention in Russia, while more than 300 are under criminal investigation. 
Shpakovskiy, who was first charged in March 2019, was additionally charged with financing extremist activities later that year. 
Jarrod Lopes, a U.S.-based spokesman for the religious group, condemned Shpakovskiy's conviction.
""Today, Russia has arbitrarily imprisoned another peaceful believer, disregarding its own constitution and international human rights law,"" he said in a statement. 
""The city court's ruling is in defiance of repeated demands by the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention and other prominent international actors to stop arresting, detaining, and prosecuting Jehovah's Witnesses for their peaceful worship.""
The court did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions. The group has about 170,000 followers in Russia, and 8 million worldwide.

The government has been pressured by the tourism industry to lift a ban on foreign visitors after a strict coronavirus lockdown brought an industry that employs more than one in eight Spanish workers to a standstill.
It has now approved the islands' plan to allow tour operators TUI, Schauinsland and Der Touristik, to fly in 6,000 German tourists starting on Monday, the tourism ministry and a spokeswoman for the Balearics tourism industry FEHM said.
""What we are planning in the Balearics is to let a few thousands in. This is limited and to test the system,"" an official at the Spanish foreign ministry said.
The head of the Balearic region will give details of the plan at a news conference later on Tuesday. 
A spokeswoman for the regional government confirmed the plan aimed to let German tourists travel directly to the islands and exempt them from the two-week quarantine imposed in Spain on all overseas travellers until the end of the month.
Last week, Tourism Minister Reyes Maroto said Spain would reopen land borders on June 22, although she backed down a few hours later. 

Beyond the pilot project in the Balearics, borders are set to reopen from July 1, to and from regions which are considered to have the pandemic under control.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam warned on Tuesday that the Chinese-ruled city cannot afford further ""chaos"" as activists marked a year of pro-democracy rallies with lunchtime protests in several shopping malls. 
The global financial hub is on alert for unrest with larger gatherings planned for the evening to mark the first anniversary of a mass rally that galvanised the anti-government protest movement.
That demonstration, which drew an estimated more than one million protesters in a city of 7.5 million, was triggered by proposed legislation to allow extraditions to mainland China, where the courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
Lam later withdrew the bill but widespread concern lingered that Beijing was stifling freedoms in the former British colony which returned to China in 1997 with the promise of a high level of autonomy, sparking months of often-violent unrest.
""All of us can see the difficulty we have been through in the past year, and due to such serious situations we have more problems to deal with,"" Lam told a weekly news conference.
""We need to learn from mistakes, I wish all lawmakers can learn from mistakes - that Hong Kong cannot bear such chaos.""
Almost 9,000 people, aged between 11 and 84, were arrested in the protests over the past year, police said late on Monday. More than 600 were charged with rioting.
A 21-year-old lifeguard, the first protester to plead guilty to rioting, was sentenced to four years' jail last month.
After a lull during the coronavirus outbreak, demonstrators have returned to the streets as Beijing drafts national security laws activists fear will further undermine Hong Kong freedoms, including its much-cherished independent legal system. 
Dozens gathered in several shopping malls across Hong Kong at lunchtime, chanting slogans such as ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times,"" before dispersing peacefully after an hour.
Some held placards reading ""We can't breathe! Free HK"" and ""Young lives matter"", in a nod to the U.S. protests against police brutality sparked by the death of black American George Floyd.
""Hong Kong people are always strong,"" said 27-year-old protester Ellen, who works in finance and declined to give her full name. ""We will ... find ways to continue our fight.""
Activists were planning larger evening protests and union leaders have said they intend to hold a referendum among their members on Sunday on whether to launch a city-wide strike against the proposed national security laws.
Authorities have insisted the laws will focus on small numbers of ""troublemakers"" who pose a threat to national security and would not curb freedoms or hurt investors. Lam cautioned against the strike plans.
Police said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post they would have enough presence on the streets, warned drivers some roads may be blocked if protests materialise, and urged people not to participate in unauthorised assemblies, saying they face the risk of arrest as well as that of catching the coronavirus. 
Prominent pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said the world had witnessed ""the deteriorating situation in Hong Kong, with Beijing tightening its grip over the city's liberties"".
Washington said it would remove Hong Kong's special treatment in U.S. laws as it deemed the city to no longer be sufficiently autonomous.

The European Union, Britain and others have expressed concerns about the proposed legislation, while Beijing hit back against foreign meddling in its affairs.

Malaysia does not recognise refugee status but has been a favoured destination for ethnic Rohingya, most of them Muslims, who fled a 2017 military-led crackdown in Myanmar, and more recently, squalid refugee camps in Bangladesh.
However, the Southeast Asian nation has said it will no longer accept Rohingya refugees as it has tightened border controls to rein in the coronavirus. 
""The Rohingya should know, if they come here, they cannot stay,"" the minister, Ismail Sabri Yaakob, told reporters.
Malaysia's foreign ministry will ask Dhaka to take back the detained migrants if they were found to have fled camps in Bangladesh's district of Cox's Bazar, he added. 
On Monday, authorities arrested 269 Rohingya and retrieved the body of a woman from a damaged boat near the Malaysian island of Langkawi, off its northwestern coast. 
Malaysia may ask for the migrants to be placed on the island of Bhasan Char, where Bangladesh had earlier planned to re-settle Rohingya refugees, added Ismail Sabri. 
Malaysia also plans to ask United Nations refugee agency UNHCR to re-settle Rohingya migrants in a third country.
In Dhaka, a senior foreign ministry official said the refugees were the responsibility of Myanmar.
""Why don’t they ask Myanmar to take them back?"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""Secondly, they are the responsibility of the country where they ended up. Bangladesh has nothing to do with them.""
UNHCR officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The numbers, published after a weekend in which tens of thousands of people filled Europe's streets protesting in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, highlight how institutional racism and discrimination are far from unique to the United States.
According to the agency's annual report, published on Tuesday, the number of complaints of racism the agency's advice line received rose 10% to 1,176.
In complaints to the German agency, a hairdresser described a client shouting a racial slur across the salon to demand service from the person who normally massages her head.
A schoolchild wrote: ""A child insulted my brother at school because he has a dark skin colour. Then he hit him. The teacher watched it all but did nothing.""
Bernhard Franke, the agency's head, told a news conference that police were ""not as free of discrimination as some of us would like to believe.
""We have seen 200 cases of racial profiling, of people who have been stopped by police purely because of their appearance,"" Franke said.
Only half Germany's federal states had created their own anti-discrimination agencies - an institutional shortcoming that hindered the fight against racism, he said.

Partly because of its World War Two history of genocide, Germany has long been on its guard against neo-Nazi violence, such as a gun attack on a synagogue last year, in which two passers-by died. Other forms of racism have received less attention.

The 1:21 minute clip, which NHK had also broadcast on its Sunday evening programme ""Sekai no Ima"" (""The World Now""), featured a tough-talking black narrator citing the wealth disparity between black and white Americans and the economic impact from the coronavirus. 
But it made no mention of police brutality or the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after being pinned by the neck for nine minutes by a white officer's knee, which sparked the latest protests.
In the clip, the narrator's bodybuilder-like muscles were bursting out of a white tank top, while other African-American characters included a man with an afro and mutton chop sideburns, and a muscular man in a sleeveless purple suit, fedora-style hat and sandals strumming a guitar.
""While we understand @NHK's intent to address complex racial issues in the United States, it's unfortunate that more thought and care didn't go into this video,"" the interim head of the U.S. embassy in Tokyo, Joseph M. Young, said on Twitter. ""The caricatures used are offensive and insensitive.""
NHK said it had decided to take down the tweet after receiving a lot of criticism and that it had posted the video with a ""lack of consideration"".
""We apologise to those who were made to feel uncomfortable,"" the broadcaster said on Twitter.
The video had been viewed more than one million times as of midday Tuesday on the programme's @nhk_sekaima Twitter account.

AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND: Borders are effectively closed except for returning citizens and residents, who are quarantined for 14 days. The two countries have talked about a possible ""travel bubble"" between them but New Zealand has said that is unlikely to happen while travel between Australian states remains restricted. A travel bubble may include Pacific Islands.
CHINA: Citizens can return, but the entry of most foreigners, including those with valid visas and residence permits, remains suspended.
It has, however, signed a fast-track programme with South Korea and Singapore to allow essential business travel and is in talks with more countries to do so.
It has also allowed foreign executives and technical personnel from some other nations to enter on pre-approved charter flights, sometimes with reduced quarantine, to accelerate the resumption of business. 
INDIA: Borders are effectively closed as coronavirus cases have surged to over 267,000. India said this week it will take a call on resuming international flights as soon as countries ease restrictions on foreign nationals.
INDONESIA: Citizens and long-term pass holders may enter, but must bring documents showing they are free of the coronavirus or undergo tests at the airport. The country is opening up domestic travel from Wednesday with safety and quarantine measures.
JAPAN: The country is considering an easing of travel curbs, although it is likely to require testing and the submission of a travel itinerary, local media https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2020/06/892041b57919-japan-to-require-virus-testing-itinerary-in-travel-restriction-easing.html reported. It is in talks with some countries to reopen borders, with business travellers and medical staff expected to be fast-tracked.

897,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 09, 2020 05:15AM ET</span>",Czech Senate speaker to visit Taiwan in trip that could irk China,"PRAGUE (Reuters) - The speaker of the Czech upper house of parliament is to travel to Taiwan with a trade mission at the end of August, potentially further souring his country's relations with China which regards the island as a part of its territory.
The Czech Republic adheres to the one China policy, like most countries, but unofficial ties with Taiwan exist, mainly in business and science.
Any visit would infuriate Beijing, which views Taiwan as merely a Chinese province with no right to state-to-state relations and routinely denounces any formal interactions between foreign governments and the island.
For Taiwan, it would be a valuable show of international support at a time when China has ramped up pressure on Taiwan to get it to accept Chinese sovereignty.
Milos Vystrcil's decision follows a plan to visit Taipei by his predecessor as Senate speaker, Jaroslav Kubera. Kubera died in January before he could make the trip but was under pressure from China and the Czech presidency to drop the idea.
A document sent by China's Embassy in Prague to the Czech president's office in January suggested that Czech companies operating in mainland China, such as Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) subsidiary Skoda Auto or lender Home Credit, would suffer if Kubera visited the self-ruled island.
Vystrcil, member of the centre-right opposition, said on Tuesday he was motivated by business development and the country's tradition of human rights policies. 
""We will either stick to our principles or count pennies. I am leaning toward keeping our values and principles,"" he told a news conference.
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou expressed her ""sincere welcome"" to Vystrcil. The Chinese Embassy in Prague did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Vystrcil's trip would also irk Czech President Milos Zeman, who has for years tried to build up warm relations with China.
But fizzled investments, Czech cybersecurity warnings over using Huawei and a Prague mayor who defied China signing a sister-city agreement with Taipei instead of Beijing have dented the relationship.

The Ministry of Education's warning came days after the Chinese culture and tourism ministry advised citizens against travelling to Australia due to racial discrimination and violence stemming from the coronavirus outbreak, which first emerged in China in late 2019.
The education ministry made a statement advising overseas students ""to conduct a good risk assessment and be cautious about choosing to go to Australia or return to Australia to study"". 
Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said Australia had established processes to stamp out racism.
""We're a country that has zero tolerance (towards racism),"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""Not zero incidents, I understand that, but I think the idea that Australia, in any way, is an unsafe destination for visitors to come to is one that just does not stand up to scrutiny.""
Relations between Australia and China have become strained since the Australian government proposed an international inquiry into how the COVID-19 outbreak in China became a global pandemic.
The Sydney Morning Herald newspaper reported on Sunday a survey conducted by the Per Capita think tank had documented 386 racist incidents - ranging from abuse to physical intimidation and spitting - since April 2.
China has imposed tariffs on Australian barley imports and blocked some beef imports, though Beijing has denied its actions are connected to the COVID-19 dispute.
Australia has also spoken out over China's proposed national security laws for Hong Kong, which critics say undermines freedom in the former British colony. 
The Australian dollar slipped further on Tuesday on the Chinese education ministry's warning, falling 1% to $0.6951.
About 10% of university students in Australia are from China, and deliver the industry about A$12 billion a year in fees.
Universities Australia declined to comment on the warning, saying it was a matter for the governments of Australia and China.

Han Kuo-yu from the main opposition party the Kuomintang, or KMT, lost Saturday's recall vote by a huge margin, though he had called on his supporters to boycott it. Han was the party's presidential candidate in January, and also lost by a wide margin.
""I respect the will of the people, and will not lodge a lawsuit,"" Han said in a statement.
If he had contested the vote it would have delayed the election of his replacement, which should now happen within the next three months. 
Han, who was criticised for taking time off to run for president and neglecting Kaohsiung, cannot stand, having lost the recall.
Opponents portray Han and the KMT as doing China's bidding by supporting Beijing's ""one country, two systems"" model to get Taiwan to accept Chinese sovereignty. The KMT says it has never supported this.
Han last year visited China and met its top Taiwan-policy maker and met in Hong Kong with its leader Carrie Lam before the Chinese-ruled city was engulfed in anti-China protests. He has said of those trips that he was simply trying to drum up investment for Taiwan.
The KMT is in the midst of an overhaul having lost January's elections, especially on how to rethink its unpopular policy of seeking closer ties with China, which claims Taiwan as its own and has never renounced the use of force to win control.
The KMT also has to decide who to stand in the Kaohsiung mayoral election, though it has rebuffed speculation its youthful new chairman Johnny Chiang might contest the seat.

Kaohsiung, Taiwan's third-largest city and a major international port, is traditionally a stronghold for the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party.

A statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from trading West African slaves, was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour on Sunday by a group of demonstrators taking part in a wave of protests following the death of George Floyd in the United States.
Khan said a commission would review statues, plaques and street names which largely reflect the rapid expansion of London's wealth and power at the height of Britain's empire in the reign of Queen Victoria.
""Our capital’s diversity is our greatest strength, yet our statues, road names and public spaces reflect a bygone era,"" Khan said. He said some statues would be removed. 
""It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored.""
In the biggest deportation in known history, weapons and gunpowder from Europe were swapped for millions of African slaves who were then shipped across the Atlantic to the Americas. Ships returned to Europe with sugar, cotton and tobacco.
As many as 17 million African men, women and children were torn from their homes and shackled into one of the world's most brutal globalized trades between the 15th and 19th centuries. Many died in merciless conditions.

Those who survived endured a life of subjugation on sugar, tobacco and cotton plantations. Britain abolished the trans-Atlantic slave trade in 1807 although the full abolition of slavery did not follow for another generation.

President John Magufuli, nicknamed ""the Bulldozer"", swept to power in 2015 promising an end to corruption. But he has been accused of curbing human rights including limiting freedom of expression and cracking down on leading opposition figures.
Mbowe, who is the leader of the opposition in parliament and chairman of the CHADEMA party, was set upon by the assailants as he was returning home just after midnight, party officials said. 
""Unknown people surrounded him and assaulted him before he started taking the stairs. Though these people had carried firearms, they didn't use them,"" said CHADEMA's Secretary General, John Mnyika.
Mbowe, who along with other opposition lawmakers was found guilty of sedition in March, was rushed to a hospital in the administrative capital Dodoma, where he was receiving treatment, Mnyika said, without giving more details.`
Dodoma's police commander Gilesi Muroto was not immediately available for a comment. There was also no immediate comment from the government.
Tanzania's ruling CCM party, and its predecessor TANU, have governed since independence from Britain in 1961.
Mbowe, who unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in the 2005 election, has not declared whether he will be a candidate in the October polls.

His deputy in CHADEMA, Tundu Lissu, has offered himself as a candidate in the presidential election. Lissu has been living in exile in Europe after he narrowly escaped assassination by unknown gunmen in Dodoma, back in September 2017.

Adama Traore was celebrating his 24th birthday on July 19, 2016, when three police officers used their weight to restrain him. By the time he arrived at the police station, he was unconscious and could not be revived.
Medical experts differ on whether Traore died because of the restraint or because of an underlying medical condition.
His family and their supporters have demanded that the officers involved be held to account. No one has been charged.
""The Traore family reiterates that it wants legal progress, and not an invitation to talks which won't lead to any procedural purpose,"" the campaign group, ""Truth for Adama"", said in a statement.
The group called for a mass protest in central Paris on Saturday. It said the offer of talks with the minister was received through its lawyer.
Worldwide anger over the killing of Floyd, including in France, has given new momentum to the Traore family's campaign. 
Thousands of people marched in Paris last Saturday to mark Traore's death and in solidarity with U.S. protesters. 

Accusations of brutality and racism against French police remain largely unaddressed, rights groups say. President Emmanuel Macron's government on Monday said it was banning a chokehold used to detain suspects and promised zero tolerance for racism among police.

Swedes hope to find out,"STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Thirty-four years after Prime Minister Olof Palme was killed, Swedes hope finally to find out who shot him dead as he walked home from a cinema with his wife and son. 
Prosecutor Krister Petersson will on Wednesday present the conclusions of the investigation he took over in 2017 into Palme's murder on a busy Stockholm street shortly before midnight on Feb. 28, 1986.
The failure to solve the case, despite Sweden's biggest ever manhunt, has long caused unease in a nation that prides itself on its openness and tolerance.
""It is an open wound for Sweden in that we do not know what happened,"" Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said in February.
When Petersson took charge of the investigation, few expected him to make progress. 
But in February, he said he hoped the case could be solved and that he was close to wrapping up the investigation though there might not be a prosecution - a remark that could mean the suspected killer is dead. 
The comment focused attention on one suspect - a graphic designer known as ""Skandia-man"" who is known to have been present at the scene of the murder and died in 2000.
Skandia-man's former wife told the daily Aftonbladet in 2018 she was convinced he was not the killer. Reuters could not immediately contact her.
Palme, a Social Democrat, was prime minister between 1969 and 1976 and between 1982 and 1986. Some hail him as the architect of modern Sweden but conservatives hated his anti-colonial views and criticism of the United States.
His murder, at the age of 59, led to numerous conspiracy theories, none of which has been proved true.

The police were widely accused of bungling the initial investigation. A petty criminal was found guilty in 1989 of Palme's murder but was be freed on appeal and died in 2004.

Authorities have carried out a sustained crackdown on alleged followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen since the failed coup in July 2016, when 250 people were killed.
Gulen denies any involvement. The former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999.
The police operation was coordinated from the western city of Izmir and targeted people in 22 provinces, Anadolu said. The police have already detained 145 of the suspects, it said.
The suspects, mostly on active duty, were believed to have communicated to other Gulen followers through pay phones and to have received advantages in admission to military schools, Anadolu said.
In a separate operation, police detained 16 military personnel the southeastern city Diyarbakir over the weekend, security sources said. On Tuesday, a local court jailed six of them pending trial and freed 10 others, the sources added.
Turkey's Western allies have criticised the scale of the crackdown, while Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the security threat. 
Erdogan has for years accused Gulen's supporters of establishing a ""parallel state"" by infiltrating the police, judiciary, military and other state institutions.
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended.

The National Steering Committee for COVID-19 Prevention and Control had been asked to draft a list of ""safe"" countries, the prime minister said. 
He did not say whether countries or airlines had been consulted, but said destinations such as Guangzhou in China, Tokyo, Seoul, Taiwan, Laos and Cambodia were among the priority routes to reopen.
Vietnam on Monday reported three new coronavirus infections, all of which were imported cases.
The Southeast Asian country has gone 54 days without a domestically transmitted infection.

Vietnam has suspended international flights since March 25 with some exceptions and banned the entry of foreign nationals since March 22 in an effort to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealanders hugged and kissed, shopped, and planned parties on Tuesday as the country took off all coronavirus restrictions for the first time in more than three months, while much of the rest of the world is still grappling with the pandemic.
The South Pacific nation of 5 million declared on Monday that it was free of the coronavirus, becoming one of the first countries in the world to return to pre-pandemic normality.
This meant no more limits on people in cafes, malls, stadiums, night clubs or public and private gatherings. Life, for the most part, is back to normal.
""I'm just walking in the city today and I've seen more people than I have seen in months,"" said Steve Price of the capital, Wellington. 
""People are shopping, dining and just hanging about holding hands... it's so lovely to see,"" he said.
New Zealanders are emerging from the pandemic while big economies such as Brazil, Britain, India and the United States continue to struggle with the virus.
Its largely due months of restrictions, including about seven weeks of a strict lockdown in which most businesses were shut and everyone except essential workers had to stay home.
Katy Ellis of Mojo Coffee in Wellington said her business has removed all the social distancing measures. 
""That's what allows us to have a lot more people in the café, it's really helped generate that absolute buzz and that real feeling of more normality, really,"" Ellis said.
Offices were open again, and public buses and trains were packed with commuters. 
Many offices and businesses still have hand sanitiser dispensers at the entrance, although it is no longer mandatory to use them.
Pubs are opening their dance floors and are expecting many to turn up on Friday.
""I just realised....I can hug someone today,"" said one user on Twitter as #COVIDFreeNZ was trending. 
New Zealand will also be one of the first countries to allow people to watch professional sports at stadiums with no limits on crowd numbers. Thousands are expected to pack into a stadiums for the opening weekend of the domestic rugby union competition.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who has won praise for her leadership during the pandemic, said on Monday that she did a ""little dance"" to celebrate zero active cases in the country.
Her health chief, Ashley Bloomfield, who spearheaded the strict lockdown, said it was time to live a little. 
""It's about buying local, getting out and enjoying everything this country has to offer,"" he told reporters in Wellington.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Medical sector worker Tana has attended peaceful lunchtime rallies in Hong Kong regularly for months along with thousands of others protesting Beijing's influence and calling for greater democracy in the global financial hub.
Now, a year on from a mass rally that kicked off a large scale and often violent anti-government movement, 37-year-old Tana and her husband fear not enough has changed. 
The protests succeeded in forcing a backdown by the Hong Kong government on proposed legislation that would have allowed extradition to mainland China. But a year later, authorities in Beijing are drafting national security laws that activists fear would further curb freedoms. 
For Tana and her family, including a son born just before the protests began, pragmatism is beginning to trump idealism.
""I am most worried about my child,"" Tana told Reuters, requesting her surname be withheld for security reasons. The family has already shifted their savings abroad, she said, and ""emigration might be an option.""
Among supporters of the protest movement, feelings range from slim hope to acute fear of oppression. After a relative respite during the coronavirus outbreak, protesters are again taking to the streets against the proposed security laws. Officials have said the laws would target a small number of ""troublemakers"" with provisions against secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference.
Ng, a retired 63-year-old woman is among those looking back at the past year with pride and pledges to keep demonstrating. 
""A single spark can start a huge blaze,"" she said, also requesting she be identified by one name only. ""The more the government suppresses us, the more resisting we become.""
David, 22, who works in insurance and declined to give his surname, said a mix of violent and peaceful tactics was needed for international attention.
David said he ""sometimes felt overwhelmed with fear"" when he helped at rallies by mixing petrol bombs and disabling tear gas canisters, but he felt compelled to continue.
Demonstrations have often turned violent, with protesters blocking roads, vandalising shops perceived to have pro-Beijing links and throwing bricks and molotovs at the police, who have responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
Isaiah Choy, who studies in Britain but came back last year to take part in peaceful protests, said violent tactics should be abandoned. The 21-year-old said he is frustrated with Hong Kong being treated as a ""pawn"" in U.S.- China conflicts. 
Washington, which has traded barbs with Beijing over trade, the coronavirus pandemic and other issues, says China has quashed the high degree of autonomy that Hong Kong was promised for at least 50 years when it returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing has dismissed the claim and urged Washington not to meddle. 
MUTUAL DESTRUCTION
The protests have strong support among Hong Kong's 7.5 million people, according to opinion polls, with about one third of the population opposed.
Keung, 50, said he supported national security laws and hoped the pro-democracy movement ""will end soon because evil can never prevail over good.""
""It is normal for the government to set up laws to tighten its grip when people are violating the previous ones,"" Keung, who also gave one name only, told Reuters. 
Others vow to continue to protest for as long as it takes.
Sixty-four-year-old retiree Fu has embraced the often chanted slogan ""if we burn, you burn with us,"" referring to the belief that as a magnet for global capital, Hong Kong is the goose that lays the golden eggs for the mainland economy.

Fu said he has lost many childhood friends because of his position, but he has no regrets: ""I am a die hard fan of mutual destruction and Hong Kong independence.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - Clad in black, Beijing's city inspectors descended on street vendors this week and ordered them to clear out, just days after the Chinese premier had sparked a rush to set up curbside stalls by praising them as a creator of jobs in the coronavirus-hit economy.
Wang Yihu, 50, a home decorator whose business has dried up after the COVID-19 pandemic, was in despair.
""The premier has already given us support. The power of the Beijing city government couldn't be stronger than the State Council right?"" Wang said as he packed away tens of toy cars in anticipation of being chased away.
""The premier's words are always skewed by you local-level people,"" Wang said heatedly within earshot of some inspectors.
""We've lost our basic right to feed our families!""
Deemed by city officials as filthy and unsightly, street stalls made an unexpected comeback last week after Premier Li Keqiang said on a visit to Shandong province that roadside vendors provided vitality to China.
Days earlier, Li cited media reports about a certain city in western China that created 100,000 jobs overnight after setting up 36,000 street stalls. Up to 30 million people may lose their jobs this year due to the pandemic, some economists say.
But the State Council, or cabinet, has yet to announce any new policy in support of roadside vending. 
Beijing Daily, a newspaper run by the city government, said over the weekend that letting the street market economy proliferate will harm the image of the Chinese capital. 
The Beijing city government declined to make any additional comments. 
""Premier Li's words in Shandong were more of an improvisation, not an official report,"" said Liu Shengjun, an independent commentator on the economy. 
""What he didn't say but would naturally imply was that the street stall economy must be well regulated too"".
JOB LOSSES
The resistance towards street vendors widened on Monday as state television cautioned tier-one cities - traditionally Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen - against chasing short-term employment solutions. 
Among them only Guangzhou has unveiled new policies promoting street vending.
Guangzhou on Friday specified 60 locations in the city where street stalls can be set up. It also imposed restrictions on merchandise type. 
The street stall economy is more suitable in central and western cities, some state media said.
Preventing mass unemployment remains a top concern for the Chinese leadership, with President Xi Jinping pledging to turn China into a moderately prosperous society and eliminate abject poverty by the end of 2020. 
Beijing street vendors told Reuters they were desperate to boost their incomes. 
One was struggling with her rent and her son's mortgage, while a former jeweller with 100,000 yuan ($14,126) of unsold inventories at home was peddling 150-yuan Thai elephant brooches.
Yan Ying was selling black tea marketed by a company she was working for. 
The 30-year-old has not received any wages since February, and if she fails to sell the tea, she will be fired.
""Even though the inspectors chased me away, I'll find other places,"" said Yan, who works part-time at Decathlon in the day.
""Reality is very cruel.""

The Su-30 fighters, some of China's most advanced jets, were given verbal warnings to leave and Taiwanese air force jets ""drove away"" the intruders, ministry added.
Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.
China says such exercises are nothing unusual.
China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China's most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan becoming independent.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist bent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait.
A U.S. C-40A, a military version of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737, had entered Taiwanese air space with permission, though it did not land at any Taiwanese airports, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said in a separate statement on Tuesday.
The U.S. aircraft took off from Japan's Okinawa island, where there is a major U.S. air base, and flew over northern and western Taiwan on its way to Southeast Asia, Taiwanese media reported.
While Washington and Taipei have no formal diplomatic ties, the United States is Taiwan's strongest international supporter and main arms supplier, becoming another source of U.S.-China tension.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - The killing of an indigenous Maya healer, who was set ablaze by a mob in rural Guatemala after he was accused of being a witch, was strongly condemned on Monday by the country's president and human rights organizations.
Domingo Choc, a 56-year-old practitioner of traditional Maya medicine, died on Saturday after several members of his own Q'eqchi' community accused him of using witchcraft to kill a man who had died in a local hospital several days earlier, according to a statement from the national police. 
President Alejandro Giammattei, a medical doctor, wrote on his Twitter page that he was asking Guatemalan prosecutors to bring those responsible for Choc's ""murder"" to justice.
A 28-second video clip shared online shows Choc running in a field as flames engulf his entire body, a plume of black smoke above him. Some onlookers, including families with children, can be seen recording the grisly scene on their phones.
While acts of violence against Guatemala's Maya communities are not common, many community members complain about persistent racism and discrimination directed toward them. 
Choc was a member of the Releb'aal Saq'e' spiritual association which is made up of Maya healers and has worked with researchers in Guatemala as well as the University of Zurich and University College London.
Jose Che, a leader with Releb'aal Saq'e', said in a phone interview that the association works to revive traditional Maya spirituality, which he said has nothing to do with witchcraft.
""We want justice to be done,"" said Che. ""This is not normal. It's an inhumane act.""
He said that members of one family may be responsible for the crime, and called for an end to the persecution of indigenous healers for simply practicing their traditional beliefs. 
In a brief statement, Guatemalan human rights organization UDEFEGUA demanded the ""prompt arrest of those responsible ... for this crime of hate and fanaticism.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday it will sever hotlines with South Korea as the first step toward shutting down all contact with Seoul, state news agency KCNA reported.
For several days, North Korea has lashed out at South Korea, threatening to close an inter-Korean liaison office and other projects if the South does not stop defectors from sending leaflets and other material into the North.
Top government officials in North Korea, including leader Kim Jong Un's sister, Kim Yo Jong, and Kim Yong Chol, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, determined ""that the work towards the South should thoroughly turn into the one against an enemy,"" KCNA said.
As a first step, at noon on Tuesday, North Korea will close lines of communication at an inter-Korean liaison office, and hotlines between the two militaries and presidential offices, the report said.
On Tuesday morning, North Korean officials did not answer a routine daily call to the liaison office, nor calls on military hotlines, a South Korean defence ministry spokeswoman told a briefing.
The routine calls between South and North Korea should be maintained as they are basic means of communication, said the South's unification ministry, responsible for inter-Korean affairs.
The ministry said it will continue to follow the agreed principles and strive for peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula.
On Monday morning, North Korea did not answer the liaison phone call for the first time since 2018, though it later answered an afternoon call.
The decision to cut communications marks a setback in relations amid efforts to try and persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for relief on tough international sanctions. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.
Shares of South Korea's defence firms surged after North Korea announced it would sever the hotlines.
Analysts said the move is likely about more than the defectors, as North Korea is under increasing economic pressure as the coronavirus crisis and international sanctions take their toll.
""North Korea is in a much more dire situation than we think,"" said Choo Jae-woo, a professor at Kyung Hee University ""I think they are trying to squeeze something out of the South.""
Cutting communications is ""a well-worn play for Pyongyang,"" but one that can be dangerous, Daniel Wertz, of the U.S.-based National Committee on North Korea, said on Twitter. 
""Regular communication channels are needed most during a crisis, and for that reason North Korea cuts them off to create an atmosphere of heightened risk,"" he said.
The people of North Korea have ""been angered by the treacherous and cunning behaviour of the South Korean authorities, with whom we still have lots of accounts to settle,"" KCNA said.
The report accused South Korean authorities of irresponsibly allowing defectors to hurt the dignity of North Korea's supreme leadership.

""We have reached a conclusion that there is no need to sit face to face with the South Korean authorities and there is no issue to discuss with them, as they have only aroused our dismay,"" KCNA said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for the former Green Beret and son wanted by Japan for helping former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co boss Carlos Ghosn flee the country on Monday argued U.S. authorities wrongly arrested them for aiding a crime that they say does not exist in Japan: bail jumping. 
Lawyers for Michael Taylor and his son, Peter Taylor, in a motion asked a federal judge in Boston to quash the U.S. warrants issued last month for their arrests or release them on bail while their extradition case proceeds.
U.S. authorities arrested the Taylors in May at Japan's request for allegedly smuggling Ghosn out of the country in a box while he was out on bail awaiting trial on financial charges.
Their lawyers on Monday argued that neither bail jumping nor helping someone do so are crimes in Japan.
The defense attorneys said that fact is ""so far beyond dispute that the Japanese government has begun considering whether it should amend the law to make such conduct a crime.""
While Japan has issued arrest warrants for the Taylors, their lawyers said the crime stated in the Japanese warrants is an immigration offense, a non-extraditable misdemeanor.
The lawyers added that neither Taylor, including Michael, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran who founded a private security company, pose a flight risk requiring them to be held without bail.
The Justice Department and Japanese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.
U.S. authorities arrested the Taylors in Harvard, Massachusetts, on May 20 at the request of Japan, which in January issued arrest warrants for both men in connection with facilitating the Dec. 29, 2019 escape.
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, while he was awaiting trial on charges that he engaged in financial wrongdoing, including by understating his compensation in Nissan's financial statements. He denies wrongdoing.

Turkey supports the internationally recognised government of Fayez al Serraj, whose forces have in recent weeks driven back an assault on the capital Tripoli by the forces of Khalifa Haftar, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
""A new era between Turkey and the US may start after our phone call. We agreed on some issues,"" Erdogan said in an interview with state broadcaster TRT, without offering specifics.
A White House statement said Trump and Erdogan discussed the war in the north African country, as well as Syria and the wider eastern Mediterranean region, but gave no details.
Egypt had called for a ceasefire starting on Monday, as part of an initiative which also proposed an elected leadership council for Libya. Haftar's other supporters, Russia and the UAE, also welcomed the proposal.
But Erdogan, whose support for Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) helped change the course of the war, said the GNA would continue fighting to seize the coastal city of Sirte and the Jufra air base further south, in a strategic region of the oil exporting country.
""Now the goal is to take over the whole Sirte area and get it done. These are areas with the oil wells, these are of great importance,"" he said.
Erdogan said he would also discuss Moscow's role in Libya with President Vladimir Putin, including what he said was the supply of Russian planes and Pantsir air defences to Haftar's forces.

""They have Pantsirs there, they sent 19 warplanes to Libya,"" Erdogan said. ""After talking with him, we can plan ahead.""

TORONTO (Reuters) - The first black police chief of Toronto, Canada's largest city, abruptly announced his retirement on Monday, saying he would step down nearly a year early on July 31, just days after kneeling with protesters calling for police reform.
Mark Saunders said he plans to spend more time with his family and also hoped to work on community initiatives ""near and dear"" to him after a period of time.
Toronto's city council voted in August 2019 to extend Saunders' contract to April 2021.
Last week, Sanders knelt with protesters demonstrating against police brutality and decrying the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in custody of Minneapolis police.
He told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation last week that Floyd's death left him with a ""horrible feeling"" in his stomach.
""It still bothers me,"" he said. ""That is not what law enforcement is trained to do.""
Saunders has been with the Toronto Police Service for 37 years, holding the role of police chief since 2015.
""Working in homicide... I see a lot of young black boys getting killed by young black boys,"" Saunders told reporters on Monday. ""Law enforcement deals with those symptoms and I want to help the cure of the disease.""
Saunders, who suffered from kidney disease and underwent a transplant in 2017, said health was not a factor in his decision to retire.
Toronto Mayor John Tory said Saunders had told him of his plans to retire last week.

""We will continue to see the benefits of his work on modernization and culture change for years to come,"" Tory said in a statement.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement on Monday warned commercial and maritime industries, governments and others that they risked U.S. sanctions if they did business with the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines (IRISL) and its Shanghai-based subsidiary, E-Sail Shipping Company.
The State Department had announced the designations in December but allowed a delay for them to take effect, giving time for exporters of humanitarian goods to Iran to find different shipping methods, according to the statement.
""These designations serve as a clear warning that anyone doing business with or otherwise supporting IRISL or E-Sail are exposed to potential sanctions and risk contributing to Iran’s proliferation-sensitive programs, including its nuclear and missile programs,"" Pompeo said in the statement.
He also asked governments around the world to investigate activity by the shipping entities in their ports and seas, encouraging them to take appropriate action to stop the activity. 
The State Department accused IRISL of repeatedly transporting items related to Iran's ballistic missile and military programs, as well as other proliferation-sensitive items.

In December, Pompeo said E-Sail Shipping Company ""knowingly transports illicit materials from Iran's Aerospace Industries Organization, which oversees all of Iran's missile industry"" and has worked with Iranian organizations subject to U.N. sanctions.

Reuters interviewed five people in five countries about why they had taken to the streets in recent days and what they hoped to achieve. Here is what they said:
LONDON: Stedroy Cabey, a 30-year-old actor, who spoke while surrounded by hundreds of noisy protesters at the weekend:
""As a black man it feels like your skin is a weapon. It feels like for some reason they feel like you're a threat and you don't understand why because you've never done anything to do that. Personally I haven't done anything.
""When I first moved to the UK there was an incident where ... me and my cousin were on the bus and (a stranger) started looking at us in a weird way. When he got off the bus he ran up to us, he was like 'go back to where you came from, you don't belong here'. And I was speechless in that moment. I was a young boy, a young man coming from the Caribbean ... for a better life ... It was like wow. It reminded me that racism is actually real.""
PARIS: Bokar Ture, a U.S. citizen and economist living in Paris, addressing his small daughter whom he held in his arms:
    ""I said that there are some people who might think less of us because we're black, but we know that's not true, right? We know that we're just as smart, just as intelligent, and you're just as beautiful as anyone, OK? ... It doesn't matter what other people think. OK? So you're proud of yourself, OK? You can achieve anything you want and the colour of your skin, if other people are stupid enough to think that it should be a barrier, let them be stupid. You be smart, OK?""
BRUSSELS: Pauline Sobze, 17, a high school student living in Ath, western Belgium.
""The reason why I come here to protest (was) because as you can see (from) the colour of my skin, it can happen to me, it can happen to my family, my friends. And it's important for me to come here because we ... have to be together to protest for the things that matter to us.""
MADRID: U.S. national Frank Bradford, who now lives in Madrid, speaking through a face mask:
""I grew up in America's south, Mississippi. It has one of the darkest histories of racism and I've seen it on a day-to-day basis, growing up in school, the university, at work and I think it's a major problem that we have to deal with.""
    ""I have seen it around day-to-day like in the grocery store or supermarket, on the street. It's been something challenging. Also I'm a teacher, so I see it at the school a little bit and I try to correct students and try to teach them a better way, to recognise racism and fight against it.""
LOS ANGELES: K.C. Coleman, a 55-year-old former police officer from Inglewood, California.
    ""I am protesting today because I'm a bi-racial woman. I have faced racism in my life. As an ex-police officer I faced racism, and now it's time for a change. So, I'm here to support the cause for justice for all, freedom for all, equal rights for all.

""I am very optimistic about the protests and (them) leading to change, because at first it was just the black and the minorities that were out here but now you have a nation that's all coming together as one. So, as I go out to these protests, it's not just the African-Americans that are out here, it's everyone out here so we're finally united as one. So change is definitely coming and I'm feeling extremely positive about the change.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - Relatives of victims and activist groups called on Monday for the top United Nations human rights body to launch an investigation into ""police violence and repression of protests"" in the United States.
The joint letter calling for a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council was sent to its 47 member states. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), and World Organisation against Torture (OMCT) were among some 600 groups that signed.
The Geneva forum, which is due to meet from June 15, can hold a special session if requested by one-third of its members. The United States quit the forum two years ago alleging an anti-Israel bias.
The letter was endorsed by the brother and son of George Floyd, the unarmed African American who died in handcuffs on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The police officer, who appeared in court on Monday, has been charged with second-degree and third-degree murder as well as second-degree manslaughter.
The death of Floyd, 46, was ""only one of a recent string of unlawful killings of unarmed black people by police and armed white vigilantes,"" the letter said.
""We are deeply concerned about the escalation in violent police responses to largely peaceful protests in the United States, which included the use of rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray and in some cases live ammunition, in violation of international standards on the use of force and management of assemblies,"" it said.
The groups voiced concern that ""rather than using his position to serve as a force for calm and unity, President Trump has chosen to weaponize the tensions through his rhetoric"". They also denounced the deployment of more than 60,000 National Guard members in two dozen states.
Recent police killings of unarmed black people as well as police use of excessive force violate U.S. obligations under major international human rights treaties, they said, calling for the right to peaceful assembly and protest to be protected.

The rights council should launch an independent inquiry into ""racist policing in cities across the country that continues with seeming impunity"" since the killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri in Aug 2014, and allegations of excessive use of force against peaceful protesters and journalists since Floyd's murder, they said.

The strikes hit villages in the Jabal al-Zawiya region in the southern part of Idlib province and two towns in the Sahel al-Ghab plain, west of Hama province, witnesses said.
Hundreds of civilians fled, fearing a wider resumption of air strikes in Syria's last rebel bastion, the witnesses said. 
The deal brokered in March between Russia, which backs Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces, and Turkey, which supports opposition fighters, ended fighting that had displaced over a million people in three months in the region which borders Turkey.
But the deal holds less sway over hardline jihadists who control large parts of Idlib province.
Civil defence groups said two civilians and several others were injured in strikes conducted by Russian jets that flew at high altitudes, according to a network of plane spotters who document sightings of jet fighters.
Mainstream opposition sources said they suspected the strikes were against militant hideouts in parts of territory where Ankara has now established a major military presence since the Russian-backed Syrian army offensive began in earnest earlier this year. 
A Syrian army source told state media that militants attacked two army outposts in the Sahel al-Ghab plain and seized them, but were later repelled. It did not refer to any aerial strikes.

The death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 has triggered demonstrations across the world calling for racism to be stamped out and in particular for better oversight of police.
Castaner's reforms include ditching a controversial chokehold method of arrest.
""Racism has no place in our society and even less in our Republican police. I will not let the hateful actions of some stigmatise all. I refuse to say that the (police) institution is racist, but yes some policemen are racists,"" he said.
On Saturday, thousands of people marched in Paris to mark the 2016 death of Adama Traore, a 24-year old black Frenchman, in a police operation some have likened to Floyd's death.
""French police are not American police"" said Castaner, who stressed that ""nobody must risk his life during an arrest,""

Castaner said the chokehold arrest would no longer be taught in police schools, that a police officer could now be suspended on suspicion of racism and that the use of body cameras would be beefed up.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's reported plan to remove 9,500 troops from Germany is the latest move to rattle his NATO allies but, even if they are pulled out, America's military footprint in Europe would still be large enough to deter Russia.
Some 50,000 U.S. military personnel backed by billions of dollars of U.S. investment would remain across Europe and, as a senior U.S. official said on Friday, the large contingent in Germany is in any case less critical now thanks to increased military spending by other NATO countries.
While the decision has caused consternation in Germany - one lawmaker there said it would shake ""the pillars of the transatlantic relationship"" - it will not deflect NATO from its core task of shielding Europe's eastern flank from Russia.
Experts noted that a troop withdrawal would take time, some may be moved to Poland, in closer proximity to Russia, and the plan could even be reversed if Trump loses his bid for a second term in November's election. 
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg spoke to Trump by telephone on Monday, although the alliance chief declined to comment directly on whether he discussed any changes in troop numbers. 
""We discussed, as we almost always do, the U.S. presence in Europe,"" the chief of the 30-nation defence alliance told Reuters by telephone. ""The U.S. presence in Europe has increased over the last years and this is more than Germany,"" he said, citing Poland, the Baltics, Spain, Norway and the Black Sea.
NATO allies are now used to Trump's unpredictability: he has often questioned the value of the alliance and branded as ""delinquent"" those countries that spend the least on defence.
""It seems to me very hard to see much of this getting done in a hurry,"" said Nick Witney, an analyst at the European Council of Foreign Relations think tank, commenting on the plan to withdraw U.S. troops. 
""SADDENING""
""I think that's another reason why the initial reaction in Europe will be 'yeah, well, it's Trump'. It's another dead cat thrown onto the political table to distract,"" he said, referring to criticism of Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and protests over racial injustice in the United States.
The reported U.S. decision, even if not yet confirmed, shocked policymakers in Berlin. ""We're not yet at divorce. But we're already at a much lower level of cohabitation than before. It's saddening because what's happened is not in the German, European or American interest,"" Peter Beyer, the German coordinator for transatlantic ties, told Reuters. 
NATO allies worry that Trump's carping against European allies will erode public support for the alliance founded in 1949 to contain a military threat from the Soviet Union.
""It doesn't actually change things very much,"" said Francois Heisbourg, special adviser at the Paris-based Fondation Pour la Recherche Strategique, of the Trump plan. 
""The problem is that many people will see this as a first step out of two or three (and) the political signal it gives to (Russian President Vladimir) Putin...I am sure the Russians are quite happy."" 
Despite his criticism of NATO, Trump increased the budget for the U.S. military in Europe to $6.5 billion in fiscal 2019, from $4.7 billion in 2018. He requested $5.9 billion for 2020.
Since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, Washington has sent troops to the Baltics, Poland and the Black Sea, held more exercises and helped modernise NATO's response force. 
""The heartening thing from the NATO perspective is that the U.S. commitment (under Trump) in terms of the nuts and bolts has been remarkably solid,"" said Jamie Shea, a former senior NATO official now at the Friends of Europe think-tank. ""That's where the deterrence lies, not in the rhetoric.""
A senior EU diplomat said French President Emmanuel Macron, who called NATO ""brain dead"" last year, could seize on Trump's announcement to insist that the 27-nation European Union develop more military capabilities independently of the United States.

""The EU is developing its defence, but it still needs the U.S. militarily. It is very reluctant to deploy alone,"" the EU diplomat said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said he wanted police forces across the country to wear body cameras to help overcome what he said was public distrust in the forces of law and order.
Trudeau, who last Friday attended a protest against police brutality, called for bold action to tackle systemic discrimination and racism against black Canadians and indigenous Canadians.
Trudeau said he had spoken earlier in the day to Brenda Lucki, head of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
""One of the things we discussed was the adoption of body cameras. I'm committing to raising this with the provinces this week so we can move forward as quickly as possible,"" Trudeau told a daily briefing. ""Body cameras (are) a significant step towards transparency.""
The RCMP, which is a federal police force, also services eight of the 10 provinces. Ontario and Quebec, the two most populous provinces, have their own police.
According to a survey by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp, the only major police force in Canada that obliges its officers to carry body cameras is in Calgary, Alberta.
Trudeau said the federal government was working on other measures to improve how the RCMP worked but gave no details.
""The reality is that many people in this country simply do not feel protected by the police. In fact, they're afraid of them,"" he said.
Trudeau spoke a day after Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said Canadians deserved answers over the arrest of an indigenous leader who alleges police beat him up.

Protesters in Montreal and other Canadian cities took to the streets on Sunday in the latest international demonstrations against police brutality, sparked by the death of an unarmed black man in Minnesota.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) urged countries on Monday to press on with efforts to contain the novel coronavirus, noting the pandemic was worsening globally and had not peaked in central America.
More than 136,000 cases were reported worldwide on Sunday, ""the most in a single day so far"", WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
""More than six months into the pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal,"" he told an online briefing.
In response to a question on China, WHO's top emergencies expert, Dr Mike Ryan, said retrospective studies of how the outbreak has been addressed could wait, adding: ""We need to focus now on what we are doing today to prevent second peaks.""
Ryan also said infections in central American countries including Guatemala were still on the rise, and that they were ""complex"" epidemics.
""I think this is a time of great concern,"" he said, calling for strong government leadership and international support for the region.
Brazil is now one of the hotspots of the pandemic, with the second highest number of confirmed cases, behind only the United States, and a death toll that last week surpassed Italy's.
After removing cumulative numbers for coronavirus deaths in Brazil from a national website, the Health Ministry sowed further confusion and controversy by releasing two contradictory sets of figures for the latest tally of infection cases and fatalities. 
Ryan said Brazil's data had been ""extremely detailed"" so far but stressed it was important for Brazilians to understand where the virus is and how to manage risk, and that the WHO hoped communication would be ""consistent and transparent"".
Maria van Kerkhove, a WHO epidemiologist, said that a ""comprehensive approach"" was essential in South America.
More than 7 million people have been reported infected with the coronavirus globally and over 400,000 have died.
""This is far from over,"" van Kerkhove said.
At least half of Singapore's newly discovered coronavirus cases show no symptoms, the co-head of the government's virus taskforce told Reuters on Monday, reinforcing the city-state's decision to ease lockdown restrictions very gradually.
Van Kerkhove said that many countries doing contact tracing had identified asymptomatic cases but were not finding that they caused further spread of the virus, adding: ""It is very rare"".
Ryan, asked about technical cooperation with the United States, after President Donald Trump's announcement 10 days ago that it was 'terminating' its relationship with the WHO, said the WHO relies heavily on experts from the Centers for Disease Control and National Institute of Health. 

""We will continue to do that until we are otherwise instructed or informed,"" he added.

U.S. investigators want to interview Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, about his friendship with Epstein - who was found dead in prison last year while awaiting charges of trafficking minors - as part of their inquiry into possible co-conspirators.
Andrew has publicly stated he will cooperate with any ""appropriate law enforcement agency"". But in March, Manhattan-based U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said the prince had ""shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options"".
In a statement, Andrew's lawyers said the prince, whose official title is the Duke of York, had offered his help to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) three times this year.
""Unfortunately, the DOJ has reacted to the first two offers by breaching their own confidentiality rules and claiming that the Duke has offered zero cooperation,"" Andrew's lawyers Blackfords said. 
""In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered,"" the statement said.
The lawyers said the DOJ had only requested Andrew's help on Jan. 2 this year and had stated that he had never been a target of their investigation and they merely wanted his cooperation.
They said statements by Berman that Andrew had given ""zero cooperation"" were ""inaccurate and should not have been made"".
Britain's Sun newspaper reported the DOJ had sent British authorities a mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) request, used in criminal investigations to gather material from other states which cannot readily be obtained on a police cooperation basis.
A U.S. law enforcement official, who has direct knowledge of the investigation and spoke on condition of anonymity, said such a request had been submitted. 
A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined to comment and Britain's Home Office (interior ministry) said it did not comment on the existence of any MLAT requests. Buckingham Palace is not commenting on the legal case. 
If the MLAT request is granted, U.S. prosecutors could ask for Andrew, who stepped down from public duties because of the furore over his links to Epstein, to voluntarily attend an interview to give a statement or potentially force him to attend a court to provide evidence under oath.
""Any pursuit of an application for mutual legal assistance would be disappointing, since the Duke of York is not a target of the DOJ investigation and has recently repeated his willingness to provide a witness statement,"" Blackfords' statement said.
A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation probe is focusing on British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's, and others who facilitated his alleged trafficking of underage girls, law enforcement sources told Reuters in December. 

Maxwell, whose whereabouts are currently unknown, has denied the allegations against her.

NAVALCARNERO, Spain (Reuters) - The sounds of tears and laughter rang through the Casaverde nursing home in Navalcarnero outside Madrid on Monday, as residents received their first visitors since the facility was locked down in March.
Facing each other from opposite ends of two large tables pushed together to ensure adequate distancing, Pepa Plaza and her mother Josefa Vila enjoyed an emotional reunion.
""I knew she was OK from the video chats, but now I've seen her,"" said Plaza from behind a mask. ""The only thing missing is I can't go over and give her a kiss.""
Her mother smiled as a nurse showed a video of her grandchildren back home in the kitchen. 
""It's like a dream come true,"" said Vila. ""Because of course you're far away you can't see them. You worry could they have fallen, could something have happened to them?""
Before being allowed inside, visitors must sign a declaration saying they do not have coronavirus symptoms and have not come into contact with anybody who has. Staff members then take their temperature and disinfect their hands and shoes.
Once inside, visitors must remain two metres away from their elderly relatives.
An exception to the grim norm, the Casaverde home has been only mildly affected by the coronavirus, which has rampaged through elderly communities across the country.
There are no official estimates of the national death toll from COVID-19 in Spanish nursing homes, but Madrid authorities reported that some 6,000 retirement home residents have died with coronavirus symptoms since the outbreak began, about 11% of the pre-pandemic population.
Fighting back tears, Maricarmen Cortisejo was thrilled to see her mother doing so well after such an ordeal. 

""I can't even talk. She's fine, I can see she's looking great.""

An executive from Turkish private jet operator MNG Jet and four pilots were detained in early January shortly after the escape and were charged with migrant smuggling, a sentence carrying a maximum sentence of eight years in jail.
At the time of the incident, MNG Jet said the executive acted without the knowledge of the company and it had filed a criminal complaint for the illegal use of its aircraft.
""We expect our client to be acquitted in the end,"" said Mehmet Fatih Danaci, a lawyer for jet operator executive Okan Kosemen, adding that even if found guilty and handed a maximum sentence, Kosemen should only serve a short time in jail.
In April, Turkey's parliament passed a law allowing the release of tens of thousands of prisoners to ease overcrowding in jails and protect detainees from the coronavirus outbreak.
""Even if convicted of this crime, our client, who denies this accusation, has nearly served the time he needed to remain in jail under the recently imposed amnesty,"" Danaci said.
The first full hearing in case is due to be held on July 3.
Ghosn has said he fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes, which he denies.

The United States arrested two men last month on charges of enabling the dramatic escape on Dec. 29, 2019. Japan said it was working to extradite them from the United States.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russians preparing to vote on constitutional amendments on July 1 could be forgiven for not knowing they could pave the way for President Vladimir Putin to rule for another 12 years once his current term expires.
Months of television, online and poster advertisements have listed proposed changes to pension rights, animal rights and others. But they have failed to highlight the fact that the amendments would allow Putin to run again for president, despite having served the constitutional maximum of two consecutive terms.
""There are lots of changes and it's hardly possible to single out one,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked about the issue on Monday.
""They are important when taken together.""
An official website set up last week to provide information on the proposed amendments did not mention the impact on Putin until a journalist pointed out the omission.
""There are various technical filters. Maybe it just dropped off when the site was being populated,"" Peskov said, adding that the information had now been added.
The raft of constitutional changes will, among other things, reset Putin’s presidential term tally to zero, allowing him to serve two more back-to-back six-year terms until 2036 if re-elected.
Critics have called the move a constitutional coup they say would allow Putin, 67, to unfairly extend his rule of more than two decades past the 2024 end of his existing term.

The Kremlin says a majority of Russians and the country's main political forces back the changes. It has cast the vote as a wider legislative exercise that would enshrine key rights.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sitting at the Roy d'Espagne terrace on the Grand Place in Brussels, Ian Panne enjoyed his first beer in a restaurant after Belgium eased almost 12 weeks of coronavirus lockdown.
""I would never have thought that having a beer on the Grand Place would be so emotional,"" Panne, a 48-year-old antiques dealer, told Reuters.
Belgium allowed almost all businesses to reopen on Monday, including bars and restaurants, but social distancing measures must remain.
At the Roy d'Espagne restaurant, one table in two is left empty and customers have to scan a QR code for the menu. Waiters are protected by masks or plastic shields.
That has not deterred 39-year-old Caroline Michils, who said the measures were for everyone's safety.
In contrast, Florence Vandenhoeck, 68, said the masks and the emptiness of the Grand Place, usually packed with tourists, were a frightening sight.
Monday also marked the resumption of religious ceremonies such as masses. Up to 100 worshippers are allowed, with face masks, social distancing and sanitizer the norm.
""We have to think about a lot of things in terms of health security, but from a spiritual and human point of view it is a very beautiful moment,"" priest and spokesman for Belgium's episcopal conference Tommy Scholtes said.
Belgium is set for three years of lost growth from the COVID-19 pandemic as the 2021-2022 recovery will fail to make up for a 9% decline forecast for this year, the central bank said on Monday.

Belgium has 59,348 cases of COVID-19 and 9,606 deaths.

The scaffolding had been erected for renovation work on the cathedral's old spire before the fire engulfed the major tourist attraction on April 15, 2019, destroying the spire and the roof in a disaster that stunned the nation.
The operation, delayed from mid-March by the new coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdown, is an important step in the restoration of the cathedral that French President Emmanuel Macron promised to rebuild within five years.
Two teams of five workers will use ropes and harnesses to remove the now-tangled metal poles. They will be equipped with sabre saws to cut through the 40,000 pieces of scaffolding. An 84-metre-high crane will then lower the pieces to the ground. 
On Monday workers wearing hard-hats and face masks installed the final safety nets.
""It's the last check-up before open-heart surgery. The rope workers will swing from tube to tube to cut up the scaffolding"", Christophe-Charles Rousselot of the Notre-Dame Foundation told Reuters.
""It is an extremely complicated, very delicate operation that has been prepared for months,"" he said, adding it would take all summer to complete. 
The main bell towers, outer walls and much of the vaulted ceiling of the cathedral survived last year's blaze, along with religious relics and artworks housed within.
Only when the scaffolding is removed will engineers be able to inspect how structurally sound the damaged vaults are.
""I can't imagine Paris without Notre-Dame. I hope they will make it as beautiful again as it was before"", said 72-year-old Paris resident Marie-France Di Giorgio.

Church officials hope Notre-Dame will be open for mass by 2024, when Paris is due to host the Olympics.

The well in Siberia's Irkutsk region, operated by a subsidiary of the Irkutsk Oil Company, caught fire on May 30 and authorities called in the army on Friday. 
Soldiers flew in an MT-12 Rapira anti-tank weapon to the remote site in Siberia and, working at night, fired rounds at the wellhead from 180 metres away in order to break it from the well, the Russian Defence Ministry said. 
""This helped set up the blowout prevention equipment to then seal the well and put out the fire,"" it said in a statement circulated along with footage of the operation. 
Soldiers in full military body armour and helmets - as well as coronavirus face masks - could be seen dragging the heavy feet of the weapon apart in order to set it up before shooting artillery rounds. 

The fire happened at a new field that accounted for just a tiny fraction of Irkutsk Oil Company's overall output. In 2018, the company produced 9 million tonnes of oil and gas condensate.

Scotland, like many countries, has seen demonstrations against racism in recent days, inspired by protests in the United States over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
On Cochrane Street, named after a man who made a fortune in tobacco in the early 18th century at a time when American and Caribbean plantations relied on slave labour, the campaigners put up a sign that read ""Sheku Bayoh Street"".
Bayoh was a black man who died in police custody in 2015, aged 31, after being arrested in the Scottish town of Kirkcaldy. The circumstances of his death are the subject of an ongoing public inquiry.
Other Glasgow streets were also given alternative names by the campaigners. 
One was renamed ""Rosa Parks Street"", after the U.S. civil rights activist known around the world for starting the 1955-56 bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, that was one of the milestones in the struggle against racial segregation.
Another was given the name ""Harriet Tubman Street"", after the abolitionist born into slavery in the United States in the 19th century who escaped and organised rescue missions to help other slaves to escape.
A ""George Floyd Street"" sign was put up in another road, although local media reported it was later removed.
In the U.S. capital Washington, D.C., a plaza outside the White House has been officially renamed ""Black Lives Matter Plaza"". It is the spot where President Donald Trump caused controversy by posing for a photo holding a Bible just after peaceful protesters were removed by force.

On Sunday, protesters in the English port city of Bristol tore down a statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Like many Sudanese, car mechanic Mohamed Othman says the government must end its coronavirus lockdown now so that he can get back to work because ""me and my family have no other source of income"".
The transitional civilian government, which runs Sudan under a power-sharing deal with the army, ordered most businesses, markets, schools and mosques to shut and imposed travel restrictions nearly two months ago.
But it is facing growing demands to end the restrictions from a population mired in poverty and facing annual inflation of nearly 100% as well as complaints that promised aid for poorer Sudanese has failed to materialise.
""We demand that the lockdown is lifted immediately so that we can... get on with our lives, because hunger is worse than corona,"" said Othman, who is paid by the day.
And it is not only the poor who are unhappy.
""We're facing huge daily financial losses,"" said supermarket owner Magdi Yousif.
The government says the lockdown, extended again in the capital Khartoum until June 18, has helped to curb the pandemic.
Sudan has so far reported 6,081 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the new coronavirus, with 359 deaths. The daily infection rate, at around 200, is much lower than, for example, in neighbouring Egypt.
WEAK ENFORCEMENT
The government blames technical issues for the delays in aid to the poor. The civil service is still in some disarray following the ouster of veteran ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019.
Officials say only 60% of some half a million designated families have received food baskets and cash transfers.
""There are now efforts to distribute the rest of the aid supplies,"" said Information Minister Faisal Mohamed Salih.
The Multipurpose Women's Cooperative Union, which represents 15,000 tea sellers and street vendors, said its members had not received aid despite presenting the government with lists of those impacted when the lockdown began.
""They're isolating, but they're in a difficult situation,"" union leader Awadiya Mahmoud Kuku said last week. ""We need to stand with these people so they don't go back onto the streets (to sell).""
The government later announced it would begin to provide money transfers to union members. 
Some Sudanese complain that the lockdown is being widely flouted, with some stores remaining open and people continuing to mix in public. Some tea sellers are serving the very security forces who are meant to be enforcing the restrictions, they say.
""The government is being lax in enforcing the lockdown and the government forces are only present at the bridges and main markets, while life in the rest of the city is almost as it was before,"" said school teacher Nadia Ahmed.
Health minister Akram Ali Altom has criticised security forces for not fully enforcing the lockdown. Sudan's healthcare system, neglected for decades under Bashir, is struggling to cope with the pandemic.
Adil Mohamed said he had tried unsuccessfully to report mosques that continued to host banned group prayers during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
""Why make the announcement of shutting mosques if you're not going to enforce it?""

A week ago, authorities reported six infections in the northwestern city of Mbandaka, saying they appeared to be separate from another outbreak of the virus that has raged in the east since 2018.
There have now been nine confirmed cases and three probable cases of the disease in and around Mbandaka, the WHO said. Six of those people have died, it added.
The city sits on the Congo River, close to the border with the Republic of Congo.
Genetic sequencing of the virus by Congo's biomedical research laboratory showed the new outbreak is likely to have started as a ""spillover event"", a transmission from an infected animal, according to research published on virological.org, a molecular evolution and epidemiology forum.
In a situation report, the WHO said 300 people in Mbandaka and the surrounding Equateur province had been vaccinated - a tool health workers used to control the outbreak in the east, which has not seen any new infections since April 27.
Mbandaka suffered a small Ebola outbreak in 2018 that killed 33 people. Health officials say vaccinations and swift containment efforts including mobile handwashing stations and a door-to-door education campaign kept it at bay.
The new cases in Mbandaka mark the country's 11th major Ebola outbreak since the virus was discovered near northern Congo's Ebola River in 1976. It is Congo's third outbreak in two years of the virus which causes vomiting, diarrhoea and external bleeding.

Protesters led by opposition party the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) carried placards saying ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Black people are not slaves"" outside the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria and consulates in Johannesburg and Cape Town.
The leader of the ultra-left EFF, Julius Malema, told a crowd of several hundred protesters outside the embassy that it was important for South Africans to stand in solidarity with African Americans.
""We left our homes to come here and say enough is enough,"" Malema said. African Americans had supported the anti-apartheid movement and ""when they are going through such a difficult period it's important that we too pay solidarity"", he added.
South Africa remains deeply scarred by its apartheid and colonial past, with attempts at racial reconciliation frequently marred by incidents of racism. 
Twenty-six years after the end of white minority rule, white people still control much of the economy despite accounting for just 8% of the population.
EFF protesters also knelt at a busy intersection in Johannesburg's financial district for 9 minutes, about the amount of time a white police officer knelt on Floyd's neck before he died in Minneapolis on May 25. Some of them wore T-shirts with the words ""I can't breathe"".

Videos on social media showed EFF protesters in Cape Town singing ""What did we do? Our sin is being black"" in the isiZulu language.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow is lifting its months-long coronavirus lockdown, mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Monday, declaring that the pandemic was on the wane and it was possible to resume normal life during the course of June.
Sobyanin's comments came shortly after Russia announced a partial reopening of its borders, saying it would allow people who needed to work, study, get medical treatment or look after relatives to travel abroad for the first time since late March. 
""The pandemic has slowly but steadily been on the wane for several weeks,"" Sobyanin wrote on his personal blog. ""Moscow can practically get back to its usual rhythm of life."" 
Russia continues to report thousands of new infections daily. Its nationwide tally is 476,658, the third-highest in the world, but the number of cases in Moscow, the original epicentre of the virus, has more than halved to around 2,000 a day.
The total number of deaths across the country at 5,971 is much lower than many other countries, which has stirred debate about the way authorities count fatalities. 
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced the partial border reopening for some travellers on state television.
Foreign citizens needing treatment in Russia or those with close relatives or guardians needing care could also now enter the country, Mishustin said.
Russia closed its borders on March 30 after grounding all international flights and asked citizens to stay at home to limit the spread of the coronavirus. International flights have yet to fully resume though a decision is expected soon. 
Sobyanin set out how the Russian capital would cancel virus curbs, such as a digital pass system for residents and a self-isolation regime, from Tuesday with other restrictions to be lifted during June.

Beauty salons, hairdressers and veterinarian clinics would also reopen, he said, with other restrictions, including those on restaurants and cafes, lifted later in June.

Some schools in the capital Madrid reopened for primary pupils on Monday and seniors preparing for university-entrance exams will return on Tuesday. Other regions are allowing different age groups to return.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Protests flared in Bangkok on Monday against the suspected kidnapping of a Thai activist in Cambodia which has reignited protests against Thailand’s military-royalist elite, with some online questioning a law banning criticism of the monarchy.
Small student protests over the banning of a youth-oriented opposition party had bubbled up before the coronavirus pandemic, but were stopped by government restrictions during the health crisis.
Now anger is building again around Wanchalearm Satsaksit, 37, a previously little-known activist who fled Thailand following a 2014 coup.
Wanchalearm was abducted by unknown gunmen on Thursday in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, where he had lived to escape criminal charges for criticising the former Thai junta.
Dozens of protesters outside the Cambodian embassy in Bangkok demanded an investigation into the disappearance and accused the Thai state of orchestrating his kidnapping, which Thailand's police and government have denied.
""I want the Thai government to protect people who are living abroad whether they are political exiles or not,"" said protester Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree.
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters he had no information on the case but that Thailand would discuss it with Cambodian authorities.
""This case is their matter,"" he said.
Cambodia's government and police were not available for comment. They had previously denied knowledge of the incident.
At the weekend, posters labelled ""Missing"" appeared around Bangkok featuring photos of Wanchalearm and other critics of military governments who have disappeared in past decades.
The posters were the work of the Spring Movement, a small group of students at Bangkok's elite Chulalongkorn University, group member Pun Thongsai told Reuters.
""After Wanchalearm disappeared, we wanted to do something beyond online,"" said Pun, 26, a maths graduate. ""We do not know who directly ordered the abduction, but we can see the ruling elite of this country does not care about this issue.”
In recent years, at least eight Thai activists who fled after a 2014 military coup have disappeared (https://www.reuters.com/article/thailand-rights-exiles/rpt-insight-thai-exiles-in-fear-after-murders-and-disappearances-idUSL4N230193) from Laos, Cambodia or Vietnam, with the bodies of two of them later found floating in the Mekong River.
Wanchalearm was speaking on his mobile phone to his elder sister, Sitanun Satsaksit, on Thursday, she said.
The line was abruptly cut and after 20 minutes of frantic calls, she was told by a friend that her brother had been kidnapped from the street.
In a sign that the incident had stirred rare open questioning of the Thai monarchy as well as the government, the hashtag ""#abolish112"" trended on Thai-language Twitter, used or retweeted more than 450,000 times by midday on Monday.
It was an apparent reference to Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code, which makes it illegal to insult the royal family and is punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
Any questioning of the monarchy's sacrosanct position was once rare in the traditionalist Buddhist society.
Several of the missing dissidents had been accused of violating Article 112, but Thai officials denied that Wanchalearm faced lese majeste charges and his sister said he was not an anti-monarchist.

“The palace has no comment on this issue,” an official there said.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government said on Monday it had not had official confirmation from Washington of any decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany, but stressed that their presence serves all NATO members.
Trump has ordered the U.S. military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. The move would reduce the U.S. contingent to 25,000.
""I don't want to speculate on something for which I have no confirmation,"" Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told a news conference.
""The fact is the presence of U.S. troops in Germany serves the entire security of the NATO alliance - so American security too. That is the basis on which we work together.""
Despite misgivings about nuclear weapons that the United States is believed to have at a base in Buechel in western Germany, Germans have generally welcomed U.S. troops since World War Two.
A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said on Monday close cooperation with the United States in NATO and with other NATO partners was key for Germany's security.
The decision, even if not yet confirmed, has shocked policymakers in Berlin.
The move is the latest twist in relations between Berlin and Washington, which have often been strained during Trump's presidency. Trump has pressed Germany to raise defence spending and accused Berlin of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to its energy reliance.
Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, Vice President at the German Marshall Fund of the United States which promotes U.S.-European ties, said the decision ""does smack a bit like revenge"".

KABUL/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Talks to end the 18-year-old conflict in Afghanistan may begin this month, sources said on Monday, a day after the U.S. special envoy visited the capital of neighbouring Pakistan and met Taliban leaders in Qatar.
The United States signed a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban in February, but its attempts to usher the insurgent group towards peace talks with the Afghan government have been mired in setbacks and violence surged in March and April.
The Taliban's spokesman Suhail Shaheen said on Twitter that U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad had discussed ""the commencement of intra-Afghan negotiations"" at the insurgent group's political capital, Doha, on Sunday. Khalilzad had earlier met Pakistan's army chief of staff, according to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad.
""The two took note of recent progress created by the Eid ceasefire and accelerated prisoner releases as well as reduced violence ahead of intra-Afghan negotiations,"" the Embassy said on Monday. ""(They) discussed steps required for the start of intra-Afghan negotiations.""
Disagreement over the Taliban's demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners has also blocked progress towards resolving the conflict, in which Pakistan is considered a key regional player.
One Afghan presidential palace source and one diplomatic source told Reuters those issues were gradually being resolved and momentum had grown in recent weeks for formal talks, which were expected to begin this month, likely in Doha.
However the sources also told Reuters that due to complications from the coronavirus some negotiations might initially be held virtually.

""The ceasefire, prisoners release and reduction in violence has created a momentum for the talks to begin soon and the government is fully ready,"" the Afghan palace official told Reuters, adding that President Ashraf Ghani was optimistic.

Pro-democracy demonstrators have taken to the streets again in Hong Kong in recent weeks after a lull during the coronavirus epidemic, angered by Beijing's plans to impose new security laws. Last year saw the biggest unrest in the semi-autonomous city since it was handed back to China by Britain in 1997.
A ""One Country, Two Systems"" agreement gave it rights and freedoms unavailable in mainland China for at least for 50 years. But many in Hong Kong and abroad see those freedoms, and its status as an international trade and finance center, at risk from Beijing.
In rare comments on Hong Kong's long-term future, Zhang Xiaoming, deputy director of China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, indicated that how Hong Kong's people behaved now in regard to the political situation would affect its post-2047 status.
""I have noticed quite a lot of people in Hong Kong are looking ahead to 'One Country, Two System's' fate after 2047,"" Zhang said, speaking via a videolink to an online seminar about the city's mini-constitution.
""What kind of record will Hong Kong show to the people of the whole country, represented by the then National People's Congress, for a new mandate?"" he said.
Zhang said the stronger the commitment to national security, the more room there would be for the ""One Country, Two Systems"" arrangement.
The Hong Kong protesters are angry with what they perceive as Beijing's eroding of the city's high degree of autonomy. 
Beijing sees the demonstrations as a threat to its sovereignty and national security. 
Zhang said the new security laws, which aim to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference, would only target a small group of people and would not affect Hong Kong's freedoms or its status as a global financial hub.

The city's main challenge was political, not economic, he said.

""They died in exactly the same way,"" said his sister Assa Traore. ""Adama carried the weight of three officers on his body.""
Adama Traore was celebrating his 24th birthday on July 19, 2016, when three police officers restrained him using the weight of their bodies. By the time he was delivered to a police station, he was unconscious and could not be revived.
Like Floyd, Traore was black, and his death triggered huge protests in France, where the police's record of brutality and racism remains unaddressed.
For four years, his family have demanded that French police be held to account for the death of her brother in police custody. Noone has been prosecuted. Medical experts are unable to agree on whether the way he was restrained killed him, or an underlying medical condition. Attention to the death had faded.
Now, anger over the killing of George Floyd in the United States is giving their campaign new impetus.
""It’s a strong, powerful echo,"" Assa Traore told Reuters in an interview in Beaumont-sur-Oise, the neighbourhood near Paris where her brother lived.
The Traore family and their supporters are this week calling for a nationwide day of protests in France.
""All the light shed on the George Floyd case has served as a reminder of the numerous other victims who died in the same conditions as George Floyd,"" said Almamy Kanoute, a French actor involved in the Traore campaign.
""We’re not saying the police in France are the same as in the United States. But the deadly techniques used in the United States are the same ones as in some European countries, the same ones that kill the same type of people.""

The supreme court's prosecutor will investigate whether the former king can be included in the case as he was protected by immunity until June 2014 when he abdicated in favour of his son Felipe, the statement said.
""This investigation focuses, precisely, in establishing or discarding the criminal relevance of the deeds that happened after June 2014, when the King Emeritus was not protected by the inviolability anymore,"" the statement said. 
The Supreme Court's investigation into the king derived from another one led by the country's anti-corruption prosecutor over the second phase of a high-speed railway linking the cities of Medina and Mecca in Saudi Arabia that was granted to a group of Spanish companies in 2011. 
The Spanish Royal House was not immediately available for comment on Monday. 
Juan Carlos was for long very popular in Spain for his role in the country's transition to democracy in the late seventies, before scandals undermined public approval a decade ago, pushing him to abdicate.

In mid-March, his son Felipe, the current king said in a statement he had renounced inheritance from his father and had stripped his father from his palace allowance.

LONDON (Reuters) - The toppling by anti-racism protesters of a statue of a slave trader in the English port city of Bristol has given new urgency to a debate about how Britain should confront some of the darkest chapters of its history.
The statue of Edward Colston, who made a fortune in the 17th century from trading in West African slaves, was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour on Sunday by a group of demonstrators taking part in a worldwide wave of protests.
Statues of figures from Britain's imperialist past have in recent years become the subject of controversies between those who argue that such monuments merely reflect history and those who say they glorify racism.
Colston donated widely to charitable causes across his home city of Bristol, which named a street and several buildings after him. A campaign to remove the statue had gathered momentum in recent years, but had failed to persuade the authorities.
By taking matters into their own hands, the protesters raised the temperature of a debate that had previously remained confined to the realms of marches, petitions and newspaper columns.
Opinions were sharply divided as to whether their message justified their means.
Interior minister Priti Patel called the felling of the statue an ""utterly disgraceful"" distraction from the protesters' cause, while policing minister Kit Malthouse denounced ""mobs just turning up and deciding to do whatever they like"".
""PERSONAL AFFRONT""
The mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees, said on Channel 4 television he did not support social disorder, but the community was navigating complex issues that had no binary solutions.
""I would never pretend that the statue of a slaver in the middle of Bristol, the city in which I grew up, and someone who may well have owned one of my ancestors, was anything other than a personal affront to me,"" said Rees, who has Jamaican roots.
Bristol police said they made a tactical decision not to intervene because that could have caused worse disorder.
""Whilst I am disappointed that people would damage one of our statues, I do understand why it's happened, it's very symbolic,"" police chief Andy Bennett said on BBC television.
Even Britain's wartime hero, Winston Churchill, was under renewed scrutiny: a statue of him on Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) in London was sprayed on Sunday with graffiti that read ""Churchill was a racist"".
Churchill expressed racist and anti-Semitic views and critics blame him for denying food to India during the 1943 famine which killed more than two million people. Some Britons have long felt that the darker sides of his legacy should be given greater prominence.
These debates in Britain echo controversies in the United States, often focused on statues of confederate generals from the Civil War, and in South Africa, where Cape Town University removed a statue of British colonialist Cecil Rhodes in 2015.

Cape Town's successful ""Rhodes Must Fall"" campaign inspired a similar movement at Oriel College, part of Oxford University. But the college opted in 2016 to keep its statue of Rhodes, arguing that it was ""an important reminder of the complexity of history and of the legacies of colonialism still felt today"".

In a slight thaw in U.S.-Iranian enmity, the United States allowed Majid Taheri to travel to Iran as part of the swap deal. Michael White, an American who said he contracted the coronavirus while detained in Iran, was freed last week.
""The government of Iran has done an extreme effort in order to help people like me who were somehow accused of violating the U.S. sanctions,"" Taheri told state TV after his arrival at Tehran's Imam Khomeini Airport, where he was welcomed by deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Jaberi-Ansari. 
He said he had been punished by the United States for sending material to Iran to help a research group that was making vaccines.
Taheri, detained in the United States for 16 months for violating U.S. sanctions, was freed on June 4 as Iran released White, who had been sentenced to 13 years in 2019 for insulting Iran’s supreme leader and posting private information online.
Taheri's lawyer said he would visit family in Iran and seek medical treatment before returning to the United States. He had pleaded guilty to violating U.S. sanctions, the lawyer added. 
""My charges were futile and unfair,"" Iran's semi-official Fars news agency quoted Taheri as saying.
The prisoner swap deal is a rare bright spot in the relationship between the two foes that has grown more hostile since President Donald Trump took office in 2017. He exited a nuclear agreement Iran had signed with world powers, and reimposed sanctions that had been lifted under the deal. 
Last December, Washington and Tehran worked on a prisoner exchange in which Iran freed U.S. citizen Xiyue Wang, who had been held for three years on spying charges, and the United States freed Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Last week, materials science professor Sirous Asgari, 59, who was indicted by U.S. federal prosecutors in April 2016 and acquitted in November 2019, returned to Iran. He tested positive for the coronavirus in April and U.S. authorities had said he would be deported once he received medical clearance.
While both Tehran and Washington have expressed readiness for further exchange of prisoners, Iranian authorities have ruled out a wider negotiation with the United States as demanded by Trump administration.
The Swiss Foreign Ministry, which confirmed it played a role in what it called ""the humanitarian gesture"" on White and Taheri, said it ""stands ready"" to help further.

Authorities have carried out a sustained crackdown on alleged followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen since the failed coup in July 2016, when 250 people were killed.
Gulen denies any involvement. A former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, he has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. 
The prosecutor's office in the western province of Balikesir ordered the detention of 74 people, all previously sacked from the security forces and including six former police chiefs, security officials and Anadolu said.
Prosecutors in southeastern Gaziantep province ordered the detention of 33 people, including 24 security forces personnel on active duty, Anadolu said. It said that in western Bursa province, prosecutors ordered the detention of 42 people, including six soldiers on active duty.
Erdogan has for years accused Gulen's supporters of establishing a ""parallel state"" by infiltrating the police, judiciary, military and other state institutions.
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been held pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended.

Turkey's Western allies have criticised the scale of the crackdown, while Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the security threat.

The UAE, Egypt and Russia back the Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east of the country, led by commander Khalifa Haftar, which has suffered a string of sudden reverses over the past week.
""With the support of the United States National Security Council for the Egyptian initiative, Arab and international momentum for an immediate ceasefire, a withdrawal of foreign forces and a return to the political track is strengthened,"" minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash said on Twitter. 
Libya has had no stable central authority since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed rebels in 2011 and has been split since 2014 between rival administrations in its east and west.
The internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), backed by Turkey, is based in the west of the country.
Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced a new initiative for Libya on Saturday which proposes an elected leadership council and a ceasefire starting on Monday. 
In a series of rapid victories, the GNA has, with Turkish support, suddenly brought most of northwest Libya back under its control, dashing Haftar's bid to unite the country by force.
A panel of U.N. experts says the UAE has supplied Haftar with arms and mercenaries.
Standing alongside the Egyptian president as the initiative was announced, Haftar agreed to the political initiative that analysts say could dilute his power in his eastern home territory and may demonstrate the impatience of his foreign backers. 
Gargash said the international community cannot accept that fighting continues, adding that a comprehensive political solution is needed for all Libyan parties to the conflict. 

The United States National Security council on Sunday tweeted that it was encouraged by Egypt's plan.

The re-opening of schools had been delayed after teachers' unions urged school staff to defy the government order last week, saying schools lacked sufficient health and hygiene measures to keep educators and pupils safe.
South Africa has counted nearly 50,000 cases of the new coronavirus - the most of any country in sub-Saharan Africa - along with almost 1,000 deaths. 
Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga said on Sunday that ramped up efforts to equip schools over the past week meant that 95% of South Africa's primary and secondary schools were now able to host classes.
""The golden rule is there will be no school that will resume if not ready to do so,"" Motshekga said.
The government will find alternative arrangements for pupils at schools unable to open on Monday, she said. 
Initially, only pupils in grades 7 and 12 will return to class, with other years phased in gradually.
Many of South Africa's government schools are in poor shape, particularly in rural areas, and analysts say that a quarter of them have no running water, making hand-washing nearly impossible.
Others have been vandalised or hit by arson attacks during a nationwide lockdown imposed by the government in March.
Government officials, however, worry further delaying a return to classrooms would mean a generation of school children risks losing a key part of their education, and the future opportunities it brings.
The shutdown has exposed deep divisions - between black and white, rich and poor - that persist in South Africa's education system a quarter century after the end of minority white rule.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un focused on domestic economic issues at a meeting of the politburo of the country's ruling Workers Party, state media said on Monday, as the North ramped up pressure on South Korea over defector activities.
The two-day politburo meeting comes at a time of economic uncertainty amid the global COVID-19 pandemic that is putting additional pressure on the North's economy, already battered by international sanctions aimed at stopping its nuclear program. 
The meeting discussed ""crucial issues arising in further developing the self-sufficient economy of the country and improving the standard of people's living,"" state news agency KCNA said.
Kim did not mention the North's increased criticism of South Korea or of the North Korean defectors who call it home.
For several days, North Korea has lashed out at South Korea, threatening to close an inter-Korean liaison office and other projects if the South does not stop defectors from sending leaflets and other material into the North.
On Monday, North Korea did not answer a routine daily liaison phone call from South Korean officials for the first time in since 2018, South Korea's Unification Ministry said.
The ministry has said South Korea remains committed to following inter-Korean agreements, and it is considering proposing legislation to ban groups from sending material into North Korea.
KCNA's report on the 13th political bureau meeting focused on domestic economic issues, including the chemical industry and fertilizer production as ""a major thrust front of the national economy.""
The meeting also emphasized construction of residential houses as a way to better North Korean's standard of living. 
Kim has made an unusually small number of outings in recent months, with his absence from a major holiday prompting speculation about his condition, as Pyongyang has stepped up measures against the COVID-19 pandemic.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia said on Monday China remains unresponsive to its weeks-long pleas to ease tensions between the two trading partners that escalated after Canberra called for an international enquiry into the origins of the novel coronavirus.
Australia has insisted the call for an independent investigation into the pandemic, which it says most likely originated in a wildlife market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, was not politically targeted at Beijing.
China accused Australia of playing ""petty tricks"" and the Chinese ambassador to Australia warned Chinese consumers could boycott Australian products if Australia pursued the inquiry.
China has also since suspended beef imports from four of Australia's largest meat processors and imposed hefty tariffs on imports of barley, although both sides say those moves are unrelated to the spat over the pandemic.
Australian Trade Minister Simon Birmingham, who has been requesting discussions with his Chinese counterpart for weeks, said Beijing has been ignoring Canberra's pleas.
""Unfortunately, our requests for a discussion have so far been met negatively,"" Birmingham told Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) radio on Monday. ""That's disappointing.""
China is by far Australia's biggest export market, taking more than 30% of Australia's exports by value.
Overall relations have been strained amid Australian accusations of Chinese meddling in domestic affairs and concern about what Australia sees as China's growing influence in the Pacific region.
On Friday, China advised its people to avoid travelling to Australia, citing racial discrimination and violence against the Chinese in connection with the coronavirus pandemic, advice which Canberra disputed.
A Newspoll for The Australian newspaper on Monday showed 79% of Australians backed the push for a global coronavirus investigation.

968,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2020 04:13PM ET</span>","In violent Rio, U.S. protests stoke backlash against deadly cops","By Gram Slattery and Ricardo Moraes
SÃO GONÇALO, Brazil (Reuters) - The killing of another black teenager by Rio de Janeiro police last month was, based on the numbers, unremarkable – one of hundreds gunned down every year by some of the world's deadliest cops. 
But the fallout has surprised many. 
Brazil's Supreme Court last week banned raids by Rio police during the COVID-19 pandemic and Sunday saw nationwide marches against right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, as U.S. demonstrations and a global debate over racial violence by police has spurred a reckoning in Brazil. 
A studious 14-year-old who talked of becoming a lawyer, João Pedro Matos Pinto spent the afternoon of May 18 playing with friends around his uncle's backyard pool in São Gonçalo, a gritty suburb of the Rio state capital.
When police helicopters began circling close overhead, the frightened boys rushed inside, João Pedro's mother and uncle told Reuters. Heavily armed police stormed the home, throwing a grenade inside and spraying the structure with gunfire. 
One of the bullets hit João Pedro in the torso, killing him.
""When you enter a community shooting, it's as if everyone in the community is a criminal. It's as if nobody good lives here,"" said Rafaela Coutinho Matos, mother of the slain boy, in an interview.
Authorities told her family the death was an accident, she said. They said helicopters spotted a man they thought was the target of a police raid hopping over a fence near the pool.
In a statement, Rio state police said detectives had opened an investigation into the incident and three officers had been suspended. Brazil's federal police, which also participated in the operation, did not respond to a request for comment.
Such tragedies are commonplace in Rio, where a notoriously violent police force killed 1,814 people last year, according to official statistics. They killed 606 more in the first four months of 2020. 
Many killings of unarmed black men, or children, come and go with relatively little protest or media attention.
Yet anger at João Pedro's death and other recent complaints of police brutality are boiling over in Brazil against a backdrop of widespread U.S. demonstrations after the May 25 death of George Floyd in police custody.
SUPREME COURT ORDER
On Friday, hundreds gathered outside the São Gonçalo city hall, chanting ""No justice, no peace!"" in Portuguese. 
Many focused their ire on Bolsonaro and Rio Governor Wilson Witzel, both far-right politicians that have encouraged police to kill more criminals. Witzel, a former judge, said a surge in police killings under his watch ""isn't difficult to justify.""
Also on Friday, Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin issued an order prohibiting police raids in Rio's cinderblock slums, known as favelas, until the worst of the COVID-19 outbreak subsides. The order, which made reference to João Pedro's death, allows raids only under ""exceptional circumstances"" with prior approval by state prosecutors.
On Sunday, anti-racism marches in major Brazilian cities brought out the largest crowds of anti-Bolsonaro protesters since the pandemic arrived in March. In the capital Brasilia, demonstrators in masks carried ""Black Lives Matter"" banners emblazoned with João Pedro's name.
Public safety expert Ignacio Cano said that such fallout from a police killing was unprecedented, suggesting that news from the United States had heightened sensitivities in Brazil. 
""It's sad in a way that part of Brazilian society has to look at the U.S. to realize that the problem exists at home,"" said Cano, a professor at Rio de Janeiro State University.
""And the media is giving a lot more coverage now after the George Floyd case than they would otherwise give to the recurrent cases of executions in favelas.""
At Friday's protest in São Gonçalo, black college student Mykaella Moreira echoed demands for human rights that have taken center stage in the United States as well.
""We can't accept this genocidal state, which thinks we can die for nothing,"" Moreira said. ""We are also people. We also have a right to live.""
São Gonçalo is patrolled by Rio's 7th military police battalion, the state's most deadly police force, public records show. In October, Reuters published an investigation into the death of Brayan Mattos dos Santos, a 19-year-old who was also the unintended victim of a raid here.
This year, police in the area are set to break their own grim record, having killed 103 people in the district in the first four months of 2020. In March, police here set a monthly record, killing 33 people, according to public data.
Although whites make up half the population in Rio, they account for only 12% of police killings, according to data obtained by Reuters last year under a freedom of information request. 
João Pedro was studious, devout and went nowhere without family, said his mother Rafaela.
On the day he was killed, Rafaela said the boy was visiting his cousin about a kilometer away to play by the pool. 
She learned that João Pedro had been injured when her husband entered the family home in a panic, saying their son had been shot and taken to a hospital by helicopter. It was nearly a full day until she learned his fate.

""He was a loving boy,"" said Rafaela. ""A boy who had dreams.""

In Belgium, police fired tear gas and used a water cannon to disperse about a hundred protesters in a central part of Brussels with many African shops and restaurants. Some protesters were subsequently arrested.

For example, if we start looking for a flat to rent, we have difficulties. Regarding employment, we are disadvantaged. So it's not only about police violence,” said 25-year-old insurance broker Randy Kayembe. 
The second weekend of demonstrations showed the depth of feeling worldwide over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white officer detaining him knelt on his neck. More protests were also planned across the United States.
In London, where tens of thousands gathered, one banner read: ""UK guilty too."" 
Footage posted on social media showed demonstrators in Bristol in western England cheering as they tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th century slave trader, and pushed it into a river.
Chaniya La Rose, a 17-year-old student at the London protest with her family, said an end to inequality was long overdue. ""It just needs to stop now,"" she said. ""It shouldn't have to be this hard to be equal."" 
Health minister Matt Hancock had earlier said that joining the Black Lives Matter protests risked contributing to the spread of the coronavirus.
London police chief Cressida Dick said 27 officers had been injured in assaults during protests this week in the city, including 14 on Saturday at the end of a peaceful demonstration.
'INSTITUTIONAL RACISM'
In Italy, where several thousand people gathered in Rome's Piazza del Popolo, speakers called out racism at home, in the United States and elsewhere.
U.S. embassies were the focus of protests elsewhere in Europe, with more than 10,000 gathering in the Danish capital Copenhagen, hundreds in Budapest and thousands in Madrid, where they lined the street guarded by police in riot gear.
""I really think we need to finish with the institutional racism that is actually international,"" said Gloria Envivas, 24, an English teacher in the Spanish capital. 
""It's not something that is only going on in the USA or in Europe, it's also worldwide.""
In Thailand, people held an online demonstration on the video platform Zoom, due to restrictions on movement to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
""Everyone has hopes, everyone has dreams, everyone bleeds red, you know,"" said Natalie Bin Narkprasert, an organiser of the Thai protest.
Like many people around the world, the group observed a silence in memory of Floyd, in this case, for 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the period he was pinned under the officer's knee - to know ""how it feels"".
Other gatherings were due later, including in the United States, where tens of thousands of demonstrators amassed in Washington and other U.S. cities on Saturday.

Michael White, a U.S. Navy veteran detained in Iran since 2018, was freed last Thursday as part of a deal in which the United States allowed Iranian-American physician Majid Taheri to visit Iran - a rare instance of U.S.-Iranian cooperation.
White’s release came two days after the United States deported Sirous Asgari, an Iranian professor imprisoned in the United States despite having being acquitted of stealing trade secrets.

The total death toll since the outbreak emerged on Feb. 21 now stands at 33,899, the agency said, the fourth highest in the world after those of the United States, Britain and Brazil.
With a total number of confirmed cases at 234,998, Italy now has the seventh highest global tally.
People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 35,262 from 35,877 the day before.
The northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak was first identified, remains by far the worst affected region, accounting for 125 of the 197 new cases reported on Sunday.
The next worst-hit region, Emilia Romagna, reported just 14 new cases and of the country's 20 regions, the only others to register more than 10 new cases were Liguria with 13 and Lazio with 11.
Italy lifted travel restrictions on movement between regions last week and some regional governors have complained that allowing people to travel freely out of Lombardy could spark new areas of contagion elsewhere in the country.
There were 287 people in intensive care on Sunday, down from 293 on Saturday, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 165,837 were declared recovered against 165,078 a day earlier.

The agency said some 2.627 million people had been tested for the virus as of Saturday, against 2.599 million on Saturday, out of a population of around 60 million.

Forces of the Turkish-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) on Thursday recaptured Tarhouna, as part of an advance ending a 14-month offensive on the capital by the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar.
Since the LNA -- which is backed by Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Russia -- retreated, videos have been posted online purportedly showing looting of shops and torching of homes of families associated with the LNA and its local backers.
The U.N. Libya mission (UNSMIL) said in a statement more than 16,000 people had been displaced in the past few days in Tarhouna and southern Tripoli.
""Reports of the discovery of a number of corpses at the hospital in Tarhouna are deeply disturbing,"" UNSMIL said in a statement, without blaming anyone.
""We have also received numerous reports of the looting and destruction of public and private property in Tarhouna and Alasabaa, which in some cases appear to be acts of retribution and revenge that risk further fraying Libya's social fabric.""
Alasabaa is another town south of Tripoli that was retaken by the GNA after changing hands several times.
""The GNA should take urgent steps to stop revenge crimes in Tarhouna,"" said Hanan Salah, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch.
A spokesman for the GNA interior ministry sent Reuters a statement warning its forces that any reprisals in recaptured areas would be punished.
The Tripoli-based justice ministry said the GNA forces that entered Tarhouna had discovered more than 100 bodies in a morgue.

Jalel Harchaoui, research fellow at the Clingendael Institute, said international diplomatic efforts that had supported the Tripoli government ""will be predicated on that government providing security, imposing order and promoting robust transitional justice"".

LONDON (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in London on Sunday to condemn police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, some wearing face masks to protect against COVID-19 bearing the slogan “racism is a virus”.
On Saturday, thousands of protesters had gathered in central London in a demonstration that was peaceful but that ended with small numbers of people clashing with mounted police near Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Downing Street residence.
London Police chief Cressida Dick said 27 officers had been injured in ""shocking and completely unacceptable"" assaults during anti-racism protests in central London this week, including 14 on Saturday.
Both Dick and health minister Matt Hancock urged protesters not to gather in London again on Sunday due to the risk of the spread of the coronavirus. But thousands ignored this to pack the road outside the embassy on the south bank of the River Thames. 
""It just needs to stop now,"" said 17-year-old student Chaniya La Rose who was at the protest with her family. ""It shouldn’t have to be this hard to be equal.""
There have been demonstrations around the world over police treatment of ethnic minorities, sparked by the death of Floyd, a black American, on May 25 in Minneapolis. A white police officer detaining him knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
The London protest was peaceful, with people clapping, taking to one knee, waving placards and chanting ""George Floyd"" and ""the UK is not innocent"".
Pauline Nandoo, 60, said she had been protesting about the issue of racism since the 1970s and the images of violence at the end of Saturday’s protest had not deterred her. 

""There’s children of all ages and older adults here,"" said Nandoo, who was with her brother and 13-year-old daughter. ""They are going to experience what we have experienced and we have to try to make that not happen.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Some 300 Thais and foreigners in Thailand and elsewhere joined an online protest against racism on Sunday, adding their voices to global calls for justice for black American George Floyd who died in U.S. police custody in Minneapolis last month.
With coronavirus restrictions, protesters with 'I Can't Breathe' messages on their arms and placards gathered on the video-meeting platform Zoom to emphasize the call in Thailand as they watched the video clip of Floyd's last moments.
""I've lived in three continents now. I have best friends who are from the African community, who are also black Americans, and ... you see a stark contrast in how they are treated,"" said 28-year old Natalie Bin Narkprasert, one of the event organizers.
""Everyone has hopes, everyone has dreams, everyone bleeds red, you know,"" she said. ""It's crazy that they still have this in 2020 when in 1963, that was when Martin Luther King did his freedom speech.""
The group also observed 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence - the period that Floyd was filmed pinned under a white officer's knee - to know ""how it feels"", Natalie added.
Some said racist bias existed in Asia, although it might be more subtle, and that they hoped for gradual changes.

The death of Floyd has set off the biggest anti-racism protests seen in the United States in decades and sparked demonstrations worldwide.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The city of New Delhi on Sunday ordered many of its hospital beds to be reserved solely for residents of the Indian capital, as the number of COVID-19 infections continued to surge. 
India on Sunday registered 9,971 new coronavirus cases, taking its tally to 246,628 cases, with 6,929 deaths. The case numbers now lag only the United States, Brazil, Russia, United Kingdom and Spain. (https://tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7)
New Delhi city alone has registered more than 10% of total cases, making it the third worst-affected part of the country after the western state of Maharashtra, home to financial capital Mumbai, and southern Tamil Nadu state.
""Delhi is in big trouble . . . corona cases are rising rapidly,"" state Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a video message on Twitter, where he announced that private and city government-run hospitals will be reserved for Delhi residents.
""If we open Delhi hospitals for patients from all over, where will Delhi residents go when they get infected with coronavirus?""
Typically about 60-70% of patients admitted to hospitals in Delhi are people traveling from other states to get treatment as the city's hospitals, among the best in the country. 
A Delhi government coronavirus mobile app showed the city of more than 20 million people had 8,049 COVID-19 beds, but more than half were already occupied. Of the 60 hospitals, 11 had no beds available, the app showed on Sunday. 
The Delhi city government has issued an order saying hospitals must admit every patient from the city with coronavirus symptoms, following complaints from some people on social media that people were being refused treatment. 
Although cases are still rising, India is easing its lockdown rules. From Monday, Delhi and several other Indian cities will open malls, restaurants and religious places with strict social distancing rules. 

The nationwide lockdown has hit businesses, but the government says it helped slow the spread of the virus.

Iyad al-Halaq, 32, was killed during a police chase in Jerusalem's Old City on May 30. A police spokesman said at the time officers suspected he was carrying a weapon.
The police internal affairs division is investigating the shooting.
""What happened to Iyad al-Halaq is a tragedy. This was a man with disabilities, autism, who was suspected - and we (now) know wrongly - of being a terrorist in a very sensitive venue,"" Netanyahu said in comments that stopped short of an apology.
Palestinians have drawn comparisons between the Palestinian man's fatal encounter with police and the death in the United States of African-American George Floyd after a police officer in Minneapolis pressed a knee into his neck while detaining him.
Hundreds of people attended Halaq's funeral a week ago.
Palestinian officials and Halaq's family said he suffered from severe autism and panicked and ran after the officers confronted him.
""I know that (police) are conducting examinations. We all share in the grief of the family,"" Netanyahu said in public remarks to his cabinet.
Addressing Internal Security Minister Amir Ohana, who is responsible for police, at the cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said: ""I expect your full investigation into this matter.""
A police spokesman could not immediately be reached on Sunday to provide information on whether any action had been taken so far against the officers.

At last week's cabinet session, Defence Minister Benny Gantz, Netanyahu's centrist partner in Israel's new unity government, publicly apologized for Halaq's death. The right-wing Netanyahu, sitting next to him, kept silent at the time.

Lebanon maintains a fragile sectarian balance since its many religious sects fought a 1975-1990 civil war with factions often backed by regional rivals.
A financial crisis that began late last year, rooted in decades of state waste and corruption, is seen as the biggest threat to the country's stability since the war.
""Our strength remains in our national unity...What happened last night is a warning bell,"" Aoun's office quoted him as saying on Twitter. ""We must put our political disputes aside and hurry to work together to revive our country from the depth of the successive crises."" 
Gunfire was heard in some Beirut neighbourhoods and suburbs on Saturday night during scuffles between supporters of rival parties, local media reported. Security forces deployed in large numbers.
Calm returned after a tense standoff in a Christian-Shi'ite district linked to the start of the civil war, along a former frontline, local media said.

Earlier on Saturday, security forces had fired tear gas at protesters who threw rocks, angry at the ruling elite and its handling of the crisis.

981,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 07, 2020 04:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Russian hiring of Syrians to fight in Libya accelerated in May,"(Reuters) - A Russian drive to recruit Syrians to fight in Libya for militia leader Khalifa Haftar accelerated in May when hundreds of mercenaries were signed up, five Syrian opposition sources and a regional source familiar with the matter said.
Private military contractor Wagner Group is conducting the hiring with Russian army supervision, according to two senior Syrian opposition sources and the regional source. A former Wagner Group member said it first sent Syrians to Libya in 2019.
The Russian Defence Ministry and the Wagner group did not respond to questions from Reuters.
Turkey, meanwhile, says it is providing military support to the other side of the conflict, the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) based in Tripoli.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said in February that fighters from the Turkey-backed Syrian National Army were in Libya, as well as Turkey's own military.
Russia has been a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, helping him crush the rebellion at home. Moscow's involvement in Libya is an extension of its ambition to project influence in the Eastern Mediterranean, some experts say.
Egypt and the United Arab Emirates have also lent support to Haftar because they suspect the GNA of having ties to the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group they strongly oppose.
Turkey, on the other hand, has made deals with the GNA over maritime borders and wants to protect its own interests in the region.
ECHOES OF SYRIA
The involvement of Russia and Turkey on opposite sides of the Libyan conflict has echoes of the war in Syria, where they have also backed warring parties. It also risks exacerbating the conflict, experts have warned.
""Russia and Turkey are both escalating their fire power and force numbers in Libya, where Europe has been caught on its heels,"" said Joshua Landis, head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma.
""Russia has tried to match Turkey's effort to send Syrian mercenaries, but with mixed results.""
Wagner has up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya, according to a confidential U.N. report seen by Reuters in May. The Russian state has denied having forces in Libya. 
When asked in January if the Wagner Group is fighting in Libya, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if there are Russians in Libya, they are not representing the Russian state, nor are they paid by the state.
A spokesman for Haftar's Libyan National Army denied it had recruited Syrian fighters. It has repeatedly highlighted the presence of Syrians fighting alongside its enemy.
U.S. officials said on May 7 they believed Russia was working with Assad to transfer militia fighters and equipment to Libya.
The Syrian government's information ministry did not respond to questions sent via email.
Haftar's adversary, the GNA, has been supplied with drones, air defences and advisers from Turkey.
GNA deputy defence minister Saleh Namroush said its request for military support was in response to what he called ""international meddling in Libya.""
""Turkey is the only country that was willing to help us end the widescale civilian killing and destruction by the UAE, Russia and others,"" he said.
PACE OF HIRING INCREASES
New recruits to the Russian effort in support of Haftar included 300 from the Homs area, among them former Free Syrian Army fighters, according to one of the two senior opposition sources, and some 320 from the southwest, a third source said.
The pace of hiring increased as Libya's fighting intensified and the war in Syria died down, the regional source said.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which reports on the Syrian conflict using a network of sources on the ground, more than 900 Syrians were recruited by Russia to fight in Libya in May.
The fighters are trained at a base in Homs before going to Libya, according to the sources who cited salaries ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 a month. 
The movement of fighters into Libya violates a U.N. arms embargo and the U.N.'s acting Libya envoy on May 19 urged the Security Council to stop ""a massive influx of weaponry, equipment and mercenaries"".
Many former Syrian rebels stayed behind in areas recovered by Damascus and its Russian allies, signing agreements that required them to pledge loyalty to the state. But their lives remain tightly restricted and monitored by the authorities.
Since 2014, Libya has been split between areas controlled by the Tripoli government and territory held by Haftar’s eastern-based forces in Benghazi. 
Haftar is supported by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, according to U.N. experts and some security sources. The countries deny direct involvement in the conflict.
Despite this backing, forces loyal to the GNA captured Haftar's last major stronghold near Tripoli on Friday, capping the sudden collapse of his 14-month offensive on the capital.
On Thursday, Erdogan vowed to ramp up Turkey's support for its ally in Libya to lock in the gains. On Saturday, Haftar was in Egypt, where President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced a new peace plan.

The retreat, reversing many of Haftar's gains from last year, extends the GNA's control of most of northwest Libya. Haftar and allied groups still control the east and much of the south, as well as most of Libya's oilfields, however.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australians who defied public health rules and rallied in support of the U.S. ""Black Lives Matter"" movement were reckless and self-indulgent, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said on Sunday.
More than 20,000 people protested in Sydney and other cities on Saturday, in solidarity with U.S. anger over the death of a black man in police custody and calling for an end to similar deaths of indigenous Australians.
Cormann said the protesters risked a second outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
""I think it is incredibly selfish,"" Cormann told Sky News. ""It's incredibly self-indulgent.""
Australia has had 7,255 cases of the coronavirus and 102 deaths, avoiding the higher tolls seen elsewhere because of border closures and strict social distancing since March. Small outbreaks, however, still emerge.
The protests came despite calls by authorities for people to stay at home and obey social-distancing rules that allow only for small groups to gather.
Cormann later told reporters that many Australians had lost their jobs, the economy had suffered and people had been unable to attend funerals of loved ones in order to stop the virus.
""But we are going to have a mass gathering of tens of thousands of people in complete breach of the rules that apply to everyone else, it is absolutely reckless and irresponsible,"" he said.
The deputy leader of the opposition Labor opposition, Richard Marles, said he while he was ""uncomfortable"" with the protests, he was not casting judgement. 
""If you are born indigenous in this country, your life stands to be materially worse than those of us who are born non-indigenous in terms of child mortality, education, employment and incarceration,"" Marles said on ABC's ""Insiders"" programme.

KINGSTON (Reuters) - Wearing black and braving a blistering sun, Jamaicans gathered on Saturday to lend support to global protests against police abuses sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.
Several hundred people stood outside the U.S. Embassy in Kingston with signs and t-shirts reading ""Black Lives Matter"" and ""Enough is Enough,"" demanding justice for Floyd as well as Jamaicans who have died at the hands of security forces.
Floyd, a black American, died in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest.
The Kingston protests were peaceful, and police mostly stood by watching as demonstrators voiced their concerns.
""I am here to protest against injustice and systematic racism,"" said Michael Pottinger, 58.
According to a government-backed study, over 3,000 Jamaicans have been killed by law enforcement officials since 2000.
In a country where the vast majority of people are of African descent, Jamaicans say racism can take on subtler forms.
Jemila Henry, 23, expressed solidarity with U.S. protesters and wanted to raise awareness of local problems.
""You have persons in Jamaica who don't believe we experience anything remotely racist, but technically it can be described as colorism,"" she said, noting that Jamaicans with lighter skin are perceived as superior to those with darker skin.
Alice Hogarth, 70, who organized a separate protest at Emancipation Park in central Kingston, said racism due to skin color might be less blatant, ""but we have classism here.""
Human rights activist Lloyd D'Aguilar, who attended the protest at the U.S. Embassy, was concerned about a lack of action on killings by security forces in Jamaica.

""There are never any follow-up protests,"" he said. ""The positive is that people are paying attention to the massive protests in the United States - this is where we need to go.""

Kaohsiung police said city council speaker Hsu Kun-yuan jumped to his death from his 17th-floor apartment a few hours after the announcement of Han's defeat, though the case is still being investigated.
Hsu, 63, was a strong Han supporter and like him a member of the KMT.
Han wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that he was heartbroken.
""I am very, very grieved, and have no words to express what I feel in my heart,"" he said.
KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang, who took over after January's defeat promising a thorough party overhaul including rethinking its unpopular policy of seeking closer ties with China, expressed his sorrow and called for calm to prevail after the recall vote. 
""The sudden death of the speaker makes us worry that social antagonism has intensified.""
The DPP said it was shocked by the news, and called for people not to speculate about what had happened before the police had completed their investigations.
The recall vote took place against the backdrop of further tensions with China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if needed.
It also happened at the same time as renewed anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong against Beijing-backed national security legislation.
The protesters have widespread public sympathy in Taiwan and have won rare cross-party support on the island.

President Donald Trump has ordered the U.S. military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany, a senior U.S. official said on Friday.
""Should it come to the withdrawal of part of the U.S. troops, we take note of this. We appreciate the cooperation with the U.S. forces that has developed over decades. It is in the interests of both our countries,"" Maas told Bild am Sonntag.
Maas acknowledged problems in Germany's relationship with the United States, saying: ""We are close partners in the transatlantic alliance. But: It is complicated.""
On Saturday, senior lawmakers from German Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling conservative bloc criticised Trump's decision to order the U.S. military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany.

A U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said on Friday the troops move was the result of months of work by the top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, and had nothing to do with tensions between Trump and Merkel, who thwarted Trump's plan to host a G7 meeting this month.

Enrique Alfaro, governor of the western region of Jalisco, said he was appalled that police in the state capital Guadalajara had on Friday beaten people who were demonstrating over the death of man in police custody last month.
""It embarrasses me, it distresses me, it greatly pains me as a man from Jalisco, and as governor,"" Alfaro said in a video posted on Twitter.
After Friday's clashes, local media reported more than a dozen people were missing after being abducted by armed men. Alfaro said he had given orders for the missing people to be tracked down.
""We're checking one by one,"" he said, ""one by one in their homes.""
The disappearance and apparent massacre of 43 student teachers in Mexico in 2014 sparked outrage and did lasting damage to the reputation of former president Enrique Pena Nieto.
Inspired by the case of George Floyd, a black American man who died in Minneapolis last month after a white police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest, protests over police abuses have flared up in other parts of the world.
Floyd's death helped drive demonstrations over the fate of Giovanni Lopez, who died in police custody in Jalisco last month after reportedly being detained by municipal officers for not wearing a face mask to contain the spread of coronavirus.
A resulting demonstration triggered clashes and the arrest of protesters in Guadalajara on Thursday. Alfaro said he was had decided to release the detainees without charges.

A few dozen demonstrators assembled in Guadalajara for another protest on Saturday afternoon.

The Sunday Times said Johnson wanted to relax planning restrictions that stop many pubs, cafes and restaurants from using outside areas, and also to make it legal to hold weddings outside - something currently limited to Jews and Quakers.
Indoor weddings and funerals with up to 10 people attending would also be permitted from early July, while places of worship would be allowed to reopen for private prayer from June 15, as part of plans to be announced in the coming week, the newspaper said.

A spokeswoman for Johnson's Downing Street office had no immediate comment on the report.
Separately, the Sunday Telegraph said Johnson planned to announce in the coming weeks that the government would speed up road improvements and the construction of 40 new hospitals it had promised before last December's election.

LONDON (Reuters) - British anti-racism protesters briefly clashed with mounted police on Saturday after thousands gathered in central London to voice their anger at police brutality after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
After a largely peaceful day, small numbers of protesters near Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Downing Street residence threw bottles at police, and mounted officers charged at protesters to push them back. One officer required hospital treatment after falling from her horse, police said.
Later a group of protesters attacked a dummy resembling U.S. President Donald Trump, while others threw flares.
More than a thousand protesters marched past the U.S. Embassy on the south bank of the River Thames.
Thousands of protesters also crowded into the square outside parliament, holding ""Black Lives Matter"" placards and ignoring government advice to avoid large gatherings due to the risk from coronavirus.
""I have come down in support of black people who have been ill-treated for many, many, many, many years. It is time for a change,"" said one protester, 39-year-old primary school teacher Aisha Pemberton.
Another protester, IT specialist Kena David, 32, said Britain was guilty of racist abuses too. ""Everything you see around you is built off the backs of black and brown bodies.""
Saturday's protests reflect global anger over police treatment of ethnic minorities, sparked by the May 25 killing of Floyd when a white police officer detaining him knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as fellow officers stood by.
Demonstrations also took place in other British, European and Asian cities on Saturday, after tens of thousands of people chanting ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"" marched through central London on Wednesday. 
Reclusive street artist Banksy published a new artwork online showing the U.S. flag being set alight by a candle that formed part of a memorial to an anonymous, black, silhouetted figure.
Before Saturday's protest in London, the U.S. ambassador to Britain condemned Floyd's death and said the United States needed to do more to fight racism and injustice.

""It is through peaceful protests that injustice is most successfully addressed,"" said Ambassador Woody Johnson.

Protesting in face masks and keeping their distance from each other under coronavirus restrictions, they gathered under the banner ""No to annexation, no to occupation, yes to peace and democracy"". Some waved Palestinian flags.
The protest was organised by left-wing groups and did not appear to be the start of a popular mass movement. Around half of Israelis support annexation, according to a recent opinion poll.
The organisers screened a video address by U.S. Democratic Senator Bernie Sanders.
""It has never been more important to stand up for justice, and to fight for the future we all deserve,"" Sanders said. ""It’s up to all of us to stand up to authoritarian leaders and to build a peaceful future for every Palestinian and every Israeli."" 
The Palestinians want an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip, territories Israel captured in a 1967 Middle East war. 
Netanyahu has set July 1 as the date to begin advancing his plan to annex Israel's settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, hoping for a green light from Washington. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has unveiled a peace plan that includes Israel keeping its settlements and the Palestinians establishing a state under stringent conditions. 
Palestinians have rejected the proposal and voiced outrage against Israel's proposed annexation.

Warning of possible violence and diplomatic repercussions, some European and Arab states, together with the United Nations, have urged Israel not to annex its settlements, regarded by many countries as illegal.

However, the figures are unlikely to be an immediate concern for Johnson, who does not need to hold an election until 2024 after winning a comfortable parliamentary majority in December. 
The sharpest swing came in a poll conducted by Survation on June 3, which had support for the Conservatives falling to 41% from 45% in the previous poll, conducted in the period May 22-26. Support for the opposition Labour Party rose by five points to 39%.
Surveys for Deltapoll and Opinium, both conducted on June 4-5, showed the Conservative lead narrowing to three percentage points. 
Opinium said 47% of people surveyed disapproved of the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis, against 34% who approved, extending a steady deterioration in confidence in the government since the crisis started.
Britain has suffered Europe's highest reported death toll from COVID-19, with more than 50,000 deaths according to a Reuters tally this week based on official sources.

A survey on Thursday by the market research company Kantar indicated that British people had lost a greater degree of confidence in their government than citizens of any other country in the G7 group of large, advanced economies.

The attackers on Friday targeted the village of Binedama in the Mopti region, which has seen dozens of tit-for-tat ethnic massacres over the past few years.
The Fulani, semi-nomadic herders present across West Africa, have been accused by rival farming communities of supporting local jihadist groups, making them targets of violence from ethnic vigilante militias and sometimes government forces. 
Moulaye Guindo, the mayor of the commune of Bankass, which neighbours the commune to which Binedama belongs, said between 20 and 30 people were killed by men in military attire. 
Fulani association Tabital Pulaaku said 29 people were killed, including a 9-year-old girl. It blamed the attack on Malian soldiers, who it said surrounded the village in pick-up trucks before killing the villagers and setting houses on fire. 
""The victims are all from the peaceful civilian population .. who had not committed any crime except for their ethnic identity,"" Tabital Pulaaku said in a statement. 
Mali's army spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. 
Human rights groups have accused the Malian military in the past of conducting extrajudicial killings, kidnappings, torture and arbitrary arrests against suspected jihadist sympathisers - charges it has promised to investigate.
In 2018, the government said some of its soldiers were implicated in ""gross violations"" after the discovery of mass graves in the centre of the country.
Mali has been in crisis since 2012 when al Qaeda-linked militants seized its desert north. French forces intervened the following year to drive them back, but the militants have since regrouped and extended their operations into neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.

WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - An indigenous chief alleged on Saturday that Canadian police beat him in March after an incident involving an expired licence plate on his truck.
Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), however, say officers used reasonable force after Chief Allan Adam of Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation resisted arrest, and laid criminal charges against him.
Adam made the allegations as anti-racism protests spread across the United States and Canada, following the death of George Floyd. The black man died in Minneapolis in police custody on May 25.
Indigenous people have long said they face violent treatment from Canadian police.
Adam, speaking in Fort McMurray, Alberta, said RCMP approached his parked truck on March 10 as he and his wife prepared to leave a casino in the city.
After police refused to answer why they had pulled up, the couple began to drive away, before an officer ordered them to stop and pulled Adam's wife from the driver's seat, Adam said. 
He then intervened. An officer grabbed his arm while a second one knocked him down and punched him, Adam said.
""We are a minority and nobody speaks up for us,"" Adam said. ""The RCMP always seems to use excessive force. That has to stop.""
According to RCMP, officers approached an unoccupied and idling vehicle with an expired plate. Adam returned to the vehicle and a confrontation occurred, said RCMP Const. Patrick Lambert.
Senior police reviewed in-car video and determined the officers' actions were reasonable and an external investigation not justified, he said.
Adam's lawyer called for police to release the video and suspend one officer.
The chief is due in court on July 2, charged with resisting arrest and assaulting police.
Adam said he waited to publicize the incident because he was busy with pandemic precautions.

LISBON/BERLIN (Reuters) - Portugal's prosecutor's office said on Saturday it would pore over its files to see if a German man suspected of murdering British girl Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in the southern Algarve region in 2007, has a criminal record there.
Germany is investigating a 43-year-old German national on suspicion of murder, the Braunschweig state prosecutor said on Thursday.. 
Lawyer Jan-Christian Hochmann confirmed to Reuters on Saturday he was representing the suspect, Christian B., but declined to comment. 
German police said on Wednesday that the suspect lived in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and that he worked in the catering industry while also burgling holiday flats and drug dealing. The suspect is currently in detention over a different matter.
On Friday, the prosecutor general's office in Portugal said there were no records of crimes committed by the suspect in the Algarve. 
However on Saturday, asked specifically about German court documents citing his past convictions in Portugal and his own confession in a German court of at least two cases of theft, the prosecutor's office said, ""Given the new elements that have arisen, we will revise our search"".
The Portuguese prosecutors said on Friday that the only records they had of the suspect were five requests for international judiciary cooperation, at least one related to the McCann case. They would not say if the man had ever been investigated in Portugal in relation to the McCann case.
McCann, aged 3, vanished from her bedroom on May 3, 2007 while her parents were dining with friends nearby in the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz, sparking an international search.
In Germany, the Braunschweig state prosecutor said on Thursday the suspect was a sex offender with multiple convictions, including for sexual abuse of children, and that authorities assumed the child was dead. No body has ever been found.
Joaquim Braz, 50, who lives near Praia da Luz, said he remembered the suspect: ""I didn't like him very much. I remember him very well but he kept to himself"".
Strolling by the beach on Saturday in Praia da Luz, Danny Townsend, 53, who bought his holiday home the year McCann vanished and moved there permanently 18 months ago from England, said it was important that the authorities got to the bottom of what happened.

""It's a nice place and it would be great if we could get to the point it's resolved and people can move on but in the meantime we have to live with it I guess,"" added Townsend.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hundreds of Lebanese protesters took to the streets on Saturday to voice outrage over the government's handling of a deep economic crisis, with security forces firing tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse rock-throwing demonstrators.
The first big protests since the government rolled back coronavirus lockdown measures come as Beirut negotiates an International Monetary Fund package it hopes will secure billions of dollars in financing to prop up its collapsing economy.
Protesters burned garbage bins and ransacked a furniture shop in the capital's upscale shopping district, smashing its storefront and hauling out a couch to block a road.
Security forces responded by firing rounds of tear gas, footage from Lebanese broadcasters showed.
Some demonstrators waved banners demanding better living conditions and called for early parliamentary elections, tougher measures to fight corruption and the disarming of powerful Shi'ite paramilitary group Hezbollah.
""As long as there are militias that are stronger than the state, then it (the government) will not be able to fight corruption,"" said John Moukarzel, a real estate company owner.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab took office in January with the support of the Iran-backed Hezbollah and its allies after the previous government was toppled by the protests that erupted last October. 
Lebanon's economic woes have reached new depths in recent months. The pound currency has lost more than half of its value on the parallel market, prices have soared, and companies dealing with the double blow of the coronavirus have axed jobs.

""You can sense that everyone is tired and the situation is very hard, especially the economy, so you can sense that people no longer want to be festive (in their protests). People are just angry,"" said protester Marie-nour Hojaimy, a lawyer.

The total death toll since the outbreak emerged on Feb. 21 now stands at 33,846, the agency said, the fourth highest in the world after those of the United States, Britain and Brazil.
People registered as currently carrying the illness fell to 35,877 from 36,976 the day before.
With a total number of confirmed cases at 234,801, Italy now has the seventh highest global tally after India overtook it a day earlier.

The next worst-hit region, Piedmont, reported 38 new cases and of the country's 20 regions, the only others to register more than 10 new cases were Lazio, with 28, Emilia Romagna with 17 and Liguria with 13.
On Wednesday, Italy lifted travel restrictions on movement between regions and some regional governors have complained that allowing people to travel freely out of Lombardy could spark new areas of contagion elsewhere in the country.
There were 293 people in intensive care on Saturday, down from 316 on Friday, maintaining a long-running decline. Of those originally infected, 165,078 were declared recovered against 163,781 a day earlier.

""I was really looking forward to coming back. To see how it has come back to life makes me very emotional,"" said masters student Alejandro Elizalde, who wiped away tears while viewing Diego de Velazquez's ""Las Meninas"", one of the Prado's most famous paintings. 
The government shut state-run museums on March 12 as it locked down the country to curb the coronavirus spread. Curbs have been lifted gradually, with Madrid one of the slowest places to ease restrictions as it was among the worst hit.
The Prado and Reina Sofia are not yet fully open, but many masterpieces, including works by Velazquez and Goya in the Prado and Picasso's ""Guernica"" in the Reina Sofia, are on display. 
Health measures are in force, including social distancing, reduced capacity and timed tickets for visits. Staff took visitors' temperatures as they entered the Prado.
Many people noted how quiet the museums were. As one of Madrid's major tourist draws, a usual Saturday would have seen them packed with visitors. 
""It's a really weird feeling and at the same time it's really good because I've never been in the Reina Sofia with so few people,"" said business developer Elena Vázquez.
Spain has so far recorded 27,134 deaths and 240,978 cases of the coronavirus. It will further ease the lockdown in Madrid and Barcelona from Monday, when bar and restaurant patrons will be allowed to sit inside rather than just on outdoor terraces.

Cafes, restaurants and other facilities had reopened on Monday as infection rates slowed and restrictions on intercity travel had been lifted as the infection rate slowed. But Erdogan had intended to maintain the weekend lockdown, applied to big cities since April 11, until a public backlash.
On Saturday, people flooded beaches and shores in Istanbul, and hundreds queued to get into parks. Others bought ice cream in the warm weather - under new hygiene rules. In the capital, Ankara, daytrippers caused traffic jams.
""The last time I was here was 70 days ago,"" said Gulay Cevik, a housewife in Istanbul who was fishing in the Eminonu district. ""I would always come here to fish, but since the outbreak we've had to protect ourselves a bit. But I really missed it.""

Sisi, who was also accompanied in Cairo by eastern Libyan parliament head Aguila Saleh, said the plan included a call for negotiations in Geneva and for the exit of all foreign fighters from Libya.
Libya has had no stable central authority since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed rebels in 2011. For more than five years it has had rival parliaments and governments in the east and the west, with streets often controlled by armed groups.
Sisi's announcement comes after the abrupt collapse of a 14-month offensive by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) to try to take control of the capital, Tripoli.
The retreat, reversing many of Haftar's gains from last year when he raced towards Tripoli, extends the control of the rival Government of National Accord (GNA) across most of northwest Libya. Haftar and allied groups still control the east and much of the south, as well as most of Libya's oilfields, however.
Egypt along with the United Arab Emirates and Russia have provided support for Haftar, but that backing has been outweighed in recent months by Turkish military backing for the GNA.
Haftar is a deeply divisive figure whose offensive upended a U.N.-led peace process, and it is unclear how much traction any initiative proposed by him or his allies could gain.
Multiple previous attempts to establish truces and a return to negotiations have foundered, though the United Nations has started holding separate talks with both sides for a ceasefire deal in recent days.

The move would reduce U.S. troops numbers in Germany to 25,000, from 34,500.
""The plans once again show that the Trump administration is neglecting an elementary leadership task: the involvement of alliance partners in decision-making processes,"" Johann Wadephul, foreign policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, told Reuters.
All NATO partners benefited from the cohesion of the alliance, and only Russia and China gain from discord, Wadephul said, adding: ""This should be given more attention in Washington"".
Wadephul also spoke of a ""further wake-up call"" to Europeans to position themselves better in terms of security policy.
The German Foreign Ministry declined to comment.
Andreas Nick, like Wadephul a member of the parliamentary foreign relations committee, told Deutsche Welle the indications were that ""that the decision was not a technical but a purely politically motivated decision"".
A U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said on Friday the move was the result of months of work by the top U.S. military officer, General Mark Milley, and had nothing to do with tensions between Trump and Merkel, who thwarted Trump's plan to host a G7 meeting this month.

The withdrawal, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is the latest twist in relations between Berlin and Washington, which have often been strained during Trump's presidency. Trump has pressed Germany to raise defense spending and accused Berlin of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to its energy reliance.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The case of a Kurdish man who says he was stopped and shoved to the ground by Tokyo police became a rallying cry for protesters marching in solidarity with Black Lives Matter on Saturday.
Several hundred people chanting ""I can't breathe"" to invoke the death of George Floyd in the United States marched through the trendy Shibuya district on a sultry afternoon, saying that police abuse - particularly against foreigners - was a problem at home as well. 
""I feel very sad,"" said Tomohiko Tsurumi, 43, who joined the march with his wife. ""I always thought of this country as very safe and I realized that there is so much (police action) we cannot see.""
The 33-year-old Turkish man of Kurdish origin, who asked not to be named, told Reuters this week that he was stopped by police driving in downtown Tokyo on May 22 - three days before George Floyd died in Minneapolis when a police office knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.
When the man would not allow police to search his car, two officers shouted at him and shoved him to the ground, the man said. A friend in his car filmed part of the incident. 
Police declined to comment, saying they have not made anything public about the incident.
The video, seen by Reuters, includes the officers yelling at him to sit and not make trouble. One of the officers can be seen kicking the man in the leg before making him crouch on the ground. 
That officer can be seen with his arms around the man’s neck, telling him to be quiet.
""I couldn't breathe. If my friend hadn't been filming I don't know what would have happened,"" the man said, adding the encounter left him with bruises on his neck and back.
""This was in the middle of the day and I was on the way to my dentist,"" said the man, who said he has lived in Japan for 15 years and was not at Saturday's protest due to what organizers said was fear of being arrested. ""That's what's so upsetting.""
The man filed an assault suit against the two officers with Tokyo prosecutors on May 27, said his lawyer, Yasuaki Nara. 
An African man at the demonstration with a friend said their appearance got them more scrutiny from Japanese police.

""I feel what George Floyd was feeling,"" he said, declining to give his name or his country of origin. ""We feel what his family is feeling.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser has drawn a battle line right up to the White House.
Bowser, one of seven black female mayors of America's 100 largest cities, on Friday declared a small but symbolic patch of the U.S. capital - a section of 16th Street bounded by a church on one side and Lafayette Square (NYSE:SQ) opposite the White House on the other - ""Black Lives Matter Plaza."" 
The Democratic mayor then had the District Of Columbia's departments of transportation and public works paint giant yellow letters spelling ""Black Lives Matter"" followed by the city's flag on the street spanning two city blocks leading to plaza. To finish, Bowser posted on Twitter a video taken from a nearby roof showing the White House overlooking the results. 
""There are people who are craving to be heard and to be seen,"" Bowser told a news conference, ""and to have their humanity recognized, and we had the opportunity to send that message loud and clear on a very important street in our city.""
Glynda Carr, president and chief executive of Higher Heights for America PAC, a political action committee dedicated to helping more liberal black women win elective office, said Bowser ""showed the world that she leads, unbought and unbossed."" Carr's organization has never raised money for Bowser.
For his part, the Republican president denounced Bowser as ""incompetent.""
Washington's status as the seat of the federal government has not always been a comfortable fit for its residents or elected leaders. The city's population of about 700,000 people - 46.4% black and 45.6% white, according to the Census Bureau - is politically liberal and heavily Democratic. 
The ongoing protests over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last month, have heightened that tension and thrust Bowser - mayor since 2015 - into the national spotlight. 
Bowser has supported peaceful demonstrators while denouncing violence and looting. Trump has advocated a militarized response to civil unrest and even summoned a contingent of active-duty troops to Washington, though they were never deployed on the streets. Bowser said she did not want any out-of-state military forces in Washington. 
When Trump threatened protesters who come near the White House with ""vicious dogs"" and ""ominous weapons,"" Bowser shot back with a comment that summed up their relationship.
""There are no vicious dogs & ominous weapons. There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone. ... I call upon our city and our nation to exercise great restraint even while this President continues to try to divide us,"" Bowser wrote on Twitter.
After baton-swinging federal police fired smoke canisters, flashbang grenades and rubber bullets to drive away peaceful protesters near the White House so Trump on Monday could pose holding a Bible in front of a church near what is now ""Black Lives Matter Plaza,"" Bowser called the scene ""shameful.""
A single mother to a toddler, Bowser is only the second woman to serve as Washington's mayor and the first to win a second term in office.
Like other elected officials in Washington over the years, Bowser has advocated statehood for the District of Columbia, which has no voting members of Congress even as states with smaller populations have two senators and one member of the House of Representatives. Washington's mayor was a federal appointee until the 1970s when the city was granted ""home rule"" and began electing its mayors.
Bowser also clashed with Trump during the federal government shutdown in 2019, over relief funds offered to the city during the coronavirus pandemic and over his plans to hold a grand military parade in the capital.
Trump castigated her on Twitter on Friday.

""The incompetent Mayor of Washington, D.C., @MayorBowser, who's budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for 'handouts,' is now fighting with the National Guard,"" Trump wrote.

""The President said he was monitoring the (Hong Kong) situation closely and reiterated France's support for the principle of 'one country, two systems',"" the official told Reuters on Saturday.
China has approved security legislation for Hong Kong that democracy activists, diplomats and some in business fear will jeopardise its semi-autonomous status and its role as a global financial hub. 
The legislation has reignited tensions between Washington and Beijing, and led the European Union to express ""grave concern"" last week.
Hong Kong was discussed during an hour and a half phone call on Friday between Macron and Xi, the official said. 
The Elysee had reported the call in a statement late on Friday without mentioning Hong Kong. 

The statement also referred to cooperation in tackling the coronavirus pandemic, saying Macron stressed the essential role of the World Health Organization, blamed by Washington for mishandling the crisis.

The Central Asian nation has frequently been criticised by human rights groups for requiring public rallies to have been approved by authorities. However President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a law late last month removing this provision.
But officials said that, while the law technically took effect on Saturday, it would need a five-day notice period before being applied in practice. They said opposition groups had failed to notify authorities about their plans to rally, and were also breaching COVID-19 social distancing rules.
Police, including riot units, cordoned off the main squares of Almaty as well as streets near the area where at least 100 activists had gathered, breaking up the protesters into smaller groups of dozens of people each.
At least one group of activists carried a banner that read ""I can't breathe"" - a reference to the death of George Floyd, an unarmed American black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, which sparked riots across the United States. 
Some protesters also chanted ""Old man, go away!"" a reference to former President Nursultan Nazarbayev who retains sweeping powers in the former Soviet nation.
Among their other demands were the resignation of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, Nazarbayev's ally who took over following his resignation last year, and a fairer redistribution of wealth. 
""Why are people poor in a country rich with oil and gas?"" read one banner.
After a brief confrontation, police detained a few dozen protesters and took them away in minivans.

The oil-rich nation of 19 million people has been hit hard by a drop in crude prices as well as the fallout from the novel coronavirus pandemic. More than four million people lost their sources of income during a two-month lockdown that ended last month, according to official data.

(Reuters) - All 57 members of a police tactical unit in Buffalo have resigned from that team to protest the suspension of two colleagues who were filmed shoving a 75-year-old man to the ground, officials of the northern New York city said on Friday.
Two members of the Buffalo Police Department's Emergency Response Team were suspended on Thursday and are being investigated after a local radio station released video of the incident involving the protester, Martin Gugino.
The video, which has been viewed more than 70 million times, shows the white-haired Gugino approaching a line of officers in riot gear. One officer pushes him with a baton and a second one with his hand. He falls, a crack is heard and blood trickles from his head, as officers walk by his still body.
Local media quoted Buffalo Police Benevolent Association President John Evans as saying the officers were doing their job, and that their colleagues on the response team had resigned from the special unit to protest their treatment. The 57 remain police officers, Buffalo Police Commissioner Byron Lockwood said in a statement. Evans could not be reached for comment.
Earlier on Friday a spokeswoman for the local county's district attorney, Kait Munro, said the two officers are under investigation for potential criminal liability in connection with Thursday evening's incident outside city hall.
Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told a press conference on Friday that contingency plans were in place to address any policing issues due to the resignations and he said state troopers were embedded with Buffalo police to shore up their operations.
""I can say that Buffalo will be safe this weekend,"" he said.
Brown said Gugino had been ""asked to leave numerous times"" from the area because of the city's curfew.
Prior to the incident ""there were conflicts between protesters,"" Brown said. ""There was a danger of fights breaking out between protesters, and the police felt it was very important to clear that scene for the safety of protesters.""
Even so, the video footage has raised further questions about police behavior, after the death of African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis set off nationwide street protests.
The video shows the majority of the officers march past Gugino, though the officer who pushed him with a baton starts to lean over him before he is motioned away by another officer. Someone is heard calling for a medic.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday he had spoken with Gugino and was thankful he survived. Cuomo said the police chief should fire the officers involved. 
""You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing. ""Why, why, why was that necessary? Where was the threat?""
Gugino, who is white, could not be reached. According to a community organizer who has known him for a decade, he is a longtime activist who has advocated for affordable housing, climate justice and police accountability and regularly protested outside the Erie County Holding Center, a Buffalo jail that has come under scrutiny for a string of inmate deaths. 
""I've been doing this work for around 10 years, and I can't remember a protest Martin wasn't at,"" said John Washington, an organizer at People's Action in Buffalo. ""Whatever the issues of justice were he stepped up and was always there.""

Washington said Gugino had gone to the demonstration to protest brutality by police but ""clearly"" posed no danger to the officers. He said he had only been able to confirm Gugino was in stable condition.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Australians rallied on Saturday in solidarity with U.S. protesters angered by the death of a black man in police custody, after authorities in one area lifted a ban on the gatherings under the country's social-distancing rules. 
A last-minute appeal at the New South Wales Court of Appeal allowed a rally in Sydney, where several thousand people marched among heavy police presence, chanting, ""Whose lives matter? Black Lives matter.""
Inspired by the death of George Floyd - who died in Minneapolis after a white policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes - Australians were also calling all for an end to police mistreatment of indigenous Australians.
The protests came despite earlier urging from authorities to stay home and obey social-distancing rules imposed to combat the spread of the coronavirus. These allow only for small groups to gather outside.
After the court ruling, the New South Wales police urged people via Twitter to ""keep a safe physical distance,"" saying they were there to ""facilitate"" people's movement. 
In the United States on Friday, prominent Democratic politicians adopted the slogans of the nationwide protests and announced reforms, as tensions remained high in major cities after days of largely peaceful protests that saw sporadic violence.
More than 10,000 people rallied in Brisbane, according to police estimates, with many protesters wrapped in indigenous flags. 
Many protesters wore black masks with handwritten ""I can't breathe"" signs on them - Floyd's last words, which have become a rallying cry worldwide for the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement.
In Melbourne, more than 5,000 people gathered, where organisers reading out a long list of names of indigenous Australians killed either by police or who died in police custody.

""We don't want anything that's going to take away from our message that Black Lives Matter,"" Sue Ann Hunter, a member of the Wurundjeri Aboriginal nation, told ABC News.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Thousands took to the streets in Australia on Saturday, and hundreds did in Japan, to support protests across the United States against police brutality, while demonstrations were expected in South Korea with a virtual rally in Thailand.
The rolling, global protests reflect rising anger over police treatment of ethnic minorities, sparked by the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis after a police officer detaining him knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes as fellow officers stood by.
Demonstrations, however, were limited by social-distancing curbs aiming at stopping the novel coronavirus pandemic.
In the United States on Friday, prominent Democratic politicians adopted the slogans of the protests and announced reforms, as tensions remained high in major cities after days of largely peaceful protests that saw sporadic violence.
In Brisbane, police estimated 10,000 people joined a peaceful protest, wearing masks and holding ""Black Lives Matter"" placards. Many wrapped themselves in indigenous flags, calling for an end to police mistreatment of indigenous Australians.
In Sydney, a last-minute court decision overruled a coronavirus ban as several thousand people marched, amid a heavy police presence, chanting: ""Whose lives matter? Black Lives matter.""
Rallies were also held in Melbourne, Adelaide and other Australian cities.
In Tokyo, marchers protested against what they said was police treatment of a Kurdish man who says he was stopped while driving and shoved to the ground, leaving him with bruises. 
Organisers invoked the U.S. protests, saying they were also marching in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. 
""I want to show that there's racism in Japan now,"" said 17-year-old high school student Wakaba, who declined to give her family name.
She and her friend, Moe, marching in their school uniforms, held a sign saying: ""If you're not angry, you're not paying attention"".
""No justice, no peace, no racist police,"" the crowd chanted.
South Korean activists were planning to march in downtown Seoul later on Saturday, with organisers expecting several hundred people. Coronavirus curbs thwarted plans to gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, they said.
With pandemic restrictions in Bangkok, activists were going online, asking for video and photos of people wearing black, raising their fists and holding signs, and explaining why they ""stand united behind Black Lives Matter"".

The Thai protesters plan to gather on the video-meeting platform Zoom on Sunday and observe 8 minutes 46 seconds of silence - the period that George Floyd was filmed pinned under the officer's knee.

Afghanistan's foreign ministry said in a statement on Friday three Afghans were killed and four injured in Iran's central Yazd province after their vehicle was shot at by Iranian police, triggering the fire. 
Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims.
The boy's plea of ""give me some water, I am burning"" was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice.
""Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,"" said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland.
Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home.
Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border.
At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil.
Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.

The court declared the National Assembly's decisions null and void shortly after the opposition won control of the body in late 2015. With new legislative elections due by the end of this year, the decision marked a setback to efforts between the two sides to agree on conditions for the vote.
Most mainstream opposition parties boycotted the presidential election in 2018, due to concerns President Nicolas Maduro had laid the groundwork to rig the vote. He easily won re-election amid relatively low voter turnout and accusations of irregularities, which he denies. 
The Supreme Court's ruling, in a case came brought by parties seen as close to the government, complained that the congress had not named the authorities in time. The court did not give a timeline for hearing the case. 
""Today's events obstruct the designation of the CNE,"" said Juan Pablo Guanipa, an opposition lawmaker and vice president of the National Assembly, using the Spanish abbreviation for the National Electoral Council. ""They are trying to name a CNE that will worsen the problems.""
A loss of control of the National Assembly by the opposition could complicate the standing of Juan Guaido, the National Assembly president who is recognized as Venezuela's legitimate president by dozens of countries, including the United States and most Western democracies.

Guaido invoked the constitution to assume the role of interim president last January, a claim that was based on his position as leader of the legislative body.

1017,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 09:50PM ET</span>",U.S. protesters call to 'Defund the Police.' What would that look like?,"By Jonathan Allen and Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Nationwide protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, the latest in a long string of high-profile slayings of black men by white officers, have featured a common rallying cry: ""Defund the police.""
The movement predates the current protests and is driven both by anger at the militarized posture of many U.S. police departments and by the recognition they are being called on to confront social ills including addiction, mental illness and homelessness that, advocates say, could be better addressed by spending on social services and rethinking what behaviors should be considered crimes.
Demands on streets from New York to Los Angeles have given higher prominence to the idea, drawing the attention of big-city mayors and on the presidential campaign trail.
WHAT DO PEOPLE MEAN BY 'DEFUND THE POLICE'?
Some envision virtually abolishing modern police departments, which first appeared in the 19th century, and in some southern states grew out of patrols organized to catch runaway slaves.
Others see it as a call to slash city police budgets, which have grown significantly since the 1990s, particularly after a 1994 crime bill signed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, according to criminal justice activists. Policing and corrections accounted for about 30% of general funding in Atlanta and Orlando in 2017, and nearly 40% in Chicago, according to a report from the Center for Popular Democracy, an advocacy group.
Defunding advocates say money saved on policing could then be diverted to social programs.
""They don't think the police can be fixed, so they're trying to figure out how to reduce the burden of policing,"" said Alex Vitale, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College who wrote the 2017 book ""The End of Policing.""
Miski Noor, a member of the Minneapolis-based Black Visions Collective, said the idea gained traction after reforms, including training on de-escalating confrontations and recognizing implicit racial biases, failed to produce structural change.
""The police do not need to be called for every single instance of conflict,"" Noor said.
HOW ARE CITIES RESPONDING?
In Los Angeles, city officials proposed cutting up to $150 million from the police department's $3 billion budget this week, as part of a broader wave of spending cuts. Mayor Eric Garcetti, a Democrat, said the goal was to free up money ""so we can invest in jobs, in health, in education and in healing.""
In New York City, which faces a $9-billion deficit, city council members pushed back against Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio's plans to cut the police budget by less than 1% while slashing youth services by one-third. Council members instead proposed a 5% to 7% cut for all agencies, including police.
Comptroller Scott Stringer has proposed a more sweeping overhaul, saying the city could save $1.1 billion over four years by reducing the number of police officers and cutting overtime. He proposed the savings be put towards ""social workers, counselors, community-based violence interrupters, and other trained professionals.""
WHAT'S THE RISK?
Large-scale reductions in spending could result in a rise in crime, said law-enforcement advocates.
""There will be a backlash as you see crime go up,"" said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who also serves as president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Friday told reporters that ""what I've heard from people in neighborhoods is that they want more police protection not less.""
U.S. Representative Val Demings, a potential running-mate to presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, sounded a similar note.
""We don't have to just maintain law and order and pay no attention to the man on the ground,"" said the black former police chief in Orlando, Florida. ""We can do both.""
Still, Demings said that Democrats need to listen to activists calling for defunding: ""Every discussion moving forward — they should be involved in it.""
Biden had pledged a slate of criminal justice reforms before Floyd's death, including stepping up Department of Justice investigations of police abuse as well as bringing more mental health and substance abuse specialists in to work with law enforcement.
HOW WILL THIS FACTOR INTO THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION?
President Donald Trump, who urged mayors and governors to take a hard line against protesters, seized on the defunding idea as a new attack against Biden.
""The Radical Left Democrats new theme is 'Defund the Police,'"" Trump said in a tweet this week. ""Remember that when you don't want Crime, especially against you and your family. This is where Sleepy Joe is being dragged by the socialists. I am the complete opposite, more money for Law Enforcement!""
Biden has called for a $300-million investment in policing, contingent on officers mirroring the diversity of their communities.
Asked about Garcetti's plans in Los Angeles at a Thursday campaign event, Biden said ""I think it makes sense"" but that the response should vary from community to community. ""It's all about treating people with dignity.""

In the decision, Minister Edson Fachin forbid raids in favelas - as Brazil's informal shantytowns are known - ""except in absolutely exceptional cases,"" which most be pre-approved by the state prosecutor's office.
Rio's police forces are notoriously violent, having killed over 1,800 people in 2019. Innocent bystanders are frequently caught in the crossfire and police are commonly accused of having a shoot-first, ask-questions-later attitude.
In May, police in Rio drew criticism for an operation in which a 14-year-old boy was killed, as well as another shootout in a coronavirus-stricken favela, which drew hundreds into the streets.
Protests in the United States over the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in police custody in Minnesota have served as a catalyst to the protests in Brazil.
""It's a historic decision,"" said Congressman Alessandro Molon, whose PSB party filed the suit that resulted in the decision.

The Andean country is the world's second most biodiverse country after neighboring Brazil and is home to over 50,000 recorded species of animals and plants, which are threatened by deforestation. 
Colombia had been due to host the 2020 edition of World Environment Day, which focuses on biodiversity. However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, events were held virtually. 
""These people, who illegally commercialized Colombia's exotic wildlife, advertised species through social networks or via instant messaging groups and sold them on demand,"" the government said.
During the operation, authorities recovered 502 species of fauna and 38 specimens of flora, and also seized 51 cubic meters of wood.
So far this year environmental authorities in Colombia have seized 52,000 species of flora and 11,436 species of fauna, as well as over 41,500 cubic meters of wood. 
Some 2,200 people have been detained for crimes against the environment in 2020, the government added. 
Destruction of natural areas spiked after Colombia signed a peace deal in 2016 with its largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as swathes of land became more accessible.
In recent years deforestation has started to decline. According to government data, deforestation in 2018 fell to 197,159 hectares (487,190 acres), from over 219,000 hectares in 2017. 
In 2019, deforestation in key provinces in the country's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region fell by around 50%, according to the environment ministry. 
However, a study recently published by the Foundation for Conservation and Sustainable Development found that more than 75,000 hectares of Colombia's Amazon were destroyed from the start of the year through April 15.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian protesters chanted ""Stand up to Trump!"" to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as he joined thousands at an anti-racism rally on Friday and took a knee alongside protesters.
Trudeau, wearing a black mask and surrounded by bodyguards, made a surprise appearance at the ""No justice = No peace"" rally in front of Parliament. His appearance came a day after police shot and killed an indigenous woman during a wellness check in eastern Canada. 
Demonstrations were held in other Canadian cities on Friday, including Toronto, where hundreds walked downtown in protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in police custody in Minnesota.
Trudeau three times took a knee alongside other protesters, a gesture used to protest against police brutality and the treatment of African-Americans by police. Afterward, several people thanked Trudeau for kneeling.
On Monday, police tear-gassed peaceful protesters outside the White House to make way for President Donald Trump to have his picture taken holding a Bible while standing in front of a church.
Asked to comment on Trump's idea of using soldiers against protesters on Tuesday, the Liberal prime minister paused for more than 20 seconds before he said that Canadians were watching the United States with ""horror and consternation.""
Trudeau did not speak at the rally Friday and left as the protesters began a march to the U.S. Embassy, near the Parliament building.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>","North Korea criticizes South Korea, threatens to close liaison office","SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea lashed out at South Korea for the second day in a row on Friday, threatening to close an inter-Korean liaison office and calling the South naive to think the North wants dialogue and negotiations right now.
A spokesman for the United Front Department (UFD), which handles inter-Korea affairs, said North Korea would ""definitely withdraw"" from the liaison office operated with South Korean officials in the North Korean city of Kaesong as the first step in punishing the South for failing to stop defectors from sending leaflets across the border, according to a statement carried by state news agency KCNA.
The liaison office was one of several inter-Korea projects that were implemented during a period of detente between the two Koreas in 2018. Relations between the two countries have cooled again amid stalled talks over North Korea's nuclear weapons.
""We do not hide that we have had long in mind decisive measures to fundamentally remove all provocations from the south and to completely shut down and remove all the contact leverage with the south side,"" the spokesman said, calling defectors ""mongrel dogs"" and ""human scum"" who insulted the dignity of North Korea's supreme leadership.
On Thursday, KCNA carried a similar statement by Kim Yo Jong, the sister of North Korea's leader, warning South Korea over the leaflets, saying it may cancel a recent bilateral military agreement if the activity persists.
South Korean officials quickly responded to Kim's statement, saying they make efforts to stop defector groups from sending leaflets, that the activities pose environmental risks and endanger private property in the South and raise tensions with the North, and suggested they may move to make such operations illegal. 
South Korea's Unification Ministry did not immediately respond to Friday's statement by the UFD.
The UFD spokesman ridiculed South Korean officials, calling them ""ignorant imbeciles"" and ""the meanest bastards"" if they misunderstood or intentionally ignored the warnings in Kim's statement.
""We are about to start the work that can hurt the south side soon to make it suffer from annoyance,"" he said.

1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 05:40PM ET</span>",France says its army killed al Qaeda North Africa chief Droukdel,"By John Irish and Tangi Salaün
PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Friday its military forces had killed al Qaeda's North Africa chief Abdelmalek Droukdel, a key Islamist fighter that its forces had been hunting for more than seven years, during an operation in Mali. 
""On June 3, French army forces, with the support of their local partners, killed the emir of al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Abdelmalek Droukdel, and several of his closest collaborators, during an operation in northern Mali,"" French Armed Forces Minister Florence Parly wrote on Twitter.
The announcement of the death of Droukdel comes almost six months after former colonial power France and regional states combined their military forces under one command structure to focus on fighting Islamic State-linked militants in the border regions of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso.
Droukdel was among North Africa's most experienced militants. He took part in an Islamist militant takeover of northern Mali before a French military intervention in 2013 drove them back and scattered fighters across the Sahel region. 
Droukdel was believed to be hiding in the mountains of northern Algeria. Al Qaeda North Africa was the dominant jihadist force in the region, staging several high-profile deadly attacks until 2013, when it fractured as many militants flocked to the more extremist Islamic State as it seized territory in Iraq, Syria and Libya.
It remained active in North Africa's largely desert and often scarcely governed Sahel region. In Mali, it focussed its activities to the north in Libya and Tunisia. As Islamic State waned, it has sought to lure new talent from among IS veterans. 
Parly said that French forces, which number about 5,100 in the region, had also on May 19 captured Mohamed el Mrabat, a fighter she identified as a veteran militant in the region and member of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara.
""Our forces, in cooperation with their local partners... will continue to track these (people) down without respite,"" Parly said.
Critics in the region have increasingly scorned Paris for failing to restore stability. Anti-French sentiment has grown as militants have strengthened their foothold, making large swathes of territory ungovernable and stoking ethnic violence.
Parly said earlier this week that about 100 special forces from other European countries would be deployed to the region to support French and regional troops.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Vatican police on Friday arrested Gianluigi Torzi, an Italian middleman who was part of a controversial deal in which the Vatican used Church money to purchase a luxury building in London as an investment. 
Torzi, who was arrested after questioning by Vatican magistrates, was accused of extortion, embezzlement, aggravated fraud and money laundering, the Vatican press office said in a statement. Torzi is the first person to be arrested in connection with the deal.
The investigation had led to the suspension last year of five Vatican employees, the resignation of the Vatican's police chief and the departure of the former head of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF).
Torzi was the Vatican's fiduciary for the deal, in which the Vatican's Secretariat of State purchased a building in London's Chelsea district several years ago for $200 million.
It was not immediately possible to contact lawyers for Torzi.
It is rare for an Italian citizen to be arrested and held in the Vatican. Most of those arrested and held in the past have been either Vatican citizens or Italian employees of the tiny city-state.
The investigation became public on Oct. 1 when Vatican police raided the offices of the Secretariat of State, which is the administrative heart of the Catholic Church, and the offices of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF). The police seized documents and computers.
In February, Vatican police raided the home and office of a priest who was working in the Secretariat of State at the time of the purchase and said he was suspected of embezzlement, abuse of office and corruption.
Also in February, Cardinal Angelo Becciu, a former top official at the Secretariat of State, said the value of the London property had tripled since it was purchased but that middlemen had acted improperly in their dealings with the Vatican.

Pope Francis and other Vatican officials have defended using Church money for real estate investments as long as they are ethical. He said last year that Church money should not be ""kept in a drawer"" but allowed to grow so that it could be used to do more good.

""(President Donald Trump) has had the door open to diplomacy for many years and in the same time frame, he has met (North Korean leader) Kim Jong Un three times. So, we would like to see the (Iranian) regime meet our diplomacy with diplomacy,"" he told reporters a day after Iran freed U.S. citizen Michael White.

He also said the number of U.S. citizens wrongly detained abroad who will be released will grow, but provided no details on when or where that might happen.
The U.S. official reiterated an appeal for Iran to release American citizens Baquer Namazi, his son Siamak Namazi and conservationist Morad Tahbaz. He specifically asked for the latter two to be furloughed from prison on medical grounds.
Hook also said Washington plans to stick to its policy of harsh economic sanctions on Tehran in an effort to bring it to the negotiating table on issues such as the nuclear program, saying ""timidity and weakness invites more Iranian aggression.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft on Friday pushed back against criticism from China and Iran over the protests across the United States about racial inequality and excessive police force, challenging them to compare records.
China and Iran, described respectively in the past as authoritarian and a mafia-like state by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both urged the United States in recent days to tackle racism and protect minorities' rights.
The largely peaceful U.S. protests over the past 10 days were sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis with a white policeman's knee on his neck. Some cities have had to deal with arson, looting and clashes between protesters and police, leading to the mobilization of National Guard units.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft denounced Floyd's death as ""intolerable"" and ""brutality.""
""However, there is no moral equivalence between our free society, which works through tough problems like racism, and other societies, which do not allow anything to be discussed,"" Craft told reporters in a telephone briefing.
""I would challenge anyone to compare their record with our record as far as how they treat situations,"" she said. 
Craft cited China's treatment of its minority Muslim Uighur population in Xinjiang, as well as Tibet and Africans, adding there should be a ""dialogue on the difference"" between those situations and what was happening now in the United States. 
China rejected the ""baseless accusation' by Craft, said a spokesperson for China's U.N. mission. 
""We urge the US to get its own house in order, solve its own problems, take care of its own people and stop gross interference in other countries' internal affairs and the attempt to divert attention,"" the spokesperson said.

U.N. chief Antonio Guterres has urged Americans protesting to do so peacefully and called on U.S. leaders and authorities to listen to them and show restraint.

1029,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 03:55PM ET</span>","Explainer: Who are Antifa, the 'boogaloo' movement and others blamed in U.S. protest violence?","By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and his allies have sought to blame left-wing extremists for the violence and looting at U.S. protests over police brutality while local authorities and watchdog groups have pointed to the threat posed by right-wing movements.
A recent U.S. intelligence assessment reviewed by Reuters this week said most of the violence at protests appears to have been driven by opportunists. But the assessment also said there was some evidence that organized extremists were tied to violence or promoting it online.
WHICH GROUPS ARE BEING SINGLED OUT?
President Donald Trump and some fellow Republicans have sought to blame the left-wing anti-fascist Antifa movement but have presented little evidence.
Liberal watchdog groups and some local authorities have warned that members of the anti-government ""boogaloo"" movement or white supremacist groups could infiltrate protests.
Federal prosecutors filed charges this week against three alleged boogaloo members accused of plotting to cause violence and destruction at Las Vegas protest.
WHAT IS ANTIFA?
Antifa, short for ""anti-fascist,"" is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists. Antifa aims to ""intimidate and dissuade racists,"" but its aggressive tactics including physical confrontations can create ""a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame,"" the ADL said.
The FBI has been increasingly concerned about violence perpetrated by Antifa at public events, according to a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service, a public policy research arm of the U.S. Congress.
WHY IS ANTIFA SO WELL-KNOWN?
Antifa grew in notoriety following a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, organized by white supremacists and white nationalists who clashed violently with counter-protesters. Trump drew criticism afterward when he said there were ""very fine people on both sides"" and blamed ""many sides"" for the violence. Trump specifically mentioned Antifa.
""You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they've got clubs and they've got everything,"" Trump said of Antifa days after the rally.
Mark Bray, author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,"" said Trump was focusing on Antifa to redirect the conversation away from social and economic discontent in the United States at the heart of the protests. 
""There just aren't enough members of Antifa groups out there to do everything they're being blamed for,"" said Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University in New Jersey.
WHAT IS THE BOOGALOO MOVEMENT?
The anti-government boogaloo movement embodies a militant ideology whose members believe the United States will enter into a second civil war, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. Boogaloo followers anticipate the government will attempt to confiscate people's guns.
The boogaloo ideology itself is not white supremacist, but some white supremacist groups have embraced it, the ADL found.
""Whereas the militia movement (and) radical gun rights activists typically promote the boogaloo as a war against the government or liberals, white supremacists conceive of the boogaloo as a race war or a white revolution,"" the ADL wrote in a November analysis.
Boogaloo groups have grown in popularity online in the past year. The Tech Transparency Project, a Washington-based tech watchdog group, found tens of thousands of people joined boogaloo-related Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) groups over a 30-day period in March and April as stay-at-home orders took effect across the United States to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Project researchers found discussions about tactical strategies, weapons and creating explosives in some boogaloo Facebook groups. 
WHAT ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS?
A small number of white supremacists and white nationalists have been spotted at recent protests, according to watchdog groups and media reports. The Nationalist Social Club, a neo-Nazi group, appeared to have had some presence at protests in Boston and Knoxville, Tennessee, the ADL said. Members of the far-right Proud Boys were seen at North Carolina and Oregon protests last weekend, according to media reports.

Nate Snyder, a former U.S. Department of Homeland Security counter-terrorism official, said it is likely anarchists were among the protesters in recent days, but doubted they would pose a credible violent threat.

1030,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Should U.S. police get free military equipment? Protests revive debate,"By Michelle Nichols and Catherine Koppel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - In cities across the United States this past week, protesters have been confronted by police carrying shields and batons and hulking armored vehicles that might look to some people like a scene straight out of a war zone. 
A U.S. law allows the Department of Defense to transfer surplus military equipment to city and state law enforcement agencies across the country. The equipment given away has either been turned in by military units or held in reserve stocks until no longer needed. 
Widespread protests against racial inequalities and excessive use of force by police following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis with a white policeman's knee on his neck have revived a debate about equipment and tactics used by police around the United States that critics say should be confined to a battlefield. Several U.S. senators are calling for an end to the Pentagon program.
At a protest in Manhattan's West Village on Tuesday, Erin Ebbitt, 28, held a sign that read: ""Demilitarize the police."" 
""They don't need all that military gear,"" Ebbitt said. ""It creates this mindset of 'I'm going into a warzone' in situations where that isn't the case.""
More than $7.2 billion worth of equipment has been given away over the past couple of decades, including $293 million worth of property last year, according to the Pentagon's Defense Logistics Agency website. It also said some 8,000 law enforcement agencies are enrolled.
Supporters of the program tout it as useful. Police used such equipment to find the 2013 Boston marathon bombers and former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said helmets and body armor from the program saved a police officer during the 2016 nightclub shooting in Orlando, Florida.
Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, who is also president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, said the national debate should not be around the use of military equipment, but on the policies over use of such equipment, training and supervision. 
""For the first time in our history we have an opportunity to really make change like we've never made it before. George Floyd's death has really touched a nerve like we have not seen,"" Acevedo told Reuters. 
Former President Barack Obama curtailed the program in 2015 after law enforcement officers using military-style armored vehicles and guns confronted protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 following the fatal police shooting of a black teenager.
President Donald Trump revoked Obama's decision in 2017.
'WE MUST END IT'
Items shipped to civilian police around the country between January and March this year included 30 mine resistant vehicles worth about $700,000 each, as well as trucks, computer monitors, electrical tape and even pouches to carry grenades, according to Pentagon disclosures on the property transfer program.
""The response to the protests has been a militarized response out of the gate, from surveillance to the weaponry, the tactics to the aggressiveness,"" said John Raphling, a senior researcher on criminal justice for Human Rights Watch.
Police across the United States are using a variety of weapons on protesters. Often described as ""non-lethal,"" these weapons include tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets. They have sometimes seriously injured protesters.
""Police are a militarized institution by their nature. We should not be responding to our societal problems with a military approach,"" Raphling said.
In the wake of the Ferguson protests Obama created a task force that recommended in 2015 that law enforcement agencies create policies for demonstrations ""designed to minimize the appearance of a military operation and avoid using provocative tactics and equipment that undermine civilian trust.""
Obama at a town hall meeting on Wednesday urged local leaders to implement the recommendations of the taskforce. 
Trump had threatened to use the U.S. military to halt violence and looting that has spread to several cities.
""President Trump is once again wrong and dangerous in urging yet more military deployment and tactics,"" the American Civil Liberties Union posted on Twitter on Sunday, adding that policing in America was already ""excessively militarized.""
Democratic senators say they will pursue a legislative amendment to discontinue the program. 
U.S. Senator Chris Van Hollen said on Twitter this week that the program ""contributed to the militarization of our police departments - leading to tanks on our streets, the erosion of police-community relations, and the escalation of violence ... we must end it.""

""We hope the initiative will produce results, we are open to dialogue and ready to meet each step forward with 10 steps from our side,"" Al Jazeera's tweet quoted foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut diplomatic and trade ties with Qatar in June 2017 over allegations that it backs terrorism. Doha denies that and accuses them of trying to curtail its sovereignty.
Kuwait and the United States have tried to mediate a rift that has undermined Washington's efforts to form a united front against Iran, which is locked in a struggle for regional supremacy with Saudi Arabia.
""We hope this initiative is different than previous ones and it is taken seriously,"" the minister said, adding that there were some talks with Saudi Arabia at the end of 2019, but the process had stopped. 
The United States has launched a new push on the four countries to reopen Gulf airspace for Qatari jets, especially Qatari Airways' aircraft, as a first step to ending the crisis, sources told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Discrimination by Canadian police against indigenous people and people of color ""needs to end,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, after police officers shot and killed an indigenous woman and video showed police appearing to purposely drive into an indigenous man.
The comments came amid protests against police brutality, sparked by the death of an unarmed black man in Minnesota who was in police custody.
""Far too many Canadians feel fear and anxiety at the sight of a law enforcement officer,"" Trudeau told reporters in Ottawa. ""Over the past weeks we've seen a large number of Canadians suddenly awaken to the fact that discrimination is a lived reality for far too many of our fellow citizens.

""The Erie County District Attorney's Office continues to investigate the incident captured on video outside City Hall Thursday evening that resulted in the injury of (a) protester,"" Kait Munro said in an emailed statement.
The incident on Thursday raised further questions about police behavior, after the death of African-American man George Floyd in Minneapolis set off nationwide street protests.
The Buffalo video taken by a reporter from local radio station WBFO and posted online shows the white-haired man approaching a line of officers in riot gear. One officer pushes him with a baton and a second one with his hand. The sound of a crack is heard and blood trickles from the man's head.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that he had spoken with the injured man, Martin Gugino, and was thankful to confirm he was alive. Cuomo said the police chief should fire the officers involved. 
""You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency and humanity,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing. ""Why, why, why was that necessary? Where was the threat?""
Gugino, who is white, could not be immediately reached for comment. PUSH Buffalo, which advocates for affordable housing, confirmed that Gugino is a member of the community group.
The video in Buffalo shows the majority of the officers march past after Gugino falls, though the officer who pushed him with a baton starts to lean over him before he is motioned away by another officer. Someone is heard calling for a medic.

Buffalo mayor Byron Brown said the incident took place after an altercation between two groups of people protesting the death of Floyd in Minneapolis, though Gugino appeared to be alone as he walked up to the group of officers in the video.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog expressed serious concern on Friday that Iran has continued for months to deny it access to sites of interest to it, describing previous suspected activities there that could have been part of a nuclear weapons programme.
The International Atomic Energy Agency issued a report in March admonishing Iran for failing to answer questions about past nuclear activities at three sites and for denying it access to two of them. 
Diplomats have said the IAEA is looking into activities there long before Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers. 
A report to IAEA member states issued on Friday detailed suspected activities and materials including ""the possible presence...of natural uranium in the form of a metal disc"" at a site that ""underwent extensive sanitization and levelling in 2003 and 2004"", the report said, describing the third site. 
""Sanitization"" is a general term used to suggest suspected activity to remove traces of nuclear material.
U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons programme that it halted in 2003. Israel's obtaining of what it calls an ""archive"" of past Iranian nuclear work has, however, given the IAEA extra information on the Islamic Republic's previous activities.
The report also described ""the possible use and storage of nuclear material at another location specified by the agency where outdoor, conventional explosive testing may have taken place in 2003, including in relation to testing of shielding in preparation for the use of neutron detectors"".
One of the three sites was sanitized, another ""underwent significant changes ... including the demolition of most buildings"" - both in the early 2000s - and at the other the IAEA observed ""activities consistent with efforts to sanitize part of the location"" from July 2019 onwards.
""The (IAEA) director general calls on Iran immediately to cooperate fully with the agency, including by providing prompt access to the locations specified,"" the report said.
That report was in addition to a regular quarterly report that showed the Islamic Republic remains in breach of many of the restrictions imposed by its nuclear deal with major powers, and that its stockpile of low-enriched uranium has increased by roughly half to 1,571.6 kg, well above a 202.8 kg limit.

Iran began breaching the accord after the United States withdrew from the deal in May 2018 and reimposed heavy economic sanctions on Tehran.

Floyd's death, after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck while detaining him, has convulsed the United States.
The largest demonstrations elsewhere on Friday appeared to be in Germany, where more than 10,000 people gathered in Frankfurt and Hamburg, according to Reuters journalists.
Many raised hands in the air and held banners with slogans such as: ""Your Pain Is My Pain, Your Fight Is My Fight"".
One poster at the Frankfurt rally asked: ""How Many Weren't Filmed?"" in reference to the fact that Floyd's case was caught on camera in Minneapolis. 
As authorities in many parts warned of the risk of COVID-19 infections from large gatherings, many protesters wore anti-coronavirus masks, some in black or with a clenched fist image.
In London's Trafalgar Square (NYSE:SQ), dozens took to one knee in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.
Placards read: ""White People Must Do More"" and ""Justice for Belly Mujinga"" in reference to a rail worker who died of COVID-19 after being spat at by a man who said he was infected.
""UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATIONS""
""There are a lot of uncomfortable conversations that people have been avoiding because it's unpleasant, it's not fun, and it can create tension, whether that's in your family or with your friends or in your workplace,"" said law firm worker Ada Offor, 21, in Trafalgar Square.
""But they're conversations that need to be had if we want to avoid things like this happening in the future, if we want to create reform, if we want to finally create a kind of society where black bodies are treated equally.""
In Australia, demonstrators marched to Parliament House in Canberra, social media images showed, despite attempts by the authorities to stop gatherings due to the coronavirus.
Australians have also been drawing attention to mistreatment of indigenous nationals.
Austrian demonstrators gathered near the U.S. Embassy, holding banners with slogans such as ""There Are No Races Just One Species"", while in Norway police let thousands of people protest even though authorities had said only 50 would be allowed. 
Ignoring one-metre social distancing guidelines but wearing masks, several thousand people gathered in front of the Norwegian parliament and hundreds outside the U.S. Embassy. 
Elsewhere, rallies were scheduled on Friday in the Netherlands, Liberia, Italy, Canada and Greece.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and China agreed on Friday to resolve a dispute over their shared border in the Ladakh region through diplomatic channels, the Indian foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.
The statement came a day before top generals of the two countries are due to meet near the site of their border standoff to try and find a way to de-escalate the situation.
Indian officials said both sides would first focus on getting both the Indian army and the People’s Liberation Army to pull back additional troops and equipment deployed in the area.
Soldiers from both sides have been camped out in the Galwan Valley in the high-altitude Ladakh region, accusing each other of trespassing over the disputed border, the trigger of a brief but bloody war in 1962.
Senior officials of the two countries held a video conference and agreed that ""the two sides should handle their differences through peaceful discussion"" and should not allow them to become disputes, the foreign affairs ministry statement said.
In Beijing, Geng Shuang, a spokesman of China's foreign affairs ministry, told reporters that the overall situation in the China-India border areas was currently ""stable and controllable.""
While maintaining close communication through diplomatic and military channels, both sides are working to ""properly resolve relevant issues,"" the spokesman said, according to the statement posted on China's foreign affairs ministry website.
Both sides recalled the consensus reached by their two leaders that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between India and China would be positive for stability in the current global situation, the Indian statement said.

1040,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 12:15PM ET</span>",Cameroon military says missing journalist died in its custody,"By Josiane Kouagheu
DOUALA (Reuters) - Cameroon's military said on Friday that a journalist who disappeared last August in a part of the country where it is battling Anglophone separatists died in its custody weeks after he was arrested but denied that he was tortured.
The statement, read on national radio, was the first public acknowledgment by Cameroonian authorities of the death of Samuel Ebuwe Ajiekia, also known as Samuel Wazizi, who worked as a radio and television anchor in the South West Region.
The head of Cameroon's journalists union said they last saw a healthy Wazizi in the first week of August after he was arrested by the police and were then informed a few days later that he had been transferred into military custody.
In the statement, army spokesman Cyrille Atonfack Nguemo said the military took custody of Wazizi on Aug. 7 after investigations revealed he was coordinating logistics for separatist fighters - charges his family and colleagues deny.
On Aug. 13, Nguemo said, Wazizi was placed into the custody of the national gendarmerie - a military police force. Soon after, Wazizi became sick and was taken to hospital in the capital Yaounde, where he died on Aug. 17, Nguemo said.
""He clearly died from a severe sepsis and not from any acts of torture,"" Nguemo said, rejecting accusations of torture made by the head of the journalists' union.
Nguemo also said that Wazizi's family was informed of his death. But Wazizi's brother, Henry Abuwe, denied that.
""It's a lie,"" he said, adding that his brother was ""loved by everyone"" and had never worked with the separatists.
Rights groups have accused both government troops and separatists of atrocities during the conflict, which began in 2017 after security forces violently cracked down on peaceful protests by English speakers against marginalisation by Cameroon's French-speaking majority.
The violence over the past three years has killed an estimated 3,000 people and forced more than 700,000 from their homes, Human Rights Watch said in April.

Anna Lindstedt, who was replaced as ambassador in February 2019, has been charged with exceeding her authority in dealings with a foreign power in the first case of its kind in modern Swedish history. She denies the accusation.
""She has acted in contradiction to current Swedish foreign policy,"" prosecutor Henrik Olin (NYSE:OLN) told Reuters after the first day of the trial.
""Even if her intentions were good and her aim was to get Gui Minhai freed, you cannot just act in any way you please, even as an ambassador.""
Olin said that Lindstedt had not consulted properly with the foreign ministry prior to the meeting and had not reported back after the meeting was over. 
Lindstedt's lawyer referred to a statement sent on Thursday, before the trial began.
""There was no negotiation with China and the ministry was informed of the meeting,"" Lindstedt said in the statement. 
Gui, a Hong Kong-based publisher of books critical of China's communist leaders and also a Swedish citizen, was abducted in Thailand in 2015 and later appeared in custody in mainland China.
Beijing says Gui is being held on suspicion of revealing state secrets and intelligence on China.
The Stockholm meeting took place in January last year. Gui's daughter Angela said in her blog that she had been invited by Lindstedt to meet two unidentified businessmen who could help secure her father's release. 
Gui said she was advised to keep quiet about her father's case while negotiations were proceeding.
Sweden's Foreign Ministry said neither it nor the foreign minister had been informed of the meeting until afterwards.
The bookseller's case has soured relations between Sweden and China, also under strain over security concerns. 
The government is planning to tighten takeover rules in relation to strategic assets, while Sweden's security police said earlier this year that China and Russia represent the biggest threats to national security.

Lindstedt could face a maximum sentence of six years in prison. The trial is expected to conclude on June 18.

1042,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 12:03PM ET</span>",Protests against police violence sweep across small-town America,"By Brian Munoz and Mica Rosenberg
ANNA, Illinois/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Before sundown on Thursday around 150 protesters marched down the main street in Anna, Illinois, past Bob's Tavern, Oasis of Grace Church, Douglas Skating Rink and Casey's General (NASDAQ:CASY) Store holding homemade signs and chanting ""black lives matter.""
Nearly a century ago this southern Illinois town of 4,200 residents expelled most of its African-American residents, according to historians.
The rally was held in solidarity with others protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis with a white policeman's knee on his neck. Some residents said they were marching as a way to try to move beyond their own community's past. 
Joe Plemon, 73, an elder at the First Evangelical Presbyterian Church, said he had prepared several Bible passages - laments - to read at the protest. 
""We have been challenged within my own denomination, and I know this is going on at other churches as well, to say, 'Let's not just wink at this, let's step up, let's admit the things that we're ashamed of and let's confess the places where we've sinned.'"" 
Anna was once known as one of the ""sundown towns,"" or thousands of American localities where black people were not welcome, according to sociologist and historian James Loewen, who wrote a book about the phenomenon.
While most national attention has been focused on massive demonstrations and violent clashes with police in the United States' biggest cities like New York and Los Angeles, hundreds of spontaneous demonstrations have popped up in little towns and rural areas across the nation in recent days. 
A BuzzFeed reporter based in Missoula, Montana, has gathered a growing thread of local news reports and social media posts showing nearly 250 protests in smaller communities - some with just a few hundred residents - in all 50 states.
Many of them are being held in conservative towns like Anna, which is 90% white and sits in a county where Republican President Donald Trump won 68% of the votes in the 2016 election.
""We can't put our head in the sand,"" Plemon said. ""It's good for us to step up and say we want to be part of the solution."" 
One of the mostly young organizers was 18-year-old Jenna Gomez from nearby Cobden, Illinois, who said she is used to seeing Confederate flags displayed by area businesses.
Gomez had thought maybe a handful of people would show up to the event when she and some others started a group chat about it. 
""We wanted to show everyone that we are not the past,"" she said at the rally over cheers and a call-and-response of ""United we stand! United we fall!""
'REMARKABLE'
About a half-hour north in Carbondale, Illinois, two other young organizers - sisters Adah, 16, and Maat Mays, 18 - came up with the idea of staging a vigil on Sunday in their small town of 25,000 while watching live Instagram feeds of demonstrations in Minneapolis. 
""When the protests started in the larger cities, I thought, 'I am not in a big city but I can still bring awareness and find a way to honor the names of the people who have been killed by the police,'"" said Maat Mays.
One state over in Indiana, sociology professor Jared Friesen found it ""remarkable"" that more than a hundred people gathered on Wednesday in the center of Huntington - population 36,000, 96% white and the hometown of Republican former Vice President Dan Quayle. 
""This runs contrary to the ideas that people have about small towns,"" Friesen said, ""That we are all hicks and we don't care about what is happening."" 
But some in these communities do not back the wave of public action. 
Jeff Barnes, a retired housepainter and proud Trump supporter who lives in Anna, said he agreed with the president's threat to use the military against looters. 
""That won't happen around here, I can assure you,"" he said, gesturing to a group of about 20 men who were not visibly armed and said they were there to protect businesses.
The flashes of hostility did not faze seasoned activists like 72-year-old Mildred Henderson. 

""Pretty soon the minority will be the majority, and they would not want to be treated the way they have treated some blacks and some other minorities,"" she said. ""They haven't thought about the script being flipped. But it's about to be.""

The airstrikes, conducted in two different provinces, were the first since the start of the Eid ceasefire declared by the Taliban and Afghan forces last month.
Sonny Leggett, a U.S. military spokesman based in Afghanistan, said in a tweet that an airstrike was carried out against 25 armed Taliban fighters executing a coordinated attack on an Afghan force checkpoint in Farah province in the west. He said a second attack was conducted in Kandahar in the south.
He did not give casualty figures, and a Taliban spokesman refused to comment on the airstrikes, which were conducted at a time when the United States is steadily pulling its troops out of Afghanistan.
U.S. President Donald Trump in recent weeks has restated his desire for a full military withdrawal from Afghanistan but has not set a target date, amid speculation he might make ending America's longest war part of his re-election campaign.
But Afghan security officials and European diplomats said the fighting had yet to ebb despite all parties working towards finding a political settlement to end the Afghan war.
At least 10 Afghan security forces members were killed on Friday morning in an ambush by the Taliban in southern Zabul province, Afghan officials said.
The Taliban has not claimed responsibility for the attack.

The kingdom is gradually easing restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus outbreak, which killed nine people in Jordan.
From Saturday, cafes and hotels can reopen and domestic flights will resume, although schools, universities and cinemas remain closed and most public gatherings are still banned. [L8N2DH4WR]
Over 30,000 police were deployed to oversee crowds attending prayers at the country's 7,000 mosques on Friday, officials said.
Worshippers in the predominantly Muslim country were asked to wear masks, limit prayer time and perform the ablution rite, the act of washing the face, arms and legs before prayer, at home. In some mosques, the floor was marked to designate the spots where worshippers could lay down their prayer rugs at a safe distance from their neighbours. 
Since a strict lockdown began in mid-March, the authorities have arrested several people, including clerics, for flouting the ban on prayers inside mosques.

1045,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>",West Libya forces seize last LNA stronghold near capital,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces loyal to Libya's internationally recognised government captured the last major stronghold of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar near Tripoli on Friday, capping the sudden collapse of his 14-month offensive on the capital.
Military sources in Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) said their forces had withdrawn from the town of Tarhouna, heading towards Sirte, far along the coast, and the airbase of al-Jufra in central Libya. The LNA made no immediate official comment. 
The advance extends the control of the Government of National Accord (GNA) and allied forces across most of northwest Libya, reversing many of Haftar's gains from last year when he raced towards Tripoli.
The GNA has been backed by Turkey, while Haftar, whose LNA still controls the east and oil fields in the south, has been supported by Russia, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates.
The United Nations has started holding talks with both sides for a ceasefire deal in recent days, though previous truces have not stuck.
The GNA gains could entrench the de facto partition of Libya into zones controlled by rival eastern and western governments whose foreign backers compete for regional sway.
""What is happening now is the beginning of the division of Libya,"" Saeed Mugheeb, a pro-Haftar lawmaker, said in a statement that echoed comments from others in the east.
Turkish military support for the GNA, with drone strikes, air defences and a supply of allied Syrian fighters, was key to its recent successes. Ankara regards Libya as crucial to defending its interests in the eastern Mediterranean. 
However, the LNA still retains its foreign support. Washington said last week Moscow had sent warplanes to LNA-held Jufra, though Russia and the LNA denied this. 
The United Nations says weapons and fighters have flooded into the country in defiance of an arms embargo, risking a deadlier escalation. Meanwhile, a blockade of oil ports by eastern-based forces has almost entirely cut off energy revenue and both administrations face a looming financial crisis.
STRONGHOLD
Located in the hills southeast of Tripoli, Tarhouna had functioned as a forward base for Haftar's assault on the capital. Its swift fall suggests Haftar's foreign supporters were less willing to sustain his bid to take over the entire country once Turkey intervened decisively to stop him. 
The GNA operations room said in a statement that its forces had captured Tarhouna after entering from four sides. Some residents fled towards the east, and the Kani family, which had controlled Tarhouna since 2014 also withdrew, LNA military sources said. 
Videos and photographs posted online appeared to show GNA forces inside Tarhouna cheering and hugging each other and firing into the air. 
""The Libyan government forces are rapidly moving in an organised manner and with armed drones. There could be a solution at the table, but Haftar's forces are losing ground in every sense,"" said a Turkish official.
Amnesty International, which documented recent threats of revenge killings in Tarhouna by GNA-affiliated fighters, called for an end to retaliatory attacks against civilians by both sides.

GNA forces implicated in retaliatory acts as they advanced west of Tripoli in April have not yet been held to account, Amnesty said. Both sides had carried out indiscriminate attacks in civilian areas round Tripoli in recent weeks, while extensive landmines and booby traps were laid before the LNA and Russian military contractors supporting it retreated, it added.

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - European Union and British negotiators said on Friday they had made very little progress in their latest round of talks about a Brexit free trade agreement, with just weeks left to extend a year-end deadline to reach a deal.
Both sides, however, avoided the vitriol that has sometimes marked years of tortuous Brexit talks. They laid out plans to intensify negotiations and pleaded for a renewed political push when their leaders assess the situation later in June. 
Britain left the EU in January. Their relationship is now governed by a transition arrangement that keeps previous rules in place while they negotiate new terms. So far, this has not gone well. 
""This week, there have been no significant areas of progress ... We cannot go on like this forever,"" EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier told a news conference.
He said the EU and Britain remained far apart on the issues of fair competition guarantees and the governance of their new relationship, as well as fishing rights. 
He noted some progress in talks over human rights guarantees that would allow Britain and the EU to go on cooperating in criminal and judicial matters from 2021, but the two sides were still far from agreement.
Britain had a similar message.
""Progress remains limited but our talks have been positive in tone,"" Britain's chief negotiator, David Frost, said. ""Negotiations will continue and we remain committed to a successful outcome.""
DEAL OR HARD BREXIT
The EU says Britain can only go on trading freely with it if London signs up to ""level playing field"" rules to guarantee equivalent regulatory standards on the environment and labour. London rejects this, saying it will not be dictated to by the EU.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to hold talks with Barnier's boss, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and the chairman of the 27 EU leaders, Charles Michel, later this month.
Negotiators would resume in late June or early July, Barnier said, possibly in person after months of videoconferences because of the coronavirus crisis. 
""If we are to make progress, it is clear that we must intensify and accelerate our work,"" Frost said. 
If the negotiation period is not extended this month, a deal needs to be sealed by the end of October to allow enough time for ratification by the bloc's 27 member states, Barnier said.
Hopes for a move on fisheries have not materialised in this week's negotiations and the two sides failed to close the gap on nuclear cooperation or fighting money laundering.
At stake is 650 billion pounds ($825 billion) in trade a year before the coronavirus crisis between the world's fifth-biggest economy and its biggest trading bloc.
""Is a deal possible? Yes, definitely. But I think it also means the UK needs to have a more realistic approach. You cannot have full sovereignty and at the same time full access to the (EU) single market,"" Germany's EU ambassador, Michael Clauss, said this week. 

On Friday, a UK official involved in the negotiations replied: ""It is obvious the EU must move its positions for there to be a deal.""

1047,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 05, 2020 10:22AM ET</span>",Special Report: Meet the masters of social distancing - Couple live alone in wilderness for decades,"By Joshua Schneyer
SOMEWHERE NEAR RESERVE, New Mexico (Reuters) - To leave society behind was a wedding vow Wendell and Mariann spoke only to each other. It was a solemn one, though, and to save for it Mariann spent only $66 on her bridal gown. Once they were married on that winter day 35 years ago, they just started driving.
Wendell and Mariann Hardy had lived most of their lives in the fast-growing southwestern city of Tucson, Arizona. But each was drawn to solitude. Mariann began distance-running into the mountains on high desert trails. Even before they met, both relocated to log cabins up on Mt. Lemmon, the 9,157-foot peak in the Catalinas range that overlooks Tucson. Still, city types came up to party there on the weekends. It wasn't isolated enough.
Wendell took a job installing windows at Mariann's cabin. Shy at first, the two got to talking about how they weren't made for crowded places. One afternoon, Mariann offered him gin and tonic. Just how far, Wendell asked her, would she be willing to go?
The question, open-ended and thrilling, marked the beginning of a union between two people who sought solitude – and instead found a life alone together.
Decades later, a pandemic has thrust the concept of social distancing into the daily lexicon and lives of Americans. As the nation's death toll from COVID-19 tops 100,000, a new reality has set in: With few effective treatments and no vaccine, maintaining distance from others in society is the only sure method of stopping the spread.
Few people are as accustomed to the rigors, or rewards, of sheltering-in-place as Wendell, 75, and Mariann, 69. Soon after their 1985 church wedding in Tucson, they started exploring the wildest reaches of the American West for a place to be on their own.
A jack of all trades, including driving race cars, Wendell had a knack for fixing up vehicles like their salvaged pickups and a 1978 Jeep. They'd load one up and scout out Arizona's parched borderlands to the south, and its ponderosa pine forests up north.
You can tell something by how couples sit on bench seats in old pickup trucks. Some sit apart, at either window. Others, like Wendell and Mariann, sit close together, behind the steering wheel.
Their search ended in Catron County, New Mexico. It is among the most rural in the United States, bigger than some U.S. states. Elk outnumber people 4 to 1. Traffic is so sparse, the county doesn't have a single stoplight. Some children wait for the school bus in wood and wire cages. These serve as a precaution, against the wolves.
Miles down a washed-out dirt road along the San Francisco River, they saw 25 acres for sale. The $40,000 stretch of land, 6,000 feet high and zoned for cattle grazing, bordered on National Forest and was near a cougar-inhabited gorge called Hogwash Canyon. They bought it in 1986. The property tax payments cost less than the postal stamps Wendell needed to mail them in.
Today, an iron sign above their front gate, forged by Mariann years ago, reads ""El Medio de Nada."" Spanish for the middle of nowhere.
""If you can get along with your wife out here, as we do, that's about it. There are no neighbors to get along with,"" Wendell says. ""I wake up happy every morning.""
As millions across America struggle with avoiding others, Mariann and Wendell face a different challenge: how to maintain their isolation as they grow old.
It is distancing, they think, that helps connect them with the world.
""We feel closer to people living the way we do,"" Mariann says. ""When we have contact with others, it means something more.""
Above their front door, she has hung a sign: WELCOME.
During the worst public health crisis in a century, most would have turned a reporter away. I told them I wanted to tell the story of a couple who'd mastered social distancing, striking a balance between solitude and togetherness, self-reliance and dependence.
So they invited me to spend two days with them in El Medio de Nada. A photographer, videographer and I observed strict health precautions during the visit. We drove separately, wore surgical masks, stayed more than six feet apart, washed our hands frequently and sanitized any surface we touched.
""I'm a dead player if I catch it,"" Wendell says of the virus. ""If I lived in a city, I don't know what I'd do, but I feel safe here.""
The pandemic, and the isolation it encourages, is already sparking signs of a modest urban exodus toward wilder areas such as this one. U.S. demand for recreational vehicles has surged, along with home rentals in far-flung locales. Many workers accustomed to office jobs, and fortunate enough to still have them, have found they can be equally productive from a redoubt in the countryside.
Yet truly remote living, the path Wendell and Mariann have chosen, comes with hardships and dangers of its own. When the San Francisco River gets high, they're effectively barricaded in for weeks or months. Mariann was stalked by a large mountain lion a few years back. Fortunately, her Siberian Husky scared the cat off, sparing her having to shoot it. (""I have guns, but I'm not a gun person, you know?"") The couple does shoot the occasional Mojave rattlesnake – a bite out here so far from civilization could be lethal because the nearest full-service hospital is hours away.
But there are prizes of living with no one else in sight: ""It feels like everything you see is yours,"" Wendell says.
On dark and moonless nights, that can include the cosmos.
""You can see stars beyond the stars,"" Mariann says.
WALDEN OF THE WEST
I grew up hearing tales of Wendell Hardy, the father of a high school classmate. As legend had it, somewhere out there with Mariann, his third wife, this elusive self-didact busied himself with elaborate projects and small feats of engineering that allowed for a comfortable life in isolation.
The couple's flight from society seemed unusual. Their careers in the years after college had put them in constant contact with people: Mariann, who had grown up with five siblings, was a cop, and Wendell co-owned a glass-contracting firm that after their marriage helped to build Biosphere 2, the futuristic experiment in self-sufficiency in Arizona's Sonoran Desert.
Driving down empty roads toward the Hardys, I wasn't sure what to expect. I had conceived of their existence as a kind of Walden of the West, fashioned after the 19th century treatise on self-sufficiency by Massachusetts writer Henry David Thoreau. From his perch on Walden Pond, Thoreau championed solitude as a way to live life to the fullest.
In society, he wrote, ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.""
During the visit, it struck me that Wendell and Mariann, while they had each other, had also taken things to an extreme Thoreau hadn't. The author, after all, only experimented with isolation on Walden Pond for two years. Even then, his self-reliance was apparently limited: Thoreau would take his dirty laundry home for his mother to wash.
During the decade it took the Hardys to build their homestead, Wendell was the self-taught designer and engineer. Mariann says that her nickname, Manny, is short for ""manual labor,"" but along the way she's become a skilled electrician, plumber, bricklayer and horticulturist. ""I do the digging, but I'm also a perfectionist,"" she says.
Their solar-powered home is entirely off grid. It took two years to build the fence around their land that keeps hunters out. Another fence, 8 feet high around the orchard, is not so much to deter people as elk, which would trample the gardens the couple depends on for food. (Recently, an agile bear reached the orchard and binge-ate 30 ripe cantaloupes).The 28-foot logs that make up the home took months to skin and put in place. Many of the steel fixtures around the property are from old tennis court light poles the couple scrounged from a Tucson country club.
After swearing off extravagances, they're able to get by on very little: a pension and some savings. The last movies they saw in a theater were ""Three Men and A Baby"" and ""Pulp Fiction.""
They can, and sometimes do, go months without venturing into the nearest town, Reserve, population 300, for bacon from Jake's grocery, or a visit with grandkids. (Wendell's daughter from a prior marriage moved to Catron County with her children in 2004.)
The couple did no panic buying as the pandemic hit; they're not the type to panic. Their root cellar – a buried shipping container accessed through an outhouse with a battery-powered elevator – is stocked like an underground Walmart (NYSE:WMT). (The shelves are made from old New Mexico road signs. ""The best plywood anywhere,"" Wendell says.) The nearest actual Walmart? A three-hour drive.
The social-distancing rules in effect almost everywhere else have little bearing on them. They're grateful for that, but no less concerned for family members, with whom they remain close, or for the rest of us.
Mariann, who is Catholic, has found solace in a daily virtual mass led by the local priest in Reserve, who's from Nigeria. ""I feel the need to pray for people during this pandemic,"" she says.
The United States, with 4% of the world's population, accounts for 28% of its recorded COVID-19 deaths so far, one indication that delaying strict social distancing measures can prove deadly. New York City has the grimmest toll, but it's clear now that rural areas won't be spared.
To the north and across the Arizona state line, the virus has been killing scores of Native Americans in the Navajo and Apache (NYSE:APA) Nations.
In New Mexico, economically depressed Catron County, whose biggest sawmill shut down years ago, has had only two confirmed cases. Despite the fierce beauty of this place, few outsiders visit.
""There is no attraction here, and for me that's the attraction,"" Wendell says as he looks out from a tennis-court-sized deck on the river, canyon, mountains and plains. ""I made a living dealing with people and can get along with anybody. I just don't like to, that's all.""
Mariann's view is more meditative.
""If you're isolated, you are able to take the time to reflect on life, what you might be able to change to be happier with yourself and with others,"" she says.
On my second day at the Hardy home, after the couple cooked up a breakfast of Finnish pancakes and crisp bacon, I wondered if they ever took refuge from each other. Surely the secret to a happy marriage between two hermit types wasn't to spend every waking moment together.
Then Mariann mentioned his cars and said I should see them for myself.
In a building Wendell quaintly calls ""the barn,"" he maintains a sort of mechanic shop-man cave that would be the envy of many. Finding and restoring antique cars and trucks is one of the only pursuits that draws him off his land.
The barn is where he spends hundreds of hours alone, converting them. Here was a new addition: a 1937 Cadillac limo with a modern engine and power steering, next to a 1928 Model A Ford. Another building on the property holds a '55 Chevy, a Ford Model T. One of Wendell's most fanciful creations, a ""river runner,"" consists of a Toyota pickup cab suspended seven feet up by a jaunty steel exoskeleton. It's terrifying to drive, but the vehicle's clearance and 25-foot wheel base make it capable of emergency river crossings.
And for Mariann, time alone comes largely in the garden, the orchard and greenhouses. She's growing 220 pounds of pinto beans, fresh asparagus, peppers and grapes for wine, jam and raisins.
But sometimes time alone is risky. A few weeks ago, Wendell told Mariann that he was taking the Cadillac out for a spin. She was worried that he could break down and decided to follow him in another vehicle, at a distance. When the Cadillac sputtered to a stop on a county road, they towed it home together. Wendell is back to spending long hours in the barn, tweaking its engine.
He didn't need to add a finicky Cadillac limousine to his fleet. But a few years ago, Mariann caught Wendell furtively visiting websites on his tablet, looking for challenging old beauties. The car, she knew, would give him purpose.
""I thought maybe Wendell should have just one more,"" she says. ""A last project car.""
GOING THE DISTANCE
While most people long for isolation to end, and states are starting to reopen, this dark chapter for society has reminded Wendell and Mariann of a quandary of their own. It is a familiar one.
Can we get through this period and still live in the way we choose?
What got them this far, they say, was an unwillingness to have anyone else prescribe how they should live, or die. But the couple didn't always consider how hard it would be to get old here.
Taking full inventory of their root cellar last year took a month of work. They're constantly monitoring power meters to see if there's enough energy to run a wash. No plumber, electrician or contractor has visited in years.
""If something goes wrong out here, you're looking at the guy and gal who have to fix it,"" Wendell says.
Both have needed a wheelchair at times. Mariann's knees are shot. Either of them could slip in their clawfoot bathtub. The what-ifs are endless and hard to plan for.
Wendell has had more serious health issues. Since 2002, he's had hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder in which iron builds up in the body, afflicting organs and joints. ""It literally rusts you from the inside out,"" he says. After his diagnosis, the couple had to drive several hours almost weekly to a hospital in Sho-Lo for his treatments. For now, it's under control, but liver cancer nearly killed him, and he's dependent on insulin for diabetes. His hearing is going; he hobbles after a fall down the root cellar shaft that crushed his foot. Mariann has stockpiled a year's worth of his medications.
Much as Wendell throws himself into restoring an old car, Mariann, with her self-described pioneer woman ethos, has been able to nurse Wendell back to health repeatedly. Can she continue?

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian rights campaigners took to the streets of the capital Abuja on Friday to raise awareness about sexual violence in the West African country after a series of high-profile rape cases.
#JusticeforUwa has trended on social media in the last week after Vera Uwaila Omosuwa, a 22-year-old student, died two days after she was raped in a church in the southern city of Benin.
More than 200 protesters marched around police headquarters in Abuja, chanting and holding placards that read ""Justice for all Nigerian girls and women"", and ""No means no"".
The march was one of a number of activities planned by campaigners to raise awareness of sexual violence and urge politicians to set aside more money to tackle the issue and ensure police independence.
""Children are dying, women are dying, enough is enough,"" said Dorothy Njemanze, one of the protest organisers. 
Njemanze said she and other campaigners were ""watching every step of everything they (politicians) say and do on sexual based violence"".
Nigeria's most senior policeman has ordered the immediate deployment of additional investigators to specialist gender violence desks, a Police Force statement said on Tuesday.

""This is to strengthen and enhance the capacity of the units to respond to increasing challenges of sexual assaults and domestic/gender-based violence linked with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and other social ills within the country,"" it said.

The Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) has been divided since Zimbabwe's Supreme Court ruled on March 30 that Nelson Chamisa was not its legitimate leader and installed Thokozani Khupe, head of one faction inside the party, to lead it in the interim.
Most MDC members still regard Chamisa as their leader and accuse President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government of siding with Khupe's faction in the battle for control of the movement.
Supporters of Khupe seized control of the party's offices at Harvest House late on Thursday while police watched, a video of the incident circulated by the MDC showed. Anti-riot police on Friday cordoned off the building, which has stood as a symbol of the MDC's fight against Mnangagwa's ruling ZANU-PF party for the past two decades.
Some MDC officials, led by party vice president and former finance minister Tendai Biti, then tried to enter Harvest House.
""We are the rightful owners of the building and you have had no court order to stop us from entering,"" Biti told the police officers blocking their way.
He and four other MDC officials were arrested and transported to a police station in a lorry. It was not immediately clear what charges they would face.
Police spokesman Paul Nyathi said he had no details of the arrests.
Chamisa says his party is different from Khupe's outfit after it contested elections in 2018 under the name MDC Alliance while Khupe's ran as the MDC-T party. 
Chamisa, 42, narrowly lost those elections to Mnangagwa. He says he is being persecuted for refusing to recognise the president's disputed victory while Khupe accepted the results.
Chamisa's MDC accuses Mnangagwa's government of eroding political rights under the cover of Zimbabwe's coronavirus lockdown, which includes a ban on political protests.

In a video question-and-answer session from the United Kingdom on Friday, Chris Patten also called for a global reset of international relations with China. 
He urged the United States to take leadership in bringing countries together in their dealings with China to prevent being ""picked off"" one by one by Beijing.
Patten, who governed Hong Kong until its 1997 transfer to Chinese rule, has been sharply critical of China's move last month to impose national security legislation.
""Since Xi Jinping came in, we've seen a gradual tightening of the screws on Hong Kong,"" Patten told journalists.
Patten said that he worries that the proposed law may make it harder for democratic candidates to qualify to stand for the Legislative Council election in September, and salutes them for their fight.
""They are on the same side of history as people like Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. Making martyrs of them, as China seems to be intent on doing, will make even more certain in 10, 15, 20 years time, people are remembering them, not Xi Jinping and his mafiaso,"" he said.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but its commissioner's office in Hong Kong has repeatedly condemned Patten's earlier comments. Last month, the office said it was ""ridiculous and despicable"" for Patten to still ""cling to a colonialist mentality"" and meddle with Hong Kong affairs. 
China's parliament approved last week a decision to create national security laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference, saying it needs to do so because the Hong Kong government has not been able to pass the law itself. The city was rocked by months of sometimes anti-government, anti-China protests.
Patten on Friday also called for countries to reflect on how to continue dealings with China ""while recognising that we can't let it get away indefinitely with bullying and heckling and breaking of rules"".
He likened the way China detained two Canadian citizens in late 2018 and recently boycotted Australian barley to pressure these countries to ""mafia-like"" behaviour, and said, ""the rest of the world shouldn't put up with it"".
""I totally agree with those who say you need to reset, but not end, your relationship with China,"" he said.
Hong Kong returned to China under a ""one country, two systems"" formula guaranteeing its freedoms and autonomy, which protesters say are being eroded by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.

China denies the charge and blames countries including the United States and Britain of fomenting unrest.

Iran freed Michael White on Thursday as part of a deal in which the United States allowed Iranian-American physician Majid Taheri to visit Iran.
Trump tweeted on Thursday of White's release: ""Thank you to Iran, it shows a deal is possible!"" 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, addressing Trump, said on Twitter, ""We achieved humanitarian swap despite your subordinates' efforts"".
""We had a deal when you entered office. ... Your advisors -most fired by now - made a dumb bet. Up to you to decide when you want to fix it.""
Trump pulled out in 2018 of the nuclear deal with major powers, under which Tehran curbed its nuclear work in return for the lifting of many international sanctions on Iran. Since quitting the agreement, Washington has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran’s oil exports as part of a policy of “maximum pressure”.
Thursday’s prisoner swap was a rare instance of U.S.-Iranian cooperation. Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi confirmed that Zarif met Bill Richardson, a former U.S. envoy to the United Nations, ""months ago"" over prisoner releases.

""We have always responded positively to humanitarian efforts that would lead to the release of Iranian hostages in the United States and elsewhere,"" Mousavi told the official IRNA news agency.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic's constitutional court on Friday rejected changes to the constitution that would have allowed President Faustin-Archange Touadera to stay in power if an election in December is delayed due to the new coronavirus.
The government had argued the changes, which would have authorised Touadera and national lawmakers to remain in office for an amount of time to be determined by the constitutional court, were need to ensure continuity of government.
The country, still struggling to emerge from a prolonged civil war, has so far confirmed about 1,300 cases of COVID-19 and four deaths. But it has a weak health system that could easily be overrun if case numbers surge.
In its ruling, the country's highest court said the proposed changes violated constitutional provisions forbidding modifications to the president's term and providing for the speaker of parliament to take over on a three-month interim basis if an election must be delayed.
""The will of the people would be tossed aside,"" it said in its judgment, which also urged the president to organise consultations with political parties to reach a consensual solution.
The presidency declined immediate comment. Mathurin Djimbélé, one of the lawmakers who sponsored the proposal in parliament, said he accepted the court's judgment but accused it of shirking its responsibilities. 
CAR is one of several African countries, along with Ivory Coast, Guinea and Ghana, where the pandemic has injected fresh uncertainty into presidential elections scheduled for later this year that were already expected to be bitterly contested. 
Touadera was elected in 2016 in a vote that followed a civil war unleashed by the overthrow three years earlier of former President Francois Bozize. 
Most of the diamond-rich country remains beyond government control as rival militias continue to clash. 

Bozize returned to CAR in December after six years in exile and has said he might stand in the election.

ERD, Hungary (Reuters) - Zoltan Wetter worked in restaurants for over two decades before the coronavirus pandemic cost him his job. With no savings, the 38-year-old chef from the town of Erd in Hungary took the first opportunity he could find: behind the wheel of a garbage truck. 
Wetter is among tens of thousands of Hungarians who lost their livelihoods almost overnight after the new coronavirus struck in early March and Hungary went into lockdown.
The country got off relatively lightly compared to others in Europe, but the economic impact is still severe: The government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to shrink by 3% this year, and for unemployment to rise to 5.6% from around 3% in 2019.
Annamaria Lazar, 29, lost her job when the jewellery shop where she had worked was forced to close. Eventually she found work picking carrots at a vegetable farm 70 kms (44 miles) from her home.
""I thought I would not live to see the end of the first day,"" she said. But at least she is financially independent from her parents, and she gets to be outdoors, Lazar said. 
Gabor Czaban used to work as a DJ, but quickly found work as a delivery truck driver for the Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) supermarket group.
""I do not work in the DJ stand and see the joy on people's faces now, but fortunately I still get to make people happy as they expect me like the saviour when I bring them some groceries.""
Meanwhile Wetter applied for work at his local council. ""When they called me back, I automatically said yes."" He has since been promoted from truck driver to dispatcher at a waste plant in Erd.
Wetter said his new line of work differed greatly from being a chef, but that it came with a more structured lifestyle:

""I can finally get some sleep again.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian court on Friday rejected a challenge by a Siberian shaman critical of President Vladimir Putin who says he has been illegally incarcerated in a psychiatric hospital, his lawyer said. 
Alexander Gabyshev drew media attention when he set off last year on an 8,000-km (5,000-mile) walk to Moscow, a journey he said would culminate with him banishing the Russian leader, whom he described as a demon.
Gabyshev made several attempts at the journey, but was always stopped by police, who took him back to Yakutsk, his home town in eastern Siberia. Finally, after being detained again in early May, he was taken to a psychiatric hospital. 
Rights activists have said Russia is reviving the Soviet practice of subjecting some of its political dissidents to forced hospitalisation and psychiatric treatment.
Olga Timofeeva, Gabyshev's lawyer, told Reuters that a Yakutsk city court had dismissed an attempt to have him released and his psychiatric hospitalisation declared illegal. 
""The decision was expected. We will appeal,"" Timofeeva said, adding that Gabyshev was calm and in good spirits. 
Amnesty International has called for Gabyshev's immediate release from hospital. 
Lawmaker Fedot Tumusov, who represents the region of Yakutia in the lower house of the Russian parliament, told the Kommersant newspaper he had asked the general prosecutor to review the competence of the doctors who signed off on Gabyshev's psychiatric hospitalisation.
Gabyshev was last year accused of extremism, an offence that can carry a prison term, and ordered not to leave Yakutsk.

Shamanism, a belief that it is possible to communicate with and harness the energy of what practitioners perceive to be the spirit world, is practiced in certain parts of Russia.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Mohammed Haider, a security worker in Iraq's southern oilfields, thought he was safe after signing a new one-year contract to guard oil facilities. Three days later, he was out of a job.
""I got laid off. They threw us out on the pavement,"" the 38-year-old said, speaking as he protested outside the Basra Oil Company headquarters, the national partner for foreign companies.
Haider had been hired to drive vehicles for a British security firm around the giant West Qurna 1 oilfield that produces hundreds of thousands of barrels of crude each day - part of OPEC member Iraq's principal source of wealth.
He now spends his days at home or searching in vain online for jobs that are hard to come by in a crisis-hit economy. 
""I can't even fall back on taxi-driving work. The curfew because of coronavirus means I'd get arrested for driving around illegally,"" he said later at his home.
Haider is one of thousands of workers in Iraq's oil sector who were laid off this year after a fall in oil prices caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and who struggle to find any other source of income.
Iraq in March asked international oil companies to cut their budgets by 30% because of plummeting oil prices. Energy companies in the south responded by cutting costs.
Subcontractors, including security, construction and transport firms, let thousands of workers go, according to local authorities.
""Of about 80,000 Iraqis working in the oilfields, some 10,000 to 15,000 are now out of work"", said Mohammed Ibadi, a local government official in Basra province, where most of the southern fields are located.
Iraqi workers had been forced to take unpaid leave or had been laid off completely, mostly by subcontractors, he said.
The British security company that employed Haider declined to comment.
'I'D TAKE HALF MY WAGES'
Ibadi's office received dozens of complaints from workers who asked Iraqi authorities to sanction companies that do not comply with contractual termination terms. The local authorities negotiated 50% and 25% salaries for four months for some 2,000 workers who had been laid off, he said.
Khalid Hamza, associate director of the Basra Oil Company, said the government body would not accept the arbitrary termination of local staff.
""We particularly need to protect the jobs of the local population,"" he said.
Iraq has pledged to cut nearly a million barrels of oil production per day (bpd) in line with OPEC cuts. Its exports stood at 3.2 million bpd in May. The cuts have slashed state revenue, of which it makes up more than 90%.
The government faces making cuts to public sector pay - a move that would further anger impatient Iraqis who staged protests last year against alleged government corruption and lack of jobs.
Ibadi fears the economic and social crisis will worsen as the COVID-19 pandemic hits Iraq harder. 
With most jobs in Basra linked to the energy industry, it is near impossible for workers like Haider to find an alternative source of income.
The father of three, who worked for five years as a driver for the British company, subcontracted by an American oil corporation, is ready to take on any job to provide for his family.
Haider fears he might no longer be able to cover school or medical costs.

""I wish the company would take me back, even for half my wages,"" He said.

PRAIA DA LUZ, Portugal (Reuters) - Foreign residents in the Portuguese resort of Praia da Luz on Friday spoke of their hopes that the parents of British girl Madeleine McCann, who went missing there 13 years ago, can find closure at last.
German authorities say she is now assumed to be dead and that an imprisoned German child abuser is suspected of her murder.
Madeleine, then aged 3, disappeared from her hotel room in 2007 during a family holiday in Praia da Luz, a small town in the southern Algarve where some foreign visitors end up living all year round.
""I always hoped they would find her alive,"" said Sally Clegg, a 69-year-old from Yorkshire, who bought a holiday home in the white-walled town, whose name translates as ""Beach of Light"", eight years ago. 
""I think for parents, even if horrible, at least they know and they can find closure,"" she told Reuters not far from the resort complex where Madeleine disappeared.
Coffee shops were open, but serving few customers as the town of about 3,500 residents remains largely deserted due to the coronavirus lockdown.
The church where the McCanns used to go and where locals prayed for her safe return years ago was shut.
""I feel bad for them. They are in a limbo, for so many years now. I can't even imagine what that's like so it would be great if there was some closure,"" said 57-year-old New Yorker Susan Harris, who moved to Praia about the time Maddie disappeared, as she strolled by the ocean.
Despite Madeleine's disappearance, Harris thought the resort was safe and still felt ""like a very family place"". 

Peter Sehurter, 70, from Switzerland, has lived in Praia de Luz for two years: ""When I moved in my neighbour said it happened in his flat ... I hope this is it - everybody does, but I think there's still lack of evidence. It would bring closure, mainly to the parents.""

BANGKOK/DHAKA (Reuters) - Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh with symptoms of the novel coronavirus are not coming forward to get tested because they fear being separated from their families and held in isolation, community leaders and aid workers say.
Only one death from the coronavirus has been recorded in the crowded camps in southeast Bangladesh, where some 730,000 Muslim Rohingya fled in 2017 to escape a military crackdown in Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
But aid workers fear the coronavirus may be spreading faster through the world's largest refugee settlement than the 29 cases confirmed since mid-May would indicate. Only 339 tests have been carried out in the camps, officials said, partly because people were simply not going to health facilities to get checked.
""Camp hospitals are empty and illegal doctors' shops are full,"" said 23-year-old refugee Mujef Khan, a community organiser, referring to pharmacies in the camps run by refugees where people buy pills to treat themselves.
""Many people are getting sick day by day - in every shelter,"" he said. 
Three Rohingya leaders interviewed by Reuters said coronavirus symptoms were prevalent in the camps that sprawl out over hills near the border with Myanmar.
The camps are more densely populated than the most crowded cities and sanitation is poor and social distancing impossible.
While new testing facilities and treatment centres are being built, a surge in cases could overwhelm the camps, aid workers said.
'HOW LONG?'
Like the majority of refugees, Khan fled from Myanmar in 2017 after his home in Rakhine State was burned to the ground during a military crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with genocidal intent.
Myanmar denies genocide, saying its forces were responding to a legitimate security threat from Rohingya militants who attacked security posts. 
While some refugees put the increase in illness in the camps – fever, dry cough, colds – down to the onset of the rainy season, many suspect it is the coronavirus.
""They don’t want to get tested,” said refugee Nurul Amin.
""We're very scared. By the grace of Allah, we're fine so far but how long can we hold out?”
Two research teams said they had found evidence to show refugees with coronavirus symptoms were reluctant to go to doctors.
Yale University researchers spoke to hundreds of refugees in April and found about a quarter reported at least one symptom of the coronavirus, while symptoms were twice as common in the camps compared with the surrounding Bangladeshi community.
Because testing is so limited and refugees fear going to the doctor, it was difficult to know the true spread of the disease, report author Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, professor of Economics at Yale, told Reuters. 
""All the other complementary indications in our data is that disease prevalence is likely much higher,” he said in an email.
RUMOURS
Researchers from the International Organization for Migration found that visits to clinics dropped by 50% in March, while some coronavirus patients tried to hide from health workers. 
""People don’t bother to get tested for the coronavirus. They are afraid of being isolated and quarantined,” said a Bangladesh government official who declined to be identified.
Mahbub Alam Talukder, Bangladesh’s refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, said authorities were working around the clock to expand testing, isolation and treatment facilities and improve communication with the community.
A lab handling 200 tests a day should soon be able to process 500 a day, said Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman with the U.N. refugee agency, while 12 treatment centres with 1,900 beds are planned. Two have been built.
But in the event of a major outbreak, patients may have to be treated in their homes or other places in the community rather than at medical facilities, said Muriel Boursier, head of mission for the Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) aid agency in Bangladesh. 
""The health capacity might be challenged and there might be a need for a community-based type of approach.”
Another problem was that Bangladeshi restrictions on internet and mobile phone access in the camps has contributed to a climate of fear, refugees said. Some people even believed rumours that coronavirus patients were being killed to stop the epidemic.
Furquan Mirza, a refugee helping to show a video door-to-door to educate people about the coronavirus, said it was as if people in the camps were blind and deaf.

""They can't see what's happening around the world,"" Mirza said, as he prepared for another day showing the film titled ""A Scared Community"".

Shares in Nornickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer, have been hit since Russian President Vladimir Putin this week upbraided officials over what he said was a bungled state response after a leak of fuel into a river.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that he had not heard any speculation about the possible nationalisation of Nornickel and that there was nothing to comment on. The priority was to clear up the spill and then an investigation would decide if anyone was guilty, he said.
Putin will meet officials later on Friday to discuss the incident, Peskov said, adding that Potanin would attend.
Potanin is the largest shareholder in Nornickel with a 34.6% stake. Another large shareholder is Russian aluminium producer Rusal, which relies on dividends from Nornickel in tough years and has had a number of shareholder rows with Potanin about the payments.
In a rare show of public support, Potanin's ex-business partner and former Nornickel co-owner, Mikhail Prokhorov issued a statement on Friday saying that Potanin was an effective crisis manager who would resolve the fuel spill situation.
""Groundless calls for nationalisation of the largest private enterprise, maligning of the reputation of a businessman, as well as public calls by some government officials to use investigative agencies to change owners and management of the company form a dangerous precedent,"" said Prokhorov, who sold his stake in Nornickel to Rusal in 2008.

""This is a serious threat to everyone who runs and develops private businesses in the country, from small restaurants to industrial giants,"" he added.

The Federal Criminal Court appellate division ruling against the federal police investigator is the latest headache for Lauber, who himself faces impeachment proceedings over what critics call his botched inquiry into corruption in world soccer. 
The man, identified only as ""Viktor K"" given restrictions on reporting the names of defendants in Swiss criminal proceedings, worked for the federal police agency but was assigned to Lauber's office. His language skills and Russian contacts made him an important channel between prosecutors. 
But his superiors began to question his trips paid for by Russian authorities, including hotel stays and a week-long brown bear hunting trip in 2016 in Siberia worth at least 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,450), according to the indictment seen by Reuters.
Lauber's office found itself in the position of having to file charges against the man from its own ranks.
Swiss media have published photos of the man, Lauber and other Swiss and Russian prosecutors on a yacht on Lake Baikal in 2014 during a conference in Russia. 
Lauber testified at the trial last year when the suspect was convicted of accepting a benefit.
Lauber's office said only that it took note of Friday's verdict.
Defence attorney Dominic Nellen said his client was disappointed that he was not acquitted, but regarded the verdict as a partial victory given he was awarded three-quarters of his legal costs as compensation.

The opposition has accused President Tayyip Erdogan and his AK Party of seeking to quash dissent by jailing opposition members and critics since a 2016 failed coup. The government has said its actions are justified by threats which Turkey faces.
Ankara accuses the HDP of ties to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought against the state in the largely Kurdish southeast since 1984 and is deemed a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. The HDP, which now has 58 deputies in parliament, denies such links.
Guven and Farisogullari were sentenced for membership of a terrorist organisation to six years three months and nine years respectively, state news agency Anadolu said. CHP's Berberoglu got five years and 10 months for giving a newspaper a video allegedly showing Turkey's intelligence agency trucking weapons into Syria.
Ankara has appointed trustees to 45 municipalities held by the HDP since local elections last year, mainly accusing them of PKK links, an HDP source said. The party still holds 12 municipalities. Eleven HDP deputies had their status removed before a parliamentary election in 2018.

(Reuters) - Thousands of miles from the protests that have swept the United States, Black Lives Matter has become a rallying cry for pro-Papuan activists in Indonesia, provoking questions about accusations of deep-seated racism.
Indonesian social media users have adopted the hashtag #PapuanLivesMatter alongside #BlackLivesMatter and prominent writers and artists have promoted it, a sign that the issue resonates beyond Papuans in an archipelago of 270 million. 
Accusations of discrimination have endured for decades in the resource rich and remote provinces of Papua and West Papua, whose indigenous people are of dark-skinned Melanesian origin in contrast with most in the world's fourth most populous nation.
""I think the BLM movement is useful in that it forces Indonesians to reflect on how Papuans have been treated by the police,"" Ligia Judith Giay, a Papuan postgraduate student at Australia's Murdoch University, told Reuters.
Parallels have been drawn between the death of African-American man George Floyd in Minnesota that unleashed the mass protests and the treatment of a Papuan man, Obby Kogoya, who was pinned down during his arrest in 2016 before he was jailed.
A website, ""We need to talk about Papua"", has been set up, while an Instagram post about the site attracted more than 12,000 likes.
Representatives of the Indonesian president’s office and the foreign ministry did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment about the online movement or accusations of racism against Papuans.
In recent days, Black Lives Matter has also been a rallying cry for black people complaining of discrimination in Australia, Brazil and elsewhere. 
Papua and West Papua came under Indonesian control after a United Nations sanctioned vote in 1969 that Papuan activists say was held under duress. A low-level insurgency has persisted for decades.
Anger boiled over last year in protests that killed dozens after Papuan students in Java were allegedly taunted with racist slurs, such as ""monkeys"".
Despite the online momentum, Indonesian political analyst Yohanes Sulaiman said local attitudes were unlikely to be swayed. 
""There's not much awareness from regular Indonesians that there's racism towards Papuans,"" he said. ""Most Indonesians consider Papua a problem of separatism. That’s how the government has framed the issue for decades.""
But in the same way that Floyd's death has catalysed a discussion of history and race in America, Black Lives Matter had inspired young people to ask questions, said Indonesian human rights activist Veronica Koman.

""There has been a huge rise in awareness among Indonesians outside our usual activist circle that I did not even see during the West Papua uprising last year,"" she said.

Turkey re-opened cafes, restaurants and other facilities on Monday, while also lifting restrictions on intercity travel and resuming domestic flights amid a slowdown in death and infection rates.
Turkey had also introduced weekend lockdowns across big cities on April 11.
The interior ministry extended the weekend lockdown overnight, a day after Health Minister Fahretting Koca said that his team would not recommend such a move. In a series of tweets, Erdogan said on Friday the government had to stick to the lockdown after a rise in daily new COVID-19 cases from around 700 to nearly 1,000.
Then he changed his mind.
""As a result of this negative development, we had to once again bring the stay-at-home order on our agenda,"" Erdogan said. ""However, the reactions we received from our people pushed us to re-evaluate the decision,"" he added. 
""Our hearts did not feel at ease with our citizens feeling trouble as they began to re-order their daily lives once again after 2.5 months,"" he said, urging citizens instead to follow social distancing and hygiene measures closely.

The virus has killed 4,630 people in Turkey, with 167,410 infections so far. The economy is expected to tip into recession as a result of containment measures, but Erdogan has promised a quick recovery.

TOKYO (Reuters) - They may not be helping out with chants but complete with cheerleader uniforms and pom-poms, mannequins at one Tokyo bar are helping keep customers a safe - and cheerful - distance apart.
Tokyo recently began to ease restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, a respite for bars and restaurants dependent on the city's normally thriving nightlife even if customers are not yet back in full force.
""Our restaurant looked very empty and we wanted to add more excitement,"" said Arata Funabara, owner of Cheers One, a cheerleading-themed bar in the capital's upscale Ginza district which counts both women and men among its clientele.
Other safety measures include face shields and gloves for the bar's cheerleader waitresses who perform karaoke songs on request. The shields and gloves are also on offer for patrons.

Indonesia has been the hardest-hit country in east Asia outside China from the pandemic and Jakarta has been the epicentre of the outbreak, with 7,766 cases and 523 deaths. 
""I feel happy that I can come back to the mosque ... because there's a difference in praying from home,"" said Deko Ronal Rafiyanto, 41, at the Al Azhar mosque in South Jakarta.

Some public transport has resumed operations and offices and malls are due to open in the city over the next two weeks.
On Friday, heavy traffic in parts of Jakarta indicated a return to what authorities have dubbed a new normal. 
Jakarta has retained some social restrictions though in recent weeks there have been signs of people flouting rules including by flocking to markets at the end of the Muslim fasting month, causing outrage on social media.

YONGIN, South Korea (Reuters) - Only a handful of rubber floats tumbled down the giant slide at South Korea's largest waterpark on Friday, its first day back in business since the coronavirus pandemic hit.
More visitors are expected to follow as summer gets under way, but new social distancing rules will make cooling off at Caribbean Bay in Yongin, southeast of Seoul, more complicated. 
Under government guidelines announced for South Korea's waterparks on Wednesday, people will have to maintain distance from each other in the pools as well as locker rooms and other facilities.
The operators of Caribbean Bay, Samsung (KS:005930) C&T, are implementing additional restrictions: Visitors must first fill out an online form to list any potential symptoms, and then have their temperatures checked before being allowed in. 
South Korea blunted an initial surge in infections in February and March, but has continued to see a small but steady number of new cases, especially from crowded spots like nightclubs and churches.
Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) water itself is not believed to be a major risk for spreading the coronavirus, but the park says it has sought to reduce the risks posed by people gathering in close proximity to each other.
Officials said they carry out disinfection operations every hour. Everyone is asked to wear protective face masks when not in the water and the park provides plastic bags to keep masks dry when not in use.
""I feel like it’s safe to enjoy, so I came,"" said Kim Seung-min, a business owner who said he dropped everything to come on the first day.
Only one ride was operating at Caribbean Bay on Friday, but for 9-year-old Lee Ji-woo, this was more than enough after weeks of virus-related closures and self-isolation.

""It was so boring and stuffy studying and watching TV at home so it's really exciting to be outside,"" she said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will throw open shopping malls, restaurants and places of worship that typically attract large crowds next week, officials said, even though coronavirus infections are rising at the fastest daily rate than at any time in the past three months.
Anxious to jump-start an economy crippled by COVID-19 and put millions of people back to work, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is dismantling its vast lockdown of the 1.3 billion population imposed in March. 
Strict guidelines will accompany the loosening of restrictions on Monday, however.
Hotel guests will be tested for fever, masks will be compulsory at all times, and restaurants will have to set tables apart to maintain social distancing when they reopen on Monday, according to rules issued by the federal home ministry.
In places of worship, people will be asked to wash their hands and feet before entering, and there will be no distribution of food offerings or sprinkling of holy water or touching of idols and holy books.
""In view of the potential threat of spread of infection, as far as feasible, recorded devotional music/songs may be played (but) choir or singing groups should not be allowed,” the home ministry said on its website.
India's places of worship especially Hindu temples draw many thousands of people and the premises are usually not big enough to allow for social distancing. At Delhi's popular Sai temple, administrators have painted circles on the street for people to stand so that they can regulate entry through its narrow corridors.
Total coronavirus infections in India have reached 226,770, along with 6,348 deaths, the health ministry said on Friday. At the current rate of growth, the caseload will surpass Italy within the next two days to become the world's sixth largest. 
With this in mind, some health experts cautioned against a hasty reopening. 
""Preventing cluster formations (of COVID-19 infections) is the need of the hour. We are opening up religious places too soon, too fast. Gods can wait,"" Giridhar R Babu, epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India, wrote on Twitter.
""The rising cases in Delhi is worrisome,"" federal Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said at a review meeting with city officials where he urged them to step up surveillance. 
There were 9,851 new infections in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry, up from last week's average daily growth of around 8,000. Mumbai, with a fifth of the infections, followed by Delhi and Chennai remain the hotspots.

Greenpeace has compared the scale of the accident, which saw 15,000 tonnes of fuel spill into rivers and 6,000 tonnes into subsoil near the remote northern Russian city of Norilsk, to the Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez oil spill in 1989. 
President Vladimir Putin has declared a state of emergency in the region and upbraided a senior official on television over what he said was a bungled state response. 
Norilsk Nickel, whose share price has been hit by the incident, has said melting permafrost driven by climate change may have eroded the foundations of a fuel tank at a power station in Norilsk, causing it to lose pressure and spill out the diesel fuel. 
Environmental scientists have warned for years that climate change causing the Arctic to warm faster than other areas of the world poses a threat to infrastructure built on permafrost. 
Rostekhnadzor, a safety watchdog, carried out three major spot checks in 2017-2018 at the power station operated by the Norilsk Nickel subsidiary and found an array of violations, including ones that concerned fuel tanks at the site, RBC reported. 
The power station was found, among other violations, to have failed to clean rust off the walls and roofs of some of its fuel tanks as it had been instructed to do by authorities years earlier, it said. 
Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer, says that such violations had not been identified at the fuel tank that lost pressure however, but concerned other fuel tanks, the media portal reported.

The company, in an email to employees, cited a message sent to its website, saying: ""Warning of explosion at Dentsu's Shiodome headquarters building with deadline past 7:00 a.m. on June 7, Sunday.""
Dentsu confirmed it has closed the building due to a bomb threat, and said has notified the authorities. 
Entry to the building was forbidden over the weekend, the company said in the email. Dentsu had already introduced work-from-home measures because of the coronavirus outbreak. 
The company is the focus of political scrutiny having received almost $700 million in government funds to help run a coronavirus aid programme via a scheme that has been described as opaque. 
The pandemic has also hammered the advertising giant as clients reduce spending, with the virus-induced delay to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, in which it has a central part, particularly painful.
Dentsu's headquarters is in the Shiodome business district, where blue-chip Japanese firms including tech conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp and airline ANA Holdings are also based.
Its shares closed up 0.8% ahead of the news. Dentsu's shares have gained 65% since hitting eight-year lows in April but are still down 19% year to date.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his attitude towards ""Black Pete"", a figure from the country's winter holiday celebrations that has been criticized as a racist caricature, had undergone ""great changes"" in recent years.
In a debate in parliament over anti-racism protests in the Netherlands prompted by solidarity with U.S. demonstrations, Rutte said late on Thursday his view had changed since 2013, when he said ""Black Pete is just black and I can't do much about that"" and dismissed the discussion.
In the Dutch tradition, St. Nicholas brings gifts to kids accompanied by numerous ""Petes"", clownish servants usually portrayed by white people in black face paint wearing frizzy wigs and red lipstick.
Rutte said that since 2013 he had met many people, including ""small children, who said 'I feel terribly discriminated (against) because Pete is black'.""
""And I thought, that's the last thing that we want"" in a holiday intended for children.
""I expect in a few years there will be no more Black Petes,"" Rutte said.
While critics including U.N. cultural experts have said Black Pete is offensive, a shrinking majority of white Dutch people argue Pete is either a magical fantasy figure not portraying any race or a lively figure of fun.
Rutte observed that the tradition is already changing. Some local celebrations feature Black Petes with dabs of paint on their cheeks, representing soot from the chimneys he is said to climb down to deliver presents. Others include multicoloured Petes, dropping the word ""Black"" from the name.
Anti-racism protests honouring George Floyd were held in Amsterdam and Rotterdam this week, with more scheduled.. Rutte acknowledged at a press conference on Wednesday that discrimination is a ""systematic problem"" in the Netherlands. 
""Here too, people are judged by their heritage,"" he said.
The protests were triggered by death of Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in the custody of white police officers in Minneapolis.

Once at the heart of Assad's inner circle, Makhlouf has called the asset seizure illegal and an attempt by the government to take the company from him. The unprecedented public tussle has uncovered a rare rift in Syria's ruling elite.
The decision to place Syriatel under judicial custody is to ""guarantee the rights of the public treasury and the rights of the shareholders in the company"" the administrative court wrote on Facebook. 
Makhlouf has addressed the dispute in three video messages in which he has appealed to Assad himself to help save his firm. In his last appearance, Makhlouf said he had been told to quit as the head of Syriatel.

Najib, who was voted out of power in 2018, is facing dozens of criminal charges over allegations that about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, a state fund he co-founded in 2009.
In the first case against him, Najib has plead not guilty to seven charges of criminal breach of trust, money laundering, and abuse of power over accusations that he had illegally received transfers of 42 million ringgit ($9.84 million) from former 1MDB unit SRC international. 
Kuala Lumpur High Court judge Mohamad Nazlan Mohamad Ghazali on Friday set July 28 to issue his verdict, as prosecutors and defence lawyers delivered their closing arguments after a 14-month long trial. 
If convicted, Najib, 66, faces hefty fines and jail terms of up to 15 to 20 years on each charge.
Defence lawyers say Najib was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that the SRC funds banked into his accounts in 2014 were donated by the Saudi royal family, rather than misappropriated from 1MDB as prosecutors have alleged.
Low faces charges in Malaysia and the United States over his alleged central role in the case. He has denied wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.

Cities around the world have seen swelling protests since the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck in Minneapolis.
Protesters in Guadalajara's historic center jumped on a police car, smashed its windows, and later set it on fire, footage from network Milenio showed. Police were seen using force against protesters, including dragging a girl by her hair on the ground.
One photographer from a local media outlet was kicked after being mistaken for a protester, the outlet reported.

""If you destroy my country distributing 5.1 billion pesos worth of shabu ... I will kill you,"" Duterte said in recorded address, referring to the drugs.
He did not say where the drugs were believed to have come from but said the Philippines was a transhipment centre for Mexican drugs gangsters.
Duterte also hurled insults at human rights groups for criticising his anti-narcotics campaign.

Floyd's death was the latest in a series of high-profile fatalities of black people in what civil rights activists and some politicians decry as white police officers using disproportionate force and a longstanding pattern of bias in the U.S. justice system.

The House Judiciary Committee plans a June 10 hearing on the same issues.
Floyd died after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while arresting him on May 25. Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, and three fellow officers who took part in the arrest face lesser criminal charges.
Some lawmakers were already pressing for legislation to make the use of chokeholds by police officers a federal civil rights violation and to ease the way for civil lawsuits against police. A proposed bill https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-congress/u-s-lawmaker-prepares-bill-aiming-to-end-court-protection-for-police-idUSKBN23831W backed by Representative Justin Amash, a Republican-turned-Libertarian, was joined by some of the House's most liberal lawmakers.
Three Senate Democrats - Kamala Harris, Cory Booker and Ed Markey - followed up with a resolution to eliminate the defense known as qualified immunity that the Amash bill also seeks to end.
    A Reuters investigation published last month revealed how qualified immunity https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-police-immunity-scotus-specialrep/special-report-for-cops-who-kill-special-supreme-court-protection-idUSKBN22K18C?enowpopup, continually refined over the years by the U.S. Supreme Court, has made it easier for cops to kill or injure civilians with impunity.
    The senators' resolution said black people are disproportionately the victims of excessive force by law enforcement officers and that the Floyd death is the result of ""pervasive and systemic racism that cannot be dismantled without, among other things, proper redress in the courts.""
    ""It is clear that the Supreme Court's qualified immunity doctrine is broken and in need of reform,"" said Harris.
Senator Roy Blunt, one of that chamber's top Republicans, called on the Justice Department to step up its enforcement actions against police misconduct. He said that under President Donald Trump the department had stopped using some of the legal tools it had in place to oversee police departments, which it had notably used in Ferguson, Missouri, following the 2014 fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager Mike Brown by a white officer.
Any legislative action would have to pass the Democratic-controlled House and Republican-held Senate, as well as be signed by Trump, to become law.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was noncommittal earlier this week when reporters asked what could be done to improve police accountability, amid what he called ""legitimate"" grievances over law enforcement actions. 
""We'll be talking to our colleagues about what, if anything, is appropriate for us to do in the wake of what's going on,"" McConnell said.

Congress has a long record of failing to address urgent social matters including and beyond race relations. One high-profile example was the failure of a bipartisan attempt to pass legislation requiring stricter gun-sale background checks or banning some semi-automatic weapons after a gunman killed 20 children and six adults at a Newtown, Connecticut elementary school in 2012.

PANAMA CITY/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Panama has stepped up border controls in the vast and wild Darien Province that neighbors Colombia, authorities said on Thursday, after some members of a group of 1,900 migrants from as far afield as Africa tried to break out of a detention center to trek north. 
The migrants were stranded when lockdown measures imposed across Central America weeks ago to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus stopped their long journey toward the United States.
Panama's national border agency said it had imposed unspecified new security measures, saying migrants turned violent during repeated attempts to leave the La Penita migration station in recent days. 
The agency said in a statement that internal restrictions on movement would make it impossible to cross into Costa Rica 
""Security in the area has been strengthened with specialized units in order to guarantee the safety of the community,"" a national border source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, adding that the situation was now under control.

China, which considers Taiwan its territory, has been angered by the Trump administration's stepped-up support for the self-ruled, democratic island, such as more arms sales and nearby U.S. patrols.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said on Friday the U.S. warship had transited the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the island from the mainland, heading south.
Taiwan's armed forces monitored the ship, which it described as being on an ""ordinary mission"", the ministry added, without providing further details.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet, in a post on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, named the ship as the USS Russell, an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer.
The United States has in recent months stepped up its sailings through the Taiwan Strait, to China's anger, adding to tensions over everything from Beijing's response to the coronavirus pandemic to trade and human rights.
Public events took place in both Taiwan and Chinese-ruled Hong Kong on Thursday to mark the 1989 Tiananmen anniversary.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina extended on Thursday a mandatory lockdown in Buenos Aires, the capital, and some other parts of the country until June 28, as confirmed coronavirus cases continue to rise, surpassing 20,000 earlier in the day.
The three-week extension of the lockdown, which had been due to expire June 7, will impact the capital city, the province of Buenos Aires and some other areas that account for the highest concentration of confirmed infections, President Alberto Fernandez said during a press conference. The rest of the country will move to a phase of ""mandatory and preventive social distancing."" 
The next phase will include new permissions, including outdoor exercise during certain hours in the city of Buenos Aires, which has the highest concentration of cases, officials said. 
Argentina recorded 929 new infections on Thursday, one of the highest daily counts since the pandemic began. The country has 20,197 cases, mostly in the city Buenos Aires and the province of Buenos Aires. The death toll is at 608.
""Our results are still good, but we have not yet overcome the problem,"" Fernandez said. 
Argentina has been under mandatory lockdown since March 20, though officials already relaxed restrictions in some areas of the country. Argentina has a commercial flight ban until Sept. 1, one of the world's strictest travel measures during the pandemic.

Lee in the state's capital city of Richmond. 
Saying the statue should be detached from its pedestal ""as soon as possible"" by the Department of General Services, the Democratic governor acknowledged the move could stir anger from admirers of the commander, who led troops in a slave-owning state during the American Civil War.
""Yes, that statue has been there for a long time. But it was wrong then and it is wrong now, so we're taking it down,"" Northam told a news conference.
A spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of General Services said planning was underway to remove the state-owned statue but no further details were available. 
Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney cheered the governor's order as Virginia was set to enter Phase Two of its coronavirus reopening plan on Friday, when restaurants and gyms can offer limited indoor service.
""We have two pandemics in this country, COVID-19 and racism,"" Stoney said. ""One is six months old, the other 400 years old. Both are lethal, especially for black and brown people."" 
The move comes after George Floyd's death on May 25 set off waves of protests and uprisings across the United States and abroad. Four Minneapolis police officers have been criminally charged.
In Richmond, protesters, many wearing face masks to guard against COVID-19 spread, gathered around the defaced statue on Monument Avenue, holding high raised fists and taking a knee in symbolic denunciation of racism. The pedestal, which has been repeatedly vandalized in recent years, this week was disfigured with spray paint reading ""Stop White Supremacy"" and ""ALM,"" which means ""All Lives Matter.""

1093,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 07:29PM ET</span>",Calls to suicide helpline show Thais' stress in downturn,"By Athit Perawongmetha and Jiraporn Kuhakan
BANGKOK (Reuters) - In the weeks before she took her own life, Thai waitress Nitiwadee Sae-Tia felt growing financial pressure after she lost her job, a member of the family said.
She was one of millions of Thais who lost their jobs after lockdown restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus forced malls and other public venues to close in March.
That included the Japanese restaurant where Nitiwadee worked, said the aunt who found her lifeless body when she visited her home in May.
""When I opened the door, I was shocked,"" said Praphai Yodpradit. She said Nitiwadee, 50, had grown increasingly stressed and withdrawn after losing her job.
Although Thai figures show the average rate of suicide fell in the first four months of the year, the charity group Samaritans of Thailand said it had received between three and five times the normal volume of daily calls to its suicide helpline since the lockdown in late March.
Most related to concerns about financial problems, said Panomporn Phoomchan, the director.
In a bid to cushion the blow, Thailand announced it would pay 15,000 baht ($460) in three monthly payments to people who had lost their jobs due to the shutdown.
Initially, 24 million people applied, but only 15 million qualified, a finance ministry spokesman said.
The financial struggle of many Thais during the lockdown was also highlighted in widespread media coverage of 59-year-old Unyakarn Booprasert, who tried to take her own life in April outside Thailand's finance ministry building.
She has since recovered and told Reuters she had tried to kill herself ""to speak for other people who suffered like me.""
Authorities have provided Unyakarn with financial support and the public has donated money. She said she is looking for work.
In the first fourth months of this year, Thailand has recorded an average of 350 suicides per month, down on the monthly average of 368 last year.
But Nattakorn Champathong, director of the National Suicide Prevention Center, is concerned that will change later when the immediate crisis of the pandemic has subsided but financial problems persist.
Health experts say it is an internationally recognised phenomenon that suicides often fall during a crisis, only to rise afterwards.
After the Asian financial crisis in Thailand, for example, the number of suicides between 1998 and 2000 increased to more than 8 per 100,000 people from below 7. That compares with 6.64 per 100,000 people last year. Similarly, they rose in Japan in the years following the Asian financial crash.

""Six months after the crisis, the Thai government will face a challenge as the number of suicides will spike,"" said Champathong, who wants authorities to prepare now.

(Reuters) - The video of George Floyd's death offers clues into how three former Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting his murder could defend themselves, from saying they didn't know excessive force was used to deferring to a senior officer, according to some legal experts.
A judge set bail of $1 million on Thursday for Tuo Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng. The three men were with Derek Chauvin, the officer charged with second-degree murder after being recorded by a bystander kneeling on the neck of the 46-year old https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-protests/he-touched-so-many-hearts-george-floyd-remembered-at-memorial-service-idUSKBN23B1LX African American for nearly nine minutes during his May 25 arrest.
The video touched off global protests against police brutality, but it also provides a window into possible defenses in court, seven legal experts interviewed by Reuters said.
People are usually charged with aiding and abetting when they actively encourage a crime or participate directly, such as driving a get-away car. 
""Here, however, you have police who are duty bound to help/protect their fellow officer,"" said Kurt Weinmann, an attorney with Garbarini & Scher. ""To charge them you’d have to show they knew or should have known he was acting with excessive force."" 
According to court documents, Thao watched as Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's neck, then turned to keep the crowd from getting too close.
Weinmann said Thao appears focused on controlling the growing crowd, as he is trained to do, and said prosecutors face a challenge of convicting him for failing to monitor Chauvin's level of force.
""Expecting an officer to do that would be asking him to go against all of his instincts and usual practice,"" Weinmann said.
Lawyers for Thao, Lane and Kueng did not respond to requests for comment. The officers were fired from the Minneapolis police department along with Chauvin.
The president of the police officers' union https://www.reuters.com/article/us-minneapolis-police-culture-specialrep/special-report-how-union-supreme-court-shield-minneapolis-cops-idUSKBN23B2LL, Bob Kroll, said in a letter to union members on Monday that the four ""were terminated without due process"" and he was working with the union’s labor attorneys to get them reinstated.
After Floyd's arrest, the officers briefly tried to put him in a squad car, but he refused and said he was claustrophobic, according to court documents. After a struggle, Chauvin pulled Floyd to the ground while handcuffed, the court documents said.
Lane and Kueng helped hold Floyd down while Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck, but the legal experts said they still had defenses, particularly Lane.
Soon after Floyd is pinned down, Lane asked Chauvin if they should roll Floyd on his side, and was told ""no,"" according to court documents.
Lane also said he was worried that Floyd was suffering from excited delirium, an agitated condition.
""The case against Lane will be the toughest for the prosecution because the defense will say he actively tried to help Mr. Floyd by urging Chauvin to turn Floyd over at least twice,"" said Paul Callan, a former New York City homicide prosecutor.
Lane's attorney told the court on Thursday his client was following his training officer's orders and ""he was doing everything he thought he was supposed to do."" 
Kueng held Floyd's back during the arrest, according to court documents, and may face the toughest case, partly because he remained silent during the arrest, the legal experts said.
They said Kueng will likely try to argue he was unaware of the extent of the force that Chauvin was using and could not determine Floyd's condition until it was too late.
Both Kueng and Lane were relatively junior officers, which also could work in their favor.

""They will say they weren't willing to go against the chain of command,"" said Joseph Friedberg, a defense attorney.

1095,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>","U.S. schools lay off hundreds of thousands, setting up lasting harm to kids","By Scot J. Paltrow
(Reuters) - Late last month, San Diego high school teacher Jessica Macias put aside her worries about her future, psyched herself up and launched into an enthusiastic lesson via video feed to her class on the theory of knowledge.
Macias, a 26-year-old English teacher, had attended Castle Park High School herself as a student. While delivering that lecture, she said, she was “pushing to the back of my head” that she’d soon be unemployed. Macias, along with 204 other teachers in San Diego’s Sweetwater Union High School District, will lose her job when the school year ends June 5.
The night before the class, she said in an interview, “I couldn’t sleep because I was thinking about not having a job.”
Macias will join the staggering number of public school personnel across the United States who have lost their jobs in the wake of school closures amid the Covid-19 pandemic. In April alone, 469,000 public school district personnel nationally lost their jobs, including kindergarten through twelfth-grade teachers and other school employees, a Labor Department economist told Reuters.
That is more than the nearly 300,000 total during the entire 2008 Great Recession, according to a 2014 paper by three university economists financed by the Russell Sage Foundation. The number of public school teachers hasn’t recovered from that shakeout, reaching near-2008 levels only in 2019. 
Multiple school district administrators, public officials and teaching experts have warned that the current school personnel job loss will last for years, hurting the education of a generation of American students. It also could be a drag on economic recovery, for one thing because school districts are big employers. 
The Labor Department reported on May 8 that 20.5 million non-farm workers lost jobs in April, including 980,000 government workers. Of those, 801,000 were local government employees. Although the Labor Department report does not break out the number, 469,000 of the 801,000 local government workers were K-12 public school teachers and other school personnel, the department economist told Reuters. 
BIG BLOW TO POOR AREAS
School districts in poor areas face the most punishing blows. A Brookings Institution paper in April predicted that education layoffs “would come at the worst possible time for high-poverty schools, as even more students fall into poverty and need more from schools as their parents and guardians lose their own jobs.”
Low-income districts are particularly troubled because of plunging revenue amid the Covid-19 recession. Districts rely for revenue on local property taxes and state subsidies. Poorer districts, where property tax revenue is low, rely on states for most of their income. With states hit hard by falling income and sales taxes, aid to school districts is dwindling in many places.
The job losses at public K-12 schools are bigger and coming faster than experts anticipated. Michael Griffith, a senior researcher at the Learning Policy Institute, says “we’re looking at record cuts in teaching positions.”
In addition, many librarians – who now perform a variety of essential classroom functions – are expected to be let go. So may college advisors and the aides who work with developmentally and physically disabled students.
Many teachers and administrators are predicting class sizes will double with fewer teachers on the payroll. Some say the teacher losses will be felt in other ways.
Robert Hull, chief executive of the National Association of State Boards of Education, which represents states’ interests, told Reuters most class sizes actually will shrink when schools reopen. That is because of COVID-19 and the need for social distancing. One adaptation will be to have students come to school, on a staggered basis, only on certain days of the week, and possibly receive video instruction other days. He predicted that some of these changes would be permanent.
DEMOCRATS SEEK AID BILL
A bill passed recently by the Democratic Party-controlled U.S. House of Representatives would provide $13.5 billion in aid to K-12 public schools. Republicans, who control the Senate, oppose the bill as written. Its fate hangs in the balance as school teachers and administrators hope for the bailout.
April was an especially cruel month for education. The Labor Department report said that in addition to the 469,000 K-12 personnel, state-run colleges and universities laid off 176,000 professors and other employees. Private schools, including well-known colleges and universities and K-12 private schools, were down by 457,000.
On average, 80% of public K-12 school budgets go to salaries and benefits, according to data from the Learning Policy Institute, leaving little besides employees to cut.
Susanna Loeb, a professor of education at Brown University, said she believes most of the 469,000 laid off in April were non-teacher personnel, as districts tend to fire teachers last. But anecdotal evidence from interviews and press reports suggests that the toll includes significant numbers of teachers.
The Paterson, New Jersey, school district is laying off 243 teachers. The school board of Rochester, New York, has authorized laying off up to 198 teachers. The Napa school district in California’s Napa Valley has voted for 145 teacher layoffs. Many small districts are laying off proportionately large numbers of teachers.
Like schools across the country, San Diego’s Sweetwater already had severe financial problems before Covid-19 hit. Sweetwater Superintendent Karen Janney did not respond to attempts to reach her for comment. 
English teacher Macias is out of luck. Because she had been a teacher there for only four years, her lack of seniority put her on the chopping block. There would be no reprieve even though she taught challenging classes, including baccalaureate degree courses required by European universities. She says she hasn’t yet seen any other openings in California.

“One of my biggest dreams was to teach at Castle Park,” Macias says.

Anti-racism protests have taken place in Britain in recent days, in solidarity with U.S. demonstrations sparked by the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck.
The brief protest outside Cummings's home involved about two dozen protesters who lay on the road and chanted slogans. One of them used a megaphone to denounce the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
Britain has the worst death toll from the virus in Europe, and people from ethnic minorities have been disproportionately affected. Black and Asian people in England are up to 50% more likely to die after becoming infected with COVID-19.
Cummings resisted intense pressure to resign, including from within the ruling Conservative Party, after revelations in late May that he had travelled 250 miles from London with his wife and son at the height of the coronavirus lockdown.
Johnson, who relies heavily on Cummings, denied his adviser had broken the rules being imposed on the rest of society, but polls have shown a sharp fall in confidence in the government's handling of the epidemic since the scandal.

The protest outside the aide's home was very small in comparison with a demonstration in central London the previous day, in which tens of thousands of people marched against racism.

Egypt suspended international flights in March and shut down restaurants, hotels and cafes in order to combat the pandemic, which has cost its tourist sector an estimated $1 billion per month. 
Tourism accounts for about 12%-15% of gross domestic product.
Although airports remain closed to all but domestic and repatriation flights, 99 hotels have been allowed to reopen at a quarter of their usual capacity if they met strict health and safety protocols.
Guests must be registered online and workers have to undergo rapid coronavirus tests when entering resorts, while a hotel floor or small building must be assigned as a quarantine area for positive or suspected coronavirus cases.
As of June, hotels certified as meeting regulations have been allowed to run at maximum 50% capacity.
""They have sanitized my bag. I have also done the key-less check in, which is the first time this has happened and the first time I see this,"" said Hossam Ragaie, a guest at the Conrad luxury hotel in Cairo.
Large events and buffets have been banned, said Karim Helmy, general manager of the Hilton King's Ranch hotel in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. 
Nevine Hamdy, who used to be a regular guest at the hotel before the pandemic, returned with her family to spend a few nights. 
""From the very start at the gate, the workers are wearing masks and gloves. There is no close interaction... They are taking the highest precautionary measures,"" she said.

Egypt has reported 29,767 coronavirus cases as of Thursday including 1,126 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department plans to issue a revised order in the coming days that is likely to allow some Chinese passenger airline flights to continue, government and airline officials said.
On Thursday, China said it would ease coronavirus restrictions to allow in more foreign carriers, shortly after Washington said it planned to bar Chinese passenger airlines from flying to the United States by June 16 due to Beijing's curbs on U.S. carriers.
The change should allow U.S. carriers to resume once-a-week flights into a city of their choice starting on June 8, but that would be still significantly fewer than what the U.S. government says its aviation agreement with China allows. 
The Transportation Department did not immediately comment.
The department said on Wednesday Chinese carriers could operate ""the same number of scheduled passenger flights as the Chinese government allows ours."" It added the order was to ""restore a competitive balance and fair and equal opportunity among U.S. and Chinese air carriers.""
The U.S. order would halt the four weekly U.S. roundtrip flights by Air China (SS:601111), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp, China Southern Airlines Co (SS:600029) and Xiamen Airlines Co.
U.S. and airline officials have privately raised concerns about the revised Chinese rules and it is unclear if carriers would agree to fly just once a week to China when they have sought approval for two or three daily flights.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) asked to resume flights to China this month. Both said they were reviewing the order from the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC).
American Airlines (O:AAL) is sticking with its previous plan to resume service to China at the end of October, spokesman Ross Feinstein said.
The CAAC said all airlines can increase the number of international flights involving China to two per week if none of their passengers test positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, for three consecutive weeks.

If five or more passengers on one flight test positive upon arrival, the CAAC will bar the airline for a week. Airlines would be suspended for four weeks if 10 passengers or more test positive.

1102,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>","Special Report: How union, Supreme Court shield Minneapolis cops","By Reade Levinson and Michael Berens
(Reuters) - Long before the death of George Floyd last week, efforts to overhaul the way policing is done in Minneapolis repeatedly fizzled in the face of a powerful 800-member union that championed military-style police tactics.
The union's labor contract with the city is a formidable roadblock to citizens seeking disciplinary action after aggressive encounters with police. Led by Lieutenant Bob Kroll, the union's vocal and hard-charging president for five years, officers rarely face sanctions, Reuters has found.
A Reuters analysis of complaints against Minneapolis police officers from the past eight years shows that 9 of every 10 accusations of misconduct were resolved without punishment or intervention aimed at changing an officer’s behavior. The analysis covers about 3,000 complaints during that period; five officers were fired.
The Minneapolis union contract is not unusual. Dozens of other contracts across the United States contain provisions that stymie efforts to hold cops accountable for violence and other alleged abuses, a 2017 Reuters investigation found. The news agency examined contracts in 82 cities for that article and found that 46 required departments to erase disciplinary records, some after just six months. The absence of a paper trail makes firing officers with a history of abuses difficult, lawyers and police chiefs say.
Compounding the challenge for citizens seeking justice: a U.S. legal doctrine called qualified immunity. A Reuters investigation last month found that the concept, created and reinforced in a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings, increasingly shields from civil liability officers who are accused of using excessive force.
“You have immune police officers who are beyond punishment because of their union contract as well as constitutional law,” said Gloria Browne-Marshall, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.
“That combination leads to an arrogance of a police officer who can kill a man in broad daylight while being taped and believe he can get away with it,” said Browne-Marshall, who teaches constitutional law. “When there are no consequences, that’s when people act with impunity.”

In Minneapolis, officers have successfully used the qualified immunity doctrine to win civil lawsuits against them in federal courts. It is difficult to identify all excessive force lawsuits in federal court records, but Reuters found 28 such cases from 2006 through 2018 in which Minneapolis police officers raised a qualified immunity defense. Judges sided with the officers in 15 of those, ending the cases without a jury trial.
The union contract and the qualified immunity doctrine play a role in emboldening some officers to commit abuses, legal scholars say, but they don’t always provide a shield in cases that trigger criminal charges or unleash national media scrutiny -- as has now happened in Minneapolis.
CRIMINAL CHARGES
All four officers present in the death of Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, have been criminally charged in the case. The state’s attorney general on Wednesday charged Derek Chauvin with second-degree murder and Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane with aiding and abetting second-degree murder.
The county attorney had charged Chauvin on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. The state's attorney general, Keith Ellison, said Wednesday that he and the prosecutor now believe the evidence warrants the stronger charge.
Graphic videos show Chauvin, who is white, kneeling on Floyd’s neck for more than eight minutes as the unarmed man gasped for breath and groaned, “Please, I can’t breathe.”
Kueng and Lane also restrained Floyd, while Thao stood nearby.
Chauvin was jailed Friday, and the other three were booked Wednesday. All four officers were fired soon after the incident.
In a letter to union members on Monday, Federation president Kroll wrote that he was working with the union’s labor attorneys to get each of the officers reinstated.
“They were terminated without due process,” Kroll wrote.
WARRIOR-STYLE POLICING
Since Floyd’s death, the usually outspoken Kroll has said little in public. He did not respond to interview requests from Reuters. In Monday’s letter, he criticized elected leaders for their handling of widespread protests in the wake of Floyd’s death. He praised the city’s police officers for their response to “the largest scale riot Minneapolis has ever seen” and characterized the unrest as a “terrorist movement” that has been building for years.
That quickly drew blowback from city leaders. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tweeted: “For a man who complains so frequently about a lack of community trust and support for the police department, Bob Kroll remains shockingly indifferent to his role in undermining that trust and support.”
Some Minnesota labor unions called for Kroll’s resignation. Among them: the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, and Education Minnesota. In addition, the board of the Minneapolis Public Schools unanimously voted Tuesday to terminate its $1.1 million contract with the Minneapolis Police Department in response to Floyd’s death. The department had provided officers to patrol schools.
Kroll, who became union president in 2015, has locked horns with police chiefs and mayors past and present. A key point of contention: Kroll’s backing of so-called warrior-style policing, which conditions officers to view all encounters with residents as inherently dangerous. After Frey stopped the department’s use of such training last year, Kroll announced the union would make the training free for any officer who wanted it.
“The culture is that when they’re coming into their jobs to police, it’s like they’re going to a war zone,” said Joshua Williams (NYSE:WMB), a human rights attorney in Minneapolis. “That’s the mentality -- this is not their community.”
DISCIPLINARY HURDLES
The long-running antagonism between the police union and the community has hamstrung efforts by Minneapolis elected officials and reform-minded department leaders to change that mentality, one former chief says.
Janeé Harteau, Minneapolis police chief from 2012 to 2017, said arbitration rulings and union grievances that reversed disciplinary actions made it difficult to create a culture of accountability in the department.
Among the contract provisions that impede efforts to discipline abusive cops is one that forbids the department from including allegations of misconduct in an officer’s personnel file unless the accusations result in discipline. That means investigators cannot consider an officer’s history of complaints while probing a new allegation.
During investigations into misconduct complaints, the contract grants officers concessions that are not afforded to civilians suspected of wrongdoing. Officers are entitled to a written summation of the accusation and events, and they are given as long as two days to consider that information and to consult with a union representative before they can be called to give a statement to investigators.
Such “cooling off” periods are typical of police union contracts across the country, said Samuel Sinyangwe, a policy analyst, and they allow officers to “essentially get their facts right” before talking to the department’s internal investigators.
Some city officials say the very structure of the Minneapolis police union creates ethical concerns during the disciplinary process. Supervisors, who are in charge of discipline, are part of the same union that seeks to protect accused officers. Mayor Frey has sought to end this arrangement.
Even when officers are fired for misconduct, the union contract allows them to petition an arbitrator for their job back. Should the four officers in the Floyd case be found not guilty in criminal court, they could seek reinstatement under the contract.
Taxpayers often help pay to defend officers accused of misconduct, even in wrongful death. That is because the contract requires the city to provide legal representation to defend against job-related charges.
A FRUSTRATED CHIEF
In an interview, Harteau, the city’s first female chief and its first openly gay chief, cited particular frustration with how long it took to get one Minneapolis police officer with a long history of citizen complaints off the force.
In 2016, she fired Officer Blayne Lehner for violating the department's use of force policy after video showed him repeatedly throwing a woman to the ground while responding to a domestic disturbance. Over his 18-year career, he had accumulated more than 30 complaints. An arbitrator, concluding that Lehner’s use of force was not “substantially inappropriate,” overturned the chief’s decision and reduced the sanction to a 40-hour suspension without pay.
Lehner stayed on the force for three more years, until he was fired last year after another accusation of excessive force. The same arbitrator, Stephen Befort, upheld the termination.
“These cases are difficult and every arbitrator I know agonizes over the appropriate outcome,” Befort told Reuters this week.
Lehner did not respond to a request for comment. In arbitration filings during the 2016 case, the union said his use of force was ""measured in its severity"" and that ""Lehner's long and good work should be treated as a mitigating factor.""
Jim Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, the nation’s largest law enforcement union, said it’s easy to blame union contracts when clashes between police and civilians spark public outrage. But cities have a role in shaping those contracts, too.
“It’s become a blame game,” Pasco said. “The thing that critics never say is that contracts aren’t forced down the throats of anyone. They are negotiated.”
Police unions do not “recruit, screen or supervise officers,” he said, suggesting that low hiring standards, inadequate training and lack of supervision by top management undermine the quality of police forces. “Not everyone is suited to be a police officer,” Pasco said.
The FOP represents more than 2,000 law enforcement agencies, but it does not represent the Minneapolis Police Department, which has its own union.
BLUE WALL OF SILENCE
Harteau did have some successes. She began training to help officers recognize implicit biases, and in 2016, she rolled out the department’s body camera program, despite fierce opposition from the union.
She said she met resistance “at just about every turn” from the police federation. She said Floyd’s death shows how the culture among Minneapolis rank-and-file discourages intervening when a colleague is out of line.
“I don’t believe we hire bad cops,” former chief Harteau said. “I think events occur and we let things go unchecked.”
“The union’s perspective is we need to support the cops no matter what,” she said. “I support good work, but we cannot support or condone those that do not do a good job or act consistent with our core beliefs and values.”
Kroll voiced his views on officer conduct following a police shooting in 2015. During a meeting, he told the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota that he “viewed policing and complaints like you view a basketball game, in that if you’re not getting any fouls you aren’t playing hard enough.” 
ACCUSATIONS OF RACISM
Kroll has himself been the subject of 10 misconduct complaints since 2013, police records show. The records don’t disclose the allegations against him. None of the complaints resulted in discipline; one remains open.
He also was mentioned in a 2007 discrimination lawsuit filed against the department by five black officers. Among the plaintiffs: Medaria Arradondo, who was then a lieutenant in the force and is now the chief, having succeeded Harteau.
In court filings, Arradondo and his fellow officers alleged that the Minneapolis police force had “a history of tolerating racist and discriminatory remarks by its white police officers.” The suit described an incident in 1992 in which every African-American officer received a hate letter through the interoffice mail that threatened their lives. The letters were signed “KKK,” the suit said.
The lawsuit specifically called out Kroll. It alleged that Kroll referred to Keith Ellison, then a U.S. congressman, as a “terrorist.” Ellison, who is black and Muslim, became the state’s attorney general in 2019 and is now helping to prosecute the four officers involved in the Floyd case. The suit also alleged Kroll wore ""a motorcycle jacket with a 'White Power' badge sewn onto it.""
The police chief at the time sent an email to all employees denouncing the alleged comments, and Kroll told the St. Paul Pioneer Press that he thought Arradondo and the four other officers were on a fishing expedition. “Ever hear the phrase ‘throw a lot against a wall and hope something sticks?'"" he said then.
The suit was settled in 2009 for $740,000.
Arradondo, who became chief in 2017, has sought to stop at least one policing practice that disproportionately affects black residents. He ended low-level marijuana stings after the Hennepin County public defender found that almost every arrestee was black. On Sunday night, Arradondo said on CNN that Floyd’s killing “was a violation of humanity.”
In the wake of Floyd’s death at the hands of a white officer, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced Tuesday that the state Department of Human Rights would begin a civil rights investigation into Minneapolis Police Department policies and practices over the last 10 years. Its mission: to determine if the department “has engaged in systemic discriminatory practices towards people of color and ensure any such practices are stopped.”
A RARE SPLIT
As union president, Kroll has also clashed with the Hennepin County prosecutor. In 2018, Kroll defended officers who refused to be interviewed for the county attorney’s 2018 investigation into the death of a 40-year-old white woman shot by a police officer in the alley behind her home.
The woman, Justine Damond, was barefoot and in her pajamas. The prosecutor, who eventually charged officer Mohamed Noor with murder, had to convene a grand jury and subpoena the officers to get their testimony. Noor, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, was convicted of third-degree murder and manslaughter, and was sentenced to 12-1/2 years in prison.
The incident marked a rare split between prosecutors and police in the United States, who typically work closely in pursuing cases. The prosecutor in the Noor case, Hennepin County Attorney Michael Freeman, is now involved in the prosecution of the four officers involved in Floyd’s death. He declined to comment for this story, but in a 2018 statement to the media, he said he was left with no choice but to subpoena the officers in the Noor investigation.
Kroll defended the position of the officers in the Noor case, saying at the time that they were acting under the terms of the union contract. The contract, which remains in effect, specifies that police statements to investigators are voluntary and “made at the discretion of the officer.” In an interview with a local radio station in 2018, Kroll said it was unfair to say the police had not cooperated.

“The thing is, they were asked to come in for a voluntary statement, and not volunteering does not mean not cooperating,” he said.

Crimean Human Rights Group said in a statement that Artem Gerasimov had become the second Jehovah's Witness to be convicted for practicing his religion in Crimea, following the decision by the Crimean Supreme Court, and was one of dozens to be prosecuted in similar cases by Russian authorities.
The court did not immediately respond to a request to comment.
In a similar case in March, Sergei Filatov was found guilty of knowingly ignoring a 2017 ruling by Russia's Supreme Court that the Christian denomination was an extremist organisation and should disband.
""Today's ruling by the Crimean Supreme Court brings religious persecution to a new level of cruelty,"" said Jarrod Lopes, spokesman for Jehovah's Witnesses.
""We hope that senior officials in Russia will soon correct the injustice being doled out in their local courts and that judges in Crimea will follow suit.""
Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin.
Jehovah's Witnesses say Russia's constitution guarantees their right to exercise freedom of religion and deny wrongdoing but Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values.
Putin said in 2018 he did not understand why authorities were pursuing the group and called for the matter to be analysed. 
But the Kremlin has said since that the group remains illegal under current legislation and has declined to confirm whether the law will be changed or not.
Jehovah's Witnesses are a Christian denomination known for door-to-door preaching, close Bible study, and rejection of military service and blood transfusions. The group has about 170,000 followers in Russia, and 8 million worldwide.

KIEV (Reuters) - An audit of thousands of old case files by Ukrainian prosecutors found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Hunter Biden, the former prosecutor general, who had launched the audit, told Reuters. 
Ruslan Ryaboshapka was in the spotlight last year as the man who would decide whether to launch an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, in what became a key issue in the impeachment of President Donald Trump. 
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy described Ryaboshapka as ""100 percent my person"" on a call in July 2019 in which Trump asked Zelenskiy to investigate Biden, the man who became his main rival in the 2020 presidential race.
After taking office, Ryaboshapka in October announced an audit of old cases he inherited, including those related to the energy company Burisma, where Hunter Biden was a board member between 2014-2019.
The audit was intended to probe whether cases Ryaboshapka had inherited from his predecessors had been handled properly, given the reputation of the prosecution service as being riddled with corruption and influence-peddling. 
The audit was part of a broader reform of the prosecution service but became politically charged given some of the cases related to Burisma's founder. 
""Regarding the call to Zelenskiy and this story with Burisma. I can say that there was no pressure on me,"" Ryaboshapka said. ""The audit was completed."" 
""I specifically asked prosecutors to check especially carefully those facts about Biden's alleged involvement. They answered that there was nothing of the kind,"" he added.
Ryaboshapka was fired in March after lawmakers accused him of not moving quickly enough in prosecuting cases. Ryaboshapka said he was axed because he had started bringing real reform to the prosecution service for the first time in a way that threatened the interests of corrupt politicians.
Trump was impeached on charges of abuse of power and obstruction in the Democratic-led House of Representatives after he asked Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. He was acquitted by the Republican-controlled Senate. 
Hunter Biden's activities at Burisma have also been the target of scrutiny by a U.S. Senate committee.

Unwittingly caught up in the impeachment row last year, Zelenskiy has said Ukrainians are ""tired"" of the issue and does not want Ukraine being dragged into the 2020 presidential race.

Britain granted Huawei a limited role in its 5G network in January, defying calls to ban the company over security concerns and U.S. threats to cut off valuable intelligence feeds with countries that use the Chinese firm's equipment.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has since come under renewed pressure from Washington and lawmakers in his own party, and London is now looking at the possibility of phasing Huawei out of its 5G network completely by 2023, officials say.
Speaking in an interview recorded on May 18 for a science festival in England, GCHQ Director Jeremy Fleming said he did not see differing positions on Huawei as a threat to the ""Five Eyes"" security alliance of the UK, United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.
""Five Eyes isn't an organisation, it's a partnership, it's an alliance. It is, of course, the case that whilst we share basic principles ...there are areas where, from time to time, our approaches differ,"" he said.
""Those are not fundamentally undermining the alliance. Indeed, I think it's the power of the alliance that, where we do differ, we can both understand why we're taking those decisions, but also make sure that we continue to cooperate across the broader piece.""
Ties between the United Kingdom and China have grown tense in recent months over Beijing's handling of Hong Kong and the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We see China as an intelligence adversary, we see them as an economic partner, we work with them in some areas, we compete with them in others,"" said Fleming. 
""And in still others, we call out their behaviours when we don't think they align with what we expect to see or with our values.""

Huawei has repeatedly denied the U.S.-led allegations that it's equipment poses a security risk.

LONDON (Reuters) - The GAVI vaccines alliance said on Thursday it had raised $8.8 billion from international donor governments, companies and philanthropic foundations to fund its immunisation programmes through to 2025.
At a funding summit in London, GAVI said the pledges had exceeded its target of $7.4 billion, and would ""help immunise 300 million more children in the world's poorest countries against diseases like measles, polio and diphtheria"".
The vaccines alliance also said it had raised $567 million towards an initial goal of $2 billion from international donors for an Advanced Market Commitment to buy future COVID-19 vaccines for poor countries.
The deal would help secure enough COVID-19 vaccine doses - when the shots have been developed - for poor countries to immunise healthcare workers and those at high risk, it said, as well as creating a ""buffer of doses"" for use when needed. 
GAVI, the World Health Organisation and the United Nations children's fund UNICEF have warned that 80 million children under the age of one are at risk of disease due to disruptions to vital immunisation programmes because of the COVID-19 pandemic caused by the new coronavirus.
Britain, which hosted the summit, was among the largest donor to GAVI's core $8.8 billion funding, pledging the equivalent of 330 million pounds ($416 million) per year over the next five years, GAVI said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said GAVI could count on the UK's full contribution to help ""the triumph of humanity over disease, now and for the generations that follow"".
Other top donors included the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which gave $1.6 billion for the period up to 2025, and the governments of Norway, Germany and the United States.
""To beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the world needs more than breakthrough science. It needs breakthrough generosity. And that’s what we’re seeing today as leaders across the public and private sectors are stepping up to support GAVI,"" Bill Gates, co-chair of the philanthropic Gates Foundation, told the summit. 
He added that when COVID-19 vaccines are ready, the AMC funding would ensure people all over the world can access them.
GAVI said eight of the government donors were countries making their first ever pledge to the vaccines alliance: These were Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Finland, Greece, New Zealand, Portugal and Uganda. 
GAVI is a public-private partnership backed by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the WHO, the World Bank, UNICEF and others, which arranges bulk buys to reduce vaccine costs for poor countries.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's nationalist government won a vote of confidence in parliament on Thursday which it called to shore up its authority before a presidential election.
Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki unexpectedly asked for the vote in the lower house after a series of setbacks threatened to derail the re-election campaign of President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party.
Duda had long been the clear favourite in the June 28 election but opinion polls have shown his lead narrowing. One poll on Monday showed he would lose a second-round runoff against either of his main challengers.
His re-election is important for PiS's hopes of implementing its conservative agenda, which includes judicial reforms that critics say reduce the independence of courts.
In the vote, 235 lawmakers supported the government, 219 opposed it and two abstained. 
PiS' image as been hurt by its failure to organise the presidential election on schedule after a junior coalition partner blocked the initial plan to hold it on May 10, during Poland's coronavirus lockdown. 
Parliament was also set to hold a no-confidence vote in Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski, who is under fire over alleged irregularities in the purchase of face masks during the coronavirus outbreak.
""If you have enough votes, dismiss us. If not, let us act, don't disturb us,"" Morawiecki said before the confidence vote in the Sejm, or lower house, where PiS has a majority. 
Katarzyna Lubnauer, an opposition lawmaker, said PiS wanted to draw attention way from the planned no-confidence vote in Szumowski and asked: ""Is this a panic attack?""

Duda's campaign has also been set back by accusations that a public radio station tried to censor a song critical of PiS and that member of the ruling party do not comply with coronavirus restrictions. PiS has dismissed the accusations.

TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised government regained control of Tripoli on Thursday, driving eastern forces out of the capital after a 14-month battle in which foreign powers poured in arms and fighters. 
In the recaptured southern suburbs, bodies still lay on the ground and fighters brandished weapons abandoned by the eastern forces, a Reuters visual journalist said. 
In the city centre, civilians were glad the fighting was over. ""It's an incredible feeling. People can now return home and there is no more shelling,"" said a 37-year-old man from the Ain Zara district, one of the areas taken, who asked not to use his name.
A military source with the eastern forces said they were pulling back from all of Tripoli's suburbs. Government forces said they now held everything within the city boundary. 
It represents a stinging reversal for eastern commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA), which launched an offensive on Tripoli last year pledging to unite Libya after years of chaos. 
Continued Russian, Egyptian and United Arab Emirates support for the LNA means the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations and backed by Turkey, has little hope of carrying the war into eastern Libya for now. 
But, with eastern forces withdrawing towards their northwestern stronghold of Tarhouna, the lines are being drawn for battles to come although both sides have agreed to resume U.N.-brokered ceasefire talks. 
The arrival of heavier weapons, which the United States says include a fleet of Russian warplanes, means fighting could become far deadlier. 
The U.S. ambassador to Libya, Richard Norland, said in a call with journalists on Thursday the situation had escalated dangerously, but added that Haftar's defeat in Tripoli created an opportunity to stop fighting. 
""Participants have a choice to watch it escalate into a full-blown regional war or to finally de-escalate,"" he said. 
The main outside powers engaged in the conflict have welcomed the decision to resume ceasefire talks and publicly say they support a political resolution, but it is unclear if they could agree on a settlement.
It leaves Libya still partitioned between rival administrations in Tripoli and Benghazi in the east.
After GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj met Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday, the Turkish president said Ankara would increase its support to Tripoli. 
A senior Turkish official said the GNA advances were critical before any potential peace talks.
""Everyone wants to sit at the table without losing territory, but the territory you hold strengthens your positions at the table,"" the official said.
Norland said the U.N. had already restarted the process of talks and was engaging each side separately at first. 
INTENSE BOMBARDMENT 
Both sides in Libya are made up of unstable coalitions of sometimes rival factions. It is unclear how the failure of the Tripoli offensive could affect the position of Haftar, who went to Cairo on Wednesday for meetings with Egypt's deputy defence minister. 
Analysts say there are few other candidates capable of holding together the different forces in the LNA and a statement by Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry in Cairo reflected Egypt's established position of blaming Turkey for the bloodshed. 
The LNA's sudden reversals follow Turkey's direct intervention with drones that have targeted LNA supply lines and defences that neutralised much eastern air power. 
Fighting in the southern suburbs has for months involved intense bombardment of civilian areas held by the GNA, including rocket attacks on hospitals. 
A GNA military spokesman said the recent advances meant Tripoli would now be out of range of LNA shelling. 

But as the GNA moved southwards through the city over the past week, it said its fighters encountered many explosive booby traps hidden in houses. Civilians in LNA-held Tarhouna now face the prospect of coming under more intense bombardment.

The Central African nation of over 1.2 million people has registered more than 1,000 cases of COVID-19 and 12 deaths since confirmation of its first case in mid-March, according to WHO data.
That is dwarfed by other countries in the region, but is significant given the oil-producing nation's small population, the WHO said. 
""By population we estimate it to be one of the severely affected countries in terms of the number of cases,"" WHO's Matshidiso Moeti told reporters.
The government has asked the WHO to replace its representative Triphonie Nkurunziza in Equatorial Guinea, Moeti added, without giving details on why.
""We are currently working on doing that,"" she said. 
""I'd like to emphasise very much that we are committed to working with the government, particularly working to support the people.""
Sub-Saharan Africa's only Spanish-speaking territory, run along authoritarian lines by President Teodoro Obiang since a 1979 coup, has also been badly hit by a global oil downturn this year as fossil fuels provide 90% of state revenue.

The WHO has been helping the government respond to the coronavirus epidemic through the implementation of surveillance, contact-tracing, and isolation measures, as well as management of COVID-19 cases, Moeti said.

1111,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 12:13PM ET</span>","For Venezuelans, a key obstacle for handwashing during pandemic - no running water","By Vivian Sequera and Johnny Carvajal
CARACAS (Reuters) - After going two months without running water at her home on the outskirts of Venezuela's capital Caracas, Mara Loyo stores it whenever it becomes available, in pots, pans, and even tablespoons. 
Venezuelans have long suffered deteriorating public services amid a six-year economic collapse. Now, shortages of running water throughout the crisis-stricken South American country are worsening even as the spread of the coronavirus pandemic heightens the importance of hygiene. 
Caracas residents like Aura Perez's three children have taken to traveling daily to a nearby mountainside to fill large containers with water that falls naturally from the mountain to the street.
""I'm anxious about how we are going to cook, how we will wash the bathrooms, the plates, the pots,"" said Perez, a 57-year-old retired secretary. ""I am angry that there is no water, but I feel exhausted."" 
Loyo, a 47-year-old dermatologist, and fellow residents in the Terrazas de Guaicoco neighborhood eventually pressured the government into delivering a water truck on May 26 by cutting off a motorway during a protest. 
She knows this water offers just temporary relief, and that even when it's there, it is of questionable quality.
""I'm aware that I am bathing in mud,"" Loyo said. 
'NOT SERIOUS SOLUTIONS'
After years of underinvestment and mismanagement under socialist President Nicolas Maduro, Venezuelans have grown accustomed to coping with frequent power blackouts, cooking-gas shortages, and even long lines for gasoline in this OPEC nation that boasts the world's largest crude reserves. 
Even as state television announcements emphasized the importance of handwashing to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, water shortages worsened in the capital region.
Protests over the scarcity of water, cooking gas, or electricity made up over half of Venezuela's 716 demonstrations in April, according to the nonprofit Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict.
A recent study by the opposition-held National Assembly found that 73% of Venezuelans receive an irregular supply of water and 19.6% did not receive any running water in the past seven days. 
Just 7.3% said they receive clean water continuously. 
Maduro's government has blamed the recent shortages on an alleged act of sabotage at a reservoir that feeds Caracas. To address the problem, the government in mid-May imported some 1,000 water trucks with the capacity of some 30,000 liters each from China. 
Norberto Bausson, a former vice-president of the state-run company Hidrocapital responsible for supplying Caracas with water, called water trucks a ""prehistoric service"" that could provide nowhere near the quality of a functioning pipe-based supply network. 
""These are not serious solutions,"" Bausson said. 
He said recent rains after a dry start to 2020 were unlikely to help because the root of the problem was in leaky tubes and malfunctioning pumps due to lack of maintenance and replacement parts.
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
HOSPITALS AFFECTED 
Venezuela - which has relatively few foreign visitors - has not been hit as hard as other Latin American countries like Brazil and Ecuador as the pandemic has spread across the region. It has reported 1,952 cases and 20 deaths so far from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
But doctors and activists have raised concerns about the ability of its crumbling healthcare system to cope with any outbreak. 
A survey of 16 health centers in Caracas conducted by Mauro Zambrano, an opposition-linked health care union leader, found that eight lacked water. The figure was published in a late May joint report by Human Rights Watch and the John Hopkins University's Centers for Public Health and Human Rights and for Humanitarian Health. 
Bausson, who is a member of a committee of policy advisers to the opposition, said it would take $600 million in investments to achieve a stable water supply within two years. 
With the collapse in its exports of crude oil, the main source of government revenue, the state lacks funds for such investments.

(Reuters) - One of the white men charged in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia used a racial slur after shooting the unarmed black man and before police arrived at the scene, an investigator for the prosecution in the case told a court hearing on Thursday.
Special Agent Richard Dial of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation quoted William ""Roddie"" Bryan as saying Travis McMichael uttered the slur after shooting Ahmaud Arbery in February. Bryan and McMichael are both defendants in the case.
""Mr. Bryan said that after the shooting took place before police arrival, while Mr. Arbery was on the ground, that he heard Travis McMichael make the statement: fucking nigger,"" Dial said in testimony to the court.
The case has triggered a national outcry after cellphone video of the Feb. 23 shooting was leaked on social media. Thursday's hearing in front of a Glynn County judge is being held to determine if there is enough evidence to go to trial.
Protests were expected outside the courthouse after more than a week of demonstrations across the United States over the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, also a black American. Four officers have been charged in that case. 
As the first witness for the prosecution, Dial described how the three defendants - Bryan, Travis McMichael and his father Gregory McMichael - chased Arbery in pickup trucks and sought to trap him as he was jogging in their neighborhood.
""He just enjoyed running,"" Dial said of Arbery, adding that friends confirmed he had jogged frequently for exercise.

Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, are charged with murder and aggravated assault. Bryan, a neighbor of the McMichaels' who took the cellphone video, was charged with felony murder and attempt to illegally detain and confine.

PRAIA DA LUZ, Portugal (Reuters) - The disappearance of the little British girl Madeleine McCann has hung over the quiet beach town of Praia da Luz in Portugal's southern Algarve like a dark cloud for 13 years.
Now some closure might finally be near, not only for her family but also for the town itself.
Madeleine, then aged 3, disappeared from her hotel room during a family holiday in Praia da Luz in 2007.
On Thursday, German authorities said she was assumed to be dead and that an imprisoned German child abuser was the murder suspect.
It was the most significant development towards resolving the mystery of what happened to her after years of twists and turns. A long international investigation has grabbed attention worldwide but left many in Praia da Luz feeling like they had become pariahs.
""It was very complicated back then for everyone involved. Everyone spoke badly about Praia da Luz, especially among parents with children,"" said 40-year old Irina Itrabar, who owns a tiny beach store in the town of 3,500 inhabitants.
""It was a tragedy for all of us. But some people have already forgotten what happened."" 
In the days and weeks after Madeleine's disappearance, members of the community rallied around.
Many helped the police in searches for clues in the surrounding area. Hundreds of people prayed in churches or gathered outside, flying balloons in a show of support for Madeleine and her family. 
But the town also suffered a stigma. Business owners said some foreign tourists had been too scared to spend their holidays at Praia da Luz after she disappeared.
Looking at the ocean near a spot where he said friends of the McCanns had looked for Madeleine on the night she disappeared, 68-year old Luis Marques said he hoped the case was finally solved. 
""I was here when the girl disappeared. It was very weird at the time. This changed everything. All the televisions were here. A very complicated environment was created,"" Marques said. 
Some feared that, 13 years later, the new development could cast the town in a bad light again. 
""Back then it killed all the business, just like the coronavirus,"" said 62-year-old German tourist Petra Michel.
""And people are trying to get back on their feet again and this whole thing is starting again.""

Michael White had been released from an Iranian prison in mid-March on medical furlough but was held in Iran under Swiss custody.
""For 683 days my son, Michael, has been held hostage in Iran by the IRGC and I have been living a nightmare,"" his mother Joanne White said in a statement. ""I am blessed to announce that the nightmare is over, and my son is safely on his way home."" IRGC is the acronym for Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.
Both countries have called for the release of prisoners because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the Middle East, while the United States has reported the highest number of deaths and infections worldwide from the virus.
U.S.-Iranian relations have been bitter since the Islamic Revolution toppled the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran in 1979 and ushered in an era of theocratic rule. Tensions flared after President Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.
Worsening tensions, a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Qassem Soleimani, the powerful head of Iran's elite Quds Force.
White's release comes two days after the United States deported Sirous Asgari, an Iranian professor imprisoned in the United States despite being acquitted on charges of stealing trade secrets. Iranian media reported his arrival on Wednesday.
Both the U.S. State Department and Iranian officials have repeatedly denied that Asgari was part of a swap with White, or anyone else and said his case was separate.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Restaurants may still be officially open in Ethiopia, but diners are staying away due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Connecting the two is an Ethiopian food delivery service, Deliver Addis, which has seen demand surge since the start of the health crisis. 
For many restaurant kitchens, take out has become an important avenue to staying afloat since Ethiopia confirmed its first case of coronavirus in March and restrictions on public gatherings came into effect, leading to people staying at home. 
In a leafy suburb of the capital, Henok Girma, 26, who runs a communications company, fancied trying some Mexican food. He used Deliver Addis' mobile app to order.
""When it comes to working from home in a safe environment and being able to order whatever I want, it has really made that aspect of this whole situation a bit easier to deal with,"" he said.
The owner of La Morena, a Mexican restaurant in Addis Ababa is also relieved.
""Our business virtually overnight slowed down to almost 10% of what we used to be,"" said Selamawit Paulos.
But joining Deliver Addis ""really kept our business alive,"" she added. 
Launched in 2015 by United States-raised Feleg Tsegaye, the company is growing, hiring staff and drivers to keep up with the spike in demand.  
""We don't see that subsiding any time soon,"" Tsegaye said. 
Ethiopia has confirmed nearly 1,300 positive cases of COVID-19, with 12 deaths as of June 2.

African consumers have typically been shy of ordering good online but the coronavirus pandemic has created a boost for e-commerce to flourish on the continent as people are forced to stay at home.

The government expects the economy to shrink 12% in the second quarter after a 1.5% drop in the first quarter.
""It is necessary to liberalise the visa policy: if countries cancel visa requirements for Ukrainians who come to them, we will cancel for them too. We need to compete for tourists,"" Zelenskiy said.

Floyd died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, video footage showed, sparking outrage across the United States and beyond. Protests in the country have turned violent. 
The foundation, set up to guard the legacy of Nelson Mandela, South Africa's first democratically-elected president, said that violence is often too readily dismissed as the work of extremists or criminals, when it can be the result of careful calculation by communities who ""see that only such action elicits the desired response from the state"". 
""When communities are confronted by both resilient structural violence and attacks on their bodies, violent responses will occur... The use of violence can be rational and carefully targeted,"" its statement continued. 
Violent struggle helped bring an end to a system of segregation and white minority rule in South Africa. But 26 years after the end of apartheid, the country is still grappling with racial tensions and massive inequality, with the foundation saying democracy had not ""yet ensured black lives matter as much as white lives"". 
It highlighted the case of Collins Khosa, a man who recently died in South Africa after allegedly being beaten by soldiers amid the country's lockdown to stem the spread of the coronavirus. 

""Now is the time for sober assessment of a resilient white supremacy in our country, in the US and globally. We need to reckon with the fact that structural and other forms of violence will provoke violence,"" it said.

Those stripped of their status were Leyla Guven and Musa Farisogullari from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and the Republican People's Party's (CHP) Enis Berberoglu.
The decisions were announced in parliament after appeals courts upheld Berberoglu's conviction for disclosing government secrets and the convictions of Guven and Farisogullari for being members of a terrorist organisation.
""This disregards the national will. We will continue the democratic fight to obtain justice, rights and law,"" CHP leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu wrote on Twitter.
""This is the trampling and theft of the will of the voters and the Kurdish people,"" HDP deputy Saruhan Oluc said in a speech in parliament.
The government has repeatedly accused the HDP of ties to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has fought against the state in the largely Kurdish southeast since 1984 and is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union. The HDP denies such links.
President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party has 291 deputies in the 600-seat assembly, while the CHP now has 138 seats and the HDP has 58 seats, keeping it as the second biggest opposition party.
The AKP is planning to push measures through parliament with its nationalist MHP allies that affect how political groups may contest elections and could hamper new opposition parties taking part in any snap elections. [L8N2DB35Q]

President Vladimir Putin last week ordered Russia's foreign and defence ministries to hold talks with its close ally, Syria, to obtain more facilities and maritime access there, in addition to the two military bases it has already. 
Russia's Embassy in Syria said on Twitter late on Wednesday that the latest batch of planes was for the Syrian military. 
""Syrian Arab Army received the second batch of advanced MiG-29 fighter jets from #Russia - in the framework of military & technical cooperation between our countries. Syrian(s) already begin to carry out missions on those planes,"" it said. 
It shared a link to a May 30 report by the Syrian Arab News Agency, which cited a Syrian military source as saying the fighters were more effective that their previous generation and would be used in Syrian airspace from June 1. 
The United States in late May accused Russia of deploying fighter aircraft via Syria to Libya to support Russian mercenaries fighting for the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
It said aircraft had arrived in Libya after being repainted to conceal their Russian origin in Syria, stating that the aircraft would likely provide close air support and offensive fire.
Reuters sent a request for comment to the Russian defence ministry last week. It did not respond.
Libya's civil war has drawn in regional and global powers with Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt backing the LNA and Turkey supporting the internationally recognised government of national accord.

Over the past weeks it has lifted restrictions for citizens from neighbouring Croatia and Hungary.
The spokesman said Slovenia will decide on whether to lift restrictions for citizens from neighbouring Italy following the Saturday visit of Italian Foreign Minister Luigi di Maio in Ljubljana.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Madeleine McCann, the British girl who disappeared in Portugal in 2007 aged just three, is assumed to be dead and an imprisoned German child abuser is the murder suspect, a German prosecutor said on Thursday
McCann vanished from her bedroom on May 3 during a family vacation in the Algarve while her parents were dining with friends nearby in the resort of Praia da Luz.
Her disappearance sparked an international search, with missing posters of the little girl's face papered across the world and celebrity appeals for information that could help track her down and bring her abductors to justice.
""We assume that the girl is dead,"" Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said. ""The public prosecutor's office in Braunschweig is investigating a 43-year-old German national on suspicion of murder."" 
No body has ever been found. 
But the German statements that the young girl was assumed dead were the most authoritative thus far on her fate. Family and supporters had always held out the hope that she might still be alive somewhere. 
German police said on Wednesday that while the exact sequence of events was still a subject of investigation, the suspect may have had a sexual motive but it is also possible that he had made a spontaneous decision to abduct McCann during a break-in of the apartment where she was sleeping. 
They are treating the case as suspected murder, though British police said the case remains a missing person inquiry.
McCann's parents said they wanted to find peace but that the German suspect was potentially very significant. 
""All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice,"" her parents, Kate and Gerry, said in a statement issued before the German prosecutor spoke. 
""We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.""
DRUGS AND BURGLARY
Prosecutor Wolters said the suspect is a sex offender with multiple convictions, including for sexual abuse of children.
The suspect, who was not publicly named, lived in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and worked in the catering industry, burgled hotels and holiday flats as well as trading drugs, German police said. He is currently in detention over a different matter.
British and German police appealed for information about the man - who lived in Braunschweig, northern Germany, before moving abroad - and released photographs of vehicles - a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) camper van and a Jaguar - which he used at the time.

Police said they wanted to speak to a thus-far unidentified second person who spoke with the German suspect from a Portuguese phone number on May 3, 2007 at the time of McCann's disappearance.

LUCKNOW/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Police in India's most populous state are dealing with a surge in property disputes, as millions of migrant workers flee to their villages after losing their jobs in the cities, sparking feuds over fields and family homes.
The northern state of Uttar Pradesh, home to some 200 million people, has seen millions of migrants return home during an extended nationwide coronavirus lockdown.
Hundreds of thousands walked, cycled and hitchhiked in the early weeks, but the exodus gathered pace in May, as the government began moving millions of people back in buses and trains.
Driven by hunger and the inability to pay rent, the exodus is causing tensions over limited resources in the villages.
Smriti Singh, an administrator in the village of Ratshar Kalan, said she was juggling between quarantining about 1,000 returnees and tackling family feuds.
""Fights over property happen every day. These cases all have similar a narrative,"" said Singh, adding most involved returning families quarrelling with relatives about ancestral homes and property.
Two officials told Reuters that police recorded more than 80,000 property dispute complaints between May 1 and May 20, more than double the 38,000 cases recorded in April. 
In comparison, the officials said the state had recorded a total of 49,000 complaints over ownership of homes, commercial properties and agricultural land, between January and March. 
The officials, who asked not to be identified as they were not authorised to discuss the matter publicly, said they expect such incidents to keep rising as migrants flock home.

Bregman, 32, whose latest book ""Humankind"" argues that people are generally decent rather than evil, became famous last year when he told a wealthy audience at the Davis World Economic Forum that they should pay more tax.
In an interview with Reuters Television, Bregman said he sensed the virus crisis was showing that things are changing and there is ""a shift in the Zeitgeist"" for the younger generation.
""We are now moving into a different kind of era that is more about public service, about cooperation, about basically what's decent,"" he said.
Governments had published lists of essential professions in the crisis and this could have a huge impact on a whole generation, Bregman said.
""If you look at these lists, you're like, where are the hedge fund managers? You know, where are the bankers, or the marketeers?""
He said it was clear who were doing the important jobs now - nurses, teachers, care workers and journalists.
""I think we could see a real shift here, that now there could be a new generation, and I think we already see the early signs of this, of people who want to do a job where you actually help other people,"" he said.
As for other post-pandemic changes, Bregman saw a decline in travel with people appreciating local values more, although global cooperation would be needed on climate change.
And after months of social distancing, would there be an end to the handshake and the hug?
""No, I don't think you can ever kill the handshake or the hug, especially not the hug,"" Bregman said. ""People are hard-wired to connect with one another.""

Some European countries such as Germany, Spain and Austria plan to lift coronavirus-related border restrictions with neighbouring countries this month, something Ireland has been more cautious about as it slowly reopens its economy.
Ireland requires anyone entering the country to self-isolate for 14 days and foresees making its first step back to non-essential travel via so-called ""air bridges"" with other countries who share low levels of coronavirus infection.

Ireland has reported 1,659 deaths related to just over 25,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease the novel coronavirus causes. The number of cases, deaths and admissions to hospital have all been falling in recent weeks.
The government will review the 14-day quarantine for travellers on June 18. Airlines, in particular Ireland's Ryanair, have pushed back strongly against the rules that they say are impossible to implement.

Successive administrations have tried for years to evacuate the building occupied by CasaPound, a group that espouses a neo-fascist ideology and that has gained increasing visibility across Italy during the economic downturn of recent years.
The order to seize the building, issued on the 76th anniversary of Rome's liberation from Nazi occupation by U.S. troops in World War Two, has not yet been carried out but Raggi said it represented a symbolic victory. 
""Today we celebrate the 76th anniversary of the liberation of Rome from nazi-fascist occupation,"" she wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), thanking magistrates for issuing the order.
The seizure order is based on an investigation into the rightist group on charges of illegal occupation of property, the police said in a statement.
A spokesman from CasaPound was not immediately available for comment.
CasaPound, which takes its name from Ezra Pound, the modernist American poet who supported Italy's wartime fascist leader Benito Mussolini, campaigns against migrants and what it sees as promoters of globalisation.
It also looks to build support in poor neighbourhoods through food distribution and other forms of assistance.
More than a dozen families live in the six-floor block, which has been occupied by far right activists since 2003 and whose inside walls are bedecked with anti-capitalist posters and the flag of Mussolini's National Fascist party.
A police statement said procedures for implementing the order were ""ongoing"" and it was not immediately clear when the group members would effectively be forced to leave.
Raggi's 2016 victory was seen as a breaktrough for the 5-Star party, however her rule has been dogged by myriad problems, including with transport and garbage collection, and she has not said if she will seek reelection in 2021.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's usually tightly-packed pubs say they face ruin unless the government eases one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, under which they can only reopen in August and must keep drinkers two metres apart - reducing capacity for some from hundreds to dozens.
For Ronan Lynch, owner of The Swan, a small, Victorian pub typical of many in central Dublin where forcing your way to the bar for a pint is usually a selling point, a relaxing of the guidelines will be the difference between reopening or not.
""We're at the periphery of Europe with a peripheral view of the two-metre rule. No business can operate at 25% capacity. It just doesn't stack up,"" said Lynch, who began a renovation just as Ireland began to shut down its economy in mid-March. 
Bars and restaurants in Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Germany have reopened with looser 1 to 1.5 metre guidelines. Operators in the Czech Republic, Switzerland and Iceland that have had to stick to 2 metres have had the benefit of being open since May to try to salvage some of the busy summer season.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, a medical doctor, has suggested a possible halving of the social distancing measure and a speeding up of one of Europe's most conservative reopening plans if coronavirus cases remain under control, but his top health advisers are more cautious.
Lynch, who is the chairman of Dublin's Licensed Vintners Association (LVA), said permitting one metre between patrons would boost his capacity to 40 to 50%, about 100 drinkers. Research carried out for the LVA found capacity could drop as low as 12.5% for some without any change. 
An easing will still leave pubs and restaurants needing further state support, Lynch said, but will give them a chance of surviving into 2021 when the government hopes a treatment or vaccine can bring an end to social distancing. 
Irish pubs, renowned for their bustling atmosphere, have presented the government with a plan to limit drinking to table service, with no live music and staggered access to toilets in a bid to open earlier alongside restaurants on June 29.
They are waiting to hear back.
The guidance will be crucial for pubs, some of whom were criticised for not enforcing social distancing in the early days of the crisis, forcing their closure on the eve of the lucrative St. Patrick's Day holiday.
Too strict and the one in ten workers dependent on Ireland's pub-focused tourism industry will remain among the 26% currently claiming unemployment benefits. Too lenient and it could spark a second wave of infections, undoing Ireland's careful approach.
With Ireland due to enter the second of five stages next week, Varadkar has said he may revise the later phases as soon as Friday, amid growing political pressure. 
Pubs say they need a decision and soon so they don't waste money on refurbishing to the wrong specifications, can figure out how many staff they can need or whether it's worth reopening at all.

""The government needs to take a leap of faith here, push the button on it and get things open sooner rather than later,"" said Lynch.

Some of the migrants have been held at sea for more than a month after being rescued from unseaworthy boats north of Libya from which they set out to reach Europe. Malta, which chartered the tourism boats, insists it cannot let them land because its ports have been closed since the coronavirus pandemic broke out. 
""The situation of more than 400 persons kept on private ships just outside Malta's territorial waters is unsustainable and requires immediate action,"" Dunja Mijatović, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, said in a statement.
Malta also says most commitments from fellow European Union member states to take in some migrants reaching its shores have not been kept and its holding centres are being overwhelmed. 
Women and children have, however, been allowed to disembark on humanitarian grounds. The condition of the men left on the boats remains unclear, though photographers who managed to approach one boat said those aboard appeared in good health.
Last month, the Malta government chartered a fishing vessel to rescue some migrants at sea and take them back to Libya, drawing strong criticism from rights groups.
""Any challenges notwithstanding, it remains paramount that no action by Council of Europe member states results, either directly or indirectly, in the return of migrants at sea to places where they face serious human rights violations,"" Mijatović said.

ESZTERGOM, Hungary/STUROVO, Slovakia (Reuters) - For Laszlo Petrik, an ethnic Hungarian living on the Slovak side of the River Danube, the treaty after World War One which led to Europe's maps being re-drawn stirs up strong feelings.
Many Hungarians view the Treaty of Trianon - signed on June 4, 1920 - as a national trauma because it took away two-thirds of the country's territory and left millions of ethnic Hungarians living in what are now Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, Austria and Ukraine. 
""This is the greatest injustice ever and one that no one has remedied,"" Petrik said, standing in Sturovo near the bridge that connects the town with Esztergom in Hungary. The bridge, which was blown up in 1944 by German troops, was rebuilt in 2001. 
""Half of my relatives are over there (in Hungary) and even though we have the European Union there is still this division.""
Today, ethnic Hungarians cross the bridge to shop and work in Hungary and Hungarians like to pop over to Slovakia. 
A nationwide survey conducted by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences in May showed 85% of Hungarians believe Trianon was the greatest tragedy in Hungary's history.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, a nationalists who has been in power for a decade, in 2010 declared the June 4 anniversary a ""day of national unity"" as part of his efforts to restore a battered sense of national pride. 
He has won popularity at home by offering ethnic Hungarians citizenship and a right to vote in elections. 
Orban has never suggested re-uniting lost territories with Hungary, and relations with neighbours are mostly amiable.
However, tensions resurface, most recently with Ukraine over a language law that curbed minorities' access to education in their mother tongues.
Parliament on Thursday debated a resolution that calls on parliaments of Central European states to enshrine the right to national identity as a constitutional right.
Speaker Laszlo Kover said the struggle of ethnic Hungarians for this right was a ""European affair as all European nations will face a similar struggle for identity in the coming period.""
Slovak Prime Minister Igor Matovic, addressing ethnic Hungarians on Tuesday, said that even though history had redrawn the borders it was time to look ahead.

""On the 100th anniversary of the Trianon Treaty I offer my hand to act together in order to resolve our common issues,"" he as saying by Korkep.sk, a Hungarian-language news site in Slovakia.

1131,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>",EU to use $2.7 billion fund to buy promising COVID-19 vaccines,"BERLIN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is preparing to use an emergency 2.4-billion- euro ($2.7 billion) fund to make advance purchases of promising vaccines against the new coronavirus, EU officials told Reuters.
The move was discussed at a meeting of EU ambassadors on Wednesday, after Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands said they were speeding up negotiations with pharmaceutical companies to secure access to vaccines currently under development.
The EU rainy-day fund, known as the Emergency Support Instrument (ESI), would also be used to increase vaccine production capacity in Europe and offer liability insurance to pharmaceutical companies, officials said, confirming a Reuters report in May.
The EU's push follows moves from the United States to secure vaccines under development, including almost a third of the first 1 billion doses currently planned for AstraZeneca's (L:AZN) experimental COVID-19 shot.
An EU official said it was necessary to do as the United States was doing, even if this meant losing money as many of the vaccines under development are unlikely to be eventually successful. 
The bloc is ready to take higher financial risks as it fears not otherwise having rapid access to a vaccine against the virus that has killed more than 385,000 people worldwide.
The ESI fund is run by the European Commission, the EU executive arm, which acts on behalf of the 27 EU states.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn and his colleagues from France, Italy and the Netherlands wrote to the Commission saying they had joined up to ""achieve the fastest and best possible outcome in negotiations with key players in the pharmaceutical industry"", German newspaper Handelsblatt wrote on Thursday.
The paper cited government sources as saying Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands were talking to several pharmaceutical firms including AstraZeneca about government research funds and purchase guarantees.
AstraZeneca declined to comment.
At the time of its collaborative agreement with the United States last month, the British group said it was working on a number of deals with other countries and international organisations to ensure a ""broad and equitable"" supply of the vaccine at no profit during the pandemic.
Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands are also talking to Britain, Norway, Singapore and Japan about possible cooperation, Handelsblatt reported.
The EU is also worried that not enough doses might be available to rapidly vaccinate its population of nearly 450 million if a vaccine against the new coronavirus is developed. 
It is working on a vaccination strategy to give priority to the people most in need, like medics, nurses and the elderly.
It remains unclear how the EU initiative will be coordinated with plans by individual member states to secure vaccines from pharmaceutical companies.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Inspired by global protests at the death of unarmed black American George Floyd, some 30,000 people in Belgium have signed two petitions to remove statues of the country's colonial-era King Leopold II, whose troops decimated Congo in the late 1800s.
The online petitions, one of which was started by a 14-year-old boy on photo-sharing app Instagram, demand the removal of the monuments across Brussels and a bust in the city of Halle. 
""We are minors and do not wish to reveal our identities. This is why we are looking for an organisation ... to represent us,"" the 14-year-old told Reuters, giving his name as Noah.
His petition in French and Dutch on change.org calls for the removal by end-June, saying Leopold II has no place in multicultural Brussels, which bills itself as the capital of Europe.
Demonstrations have swept the United States since Floyd's death on May 25 in police custody in Minneapolis. There have been smaller protests across Europe.
In the Belgian city of Ghent, a bust of Leopold II was covered in red paint and daubed with ""I can't breathe"", words spoken by Floyd as he was pinned down by the neck, according to photos posted on Twitter. Another statue was set on fire near the city of Antwerp, Belgian media said.
Many younger Belgians say they are ashamed that Leopold II continues to be honoured when millions of Congolese are estimated to have died between 1885 and 1908 after the monarch declared the African country his personal property.
Leopold's troops were ordered to collect the hands of victims, who were often shot for resisting slave labour. He also imported Congolese for a human zoo in Belgium.

Some Belgians resent criticism. The country's status as a wealthy European country can be traced to its success as a trading economy in the colonial era.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>",Two girls' lockdown learning underlines South Africa's educational divide,"By Tim Cocks
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - When Zinzi Lerefolo was sent home from her fee-paying girls' school in a leafy Johannesburg suburb in March, her family set up a virtual classroom that allowed her to continue studying uninterrupted.
The 13-year-old has access to the internet and her school has the means to provide online teaching during the coronavirus lockdown.
For Phuti Ngoetjana, 14, it has been a different story.
Her state school has no resources to make the leap to cyberspace, and even if it did her family could not afford the data to access lessons in the one-room brick home in the east Johannesburg township of Tembisa where she lives.
The contrast between the black girls' education during the pandemic has played out the world over.
In South Africa, it is especially acute and sensitive.
Although elite schools that were open only to white South Africans under apartheid are now integrated, most black pupils can't afford them, and the country has struggled to bridge huge inequalities 26 years after the fall of white minority rule.
The country remains one of the world's most economically divided, with the top 10% of households owning 71% of the wealth, according to World Bank data from 2018.
As schools prepare to partially re-open from Monday, the educational gap risks widening, and government ministers, teachers' unions and parents are worried.
Those institutions built under apartheid in predominantly black townships and rural areas are the least well equipped to cope with the pandemic, with poor internet access, crowded classrooms and sparse amenities.
""COVID-19 has exposed the divide,"" said Lerefolo's father Simon, now a church pastor who escaped the townships to a top university in 1994 and who was able to pay for an elite education for his daughter.
""And it's got us thinking: what have we done, us who are privileged, to reduce this divide?""
WHEN TO RE-OPEN?
Schools were supposed to have resumed this week, but some teachers and unions argued it was not safe to do so until the government did more to ensure employees were safe from COVID-19.
Government officials have countered that a generation of school children risks losing a key part of their education, and the future opportunities it brings, even though the virus affects them far less than the sick and elderly.
In Western Cape, the opposition Democratic Alliance, which unlike the governing party is not beholden to unions, has defied orders from Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga to delay opening for the last grades of primary and secondary school.
That's despite the province accounting for two thirds of the country's coronavirus cases.
Western Cape education chief Debbie Schafer said that schools there had taken the necessary precautions and she would not wait for another week to start. They re-opened on June 3.
An education department spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on this article.
'TWO-TIER' SYSTEM
South Africa's education system has left millions of children without basic skills.
Literacy tests carried out by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement in 2016 found that 78% of South African pupils could not read for meaning by the age of 9 or 10, compared with 64% in Morocco and 4% in the United States.
Of 100 students who start school, 40-50 will pass their final high school exam, and 14 will go to university, Amnesty International said in a report in February.
""We still have ... two South Africas living side by side,"" said Nic Spaull, an education expert at Stellenbosch University in Western Cape province. ""The two schooling systems have de-racialised, but you still have two systems.""
Under lockdown, these inequalities are being enlarged by disparities in digital access.
International Telecommunication Union data shows just 22% of households have a computer in South Africa, while 60% have internet access. 
Since the end of apartheid, the governing African National Congress has brought electricity and piped water to millions and slashed poverty by a third.
Education has also improved: in the two decades since 1994, the number of black university graduates quadrupled to 48,600, Spaull said.
But for the poorest, the situation remains dire, which he put down in part to a failure to improve the quality of teachers - many of whom were themselves a product of apartheid education. 
'I'M NOT CONNECTED'
Zinzi Lerefolo has used the dining room in her spacious family home to attend classes held via videolink and do homework handed out using social media.
""It wasn't really an issue going online,"" she told Reuters, taking a break in her lounge with a view of the pool outside, before positioning her phone for a virtual art class.
About 35 km (20 miles) away, Ngoetjana sat in her parents' single room - where they rest, eat, wash clothes and dishes - trying to study. Noise from traffic and people talking outside was ceaseless.
""The teachers didn't give us any homework during this lockdown,"" she said, looking up from her maths exercises. ""I haven't learned much because I'm not connected online.""
Most black South Africans depend on cash-strapped free schools like hers.
Under the former apartheid system, they were designed to provide only limited education: their role was to prepare black children for lower-paid jobs and keep them subservient to whites.
But the all-race democracy introduced in 1994 was supposed to change that.
Whether Ngoetjana's school resumes on Monday, when classes are meant to restart for the crucial last years of primary and secondary school, is unclear.
Teachers' unions are adamant they will not go back until all schools are equipped with masks, hand washing facilities and sanitiser.
That is a tall order given that, according to Spaull, more than a quarter of schools don't have running water.
Many rural schools lack bathrooms - they use outdoor pit latrines instead. Dozens of school buildings were also vandalised or burned during the lockdown. 
""The consequences are huge,"" said Zama Mthunzi, of the Equal Education activist group. ""Learners might not end up finishing or going to university ... They're going to be left behind very badly.""
Unlike Lerefolo, the fortunes of Ngoetjana's father, Julius, have not changed much since apartheid ended. He said in some ways his daughter's school reminded him of his: 60 kids jammed in a classroom making learning challenging.

""Things have improved but not enough,"" he said.

1134,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>",Deaths jump in Brazil's indigenous tribes as virus spreads,"By Anthony Boadle and Stephen Eisenhammer
BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Coronavirus is spreading fast through Brazil's indigenous populations, with deaths caused by the disease increasing more than five-fold in the past month, according to data collected by a national association of first peoples. 
Many epidemiologists had hoped remote locations might protect the tribes, but the virus, which first took hold in Brazil's cosmopolitan state capitals of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, is increasingly devastating these far-flung communities where basic healthcare is often precarious.
For many indigenous it harks back to a dark past.
When Europeans first navigated the rivers of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, their smallpox decimated local tribes. Later, rubber tappers, gold miners and settlers brought malaria, measles and influenza. Now, it is COVID-19.
Deaths among Brazil's indigenous populations rose to 182 by June 1, from 28 at the end of April, according to the Articulation of Brazil's Indigenous Peoples (APIB) - a national umbrella association that brings together the country's 305 tribes.
In the village of Sororó in southeastern Pará, tribesman Itamaré Surui said people were falling ill but the government had not provided tests to confirm whether they have COVID-19.
""I am feeling dizzy with fever and stomach pains. Many are ill in the village and we have no help,"" he said. 
The official figures provided by Brazil's government put the number of dead at 59, as they only classify indigenous deaths as those occurring among tribes living on reservations but not those who have migrated to cities. 
Brazil's Health Ministry, which collates the data and provides medical assistance to indigenous tribes, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The numbers may be small compared to the rest of Brazil, which now has the second largest outbreak in the world, but they are significant because they show the virus has taken hold in vulnerable communities where doctors fear the spread will prove devastating. 
Erik Jennings, a doctor working with indigenous populations, said the death toll provided a snapshot of what was happening weeks ago, due to an underreporting of cases and the time it often takes for a patient to pass away. ""Today's reality is much worse,"" he said, adding that a severe lack of testing made it hard to know exactly how bad the situation was. 
On Tuesday, the Pan American Health Organization said it was very concerned about the rate of contagion among indigenous populations in the Amazon. 
Douglas Rodrigues, another doctor, who has worked with indigenous tribes for 30 years, said he feared for the tribes in the rainforest state of Amazonas, where the only public hospitals equipped with ventilators are located in Manaus, the capital, and already are at full capacity. ""In Amazonas, the disease is a death sentence,"" he said. 
Brazil's first indigenous reservation, the Xingu Park where 16 tribes live and Rodrigues is based, blocked access to outsiders and has so far had no cases of COVID-19. ""But the danger is great because contamination is close by,"" he said.
The only intensive care units in the vast state of Amazonas are also located in Manaus, where a wing for indigenous COVID-19 patients was opened last week. 
But even there access for indigenous people is complicated. On Wednesday, indigenous women protested outside the hospital because tribal shamans were not being allowed in and they could not bring herbal medicines to a relative with COVID-19.
In southern Pará, the state neighboring Amazonas, the virus has taken hold in towns around the world's largest iron ore mine.
The Xikrin tribe in the area is suffering. Bep Karoti, a 64-year-old Xikrin chief, died of COVID-19 on Sunday in the village of Cateté, which is an eight-hour drive to the nearest city with intensive care facilities.
Two army trucks with soldiers arrived on Tuesday bringing test kits, face masks and medical personnel after the chief's death, according to residents' posts on social media.
The village of 900 indigenous people has 54 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far, and five deaths, the latest a child who died Wednesday morning.
""It is so sad. The child died with a bad infection in the lungs,"" Cateté community leader Tekore Velho said in a message.

The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. 
The man, a Turkish citizen whose identity was not revealed in the Federal Criminal Court verdict released on Thursday, had fought extradition since his arrest at Zurich airport last November on an international warrant. 
Because the PKK is not outlawed in Switzerland, the court examined whether he would have faced similar Swiss charges for his actions, which allegedly included spreading propaganda and recruiting fighters in 2014.
It found a lack of evidence that he supported a criminal organisation, the equivalent Swiss crime that would have justified sending him to Germany to face trial. 
If he was recruiting fighters, the court said, it was likely that they were to fight Islamic State jihadists in Kurdish areas of Syria or Iraq rather than to attack Turkish targets.
It ordered the man released from custody and awarded him 2,000 Swiss francs ($2,000) in compensation.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 04, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Some Israeli settlers hit out at Trump-backed annexation plan,"By Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's intention to annex parts of the occupied West Bank is being challenged by Jewish settlers who might have been expected to cheer the plan promoted by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu under a U.S. peace blueprint.
A month before the proposed expansion of Israeli jurisdiction is due to be discussed by Netanyahu's new unity government, some settler leaders have resorted to rhetoric likely to embarrass him at the White House.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his top Middle East adviser Jared Kushner ""are not friends of Israel"", David Elhayani, head of the umbrella Yesha settler council, told the liberal Haaretz newspaper.
For settler leaders like Elhayani, the peace plan Trump published in January - which includes Israel keeping most of its settlements in the West Bank - has a dangerous flip side.
Their worry - not echoed by all settlers - is that it could pave the way for the U.S. vision of Palestinian statehood in 70% of the West Bank, areas that would envelop some 15 settlements. 
Palestinians reject the proposal as a blueprint for an unviable state. Even within Israel and Netanyahu's coalition, support for annexation is lukewarm.
Accusing Elhayani of ingratitude, Netanyahu publicly commended Trump's ""unsurpassed friendship"" towards Israel. A U.S. official briefed on Israel ties played down the flare-up.
Elhayani's criticism of Trump marks a rare break between settlers and Evangelical Christians, an important constituency for the president in November's U.S. election. Most world powers deem the settlements illegal.
Influential U.S. pastor John Hagee wrote in the Israel Hayom daily on Sunday that the ""time is now"" to fulfil the ""masterful"" plan's promise of annexed biblical lands.
Elhayani suggested the proposal was designed to gain Trump votes, an idea rejected by a U.S. official.

""We try not to do things because they are popular or not. We do them because they're right,"" said the official.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Three white men charged with the murder of an unarmed black man in Georgia will face a judge Thursday morning in a case that caused a national outcry after cellphone video of the shooting was leaked on social media.
Protests are expected outside the courthouse after more than a week of demonstrations across the United States over the death of George Floyd, a black American who was pinned down to the ground by a white police officer in Minneapolis. 
In the case in Georgia, the three men were not charged until more than two months after Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was shot dead while running on Feb. 23. 
State police stepped in to investigate after the video was widely seen and Glynn County police took no action, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) pressed charges. 
A former police officer is accused of involvement in Arbery's death in the coastal community of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), and state officials have called in the National Guard to assist with the crowds expected outside the courthouse. 
Glynn County Magistrate Judge Wallace Harrell who will review whether or not the GBI had probable cause to bring the charges.
Former police officer Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis McMichael, 34, are charged with murder and aggravated assault. 
William ""Roddie"" Bryan, a neighbor of the McMichaels who took the cellphone video, was charged with felony murder and attempt to illegally detain and confine.
Police say Gregory McMichael saw Arbery running in his neighborhood just outside Brunswick and believed he looked like a burglary suspect. The elder McMichael called his son and the two armed themselves and gave chase in a pickup truck, police said.
Bryan's video footage appears to show the McMichaels confronting Arbery before Arbery was shot with a shotgun.
The U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating the case as a possible federal hate crime. The GBI is investigating the police department and two local district attorneys offices over the handling of the case.

If convicted, the three men face life in prison or the death penalty.

Demonstrators bearing signs like ""Black Lives Matter"" gathered for several hours at a square in the heart of Stockholm during Wednesday afternoon to show support for George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who was killed by police.
Pandemic-hit Sweden has a ban on public gatherings of more than 50 people. While COVID-19 deaths have slowed since the peak in early April, healthcare resources are still strained.
Home Affairs Minister Mikael Damberg said it was a democratic right to protest but that the rules from the Health Agency must be respected. 
""I would urge anyone who wants to protest against racism to use digital media instead. Otherwise, many people risk getting sick and dying,"" he said in a written comment to Reuters.
More than 4,500 people have died in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Sweden, many times more relative to the size of the population than in neighbouring Nordic countries.
Floyd, who was unarmed, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, and event that has set off the biggest anti-racism protests seen in the United States in decades.

The authorities closed the borders to everybody but Spaniards, cross-border workers and truck drivers from mid-March when the country went into lockdown to curb the coronavirus contagion.
Maroto told reporters that Spain would probably lift quarantine for people coming in by land from France and Portugal then, but added that was yet to be approved.
The issue of reopening of borders is a key one in Europe as countries hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic try to kickstart their economies and progressively go back to allowing freedom of movement in what is usually the border-free Schengen area.
Spain had initially said that it would only start lifting restriction to borders as of July 1, before adding over the past days that some could be lifted earlier.
Maroto provided more details of this plan on Thursday, saying they were working on experimenting with tourism to certain regions in the second half of June, and tour operator TUI was due to bring 6,000 German tourists to visit the Balearic archipelago around the island of Mallorca.
France has already said it was in favour of Europe opening its internal borders from June 15. 

Portugal officially closed the border until June 15 but the government had previously said it assumed it would remain closed until the end of the month because of Spain's own restrictions - which now will themselves be lifted earlier.

Lee, they said on Thursday, in the investigation of a 2015 merger and alleged accounting fraud in a suspected bid to aid his succession plans.
The move spells fresh trouble for Lee, who, if arrested, stands to return to jail just a little over two years after being released from detention in February 2018.
Lee already faces trial on a charge of bribery aimed at winning support to succeed ailing group patriarch Lee Kun-hee, and which involved former President Park Geun-hye. He spent a year in detention until the bribery case was suspended in 2018. 
Prosecutors said they sought Lee's arrest on suspicions of stock price manipulation and audit rule violations, among other offences. The Seoul Central District Court will review the prosecution's request on June 8, it said in a statement. 
In a statement, Lee's lawyers expressed ""deep regret"" at the prosecution's decision, adding that he had fully cooperated with the investigation while Samsung was going through management crises. 
Shares of Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) were up 0.4%, outperforming a rise of 0.2% in the benchmark KOSPI (KS11).
Prosecutors have been investigating suspected accounting fraud at drug company Samsung Biologics (KS:207940) after the Korean financial watchdog complained the firm’s value had been inflated by 4.5 trillion won ($3.7 billion) in 2015.
The prosecutors contend the violation helped boost the value of its major owner, Cheil Industries, which counted Lee as its top shareholder, and merged with Samsung C&T, a de facto holding firm, Yonhap news agency said. 
Attorneys for Lee requested an outside review to weigh the validity of the indictment and prosecutors are following the necessary procedures, they said in a statement. 
Last month, the prosecutors questioned Lee, 51, over the latest investigation. He also apologised for the controversies around his succession planning and vowed to guarantee labour rights at Samsung.
In a statement, Samsung said seven of its affiliates, including Samsung Electronics, had set up a labour-management relations group, aiming to improve policy. 

Lee's year in detention followed separate charges that he bribed Park to win government support for the 2015 merger that helped tighten his control of South Korea's top conglomerate.

In a statement, the EU said Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido was the rightful congressional president, not Luis Parra, whom the country's top court approved in late May.
""The latest developments have further deepened the long-lasting institutional and political crisis in Venezuela and reduced the democratic and constitutional space in the country,"" the 27 governments of the EU said. 
""The EU considers that the voting session that led to the 
'election' of Luis Parra was not legitimate ... The EU continues to fully support Juan Guaido as President of the National Assembly,"" the statement said. 
Maduro has been broadly discredited among Western nations after his disputed 2018 re-election and the economic collapse of a country with the world's largest proven oil reserves. Guaido has been recognised by more than 50 states as the country's president.
Like much of the West, the EU, which hosted a donor conference in May to help the five million Venezuelans who have fled Maduro's rule, wants fresh elections in Venezuela. 
It helped set up the so-called International Contact Group to try to unblock the stalemate and avoid any possible military intervention in Venezuela.

The group's members, consisting of about a dozen countries from Europe and Latin America, and international governmental organisations, aim to meet again soon, the EU statement said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - From outbreak to lockdown and reopening, the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged late last year, has been through all stages of dealing with the health crisis. 
Specific characteristics allowed Wuhan to impose some of the tightest restrictions in the world on its 11 million residents until the outbreak was under control. 
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/2Y20DwS in an external browser to see an interactive graphic on Wuhan's blueprint for lifting its lockdown.) 
Much of the city, the capital of Hubei province, is organised in residential compounds of apartment blocks, outdoor spaces, convenience stores and other basic services. The compounds are often walled off from the street and gated. 
People were restricted to their compounds from Jan. 23 when Wuhan went into a lockdown that lasted 76 days.
Extensive surveillance infrastructure and strict housing registration rules already in place helped to facilitate implementation of the restrictions and the easing of them later. 
Now, Wuhan residents live and move under the auspices of coloured QR codes embedded in WeChat and Alipay smartphone apps that use automatically collected travel and medical data. 
A green rating allows for unrestricted movement in and out of residential compounds and public areas, while orange and red signify a quarantine for seven and 14 days respectively. 
Wuhan also carried out an ambitious campaign to test all of its residents, an effort to boost public confidence and kickstart its economy that cost 900 million yuan ($126 million). 
While the city has largely stamped out the virus, officials are unanimous in calling for long-term controls and are investing heavily in testing and population surveillance.
""We need to prepare to make prevention and control work a new normal for a long period,"" said Liu Dongru, deputy director of the Hubei provincial health commission.

Two of the injured were severely hurt in the attack in the southwestern region of Guangxi, the county-level propaganda office said on its social media account. Others sustained light injuries and no one was critically hurt, it said.
The suspect, a 50-year-old man surnamed Li who worked as a guard at the school in the town of Wangfu, attacked at around 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT), according to the Paper, a Shanghai-government backed newspaper.
Li was under control and the matter was being dealt with, the propaganda office said.
A parent who was near the scene of the attack told the Paper that many of the injured children were about six years old.
China has seen several attacks on schoolchildren in recent years, with eight children killed in a similar attack in Hubei province last year. 

Gun ownership is banned in China and knives have come under stricter controls in recent years.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised leader will meet President Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey on Thursday as the allies seek to lock in recent gains on the battlefield near Tripoli ahead of a new round of talks on a potential ceasefire. 
Turkey began providing military support to Fayez al Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) in November after signing a military cooperation pact alongside a maritime demarcation deal, which gives Ankara exploration rights in the Mediterranean that Greece and others reject. 
In recent months, Turkish support in the conflict has pushed back Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) - backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt - which had been attacking the GNA in Tripoli since April 2019. 
The Turkish Presidency said Erdogan and GNA Prime Minister Serraj were due to meet in Ankara at 1100 GMT. 
The meeting comes a day after the GNA - supported by Turkey - recaptured Tripoli's main airport ahead of what appeared to be moves towards talks on a truce, after months of gains to oust the LNA from much of its foothold in the northwest.
The GNA said on Thursday it had regained control of Tripoli.
On Monday, the United Nations said both sides had agreed to resume ceasefire talks, warning that weapons and fighters flying into Libya in defiance of an arms embargo threatened a major new escalation.
A senior Turkish official said the airport seizure was critical ahead of potential peace talks, and that Turkey would reject any proposal to divide Libya between warring factions. 
""Everyone wants to sit at the table without losing territory, but the territory you hold strengthens your positions at the table,"" the official said, adding Erdogan and Serraj would discuss both strategy and the situation on the ground.
Serraj's visit to Ankara comes after a flurry of diplomacy on Wednesday as leaders from both sides travelled abroad for meetings hosted by the foreign powers embroiled in the conflict. Serraj's deputy and foreign minister travelled to Moscow, while Haftar was in Egypt to meet defence officials.
Ankara, which has sent equipment and military personnel to the help the GNA, has slammed Haftar's supporters for backing a ""putschist"" and says Serraj's recent advantage is an opportunity for political talks.
Libya has been without central government authority since 2011, with towns and cities controlled by factions fighting for rival governments in the east and west since 2014. 
Establishing a lasting presence in Libya would give Ankara another foothold in the eastern Mediterranean, where it has been at odds with neighbouring states over offshore hydrocarbon drilling. Greece and Cyprus called last year's maritime deal with Tripoli illegal, an accusation Ankara has denied.
It would also grant it a strategic position near Egypt, with which ties have been strained for years.

""The whole world recognises that Turkey changed the balance"" on the ground, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday. ""We have interests here (and) in the Mediterranean.""

The death of 46-year-old George Floyd has sparked more than a week of nationwide protest and civil strife. While the demonstrations have been largely peaceful, police in some cities have used force against journalists and protesters, and protesters have clashed with police. 
Derek Chauvin, the white officer seen in widely circulated video footage kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd gasped for air, has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter.
Asked during an interview on Sky News whether he condemned police violence in the United States, Raab said: ""Anyone that saw the footage of the treatment of George Floyd would have been moved and distressed as I was, and I think seeing the protests and the violence is very distressing.""
""You mention media freedoms and journalistic freedoms, of course the U.S. has a fine tradition of protecting all of those things and yes we do expect that to continue.""
Raab said Britain would ""of course"" raise difficult issues with the United States when it needed to.

""We want to see America come together,"" he said. ""We will work with our closest ally to see what more we can do, if anything, to support that process.""

Kyaw Win Thant, 31, was arrested in May after angry scenes at a monastery in the central city of Meiktila, where he apologised to monks for deriding them in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts, a senior monk said at the time.
A court in the city of Mandalay sentenced him under sections of the Penal Code that outlaw insulting religion, a spokesman told reporters on Tuesday.
""He feels regretful and admitted his crime so the court gave this decision,"" said court spokesman Kyaw Myo Win, according to video footage published by the Irrawaddy news outlet.
Kyaw Myo Win declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. He told media Kyaw Win Thant did not have a lawyer and he was not available for comment on Thursday.
Kyaw Win Thant's Facebook posts were in response to comments posted by numerous other monks denouncing a government proposal to teach sex education at school, the senior monk said earlier.
The posts have been deleted and could not be verified by Reuters.
A senior official from Mandalay district religious affairs department confirmed the sentence.
""We filed the lawsuit because he violated the law,"" the official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
Sex education is not taught as a separate subject in most Myanmar schools though aspects of growing up are addressed.

The proposal to include it has been a hot topic on social media but remains taboo in the conservative, mainly Buddhist country where monks have long been an influential source of moral guidance.

""I know you know that black lives matter,"" Meghan said in a video she recorded for students graduating from her old high school in Los Angeles which was aired on Wednesday.
The death of Floyd has become the latest flashpoint for long-simmering rage over police brutality against African Americans and led to nationwide protests, some violent, with curfews imposed in some cities to quell the disorder.
""For the past couple of weeks I've been planning on saying a few words to you for your graduation and as we've all seen over the last week what is happening in our country, and in our state and in our home town of LA is absolutely devastating,"" said Meghan, whose mother is African American and father is white.
""First thing I want to say to you is that I'm sorry, I'm so sorry that you have to grow up in a world where this is still present,"" she said in her message to the girls at the Immaculate Heart High School.
The duchess, a former U.S actress and wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, said she wanted to say ""the right thing"" and was nervous her words would be ""picked apart"".
""The only wrong thing to say is to say nothing. Because George Floyd's life mattered, and Breonna Taylor's life mattered, and Philando Castile's life mattered and Tamir Rice's life mattered and so did so many other people whose names we know, and whose names we do not know,"" she said.
Britain's royal family by tradition does not comment on political issues. However, Meghan and Harry stepped down from their official royal roles at the end of March and are now living in Los Angeles with their baby son Archie.
In her message, the 38-year-old reflected on her own memories of the 1992 LA riots.
""Those memories don't go away and I can't imagine that at 17 or 18 years old, which is how old you are now, that you would have to have a different version of that same type of experience,"" she said.

""That's something you should have an understanding of, but an understanding of as a history lesson not as your reality. So I'm sorry that in a way we have not gotten the world to the place you deserve it to be.""

Lawmakers Eddie Chu and Ray Chan rushed to the front of the chamber during a debate over a controversial bill that would criminalise disrespect of China's national anthem, splashing the reeking fluid as guards grappled with them. Police and firefighters later arrived on the scene.
""A murderous state stinks forever. What we did today is to remind the world that we should never forgive the Chinese Communist Party for killing its own people 31 years ago,"" Chu said later, before he and Chan were removed from the chamber. 
A final vote on the bill is expected later on Thursday with people in Hong Kong set to commemorate the bloody 1989 crackdown by lighting candles across the city. 
For the first time, police have banned an annual vigil to mark the event that is usually held in downtown Victoria Park, citing the coronavirus outbreak.
The disruption in the legislature came after pro-establishment lawmakers vetoed most amendments to the anthem bill proposed by democrats. 
If passed, the bill could punish those who insult the anthem with up to three years jail and/or fines of up to HK$50,000 ($6,450). It states that ""all individuals and organisations"" should respect and dignify the national anthem and play it and sing it on ""appropriate occasions"". 
Tensions in the Chinese-ruled city have ramped up after Beijing gave the green light last week to move ahead with national security laws to tackle secession, subversion and foreign interference.
The move was quickly condemned by the United States, Britain, Australia and Canada, as well as international human rights groups and some business lobbies over concerns it will erode freedoms in the global financial hub.
Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city's high degree of autonomy and the new security law would be tightly focused.

Breaking with their usual policy of political neutrality, HSBC and Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) banks gave their backing to the new law on Hong Kong on Wednesday.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said it will ease coronavirus restrictions to allow more foreign carriers to fly to the mainland, shortly after Washington vowed to bar Chinese airlines from flying to the United States due to Beijing's curbs on American airlines.
Qualifying foreign carriers currently barred from operating flights to China will be allowed once-a-week flights into a city of their choosing starting on June 8, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a statement on Thursday.
The CAAC has slashed international flights since late March to allay concerns over rising coronavirus infections brought by arriving passengers.
A so-called ""Five One"" policy allows mainland carriers to fly just one flight a week on one route to any country and foreign airlines to operate just one flight a week to a city in China.
Carriers could also fly no more than the number of flights in a weekly schedule approved by the CAAC on March 12.
But because U.S. passenger airlines had stopped all flights by March 12, they have been unable to resume flights to China.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday said it would bar Chinese passenger carriers from flying into America from June 16, pressuring Beijing to let U.S. airlines to resume flights to the country.
The U.S. Department of Transportation could not be immediately reached for comment. The department has said it will reconsider its order against Chinese airlines if the CAAC adjusts its policies affecting U.S. airlines.
The CAAC said all airlines will be allowed to increase the number of international flights involving China to a maximum of two per week if no passengers on their flights test positive for COVID-19 for three consecutive weeks.
If five passengers or more on one flight test positive for the coronavirus upon arrival, the CAAC would bar the airline from services for a week, it said. Airlines would be suspended for four weeks if 10 passengers or more test positive.
CAAC's deputy director Li Jian said in May the agency would consider increasing international flights, after public criticisms of its ""Five One"" policy, which has led to exorbitant ticket prices for many Chinese stranded overseas.

China has also suspended the entry of foreigners with valid Chinese visas or residence permits since late March, meaning only Chinese nationals can travel back to the country on commercial passenger flights.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India and Australia are set to seal a military logistics pact at an online summit between Prime Ministers Narendra Modi and Scott Morrison on Thursday that will lay the ground for greater military exchanges and exercises, officials said. 
The agreement to provide access to each other's military bases in line with a similar accord that India has struck with the United States is seen as part of a broader strategy to counter China's military and economic weight in the region.
Indian troops are locked in a standoff with Chinese troops on their disputed border, the most serious crisis in years, on top of concerns about a huge trade imbalance in Beijing's favour. 
Australia's trade frictions with China are also growing and its push last month for an international review into the origins and spread of the novel coronavirus drew opposition from China.
Morrison was due in India in January but was forced to cancel the trip because of the bushfires crisis in Australia, The holding of the summit now, in the middle of the pandemic, showed the importance the two leaders attached to bilateral ties, officials said.
""This is the first time that Prime Minister Modi will be holding a ""Bilateral Virtual Summit”, this signifies the strengthening of ties with Australia and its upward trajectory,"" Indian foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said.
The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement under which military ships and aircraft can refuel and access maintenance facilities at each other's bases is ready for signing, another official said. 
India is also considering Australia's participation in annual naval exercises it holds with the United States and Japan in the Indian and Pacific Ocean in a cementing of security ties between the four countries, military officials said.

A similar exercise in 2007 had angered China.

In May, in the Group of Seven nations as a whole, 48% of respondents approved of how authorities had handled the pandemic, down from 50% in April and 54% in March, the survey published by polling firm Kantar showed.
Britain saw the biggest drop - a sharp fall of 18 points from April to 51% - while in the United States, Canada, Germany, France and Italy, the declines ranged between two and six points. Japan was the only country to show an increase. 
Britain's COVID-19 death toll has surpassed 50,000, according to a Reuters tally, making the country one of the worst hit in the world by the pandemic.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also struggled to contain the fallout from a decision by his top advisor Dominic Cummings to undertake a long road trip to get family help at the height of the coronavirus lockdown when COVID-19 hit his household.
Kantar said 50% of respondents across the G7 said they trusted their government to make the right decisions about the pandemic in the future, down four points from April. 
Just over half said they would use a contact-tracing app to help to prevent a new wave of infections. Almost two-thirds of those who said they would not use it cited privacy concerns.
One in three people felt uncomfortable about returning to their workplace, a similar number said they would work at home more than before the crisis and about four in 10 said they would visit restaurants, cafes, pubs and cinemas less than before.

The survey of 7,012 people was conducted between May 28 and June 1.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people in the Philippines may have been killed in the war on drugs since mid-2016, amid ""near impunity"" for police and incitement to violence by top officials, the United Nations said on Thursday.
The drugs crackdown, launched by President Rodrigo Duterte after winning election on a platform of crushing crime, has been marked by police orders and high-level rhetoric that may have been interpreted as ""permission to kill,"" it said.
Police, who do not need search or arrest warrants to conduct house raids, systematically force suspects to make self-incriminating statements or risk facing lethal force, the U.N. human rights office said in a report.
There has been only one conviction, for the 2017 murder of Kian delos Santos, a 17-year-old Manila student, it said. Three police officers were convicted after CCTV footage led to public outrage, it said.
""Despite credible allegations of widespread and systematic extrajudicial killings in the context of the campaign against illegal drugs, there has been near impunity for such violations,"" the report said. 
Police say their actions in the anti-drug campaign have been lawful and that deaths occur in shootouts with dealers resisting arrest. 
The report said that some statements from the highest levels of government had ""risen to the level of incitement to violence"" and ""vilification of dissent is being increasingly institutionalized.""
""The human rights situation in the Philippines is marked by an overarching focus on public order and national security, including countering terrorism and illegal drugs,"" it said.
But this was ""often at the expense of human rights, due process rights, the rule of law and accountability.""
""The Government has also increasingly filed criminal charges, including by using COVID-19 special powers laws, against social media users posting content critical of Government policies and actions,"" the report added. 
It will be presented to the U.N. Human Rights Council later in June.
Lawyers and activists raised the alarm this week over a new anti-terrorism bill pushed by Duterte, warning of draconian and arbitrary provisions that could be abused to target his detractors.
DRUG-RELATED KILLINGS
Most victims in the drug war are young poor urban males, the U.N. report said. Their relatives described ""numerous obstacles in documenting cases and pursuing justice.""
""The most conservative figure, based on Government data, suggests that since July 2016, 8,663 people have been killed – with other estimates of up to triple that number,"" it said.
The U.N. cited reports of widespread drug-related killings perpetrated by unidentified “vigilantes” and a Philippine government report in 2017 that referred to 16,355 “homicide cases under investigations” as accomplishments in the drugs war.
A 2016 police circular launching the campaign uses the terms “negation” and “neutralization” of “drug personalities,” it said, calling for its repeal. 
""Such ill-defined and ominous language, coupled with repeated verbal encouragement by the highest level of State officials to use lethal force, may have emboldened police to treat the circular as permission to kill,"" it said.
Government figures show that 223,780 “drug personalities” were arrested from mid-July 2016 through 2019, but unclear charges and irregularities in due process raise concerns that ""many of these cases may amount to arbitrary detentions.""
At least 248 land and environmental rights activists, lawyers, journalists and trade unionists were killed from 2015 to 2019, the report said. So-called red-tagging, or labelling people and groups as communists or terrorists, had become rife.

An Australian and New Zealand business lobby group said it intended to take a proposal to governments this week to kick off a travel bubble between the pair's capital cities with a test flight as soon as July 1.
Foreign Minister Winston Peters said no plans had been agreed as the two countries continue to work on a blueprint to resume travel, adding that date ""was too early.""
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said earlier this month that September was a more realistic date for the resumption of flights.
""It will be over to the Australians more than us because they have got the federal system and they are still not flying interstate,"" Peters told reporters. He added it was unlikely the first flights would be the Wellington-Canberra route, given there were more populated cities in each country.
""I have nothing against Canberra but I am for mass population movement by way of demand rather than capital cities,"" he said. 
Falling numbers of active and new coronavirus cases in both countries have paved the way for the proposed easing of travel restrictions. New Zealand reported no new COVID-19 cases for a 13th consecutive day on Thursday and has just one active case. Australia has reported daily single digit and low double digit numbers of new cases in recent weeks and has 490 active cases, with just 25 people in hospital.

(Reuters) - Three Las Vegas men alleged to be part of the extremist Boogaloo movement have been arrested and charged with planning to cause violence and destruction during protests in the city over the police killing of George Floyd.
The men, who police said had a homemade bomb or Molotov cocktail in their possession when they were taken into custody on Saturday, all live in the Las Vegas area, the region's joint terrorism task force said on Wednesday.
“Violent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr. Floyd’s death for their own radical agendas,” said Nicholas Trutanich, the U.S. attorney for Nevada. 
Boogaloo is ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society,"" the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Terrorism Task Force said in its news release Wednesday.
The men - Stephen T. Parshall, known as “Kiwi,” 35; Andrew Lynam, 23; and William L. Loomis, 40; all of Las Vegas - face federal charges of conspiring to cause damage with explosives, possession of unregistered firearms and state terrorism-related charges.
The arrests come as law enforcement agencies struggle to keep the peace in the aftermath of Floyd's death on May 25, as protesters took to the streets across the U.S. While leaders in numerous cities have said that peaceful protests turned ugly because outsiders encouraged looting and burning arrest records in some cities show that most of those arrested live locally. 
A senior Justice Department official said Wednesday that members of the loosely organized left-wing anti-fascist groups known as Antifa have been involved in violent incidents in at least two states.
Some of the violence is driven by opportunistic looters who started out as peaceful protesters, and some is driven by hardened criminals who are taking advantage of the situation, said the official, who spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity.

In an article carried by one of North Korea's main state-run newspapers, an unnamed spokesman for the international affairs department of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) criticised recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Pompeo said recent actions by the Chinese Communist Party suggest it is ""intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values"" and ""puts Americans at risk.""
Pompeo's remarks on Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights and trade disputes were ""nonsense"" that slandered the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the WPK spokesman said.
""Pompeo, who has been deeply engrossed in espionage and plot-breeding against other countries, has become too ignorant to discern where the sun rises and where it sets,"" the spokesman said.
Such statements by American leaders are a sign of their concerns about a declining United States, he said, citing the ongoing protests against police brutality.
""Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House,"" the spokesman said. ""This is the reality in the U.S. today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.""

WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration expanded on Wednesday its list of Cuban entities that Americans are banned from doing business with to include the financial corporation that handles U.S. remittances to the Communist-run country.
Military-owned Fincimex is the main Cuban partner of foreign credit card companies and money transfer firm  Western Union  (NYSE:WU), which Cubans in the United States have used for two decades to send money back to their loved ones on the Caribbean island.
Those remittances are all the more needed now as the coronavirus pandemic is worsening Cuba's already grim economic outlook, grinding the key tourism industry to a halt.
A U.S. State Department spokesman said the move was designed to stop the flow of remittances through military-controlled financial institutions and the flow of hard currency to the government.
The Trump administration was challenging Cuba to identify another company not affiliated to its military that U.S. financial companies could work with, or to create one, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council.
""If Cuba refuses, the Trump administration is prepared to cease remittances,"" he said.
He noted a senior official had quipped to him that the sanction was ""a birthday present to Raul Castro,"" the leader of the Cuban Communist Party, who turned 89 on Tuesday.
New regulations implementing the sanction will be closely watched. There is the possibility existing U.S. business with Fincimex could be grandfathered in. 
A Western Union spokeswoman said the company was looking into the measure but could not immediately comment.
""The U.S. government continues to act as a rogue state,"" the general director for U.S. affairs of Cuba's Foreign Ministry, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said on Twitter. 
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it is tightening the decades-old trade embargo on Cuba, unraveling the 2014-16 detente of his predecessor Barack Obama, to pressure the government to carry out democratic reform.
In private, officials say they see this tough approach to Cuba as a means of currying favor with the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, a state considered vital to Trump's re-election chances in November.
But this action could backfire, say analysts, as it will so openly hurt the relatives of Cuban-Americans, ordinary Cubans, more than the Communist government.
""It is lamentable and counterproductive for U.S. sanctions to also include remittances,"" said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Colombia's Universidad Javeriana Cali.

Cubans could in normal times at least rely on money brought into the country in person but the government suspended air travel in March in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Kim Yo Jong, who serves unofficially as Kim Jong Un's chief of staff, issued the warning in a statement carried by state news agency KCNA on Thursday.
She was referring to thousands of ""anti-DPRK leaflets"" recently dumped along the North's side of the heavily fortified DMZ titled ""Defectors from the North"".
DPRK, or the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, is the North’s official name.
""If such an act of evil intention committed before our eyes is left to take its own course under the pretext of 'freedom of individuals' and 'freedom of expression', the south Korean authorities must face the worst phase shortly,"" the KCNA statement said.
Kim Yo Jong warned of the possible scrapping of the inter-Korean military agreement that promised to eliminate practical threats of war as a result of the clandestine leafletting.
The military pact reached in 2018 was ""hardly of any value"", she said.
She also warned the North will completely withdraw from the Kaesong industrial project and shut down the joint liaison office in the North’s border city, unless Seoul stopped such actions.
The KCNA report did not single out any individuals for blame in the leafletting. But Kim Yo Jong's comments come after a former North Korean diplomat and another North Korean defector won parliamentary seats in South Korea's general election in April.

Kim Yo Jong has been the most visible presence around her brother in the past two years. She serves formally as a vice director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s powerful Central Committee.

Asked about his relationship with Xi, Trump said: ""Haven't spoken to him in a while. It was very good.""
He praised a trade agreement the two countries signed in January, but criticized Beijing for the novel coronavirus pandemic, which began in China. 
""China should have never let it happen,"" Trump said.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Migrants from Africa and the Caribbean, stranded in Honduras after Central American countries closed their borders to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, on Wednesday kept marching north in an attempt to reach the United States.

On Tuesday, the group of departed the department of Choluteca, near the border with Nicaragua. 
""We're already on the way, we want to reach the border with Guatemala and then, at least for now, get to Mexico until the situation in the United States improves,"" Cuban migrant Armando Hernandez, said in a telephone interview.
""I do not agree to return. I left my country because they were threatening me and my family,"" Hernandez said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to designate at least four additional state-run Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies, increasing restrictions on their operations on American soil, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
The action by the State Department, sure to further inflame U.S.-China tensions, could come as soon as Thursday, the sources told Reuters. It follows President Donald Trump's announcement on Friday of retaliatory measures against Beijing over its tightened grip on Hong Kong.
The designations are expected to include China Central Television (CCTV), the top state-owned network, and China News Service, the country's second-largest state-owned news agency, two sources said on condition of anonymity.
They would be added to five Chinese outlets placed under restrictions in February over U.S. allegations they were used by China and its Communist rulers to spread propaganda.
Like the others, they will be required to register their employees and U.S. properties with the State Department, similar to rules covering embassies and other diplomatic missions.
Though three sources said the announcement was on track for as early as Thursday, a fourth did not rule out a delay.
The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment. There also was no response from the Chinese embassy in Washington.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have spiked, as Trump and his aides have complained about China's early handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong, which has enjoyed special U.S. treatment as a global financial center.
Chinese state media has been reveling over chaotic race-related protests in the United States and highlighting Trump's threat to use troops, even as the anniversary looms of its own bloody military crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) 31 years ago.
HONG KONG TENSIONS
Trump on Friday ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong on the grounds it no longer had enough autonomy, but stopped short of calling an immediate end to former British colony's privileges. 
China's state-run Global Times newspaper called Trump's announcement ""recklessly arbitrary."" 
The United States and China have clashed in recent months over journalists working in each other's countries.
Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said: “These are Chinese Communist Party propaganda outlets that peddle dangerous information to grow the Party’s power -- not report the news.""
In February, the Trump administration said it would treat five major media entities with U.S. operations the same as embassies: Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corp. and Hai Tian Development USA, Inc.
In March, Washington said it was slashing the number of journalists allowed to work at U.S. offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160 due to Beijing's ""long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.""

In response, China said it was revoking accreditations of American correspondents with the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.

On Monday Congolese authorities confirmed tests showing that four people had died of Ebola in the western city of Mbandaka.
Congo had been preparing to declare itself Ebola-free this month. An epidemic of the virus on the other side of the country has killed more than 2,200 people since 2018.
The two outbreaks are the same strain of the virus, which means the same vaccines can be used to help contain its spread, health officials say, although they are not thought to be linked. 
""The latest person confirmed with Ebola attended the burial of one of the first cases, but was detected in the town of Bikoro, 150 kilometres away from Mbandaka,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told journalists.
""This means that two health zones are now affected.""
Mbandaka suffered a small Ebola outbreak in 2018 in which 33 people died. The use of a vaccine and swift containment efforts including mobile handwashing stations and a door-to-door education campaign kept it at bay.
On Wednesday almost 50 health workers from WHO and its partners arrived in Mbandaka with 3,600 doses of Ebola vaccine and 2,000 cartridges for lab testing, Tedros said.
The Ebola virus causes hemorrhagic fever and is spread through direct contact with body fluids from an infected person, who suffers severe vomiting and diarrhoea. Ebola is endemic to Congo whose Ebola river gave the virus its name when it was discovered there in 1976.

Congo's health system, which has been hobbled by decades of war and mismanagement, is fighting the world's worst measles epidemic as well as the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected over 3,000 and killed 75 people.

Bearing signs and placards with messages such as ""I can't breathe"" and ""Black Lives Matter"", demonstrators gathered for several hours at a square in the heart of the city during the afternoon, television footage showed.
While the country has eschewed a lockdown and relied on Swedes' sense of social responsibility with mostly voluntary measures to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, it has banned gatherings of more than 50 people. 
More than 4,500 people have died in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in Sweden, many times more relative to the size of the population than in neighbouring Nordic countries.
A spokesman for the police, which did not move in to break up the gathering, declined to estimate the size of the crowd.
""It was a lot more than 50 anyway,"" he said, adding people had eventually begun to disperse after organisers called on them to do so for health reasons. ""There several groups moving around the town that we are keeping an eye on now,"" he added. 
Floyd, who was unarmed, died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, and event that has set off the biggest anti-racism protests seen in the United States in decades.

His death has also sparked protests elsewhere in Europe with tens of thousands taking to the streets in London on Wednesday.

The taxes, managed by Israel under 1990s accords, make up over half of the budget of the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinians snubbed the handovers for several months last year after Israel trimmed the cash in retaliation for their funding for the families of jailed or slain militants.
With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu having last month secured a new government, and annexing the West Bank's Jewish settlements and Jordan Valley on the agenda, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has declared bilateral deals null.
Ibrahim Melhem, spokesman for the Palestinian government, said in a statement that it had rejected the May tax levies ""in compliance with the leadership decision to stop all forms of coordination with Israel"".
Israel's Finance Ministry declined comment. 
It was not immediately clear how the PA, its economy already hit hard by the coronavirus crisis, could function should it continue doing without the around $190 million in monthly taxes.
Abbas previously said his security forces would stop helping Israel stem violence in the West Bank, among territories where the Palestinians, with international support, seek statehood.
Abbas' peace talks with Israel stalled in 2014 and he is boycotting the Trump administration for perceived bias. Israel and the United States appear to prefer to see the PA stay afloat rather than West Bank Palestinians revert to full Israeli rule.

The CODECO militia, mostly drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, assaulted the village of Moussa, which is home mainly to ethnic Hema, in Ituri province in the early hours of Wednesday, said Henry Juga Trilo, an administrative official.
He said they killed four men, six women and six girls and stole several goats. An army spokesman and a U.N. source confirmed the attack on the village, 60 km (40 miles) northeast of the city of Bunia and near the border with Uganda.
Last week the United Nations warned that killings, beheadings, rape and other barbaric acts committed by CODECO may constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes.
Since June 2018, hundreds of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in Ituri province, bringing the number of displaced people to more than 1.2 million.
Rich in natural resources, Ituri experienced some of the country's most vicious fighting between 1999 and 2007, after a power struggle between rebel groups descended into ethnic bloodshed, mostly between the Hema and Lendu communities.
After a decade of relative calm, tit-for-tat fighting resumed in December 2017, reviving longstanding tensions over land. The unrest has since evolved into more coordinated attacks by the CODECO militia on the army and the Hema group.
Fighting by an array of armed groups in the region has complicated Congo's response to outbreaks of Ebola and the coronavirus.

(Reuters) - The former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd is being represented by a new lawyer in the racially charged case that has sparked protests across the United States over police brutality, according to people involved in the case.
The ex-officer, Derek Chauvin, is now being defended by Eric Nelson of the Halberg Criminal Defense firm, according to Marsh Halberg, the firm's chief executive.
Chauvin's legal representation is being provided by the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association (MPPOA) which draws from a panel of about a dozen attorneys, which includes both Nelson and the lawyer he replaced, Tom Kelly of Kelly & Jacobson.
Kelly told Reuters he gave up the case for medical-related reasons. The case was assigned to him by the association, which provides legal services to Minnesota's police, because he was the on-call attorney at the time of Chauvin's arrest, Kelly said.
Chauvin, who is white, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.
Floyd, 46, died on May 25 after Chauvin pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes during his arrest. A video of the incident sparked a week of sometimes violent protests that have rocked dozens of U.S. cities in the worst civil unrest in decades.
Chauvin is scheduled to make his first court appearance on Monday.
Nelson has represented many police officers, often in officer-involved shootings, but none of whom have been charged or gone to trial, according to a person familiar with the matter.
He also represented Amy Senser, the wife of former Minnesota Vikings professional football player Joe Senser, who was convicted for the 2011 hit-and-run death of a Minneapolis chef. She was sentenced to 41 months in prison.
The Halberg firm has 10 lawyers and is the Minnesota's largest firm that does exclusively criminal defense work. Nelson is the managing partner.
The MPPOA provides criminal defense services for its members, which includes Chauvin.
The association's executive director, Brian Peters, said the change in attorneys was Kelly's decision. When Kelly left the case, Nelson was next on the panel of attorneys, according to Peters.

Kelly represented Jeronimo Yanez, a police officer in St. Anthony, Minnesota who was acquitted of the 2016 killing Philando Castile during a traffic stop that was recorded by Castile's girlfriend.

McCann, who is British, disappeared from her bedroom on May 3 during a family holiday in Portugal while her parents were dining with friends nearby in the resort of Praia da Luz.
Her fate remains a mystery despite a massive international search and media coverage which prompted reported sightings from across the globe.
British police described Wednesday's appeal - the latest of several issued since her disappearance - as a ""significant development"".
They want to speak to anyone who has relevant information on the man, whom they did not name, or the movements of two vehicles linked to him during the period around the disappearance. Both cars, a Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) camper van and a Jaguar, are now in the possession of German police.
They also asked for anyone who was familiar with two Portuguese phone numbers to come forward. One of the phones was known to be used by the suspect, and received a 30 minute phone call from the second number whilst in the Praia da Luz area on the night of the disappearance shortly before McCann was last seen.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani aviation authorities have told Pakistan International Airlines that the pilot of a passenger plane that crashed into a residential district of Karachi last month had ignored air traffic control's instructions for landing, a PIA spokesman said on Wednesday.
The PIA Airbus A320 crashed on May 22 while trying to land after the pilots reported the loss of both engines. Ninety seven people on board were killed and two survived. At least one person was reported to have died on the ground.
Initial reports suggested the plane scraped its engines along the runway on a first attempt to land following what appeared to be an unstable approach, arriving steep and fast.
In a letter sent to PIA, the Civil Aviation Authority said an approach controller twice told the pilot to discontinue its approach as he came into land but he did not comply.
As it neared landing, the plane's ground speed was above the runway threshold, the letter quoted the controller as saying.
It lifted up from the runway surface and crashed over Model Colony while attempting a second approach, the letter said.
""Yes, we have received the letter, they are documenting it,"" Abdullah Hafeez Khan, PIA's general manager for corporate communications told Reuters.
He declined to comment on the assertions made in the letter. 
The flight had been observed as being high for approach at as it passed Makli, about 100 km east of Karachi, but the pilot said he was comfortable for the descent, the letter said. He was also cautioned a second time.
The plane's cockpit voice recorder and flight data box are being decoded in France by French air accident agency BEA. 
Pakistan's Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan has said that an initial report on the crash will be presented to parliament on June 22. 

Aviation safety experts say air crashes typically have multiple causes and it is too early to determine the reasons behind the air disaster, which is Pakistan's worst since 2012.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration on Wednesday barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying to the United States starting on June 16 as it pressures Beijing to let U.S. air carriers resume flights amid simmering tensions between the world's two largest economies.
The move, announced by the U.S. Department of Transportation, penalizes China for failing to comply with an existing agreement on flights between the two countries. U.S.-Chinese relations have soured in recent months amid tensions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing's move to impose new national security legislation for Hong Kong.
The order applies to Air China (SS:601111), China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:CEA) Corp, China Southern Airlines Co (SS:600029) and Hainan Airlines Holding Co (SS:600221), as well as smaller Sichuan Airlines Co and Xiamen Airlines Co. Chinese carriers are currently flying four round-trip flights to the United States weekly.
Delta Air Lines (N:DAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL) have asked to resume flights to China this month, even as Chinese carriers have continued U.S. flights during the pandemic. 
Delta said in a statement on Wednesday that ""we support and appreciate the U.S. government's actions to enforce our rights and ensure fairness."" United said it looks forward to resuming passenger service between the United States and China ""when the regulatory environment allows us to do so."" 
China ""remains unable"" to say when it will revise its rules ""to allow U.S. carriers to reinstate scheduled passenger flights,"" a formal order signed by the Transportation Department's top aviation official Joel Szabat said.
""We will allow Chinese carriers to operate the same number of scheduled passenger flights as the Chinese government allows ours,"" the department said in a separate statement.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Trump administration on May 22 accused China's government of making it impossible for U.S. airlines to resume service to China and ordered four Chinese carriers to file flight schedules with the U.S. government. 
CHARTER FLIGHTS
The Chinese carriers are flying no more than one scheduled round-trip flight a week to the United States but also have flown a significant number of additional charter flights, often to help Chinese students return home.
Hainan had planned to fly between New York's JFK airport and Chongqing starting in July, while other carriers have flights to Los Angeles and New York. China Eastern wants to resume additional flights later this year to Chicago and San Francisco. 
The Trump administration is also cracking down on Chinese passenger airline charter flights and will warn carriers not to expect approvals. The Transportation Department order said the administration believes Chinese carriers are using charter flights to circumvent China's limit of one flight per carrier per week to the United States and ""further increasing their advantage over U.S. carriers in providing U.S.-China passenger services.""
On Jan. 31, the U.S. government barred from entry most non-U.S. citizens who had been in China within the previous 14 days due to the coronavirus crisis but did not impose any restrictions on Chinese flights. Major U.S. carriers voluntarily decided to halt all passenger flights to China in February.
Delta and United are flying cargo flights to China. Delta wants approval for two daily flights to China. United wants to fly daily to Shanghai Pudong from San Francisco and Newark, New Jersey, and between San Francisco and Beijing.
China's air authority in late March said Chinese airlines could maintain just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any given country and that carriers could fly no more than the number of flights they were flying on March 12, according to the U.S. order.

But because U.S. passenger airlines had stopped all flights by March 12, China ""effectively precludes U.S. carriers from reinstating scheduled passenger flights to China,"" the Transportation Department said.

""Many of the things that we talk about are about Putin,"" Trump told Fox News Radio in an interview, adding: ""Have him in the room ... get things done.""
Trump over the weekend had raised the prospect of expanding the G7, whose members are the world's most advanced economies, to once again include Russia, which had been expelled in 2014 following Moscow's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region.
The two leaders also spoke by phone on Monday, and discussed the possibility of holding an expanded G7 summit later this year. The Kremlin has said that it would seek more information about Trump's invitation.
Trump has also invited Australia, South Korea and India.
Other G7 nations, including Canada, have objected to Russia's return while some, such as Japan, have not yet weighed in. Germany on Wednesday said now was not the time to change the meeting's format.
 
Trump has postponed the gathering of the G7, which also includes Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the European Union, until September or later amid the coronavirus pandemic.

A fuel tank at a power station in the remote, industrial region lost pressure on May 29 and leaked 20,000 tonnes of fuel and lubricants, the Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency, said. Much of flowed into the river Ambarnaya. 
At a televised government meeting to discuss the spill, Putin said he was shocked to find out local authorities had only learned of the incident from social media two days after it happened and scolded the region's governor Alexander Uss on air. 
""What - are we to learn about emergency situations from social networks? Are you alright healthwise over there?"" Putin said, waving his hand across his eyes. 
The state environment watchdog said 15,000 tonnes of oil products had seeped into the river system with another 6,000 into the subsoil. The state fisheries agency says the river will need decades to recover.
An expanse of crimson water could be seen stretching from shore to shore down a river and one of its offshoots in aerial footage published by the RIA news agency this week.
Putin said he supported a proposal to declare a national state of emergency in the area as it would help the clean-up.
Norilsk, a remote city of 180,000 situated 300 km (190 miles) inside the Arctic Circle, is built around Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer.

The company says it is doing all it can to clear up the spill and it has brought in specialists from Moscow who have sectioned off the affected part of the river to stop the oil products spreading further.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - In the bustling kitchen of one of Bogota's trendiest restaurants, a team of chefs that usually caters to the Colombian capital's well-heeled citizens is preparing meals for a community of people cut off from work and housing during the Andean country's coronavirus quarantine.
A nationwide lockdown declared by the government of President Ivan Duque to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus has cratered Colombia's economy and particularly hurt its poor and vulnerable, who must make do without their usual informal jobs.
Now, two restaurants - El Chato, run by chef Alvaro Clavijo and winner of Colombia's best restaurant award in 2019 from Latin America's 50 Best Restaurants, and Chicheria Demente, have teamed up to bring nutritious meals to people renting beds by the day in central Bogota. 
""A lot of the food we take to the lodging isn't what they're used to,"" Clavijo said. ""We've been taking them on a discovery.""
Some 48 people live in the austere building, paying about $2.70 per day for a room, or $1.35 for a bunk bed. Many are informal workers who have seen their incomes plummet under quarantine.
Chefs from the two restaurants take turns preparing meals before delivering them and also donate other food. The initiative has received donations worth close to $6,000. 
""We take them different things, a daily meal, eggs so they have something else during the day, sometimes rice, sometimes water,"" said Natalia Carreno, one of the partners at Chicheria Demente. 
Colombia entered the nationwide quarantine in late March. While restrictions have begun gradually lifting in some places, Bogota's high infection rate has meant the city continues to observe stricter protocols.
The meals are a lifeline for residents, who did not leave the building for the first 40 days of quarantine.
""I'm very grateful to them,"" said Miryam Tellez, who helps run the house. ""They have always come, they have never left us alone.""

After weeks of fighting around Tripoli supported by competing foreign powers, the United Nations said on Monday that both sides had agreed to resume ceasefire talks. 
However, the U.N. has warned that a flood of weapons and fighters into Libya in defiance of an arms embargo could fuel more fighting. 
The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar has since April 2019 been attacking Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). 
The LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. However, Turkish support for the GNA has shifted the balance of power in recent weeks, helping it push the LNA from most of the capital and onto the back foot.. 
All those countries have publicly welcomed the decision to resume U.N.-sponsored ceasefire talks.
GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj is expected in Ankara late on Wednesday, Turkish broadcasters reported. 
His deputy Ahmed Maiteeg and GNA Foreign Minister Mohamed Siyala had earlier arrived in Moscow, local media said.
""That the legitimate government has the upper hand now should be viewed as an opportunity for a political solution,"" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a TV interview.
Meanwhile Haftar travelled to Egypt to meet defence officials, a source close to him said.
Last week the United States said Russia had flown at least 14 warplanes to an LNA airbase in central Libya. Russia and the LNA have denied that, with the LNA saying it has refurbished some old Libyan air force jets. 
The air battle has been critical, with Turkish drones knocking out LNA air defence systems and supply routes. 
On Wednesday, an LNA military source said warplanes had struck near Gharyan, a town taken by the GNA last year. 
It would represent the first acknowledged use of warplanes by eastern forces since Washington said Russia had supplied the MiG 29 and Su-24 jets.

LONDON (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people chanting ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"" and ""black lives matter"" gathered in central London on Wednesday to protest against racism after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
Floyd died after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while he lay handcuffed on the ground in Minneapolis on May 25.
His death drew outrage across a nation that is politically and racially divided five months before a presidential election, reigniting protests that have flared repeatedly in recent years over police killings of black Americans. 
Since then anti-racism rallies have been held in cities around the world, from Paris to Nairobi. 
In London's Hyde Park, many of the protesters wore face masks and were dressed in red. They chanted ""George Floyd"" and ""Black lives matter"".
""This has been years in the coming, years and years and years of white supremacy,"" 30-year-old project manager Karen Koromah told Reuters. 
""We’ve come here with our friends to sound the alarm, to make noise, to dismantle supremacist systems,"" Koromah said, cautioning that unless there was action the United Kingdom would face similar problems to those in the United States.
""I don’t want to start crying,"" she said of the images from the United States. ""It makes my blood boil.""
Some protesters waved banners with slogans such as: ""The UK is not innocent: less racist is still racist"", ""Racism is a global issue"" and “If you aren’t angry you aren’t paying attention"".
'BLACK LIVES MATTER' 
Prime Minister Johnson said on Wednesday that black lives mattered and that he supported the right to protest in a lawful and socially-distanced way.
""Of course, black lives matter and I totally understand the anger, the grief that is felt not just in America but around the world and in our country as well,"" he told parliament.
British police chiefs said they were appalled by the way Floyd lost his life and by the violence which followed in U.S. cities but called on potential protesters in the United Kingdom to work with police as coronavirus restrictions remain in place.
But in Hyde Park, near Speakers' Corner, many cautioned that racism was still a British problem too.
""My mum was a protester in apartheid and that was 30 to 40 years ago - it’s pretty disappointing that we have had to come out today to protest the same thing today they were protesting how many years ago,"" Roz Jones, 21, a student from London told Reuters.
Jones came to Britain as a small child with his mother from South Africa. 
""It’s a systematic issue all over the world. It’s not like this is just about someone dying, we live our lives made awfully aware of our race. That’s not right, that’s not the natural order,"" he said.

The Hyde Park rally is the second major protest in Britain after hundreds gathered in London's Trafalgar Square (NYSE:SQ) on Sunday before marching to the U.S. embassy.

The incident drew outrage on social media after a forestry officer, Mohan Krishnan, posted an emotional apology to the elephant on May 30 in which he said the animal died from eating a pineapple or another fruit stuffed with a firecracker.
Forestry officials said the incident happened on May 23 in the Palakkad district of Kerala state in southern India, near farmland where locals sometimes scatter fruit spiked with firecrackers to discourage animals from damaging crops.
""We only know that the injury (to the elephant) was caused by some explosive substance,"" forestry official Sunil Kumar said. The perpetrators, he said, could face animal cruelty charges that could bring fines or even a jail term.
India has the world's largest population of the Asiatic elephant but they are classified as an endangered species. Incidents of human-animal conflict are not uncommon as elephants often stray into human settlements hunting for food.
The pregnant elephant had wandered out of the local Silent Valley National Park in search of food when the incident occurred, forestry officials said.
They later found the elephant trying to cool herself in a stream but as locals tried to heave it out of the water to take it to a treatment centre, the animal collapsed and died.
""Sorry sister,"" Krishnan, who witnessed the elephant's death, wrote in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. ""With her mouth and tongue destroyed in the explosion, she paced around hungry without being able to eat. She must have been more worried about the health of the child inside her than about her own hunger.""

China and Iran, described respectively in the past as authoritarian and a mafia-like state by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, both urged the United States in recent days to tackle racism and protect the rights of minorities.
U.S. protesters ignored curfews overnight, angry over the treatment of George Floyd who died after a white policeman kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25. President Donald Trump has threatened to deploy the military to quell the nationwide unrest.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying has used Floyd's dying words -- ""I can't breathe"" -- in a tweet responding to State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, who criticised China's move to impose security laws on Hong Kong.
Chinese state media have given heavy coverage to the protests, even on the eve of the anniversary of its own military crackdown on protesters 31 years ago, an event it rarely mentions. On June 4, 1989, troops fired on students in Beijing. Rights groups say thousands may have been killed.
""China can tell right from wrong. We always oppose racial discrimination. On this issue, no double standards should be applied,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular media briefing on Wednesday.
Iran's supreme leader also waded in on Wednesday.
""The people's slogan of 'I can't breathe', which can be heard in the massive protests throughout the U.S., is the heartfelt words of all nations against which the U.S. has committed many atrocities,"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech.
""The crime committed against this black man is the same thing the U.S. has been doing against all the world,"" he said, citing Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Vietnam.
    Hundreds were killed in Iran in November when protests erupted over a fuel price hike, believed to be the worst civil unrest since Iran's 1979 revolution. Many Iranians on social media have accused Iran's clerical establishment of double standards in its criticism of Washington over the protests.
Russia and Turkey also chimed in, complaining about heavy-handed police treatment of their journalists covering the protests. Both have been targets for human rights criticism from Washington, including over press freedom.
""We consider it unacceptable for U.S. law enforcement officials to use special equipment -- rubber bullets and tear gas -- against media representatives after they have presented their press cards,"" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement last weekend.
Turkey's communications director, Fahrettin Altun, tweeted on Monday: ""Press freedom is the backbone of democracy."" According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, Turkey held 47 journalists in prison at end-2019, second only to China.
The State Department did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
A U.S. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity after witnessing protests first-hand in Washington this week, said heavy-handed police tactics and divisive political rhetoric made U.S. diplomacy much more difficult.

""Using authoritarian tactics emboldens our enemies and dismays our allies,"" he said. ""It makes us look like hypocrites. It degrades America's prestige and power, leaves all Americans less safe.""

The Memorial preserves the Auschwitz death camp set up on Polish soil by Nazi Germany during World War Two. More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in gas chambers at the camp or from starvation, cold and disease.
The Memorial has been closed to visitors since March 12. Last year it was visited by around 2.3 million people. It hopes to re-open at the beginning of July. 
""In these difficult moments, we cannot squander our previous achievements or slow down our work to maintain and build remembrance that is the only remedy for future years,"" the museum's Director Piotr Cywinski said in a statement.

The conservation of the camp has not been put at risk, the Auschwitz Memorial said, as this work is funded by the Auschwitz-Birkenau Foundation, which is doubling its financial support in 2020.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court ruled on Wednesday that the government's decision to rein in internet speeds in a bid to contain civil unrest in the country's easternmost region of Papua last year was unlawful. 
Demonstrations broke out in a number of cities in August after Papuan students in the city of Surabaya on Java island were allegedly taunted with racist slurs. 
As unrest flared across the provinces of Papua and West Papua, the government said it throttled internet access to ""prevent hoaxes from spreading"" because this could trigger more violence. 
The ruling by the Jakarta state administrative court and posted on its website said the act of slowing down the internet last year ""was an unlawful action done by an agency and/or a government official"".
The defendants listed on the ruling were the president and the minister of communications.
The lawsuit was filed by Indonesia's Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) and advocacy group the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet). It argued the internet throttling, particularly at a time of civil unrest, was a human rights violation and an infringement on media freedom.
""There is no guarantee the government won't do this again, but morally it's been proven that what they did was not right,"" Ade Wahyudin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Reuters, noting the government had 14 days to decide whether to appeal.
A spokesman for President Joko Widodo was not immediately available for comment.
In an interview with Reuters last year, Communications Minister Johnny G. Plate defended the move. 
""When there's civil disobedience, that is not repressive,"" he said. ""That is restoring the situation back to normal.""

Reporting in Papua, where some have long advocated for independence from Indonesia, has been frequently restricted for the foreign media.

""The crime committed against this black man is the same thing the U.S. government has been doing against all the world,"" Khamenei said in televised speech. ""This is the U.S. government's true nature and character that is being exposed today.""
U.S. cities have seen widespread demonstrations, some of them violent, since Floyd, a black man, died after being pinned to the ground by a white policeman in Minneapolis last week. The police officer has been charged with murder.
""In dealing with its people, the U.S. government has behaved in the worst manner. The people of the United States have every right to feel embarrassed and ashamed by their governments, particularly the current one,"" Khamenei said. 
Khamenei's speech comes at a time of heightened tension between longtime foes Tehran and Washington. Relations worsened since U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision in 2018 to abandon an agreement between Iran and world powers that curbed Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions.
Iran's state media has given wide coverage to the U.S. protests. Some Iranians on social media have also criticised Iran's clerical establishment for double standards in criticising Washington's action against demonstrators.

Thousands were arrested and hundreds were killed in November when Iranians took to the streets to protest against a fuel price hike, believed to be Iran's worst public unrest since the 1979 revolution that brought clerical rule.

MADRID (Reuters) - New official data in Spain showed on Wednesday that many more people have died than usual this year than the recorded number of coronavirus fatalities and revealed a shocking 155% spike in mortality at the epidemic's peak in early April.
Experts believe the additional deaths include cases where the cause is hard to establish due to underlying conditions, and fatalities among people who avoided hospital treatment for other problems due to the fear of contracting COVID-19.
Spain has had one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks, recording an official death toll of 27,127 and seeing its tourism-dependent economy pulverised during a severe lockdown that helped curb the disease. 
The National Statistics Institute (INE) said it was starting an experimental series monitoring the weekly mortality rate to help shed light on the impact of the pandemic.
A total of 225,930 people died in Spain in the first 21 weeks of 2020 - 43,945 more than the same period of 2019 and 16,818 more than the health ministry's current total confirmed coronavirus death toll. 
The INE data was consistent with figures from the National Epidemiology Centre, which estimates mortality comparing deaths recorded across civil registries with historical averages.
Overall mortality in Spain jumped its highest, 155%, in the worst week of the coronavirus outbreak in early April from the same period a year earlier, according to the INE data. 
Supporting the Spanish government's belief the worst is over, on the last week analysed by the INE, between May 18-24, mortality was at the same level as a year earlier.
Elderly people over 90 were the hardest hit so far this year, with 27% more deaths over the 21-week period, while 25% more died among those aged 85-89. There was hardly any difference from a year earlier in groups under 54 years old.

U.N. prosecutors accuse Kabuga of bankrolling and arming ethnic Hutu militias that killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda during a 100-day period in 1994. He is indicted for genocide and incitement to commit genocide, among other charges.
Kabuga, whose arrest in Paris in May ended a manhunt that lasted more than two decades, has called the charges lies. 
His lawyers say he would not receive a fair trial at the tribunal, which is based in The Hague and in Arusha, Tanzania. They also argue his health is too frail for him to be transferred to the African country, particularly during a dangerous pandemic. 
But the court said his health was ""not incompatible"" with a transfer. The 87-year-old is currently being held in a Paris prison.
In a letter to the U.N. tribunal's chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, ahead of Wednesday's ruling, Kabuga's lawyers urged him to leave the case with France's judiciary. 

""If you were to decide to assert the primacy of your jurisdiction over French jurisdiction, thus endangering the life of Felicien Kabuga, we would take the risk of renouncing on discovering the truth forever,"" Laurent Bayon wrote, citing Kabuga's medical history.

LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Britain will not walk away from the people of Hong Kong if China imposes a national security law that would conflict with its international obligations under a 1984 accord, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday.
The United Kingdom has urged China to step back from the brink over the national security legislation for Hong Kong that it says risks destroying one of the jewels of Asia's economy while ruining the reputation of China.
""Hong Kong succeeds because its people are free,"" Johnson wrote in the Times of London newspaper. ""If China proceeds, this would be in direct conflict with its obligations under the joint declaration, a legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations.
""Many people in Hong Kong fear that their way of life - which China pledged to uphold - is under threat,"" Johnson said.
China’s parliament approved last week a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. Mainland security and intelligence agents may, for the first time, be stationed in the city.
""If China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honour our obligations and provide an alternative,"" Johnson said.
Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule - imposed after Britain defeated China in the First Opium War.
CHINA SCOLDS UK 
China said its decisions on national security in Hong Kong were its own affair and that Britain's link to the territory stemmed from ""aggressive colonization and unequal treaties"". 
""The UK's irresponsible remarks and accusations...have grossly interfered in China’s internal affairs including Hong Kong affairs,"" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said. ""We advise the UK side to step back from the brink."" 
""The UK said the legislation is authoritarian, but this word is the exact characterization of the UK's former rule over HK,"" the spokesman said. 
Johnson repeated Britain's pledge to give British National Overseas passport-holders in Hong Kong a path to British citizenship, allowing them to settle in the United Kingdom.
There are about 350,000 holders of BNO passports in Hong Kong and another 2.5 million are eligible for them, Johnson said.
Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong called on the United Kingdom to go further and impose sanctions on China. 
""I call upon the UK government to impose necessary sanctions and restrictive measures,"" Wong said.
Hong Kong activists plan to rally to mark the June 4, 1989 anniversary of Chinese troops firing on pro-democracy student demonstrators in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ), even though for the first time, an annual vigil for the anniversary has been cancelled over concerns about coronavirus contagion.
Demonstrations are also planned for the June 9 anniversary of last year's million-strong march against a now-withdrawn Hong Kong bill to allow for the extradition of offenders to mainland China, as well as protests three days later that police tackled with tear gas and rubber bullets.

In 2019, Prague hosted more than 9 million visitors, making it the fourth-most visited city in Europe behind London, Paris and Rome, according to Euromonitor data.
But with cobblestone streets and Baroque churches empty of the usual swarms of foreign tourists, restaurants, pubs, cafes and others are rethinking their approach and prices.
""Before we wouldn't drink in a place like this because of the tourist atmosphere and high prices,"" said Petr Kopas, 56, while sipping a Pilsner at an empty Old Town Square pub that now charges four times less for a beer.
The state agency CzechTourism is also pitching in with a 350 million crown ($14.76 million) plan that includes a marketing campaign to spur domestic tourism and attract visitors from neighbouring countries.
Tourism accounts for about 3 percent of the economy of the nation of 10.7 million and contributes nearly 60 percent to Prague's overall income, leaving a big gap to fill without foreign visitors. 
CzechTourism estimates the country's tourism revenues would fall by about half in 2020 from 300 billion Czech crowns ($12.65 billion) in 2019. For Prague, tourism stands to plummet around 60 percent to 64 billion Czech crowns ($2.70 billion).
""This year's goal is to survive,"" CzechTourism Director Jan Herget told Reuters.
Restaurants and pubs have sought to stay afloat with steps such as re-jigging menus to include affordable offerings for Czechs, who on average earn far less than foreign visitors.
Ambiente Group tweaked the concept at most of its 26 eateries to make menus more appealing to locals, including ditching caviar for a more traditional fried cauliflower appetizer at the popular Cafe Savoy in Prague, said Jana Bilikova, the group's creative chef.
""We tried to simplify the offer but keep the experience,"" she said, citing a new three-course tasting menu for around 900 Czech crowns ($37.95) at its Michelin-star La Degustation Boheme Bourgeoise. A pre-pandemic 10-course menu would have cost 3,000 Czech crowns ($126.51).
Prague officials also plan to spend 121 million Czech crowns ($5.10 million) on vouchers redeemable at places like museums, galleries and zoos for Czechs and visitors from neighbouring countries such as Slovakia, Poland and Germany.

Some 25 percent of Israelis surveyed by the Israel Democracy Institute think-tank said they want their government to apply sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank even without backing from Israel's closest ally.
U.S. President Donald Trump's plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace includes Israel keeping most of its settlements in the West Bank, territory that Palestinians seek for a state. 
Palestinians have rejected Trump's proposal. They and most countries consider Israel's settlements in the West Bank illegal. Israel disputes this.
Another quarter of the 771 Jewish and Arab Israelis polled preferred annexation only with Washington's backing, while another 30 percent opposed the move entirely. The remaining 20 percent were undecided.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to begin cabinet discussions on July 1 on extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley - a de facto annexation of land captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
The Trump plan also envisages negotiations leading to a Palestinian state under near-complete Israeli security control, creating what Palestinians leaders say would be an unviable country.
Israeli settler leaders, who met Netanyahu on Tuesday, have voiced concern that annexation under the Trump blueprint would also entail Palestinian statehood and leave some settlements isolated within Palestinian-ruled territory.
Israeli cabinet minister Tzachi Hanegbi said on Army Radio on Wednesday that settlers need not worry ""because there will never be"" a Palestinian state. Israeli-Palestinian talks collapsed in 2014, part of a now-moribund peace process that began in the 1990s.
This week, Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz ordered the military to begin preparing for the consequences of annexation, which could stoke Palestinian unrest.

The game, ""Strategic Mind: Blitzkrieg,"" invites players to take command of the German army during World War Two and offers different fictional scenarios depending on the outcome. 
One such fictional scenario depicts a Nazi victory parade in the heart of Moscow and shows Hitler reviewing it as German tanks rumble across Red Square (NYSE:SQ) and planes screech overhead. 
""Here we can only express extreme regret that this game is available in our country, especially during the year when we are marking 75 years of (the Soviet) victory. This game, for us, is nothing other than Nazi propaganda and is unacceptable,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
The Kremlin hoped relevant Russian government agencies would take measures, said Peskov. 
One Russian senator has raised the possibility of criminal proceedings against the game's developers. 
Starni Games, its Ukraine-based developer, in a statement released on Reddit, has denied glorifying Nazism.
""...In no way (are) we trying to glorify the Nazi ideology, we strongly condemn their deeds,"" the statement said. ""We’ve created a historical game with alternate history possibilities: if the player loses, there are Soviet troops taking (the)Reichstag, and if he wins one of the battles German troops are taking Moscow.""
Nor, the statement said, did the game portray Hitler in a positive light. 

Russia had planned to mark the anniversary of the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany on May 9 with a military parade across Red Square. President Vladimir Putin was forced to postpone it until June 24 however due to the coronavirus outbreak.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis called for national reconciliation in the United States on Wednesday, saying that while racism is intolerable, the street violence that has broken out is ""self-destructive and self-defeating"".
Francis broke his silence on the tensions in the United States, which has seen eight nights of protests over the death of a black man in police custody, by dedicating the entire English-language section of his weekly audience to the turmoil there.
He called the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African-American who died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes, ""tragic"".
Francis said he was praying for all who died as a result of the ""sin of racism"", including Floyd.
""My friends, we cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism and exclusion in any form and yet claim to defend the sacredness of every human life,"" Francis said.
""At the same time, we have to recognise that the violence of recent nights is self-destructive and self-defeating. Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost,"" he said.
Francis asked Americans to implore God for ""the national reconciliation and peace for which we yearn"".
U.S. President Donald Trump came under fire from Christian leaders who criticised him for using religious symbols as a backdrop for staged photo opportunities.
They condemned the administration's forceful displacement of peaceful protesters near the White House on Monday so Trump could be photographed holding a Bible in front of an Episcopalian church.
On Tuesday Catholics protested as Trump rode to a photo opportunity at a shrine dedicated to St. Pope John Paul II.
Washington's Roman Catholic Archbishop Wilton Gregory said in a statement that John Paul ""certainly would not condone the use of tear gas and other deterrents to silence, scatter or intimidate them for a photo opportunity in front of a place of worship and peace"".

Gregory, who is black, criticised the administrators of John Paul shrine, saying he found it ""baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated"".

Materials science professor Sirous Asgari, 59, was indicted by U.S. federal prosecutors in April 2016. A federal judge in Ohio acquitted Asgari in November 2019.
Tehran and Washington have denied reports that his release was part of a prisoner swap. 
U.S. authorities said in May that Asgari, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in April, would be deported once he received medical clearance.

Last year, Iran freed U.S. citizen Xiyue Wang, who had been held for three years on spying charges, and the United States released Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has led Iran, one of the worst-hit countries in the Middle East, to temporarily release some prisoners in a bid to curb the spread of infections. 
In mid-March, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tehran was considering freeing some U.S. citizens as Michael White, a U.S. navy veteran who has been detained in Iran since 2018, was released from prison on medical furlough. He remains in Iran.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's parliament elected a new government on Wednesday with a prime minister promising to reach a deal on normalising ties with Serbia that would enable it to get a United Nations seat. 
The new government of Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti, of the centre-right Democratic League of Kosovo, was voted for by 61 deputies in the Balkan country's 120-seat parliament after weeks of legal wrangling.
""The final deal between Kosovo and Serbia will be based on reciprocity recognition between the two states,"" Hoti told MPs. ""We will not allow any change of the borders or exchange of territories (with Serbia).""
Hoti has promised to remove all trade barriers for goods coming from Serbia, as urged by both the United States and the European Union, to resume a Brussels-sponsored dialogue which was interrupted in 2018.
Serbia, together with its traditional ally Russia, has been blocking Kosovo's membership of international organisations including the United Nations. 
A deal on mutual recognition between Kosovo and Serbia is a pre-condition for Belgrade to join the EU. 
Hoti was deputy PM in the previous government of Albin Kurti, from leftist party Vetevendosje, which was dismissed in a no confidence vote in March after disputes over its handling of the coronavirus crisis and lifting tariffs on Serbian goods.

CASTRIES, St Lucia/KINGSTON (Reuters) - A cluster of Caribbean islands are reopening this month for international tourism, hoping to burnish their reputations as oases of tranquility after containing their coronavirus outbreaks and implementing strict new public health protocols.
The Caribbean, known for its palm-fringed beaches, turquoise water and colonial towns, is the most tourism-dependent region in the world. The move is a pilot test for other regions planning to restart tourism after pandemic-induced lockdowns.
Antigua and Barbuda, the U.S. Virgin Islands and St. Lucia are the first to reopen this week. Jamaica and Aruba are set to follow later in the month, with July target dates for the Bahamas and the Dominican Republic.
While other tourist hotspots like Greece aim to limit arrivals from countries with high infection rates, the first flights the Caribbean is receiving are from the United States, which has the world's highest number of reported cases.
But local tourism officials say they have little choice. Americans accounted for almost half the Caribbean's 31.5 million visitors last year.
""What are we going to wait for? A vaccine? Shut down the country for two years?"" Antigua and Barbuda's Tourism Minister Charles Fernandez said in an interview.
Instead, the islands reopening will conduct health screening, including temperature checks upon arrival, and require or encourage the use of face masks in public spaces.
They are divided though over whether to test - as recommended by the Caribbean Public Health Agency - because of cost, reliability and availability concerns. Without testing, asymptomatic visitors could be a risk.
Antigua and Barbuda will conduct a rapid coronavirus test of visitors upon arrival, said Fernandez.
St. Lucia Prime Minister Allen Chastanet told Reuters it would require a certificate for a negative coronavirus test conducted in the 48 hours before departure.
It remains unclear if this would work, given tests are not widely available on demand in the United States. 
Concerns remain over reopenings in countries that do not require testing of arrivals, like Jamaica.
""People should object, as should anyone who has done what they have done to flatten the curve of new cases,"" said civil rights advocate Carol Narcisse, noting Jamaica has warned of a likely new rise in cases. 
""Whose interest is the government really serving here?""
'GENERATION C' 
The coronavirus era has uprooted Caribbean carnival celebrations, nights out clubbing and resort buffets.
Still, the tourism industry hopes the mere appeal of sun, sea and the outdoors will suffice.
""Post-coronavirus, people want to get outside,"" said Marc Melville, the head of Jamaica-based Chukka Tours.
Caribbean nations, which were quick to shut their borders and impose strict lockdowns as the pandemic spread, hope to market themselves as safe destinations.
Antigua and Barbuda and the U.S. Virgin Islands have respectively just one and two reported cases, according to officials. St Lucia has none. 
Officials want the new tourism guidelines to reassure travelers, without being off-putting. Measures include sanitizing surfaces and social distancing in hotels, restaurants, tour operators and taxis.
Digital transactions aim to reduce the exchange of cash and face-to-face interaction.
Jamaica's preliminary guidelines, which run more than 100 pages long, even detail the need to reduce capacity on boats or to remove towels lying around resorts with tongs. 
Jamaican Tourism Minister Edmund Bartlett said the country should reopen and adapt to bolster its tourist industry amid the global economic crisis.
""It’s a new type of traveler who is going to be hugely health conscious,"" Bartlett said, branding this the ""Generation C"" traveler, in reference to the post-coronavirus tourist.
Islands like St. Lucia will pace their reopenings, keeping tourist sites closed in a first phase and allowing seated restaurant service only at resorts.

On his blog ""One Mile at a Time,"" travel writer Ben Schlappig wrote St. Lucia's plan would make him feel safe: ""The question becomes whether a visit would be any fun with all of these restrictions.""

In the past week, Muslim religious authorities in the territory have allowed Friday prayers in mosques, after a two-month closure.
They will now be open to worshippers every day. Abdel-Hadi Al-Agha, director of the Hamas-led Waqf and Religious Affairs ministry, said he instructed mosque leaders to keep sermons and prayers brief as a health precaution.

""People's pleasure at returning to God's house is a great blessing,"" he said.
Gaza authorities also ordered the reopening of pre-schools, for children between the ages of two and five.
""A big percentage of families are employees and since they have resumed their jobs in offices, they have brought their children back to our nursery school,"" said Hind Assousi, principal of the Beautiful Smile kindergarten in Gaza City.

The explosion, which police initially said was a suicide bombing but later said was caused by a planted device, killed two people on Tuesday including Ayaz Niazi, a scholar and the outspoken imam of the Wazir Akbar Khan mosque.
President Ashraf Ghani called the attack a crime against humanity and appointed a team to investigate, his office said on Twitter. 
Ghani also visited the hospital where Niazi's body was brought to pay his respects. 
Niazi was famous for his fiery sermons, in which he regularly criticised the Taliban, the government as well as U.S.-led foreign forces in the country. 
No group claimed responsibility. The Taliban denied involvement.
Prominent politician Abdullah Abdullah, who was recently appointed to head peace talks with the Taliban, said ""criminal terrorists"" had once again struck a ""towering religious figure"".
""They view great religious scholars as a major threat against their extremist ideology,"" he said.
Many Afghans called on social media for an official day of mourning. 
The mosque is one of the most-heavily guarded in the country and is in a central Kabul district where several embassies and offices of foreign organisations are located.
Despite a lull in fighting in recent days, following a three-day ceasefire between the government and the Taliban late last month to mark the end of Ramadan, attacks have been taking place.
Two people were killed and two wounded in Kabul on Sunday when a bus carrying employees of private Khurshid TV was hit by a roadside bomb.
The attack was claimed by the Islamic State, who also took responsibility for the storming a maternity hospital in Kabul last month. 

In the southern province of Kandahar, nine civilians were killed and five wounded when a roadside bomb blew up their vehicle on Wednesday, police said.

The government has never released a full death toll, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundred to several thousand.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok pledged justice on Wednesday for scores of pro-democracy protesters killed a year ago when security forces broke up a sit-in outside the defence ministry.
The demonstration was the culmination of weeks of protests that led the army to overthrow veteran leader Omar al-Bashir and ushered in a power-sharing agreement last year. 
The military - including a powerful paramilitary force that witnesses and activists said played a leading role in the raid - is now in a fragile, three-year pact with civilians. 
Hamdok, an economist and former senior United Nations official, leads a transitional government and named a commission in October to investigate the raid.
""I assure you all, that achieving comprehensive justice and retribution for the souls of our hero martyrs ... and for the wounded and missing is an inevitable and irreversible step,"" Hamdok said in a televised speech.
""We are awaiting the completion of the independent investigation committee's work, which will be followed by referring all those found guilty of participating in the massacre that dispersed the sit-in to fair and public trials.""
Some protesters took to the streets of the capital Khartoum on Wednesday morning carrying pictures of victims and chanting ""Our martyrs are not dead, they are alive with the revolutionaries"", a Reuters witnesses said.

1218,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 03, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: Flush with corruption cash, Brazilian states step up deforestation fight","By Jake Spring
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian states are bolstering the fight against destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest with millions of dollars from an oil company's corruption settlement that allows them to partially compensate for weakening environmental protections under President Jair Bolsonaro.
State environmental agencies will have a one-off windfall that Reuters calculates will total at least 140 million reais ($27 million). The cash, which comes from a massive settlement payment from state-run oil firm Petrobras, will be spent on patrol officers, jeeps, surveillance technology and other outlays to protect the rainforest, officials in all nine Amazon states told Reuters.
""It fell from the sky. You open and look at your bank balance and there's money you didn't even know that you had,"" said Roberio Nobre, the head of the environmental agency in Amapa state, on Brazil's northern border with French Guiana.
The amount of money going to the state environmental agencies has not been previously reported.
Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon climbed to an 11-year high in 2019 and continues to rise this year.
That has coincided with a decline in resources at Brazil's federal environment agency Ibama. Its budget has been repeatedly cut in recent years and it now has less than half the 1,600 field agents it had in 2009.
Although the fall in funding began before Bolsonaro, environmental advocates blame him for worsening the situation by weakening protections for the rainforest. Bolsonaro has railed against what he sees as overzealous environmental regulation getting in the way of economic development. 
""The transfer of money from the Petrobras Fund comes at an opportune time. The states can fill the vacuum and act as a counterpoint to the federal government,"" said Ana Karine Pereira, an environmental policy professor at University of Brasilia.
Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, was the center of Brazil's largest-ever corruption scandal - the Car Wash probe - that involved bribes being paid to hundreds of politicians and business leaders to fix public construction contracts.
The oil company admitted wrongdoing related to record keeping and internal controls, ultimately agreeing to pay a $853 million fine to settle charges that it violated U.S. anti-corruption laws. U.S. authorities agreed to return most of the proceeds to the Brazilian government.
After fires surged in the Amazon rainforest last year and provoked international outcry, Brazil's Supreme Court decided to direct a chunk of the funds to environmental protection at the state level.
For normally cash-strapped states, the money has radically expanded budgets. 
The environment agency in Pará, the Brazilian state with the highest level of deforestation last year, received 49 million reais, double their annual budget of 24 million reais. It will be spent over two years.
Pará is hiring an additional 100 environmental field agents to patrol for deforestation and other crimes, 10 times the number of agents they had before. They will conduct their first raids in June, Pará environmental chief Mauro O'de Almeida said.
Several of the states have lengthy written plans for how the money will be used.
Amapa's plan, for example, ranges from buying deforestation monitoring equipment to reassessing its protected reserve areas, Nobre said.
Roraima, which borders Venezuela, has a 35-page document that pledges to promote sustainable agriculture and educate locals on fire prevention. State environmental agency chief Ionilson Souza said some of the funds will be used to hire firefighters in October when forest fires usually peak.
Not all states will spend the money on the environment. The Supreme Court decided in May that four states would be allowed to redirect the funds, partially or in full, to fighting the coronavirus.
The Bolsonaro government has sought to militarize environmental enforcement, sending thousands of soldiers to the Amazon last month to combat deforestation. 
Environmental advocates say the military cannot effectively replace permanent oversight by specialist agencies like Ibama.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao, a retired general presiding over the operation, has acknowledged sending in the military was not ideal but says it is the best option available to the cash-strapped government. He said last month that the ultimate goal is to build up Ibama's staffing and funding by 2022, when Bolsonaro's first term will end.
States say they are picking up the slack.

""We're not waiting for help. We're doing our part,"" Pará environment chief O'de Almeida said.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italians were allowed to travel to other regions of the country on Wednesday for the first time in nearly three months, in a further relaxation of lockdown restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
Travellers boarding trains in Milan, capital of Lombardy in northern Italy, were excited at the prospect of finally being able to visit family and friends elsewhere in the country.
""I work here in Milan and up until now I couldn't move between regions,"" said Anna Falcone, who was getting ready to board a train to Calabria, southwest Italy, to see her parents. 
""But now, with the possibility of smart working, I can return home and go and meet my parents and hug them again after three months of not seeing them,"" she said. ""I am happy and I can't wait to see them.""
Lombardy remains one of the regions worst affected by the pandemic in the whole world and it accounts for about half of Italy's more than 33,500 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.
The now-obligatory protective masks and groups of security staff checking temperatures are constant reminders that the epidemic has still not been tamed.
Social distancing rules remain in force and shops routinely limit entries. There are periodic public outcries over groups of people gathering outside bars or in parks.
The governors of some regions in southern Italy, much less affected by the pandemic, are concerned that the relaxation of travel restrictions could lead to travellers from northern cities such as Milan inadvertently spreading the virus.
And with Italy's economy expected to shrink by about 9% this year and thousands of companies facing an uncertain future, few Italians are under any illusion that life will return to normal anytime soon.

""The lockdown has brought a really harsh economic reality and in the next few months we will really see its impact,"" said Alessandro Peruzzo, who was preparing to visit his family in the northeastern town of Treviso.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - When civil partnerships were legalised in Switzerland in January 2007, gay couple Laurent Marmier and Yves Bugnon completed the paperwork that same month, making them among the first to take advantage of the new law.
Thirteen years later, they hope a parliamentary vote on Wednesday will open the door for them to finally get married and enjoy full equality with heterosexual couples.
""We don't have the same rights, not quite. And this is what is bothering us,"" said Bugnon, a music teacher in the French-speaking city of Lausanne.
Conservative Switzerland lags many countries in Western Europe on gay rights and is slowly catching up. In February, voters backed an anti-homophobia law giving lesbians, gays and bisexuals legal protection from discrimination.
A survey commissioned by gay rights association Pink Cross showed more than 80% of Swiss support same-sex marriage.
However, the country's political institutions tend to be more conservative than the general public, Socialist lawmaker Mathias Reynard told Reuters. ""Swiss people are in favour – but everything takes time.""
The same-sex marriage proposal is expected to pass the lower house but it will still have to clear the upper house. Then, in line with Switzerland's direct democracy process, it could be challenged via referendum if opponents gather the necessary 50,000 voter signatures within 100 days.
The dominant People's Party (SVP) opposes the law but an official did not respond for requests to comment on whether it would seek a referendum on the issue.
The fact that gay marriage is not yet legal here has more than just symbolic importance for couples. Marital status has a bearing on adoption and assisted reproduction rights, including sperm donations for lesbian couples.
Marmier said he was hopeful the law would pass but added it was important that these other issues were also addressed in the new law.

""I think it is important it moves forward and that we don't wait 13 years to pass the next step,"" he said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media has been revelling in days of chaotic protests in the United States and highlighting President Donald Trump's threat to use troops, even as the anniversary looms of its own military crackdown on demonstrators 31 years ago.
For days, Chinese media has prominently covered the protests in the aftermath of the Minnesota police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, contrasting it with support from U.S. politicians for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
Last year's Hong Kong protests, which sometimes turned violent, prompted Beijing last month to announce it would impose national security legislation on the former British colony.
Hu Xijin, editor of the Global Times, a nationalistic tabloid published by the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily, said the United States was marking the Tiananmen anniversary ""in a unique way"".
""US military is being dispatched to the cities and police are opening fire. The US is proving the importance for China to restore order in 1989. But back then, the destruction of China's order was much worse than US now,"" he said in English on Twitter.
The June 4 anniversary of the shooting by troops of student demonstrators in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989, which rights groups and witnesses say may have killed thousands, is not publicly observed in the mainland and state media rarely mentions it in Chinese.
On Monday, Trump vowed to use military force if the U.S. violence was not quelled.
""China has shown patience toward the Hong Kong riots,"" the Global Times wrote in an editorial, citing the security legislation as key to resolving the issue there. 
""Does the White House believe that deploying the military can solve its deep-seated problems?""
China's tradition of ""magnifying social malaise"" in the West comes amid heightened U.S.-China tension, said Yuan Zeng, a lecturer in Media and Communications at the University of Leeds.
""You can clearly see Chinese state media are using U.S. unrest to justify China's move on HK National Security Law and to bash criticism from US,"" she said in a text message.
A cartoon posted by the People's Daily on social media depicted a policeman breaking off a Statue of Liberty cloaking, the sky in flames and the White House beneath him, under the Chinese caption ""Human Rights"".
China has long been criticised by the United States and others over human rights, including its treatment of Tibetans and ethnic Uighur Muslims.
In April, several African ambassadors complained to Beijing over ""inhuman"" treatment of Africans in the city of Guangzhou during coronavirus containment.
""We always oppose racial discrimination,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a Wednesday media briefing.

""We hope the U.S. government will take concrete measures to fulfil its obligations under the international convention on the elimination of all forms of racial discrimination to protect the legal rights of ethnic minorities,"" he said.

Lesotho's Appeal Court revoked her bail last week on suspicion that procedure was not followed correctly when her bail was granted. 
Thabane was transferred to court, where she wore a fur coat and black protective anti-coronavirus mask, a Reuters witness said.
The date for a new bail application was set as June 6. 
Maesaiah Thabane has been charged with ordering the killing of Lipolelo Thabane, her love rival, who was shot dead near her home in Lesotho's capital, Maseru, in June, 2017. Maesaiah Thabane was released on bail in February.
Lipolelo was estranged from Thomas Thabane at the time of the murder.
The case had been causing growing political instability in the independent mountain kingdom of 2 million people encircled by South Africa before Thomas Thabane resigned as prime minister last month. 

He is also a suspect in the murder. He denies any involvement and has yet to be formally charged.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court on Wednesday ordered President Joko Widodo to make an official apology after ruling that his government's decision to rein in internet speeds to contain civil unrest in the Papua region last year was unlawful. 
Demonstrations broke out in a number of cities last August after Papuan students in the city of Surabaya on Java island were allegedly taunted with racist slurs. 
As unrest flared across the provinces of Papua and West Papua, the government said it throttled internet access to ""prevent hoaxes from spreading"" because this could trigger more violence.
In Wednesday's ruling, the Jakarta administrative court ordered the central government, including Widodo, to make an official apology for ""slowing and/or cutting internet access"" to the Indonesian people and media organizations. 
The court ordered the government to publish the apology in three national newspapers and broadcast it on six television stations within one month of the ruling. 
The lawsuit was filed by Indonesia's Alliance of Independent Journalists (AJI) and advocacy group the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet). It argued the internet throttling, particularly at a time of civil unrest, was a human rights violation and an infringement on media freedom.
""There is no guarantee the government won't do this again, but morally it's been proven that what they did was not right,"" Ade Wahyudin, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, told Reuters, noting the government had 14 days to decide whether to appeal.
A presidential spokesman was not immediately available for comment.
In an interview with Reuters last year, Communications Minister Johnny G. Plate defended the move. 
""When there's civil disobedience, that is not repressive,"" he said. ""That is restoring the situation back to normal.""

Reporting in Papua, where some have long advocated for independence from Indonesia, has been frequently restricted for the foreign media.

Britain left the EU on Jan. 31. Talks aimed at setting out its future ties with the bloc have all but stalled and some Britons worry they will lose the right to live and work in Germany, Europe's biggest economy.
Britons usually need to have lived in Germany for eight years to qualify for citizenship. Applications take more than six months to process. Britons could take up dual citizenship while Britain was still an EU member.
In 2019, some 128,900 foreigners obtained German citizenship, a 15% increase on the prior year. Almost half the increase was due to growing numbers of Britons being naturalised, the Federal Statistics Office said in a statement.

Some 14,600 Britons were naturalised in 2019, more than in the preceding two years together. In 2015, before the Brexit referendum, just 600 Britons were naturalised, the Office said.

David Lah, a Canadian of Burmese origin, and another man, Myanmar national Wai Tun, are facing up to three years in prison under a disaster management law over church services held in the city of Yangon in early April.
A ban on public gatherings in the city took effect in mid-March.
""For lawsuits which carry a sentence of three years or more, we don’t need to grant bail,"" judge Moe Swe told reporters after the hearing.
The judge said Lah's lawyer had applied for bail. Reporters were not allowed into the court and Reuters was not immediately able to identify or contact the lawyer for comment.
About 20 people who took part in the gatherings in April later tested positive for the novel coronavirus, an official said at the time.
This led to a cluster of 67 cases including the preacher, according to Thar Tun Kyaw, a spokesman for the health ministry.
The coronavirus has infected more than six million people globally and killed more than 37,600.
Clusters of infections in several countries have been linked to religious gatherings.
Myanmar, which has reported 233 cases of the virus and six deaths, is a Buddhist-majority country but Christians make up about 6% of the population.

""Hong Kong succeeds because its people are free,"" Johnson wrote in The Times. ""If China proceeds, this would be in direct conflict with its obligations under the joint declaration, a legally binding treaty registered with the United Nations.""
China’s parliament last week approved a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. Mainland security and intelligence agents may be stationed in the city for the first time.
""Many people in Hong Kong fear that their way of life — which China pledged to uphold — is under threat,"" Johnson said.
""If China proceeds to justify their fears, then Britain could not in good conscience shrug our shoulders and walk away; instead we will honour our obligations and provide an alternative,"" he said.
Johnson repeated Britain's pledge to give British National Overseas passport-holders in Hong Kong a path to British citizenship - allowing them to settle in the United Kingdom.
There are about 350,000 holders of BNO passports in Hong Kong and another 2.5 million are eligible for them, Johnson said.
The newspaper said that Britain's National Security Council agreed on Tuesday to “rebalance” Britain’s relationship with China.

Britain on Tuesday warned Beijing to step back from the brink over the national security law in Hong Kong, saying it risked destroying one of the jewels of Asia's economy while ruining the reputation of China.

Reuters reporters saw police use tear gas after some of the protesters started fires and set up barricades around the Avenue de Clichy in northern Paris, which was littered with rubbish and broken glass.
Thousands of people assembled earlier for a demonstration in memory of Adama Traore, a 24-year-old black Frenchman who died in a 2016 police operation.
The protesters were defying a police ban imposed because of the risk of disorder and the danger of spreading the novel coronavirus. 
The demonstration had drawn attention on social media of people supporting the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement and those backing U.S. protests in response to the May 25 killing in Minneapolis of Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes.

Traore's family blamed excessive force during his arrest, when he was pinned down by three gendarmes. Successive pathology reports have reached conflicting conclusions over whether his death two hours later resulted from asphyxiation or other factors including pre-existing conditions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Tuesday that it had accepted a proposal from South Korea for it to temporarily fund thousands of Korean workers at U.S. bases who were put on unpaid leave this year.
The United States furloughed the workers in South Korea in April after the two allies failed to sign a new cost-sharing agreement.
In a statement, the Pentagon said the agreement meant South Korea would pay more than $200 million to fund 4,000 Korean workers through to the end of this year.
""This decision enables a more equitable sharing of the employee labor burden by the ROK and the U.S.,"" the Pentagon said, referring to South Korea by the initials of its official name, the Republic of Korea. 
""More importantly, it sustains the Alliance's number one priority - our combined defense posture,"" it said. 
South Korea's Ministry of Defence said it welcomed the Pentagon's decision to end the furlough for the workers.
The ministry said South Korea would work with the United States to reach an agreement ""as soon as possible"" on the broader cost-sharing arrangement, which remains in dispute after it lapsed at the end of last year, leading to the workers being furloughed in the first place.
South Korea and the United States are embroiled in a disagreement dating back almost two years over how much each should pay to support the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.
""The United States has shown considerable flexibility in their approach to the SMA (Special Measures Agreement)negotiations, and requests that the ROK does the same,"" the Pentagon said.
U.S. officials have told Reuters that before South Korea's parliamentary elections in April, President Donald Trump rejected a South Korean offer to increase its contribution by at least 13% from the previous accord.

A union representing the Korean workers issued a statement welcoming the Pentagon's decision, and called for institutional changes to prevent the situation from happening again.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - The streets of Mumbai emptied on Wednesday as a rare cyclone headed for India's most populous metropolis and thousands of people moved away from the coast, adding to the pressure on authorities grappling with coronavirus. 
India's largest container port, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), on the outskirts of Mumbai, was also ordered to shut for 24 hours, the port said in a statement. 
The cyclonic storm in the Arabian Sea ""is very likely to intensify into a Severe Cyclonic Storm during next 6 hours,"" the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday.
The cyclone, designated Nisarga, could make landfall between on the coastal border region of Maharashtra and Gujarat states, with winds gusting up to 120 km per hour (75 miles per hour), the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane, the IMD said. 
Cyclones often skirt densely populated Mumbai, a metropolis of more than 20 million people, though every year during torrential rains of the June-September monsoon season roads are submerged, and the suburban railway service that serves millions of people comes to a halt.
Mumbai's emergency services are already struggling with the nation's largest outbreak of the novel coronavirus.
Roads were deserted and police were advising people to stay indoors in the financial capital and surrounding areas that have nearly 55,000 cases of COVID-19, with more than 1,600 deaths.
Maharashtra and Gujarat have evacuated more than 100,000 people from coastal areas, especially those staying in slums and makeshift houses to places of shelter, officials from both the states said.
In Mumbai, authorities shifted 150 patients from newly built makeshift Covid-19 hospital to other hospitals as the new structure was located in low-lying area.

Mumbai airport is operating only 19 flights on Wednesday against 50 allowed to operate, the airport said.

Ardern will decide on Monday whether the country is ready to shift to alert level 1, more than two months after she imposed a strict level 4 lockdown, shutting most businesses and forcing people to stay home, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Arden said waiting until Monday would allow her to see if recent changes, like the removal of restrictions on the number of people in bars and at social gatherings, had led to a rise in cases. 
""If it hasn't, then we will be in a good position to move,"" she said during a televised news conference. 
Under level 1 there is no requirement for physical distancing or limits on the number of people allowed in places like bars, clubs, churches, and sports venues, she said.
However, there would be one major change from pre-pandemic normality, with no immediate plans to reopen New Zealand's border.
New Zealand recorded no new cases of coronavirus for a 12th consecutive day on Wednesday and has just one active case. Ardern's decision to swiftly impose one of the harshest lockdowns in the world has been credited with constraining the spread of COVID-19 in New Zealand, which has reported a total of 1,504 cases and 22 deaths. 
Ardern said the focus under a level 1 alert would shift to public health measures and basic personal hygiene like regular hand washing, self-isolation by anyone with flu-like symptoms and contact tracing.
The government will work with large scale event organisers to develop a voluntary 'COVID code', which would help authorities in contact tracing if it is needed, she added.

The two agreed that South Korea would provide $200 million in funding for the entire Korean workforce at U.S. bases for the remainder of 2020, the Department of Defense said in a statement on Tuesday. About 4,000 of the 8,500 workers were put on an unprecedented furlough in April when the countries couldn’t work out a measure to extend their cost-sharing deal that expired Dec 31.
A breakthrough has proved difficult with President Donald Trump asking for as much as a five-fold increase and South Korea, which paid about $1 billion last year for hosting U.S. troops, showing no signs of offering anywhere near that much.
“We strongly encourage our ally to reach a fair agreement as quickly as possible,” the Pentagon said in its statement. South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s administration has indicated that it wouldn’t pay much more than it did last year with many in his progressive camp and the conservative opposition calling the American demands unreasonable.
The Pentagon said without a new agreement, U.S. Forces Korea’s “mid- and long-term force readiness remains at risk.”
How Kim Jong Un Keeps Advancing His Nuclear Program: QuickTake
Trump has repeatedly insisted that the U.S. gets a raw deal from partners who host American troops around the world, and he’s focused particular ire on what is known as the Special Measures Agreement with South Korea.
While the U.S. and South Korea have been bargaining, North Korea has been busy testing new types of solid-fuel, nuclear-capable ballistic missiles designed to strike anywhere on the Korean Peninsula and evade U.S. interceptors. It has fired off nine in March alone, a record for a month.
The negotiations in South Korea could affect other U.S. allies hosting troops, such as Japan, with Secretary of Defense Mark Esper saying the Trump administration wants that country to pay more, too. Japanese officials are watching the South Korea negotiations closely with the approach of talks set to begin later this year for a U.S-Japan cost-sharing deal.

The hacking, which came to light in January, has led to the ouster of 11 unnamed military officials and the resignation of a general. The chief of the armed forces has vowed to hold those involved responsible.
There have been repeated hacking scandals involving the Colombian military in recent years, including accusations that negotiators at peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels were spied on.
Previous investigations have not yet led to convictions.
Uribe, a polarizing figure who is now a senator, has been repeatedly investigated for a variety of crimes, including alleged witness tampering.
""Based on an accusation, the Supreme Court has opened a preliminary investigation against Senator Alvaro Uribe, as a possible recipient of information from illegal spying by military intelligence in 2019,"" the court said on Twitter. 
Uribe, who was president from 2002 to 2010, roundly rejected the investigation.
""Another preliminary investigation because of an anonymous coward who says I'm the beneficiary of the reports,"" he said on Twitter. 
""Because of that same anonymous person another magistrate has investigated me since January in the case of the hacker from 2014,"" Uribe said, referring to an earlier hacking scandal involving that year's presidential election.
One of the alleged hacking victims is a former secretary of the presidency who worked closely with President Ivan Duque, a protege of Uribe.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit, a part of the finance ministry tasked with combating and preventing money laundering, said Tuesday it had asked banks to freeze nearly 2,000 accounts allegedly linked to the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
It is the latest sign of Mexico's commitment to step up its fight against organized crime after U.S. President Donald Trump backed off from his threat to designate Mexican cartels as terrorist groups.
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) considers the cartel, known under the Spanish acronym CJNG, as one of the most prolific drug trafficking organizations in the world that is now flooding the U.S. market with methamphetamine.
""The operation is the result of the joint work carried out by the institutions that make up the security cabinet ... over several months,"" the Mexican unit said in a statement.
It said it managed to have 1,770 bank accounts of individuals frozen as well as 167 for companies and two trusts linked to the CJNG. 
While it did not disclose the amount held in the frozen accounts, it said it analyzed thousands of unusual transactions. 
It said Mexican officials had collaborated with the DEA which made it possible to find ""a large number of members of said criminal group, as well as its largest financial operators and companies used in money laundering"".
Mexican authorities extradited Ruben Oseguera, son of the cartel's top boss, Nemesio Oseguera, to the United States in February. In a fresh blow a month later, U.S. authorities arrested more than 250 people linked to the cartel.

MANAUS, Brazil (Reuters) - Police stormed a dozen sawmills in Brazil's Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest in a dawn raid on Tuesday, arresting about 30 people accused of involvement in an illegal logging ring. 
A criminal group behind those arrested spans a web of loggers, sawmill workers, furniture makers and drivers as well as public officials taking bribes, state police said in a statement. 
The sawmills were located near Manaus, the state capital of Amazonas, Brazil's largest rainforest state.
A Reuters photographer witnessed armed police confiscating industrial saws and truckloads of lumber, totaling more than a thousand cubic meters of wood. 
The criminal ring linked to Tuesday's raids has cut down some 9,000 trees that were each over 100 years old in the span of 10 months, according to police.
Deforestation hit an 11-year high in 2019 and has continued to climb in 2020, rising 55% between January and April as compared to a year ago.
About 99% of deforestation in Brazil last year was illegal, according to deforestation mapping initiative Mapbiomas.
Environmental advocates blame the policies of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office last year, for emboldening illegal loggers, miners and land speculators to destroy the forest.

Bolsonaro has called for the development of the Amazon to lift its people out of poverty and says he is being unfairly demonized.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in a statement on Friday that it had been asked by the police department in the town of Snellville to investigate an officer involved in the shooting of a driver following a car chase.
The GBI identified the driver on Tuesday as Momodou Lamin Sisay, who lived in the nearby town of Lithonia. Sisay, 39, is the son of Lare Sisay, a Gambian diplomat who also worked for the U.N. Development Programme. 
The GBI statement on Friday said preliminary information indicated police officers pursued Sisay after he failed to stop when they tried to pull him over for a vehicle tag violation. 
The statement said that when the car eventually stopped and officers approached it, Sisay pointed a handgun at the officers, who fired on the vehicle and retreated to find cover behind their vehicles. 
During an ensuing standoff with a SWAT team, the statement said, Sisay fired his weapon at the officers, one of whom returned fire. Sisay was pronounced dead at the scene, it said. 
Gambia's foreign affairs ministry, in a statement Tuesday, said it had ""asked the Gambian Embassy in Washington D.C. to engage the relevant U.S. authorities including the State Department, to seek a transparent, credible and objective investigation in the matter"". 
Gambian media quoted Sisay's father as saying he was withholding judgment on the incident pending results of an autopsy and findings from a private investigator, while referring to his son as ""somebody who abhors violence"".

AMSTERDAM/MADRID (Reuters) - Images of a white police officer kneeling on the neck of African-American George Floyd, who then died, have sparked protests from Amsterdam to Nairobi, but they also expose deeper grievances among demonstrators over strained race relations in their own countries.
With violent clashes between protesters and authorities raging in the United States, anti-police-brutality activists gathered by the thousands in support of the Black Lives Matter movement in various European and African cities.
Peaceful protesters highlighted allegations of abuse of black prisoners by their jailers, social and economic inequality, and institutional racism lingering from the colonial pasts of the Netherlands, Britain and France.
""If you want to believe that we in the Netherlands do not have a problem with race, you should go ahead and go home,"" Jennifer Tosch, founder of Black Heritage Amsterdam Tours, told a crowd in Amsterdam, from where the Dutch West India Company operated ships estimated to have traded 500,000 slaves in the 1600s and 1700s.
Tosch and others drew a comparison between Floyd's death and the treatment of slaves centuries ago. ""We have seen this image before as white persecutors and enslavers held down the enslaved and branded them with an iron.""
In London, a protester held a placard reading ""The UK isn't innocent,"" while in Berlin around 2,000 people protested outside the U.S. embassy and two Bundesliga soccer players wore “Justice for George Floyd” shirts on Monday.
A similar message came from Dominique Sopo, president of French NGO SOS Racisme, which organised a small protest outside the U.S. embassy in Paris on Monday.
""This issue of police racism is also, albeit with a lower level of violence, an issue that concerns France,"" he said.
Police in northern Paris fired tear gas on Tuesday to disperse demonstrators protesting over the 2016 death of a young black Frenchman in police custody - an incident that has drawn parallels with Floyd's killing.
Adama Traore's family have blamed excessive force used during his arrest, when the 24-year-old was pinned down by three gendarmes. Successive pathology reports have reached conflicting conclusions over whether his death two hours later resulted from asphyxiation or other factors including pre-existing conditions.
Amid a coronavirus lockdown, French activists also say there have been a number of police brutality cases in low-income neighbourhoods where many originate from Africa.
CLASHES IN TURKEY
In Istanbul, more than 50 people clashed with police officers minutes after beginning a protest over Floyd and what they called police brutality in Turkey. 
At least five people were detained after scuffles with officers holding shields, after which other protesters gave speeches denouncing lethal police force and bans on demonstrations in Turkey during the pandemic.
In Nairobi, protesters at the American embassy held signs reading “Black Lives Matter” and “Stop Extrajudicial Killings”.
Organiser Nafula Wafula said violence against blacks is international and cited the killing of prisoners in Kenya.
“The system that allows police brutality to happen in Kenya is based on class. In America, it’s race and class.” 
Protests are planned in coming days in Gambia, Britain, Spain and Portugal. 
In Spain, protesters will mark the death of Floyd and ""all sisters and brothers who have died at the hands of institutional racism on our streets,"" the African and Afro-descendant Community CNAAE said.
Portugal's gathering will address ""the myth that Portugal is not a racist country"".
But not all in Europe side with the protesters. 
Spain's far-right Vox party and the Netherlands' anti-Islam Freedom Party called those protesting Floyd's death ""terrorists"" and backed U.S. President Donald Trump. 
""Our support for Trump and the Americans who are seeing their Nation attacked by street terrorists backed by progressive millionaires,"" Vox wrote in a Tweet.
In the Netherlands, the Freedom Party's Geert Wilders tweeted: ""White House under attack. This is no protest but anarchy by #AntifaTerrorists.""
Even amid such racial division, Linda Nooitmeer, who heads the National Institute for the Study of Dutch Slavery and its Legacy, drew hope from Monday's protest in Amsterdam.

""We don't have the history of the civil rights movement in Holland, so what occurred yesterday was really something new. It is the start of real dialogue.""

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - African, Cuban and Haitian migrants stranded in Honduras after borders were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic began trekking northward on Tuesday in an attempt to reach the United States, migration authorities said. 
Young men and women carrying backpacks along with children wearing face masks walked along a highway in southern Honduras near Nicaragua, television images showed, although it was not clear how many people were in the group.
An activist in the town the group left from said 102 had started out in the morning, including a dozen Cubans. Lizandro Vallecillo, a spokesman for the national migration institute, said he counted 50 people from television images. 
Vallecillo said the migrants were among some 260 people in migrant shelters in the southern Honduras city of Choluteca since mid-March, when Honduras and neighboring El Salvador and Guatemala closed borders in an effort to contain the coronavirus.
""They were in Choluteca but decided to leave in a caravan. They are aiming to reach the border with Guatemala on the way to the United States,"" he said. 
Jimmy Aguilera, an activist with civil society group ACI-PARTICIPA in Choluteca said police had stopped them at a road block in a nearby town called El Marillal.
""They are asking to be given safe passage,"" he said. 
African, Haitian and Cuban migrants have been stranded at several points in Central America since the pandemic interrupted global mobility. 
In Panama, which currently has about 2,400 such migrants, 59 people at migrant shelters in the Darien province, on the edge of a remote jungle separating Panama and Colombia, tested positive for the coronavirus.
Honduras currently allows only cargo trucks in and out of the country. 

A curfew first imposed in March is still in place, as the country on Monday registered 5,362 total infections and 217 overall deaths.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean new women's minister has been forced to apologize and pull a controversial advertisement aimed at curbing an increase in domestic violence with the coronavirus pandemic. 
Macarena Santelices, a relative of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, was accused by women's rights groups of painting abusers in a sympathetic light through the short film, which was aired on government social media accounts. 
Lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the virus have brought an uptick in domestic violence around the world. 
In Chile, calls to emergency telephone hotlines for abuse victims have increased on average 60% since lockdowns were announced in March. 
The advertisement, launched by the National Women's Service which reports to the Women's Ministry, featured an old man telling his granddaughter he regretted abusing her grandmother after she revealed to him her boyfriend had beaten her. 
The minister said on Twitter on Monday night that she ""profoundly regretted"" its airing, adding ""an abuser never has an excuse."" 
The advertisement was the second to be scrapped in a week after criticism. The first was a short cartoon created by private charities with the endorsement of the Ministry of Social Development which showed a family comforting a father who flies into a rage while attempting to work from home.
Lorena Astudillo, spokesperson for the Chilean Network against Violence against Women, said the Chilean government appeared to be singing from an old hymn sheet.
""Our institutions have a habit of justifying, victimizing and trying to generate empathy for men who have been aggressors throughout their lives,"" Astudillo told Reuters. ""The tears of an aggressor do not save women's lives.""
Santelices, a former mayor with no track record on gender issues, was appointed after the previous incumbent quit in March. 

A militant member of the far-right Independent Democratic Union, she is the great-niece of former dictator Augusto Pinochet.

Couple Loreinis Hernandez and Sean Rafferty said Amar Cafe, which is operated out of two adjacent disused phone boxes in west London, was trading for just a week before the city shut down at the end of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We were so excited, you know, just starting this business, and then the lockdown came up,"" Hernandez said. ""We closed for six weeks.""
The easing of restrictions this week prompted them to reopen the cafe, which specialises in coffee from Hernandez's native Colombia.
""We invested everything in these boxes before lockdown,"" Rafferty said. 
""It was always going be takeaways and maybe it might be better now for us because people would prefer to be outside, sitting in the park.""

While stocks are good for a few weeks, at least, Rafferty and Hernandez are hopeful that the lockdown restrictions in the South American country do not prevent future deliveries.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Deysi Silva cannot see, hug or kiss her infant daughter. 
The child, born last month at a hospital in Colombia's capital Bogota amid the coronavirus pandemic, is hospitalized in a neo-natal unit where visits are forbidden to protect the vulnerable babies from possible infection.
But family members of newborns in the unit at Kennedy Hospital are speaking to their babies via hundreds of video calls organized by staff. 
""I love you so much daughter, hopefully soon we'll be together again. You know I love you so much, your dad does too,"" 30-year-old Silva, originally from Venezuela, said through tears as she looked at her daughter Deysi Mar Victoria's image.
Since the program started in mid-May, 143 families have made 260 video calls to children in intensive care, Bogota's health secretary said. Hospitals around the world have separated newborns from their mothers in an effort to prevent spreading the virus, especially when mothers are suspected of having the illness.
Social workers - who coordinate the calls and hold tablets up to the incubators - are key.
""My job during the virtual visits is to connect the mothers to their children via the tablet. I go into the unit and put the infants on the screen so the mom can see them live and talk to and listen to them,"" said social worker Maria Nubia Arboleda.
The calls will help parents bond with their infants despite the physical distance, hospital official Mirella Pena said.
""In the case of newborns, video calls help strengthen the parents' bond with their babies,"" Pena said, adding that the communication also help reassure worried parents.
Colombia, which is holding a months-long quarantine to combat coronavirus infections, has nearly 30,500 confirmed cases of the virus and close to 1,000 deaths.

The apparent massacre of the youths, whose remains are still being searched for, is widely believed to have been committed by corrupt police working with a violent drug gang, and has drawn international outrage.
Lopez Obrador, who came into power in 2018, has vowed to uncover what really happened and examine the prior handling of the case, which led to one of the worst crises of his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto's administration. 
Independent experts appointed by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had previously said they could not advance without investigating military officials who were at the site of the students' disappearance in Guerrero state. 
When asked at his daily news conference if the consultants had been allowed to interrogate the military, Lopez Obrador said they had ""no limit."" 
""The defense ministry is providing information, facilitating investigations to arrive at the truth,"" he said. 
Pena Nieto's administration had said a local drug gang mistook the students for members of a rival group and killed them. But only one victim's remains were ever definitively identified, and independent experts picked holes in the official version of events. 
""This is a thorn in our side,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""It is something that hurts Mexico and cannot be forgotten. The so-called pact of silence is not going to work.""
He also said prosecutors have issued arrest orders for officials involved in the case, but did not provide details.
The attorney general's office did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

In March, Mexico asked Interpol to issue a red notice calling for the arrest of Tomas Zeron, a former official who has been accused by experts and parents of the victims of manipulating the probe. He has denied wrongdoing.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norway, which chairs a group of international donors to the Palestinians, urged Israel on Tuesday not to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. 
Norway heads the Ad Hoc Liaison Committee (AHLC), which met on Tuesday to discuss Israel's plan to extend its sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, occupied territory that Palestinians seek for a state. 
""Any unilateral step would be detrimental to the (peace) process, and annexation would be in direct violation and contravention of international law,"" Foreign Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide told Reuters after the meeting.
Norway helped to broker the 1993 and 1995 Oslo Accords, which provided for interim and limited Palestinian self-rule in the occupied territories, and initiated a now-moribund long-term peace process.
Soereide said she had spoken on Tuesday with her Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, to urge Israel to resume direct talks with the Palestinians and avoid unilateral moves. 
""It would undermine the potential for a two-state solution,"" she said.
The AHLC meeting also urged donors to fulfil their financial commitments to the Palestinian Authority and the United Nations' Palestinian aid agency to help fight the spread of the new coronavirus. 
West Bank health authorities reported 388 cases of coronavirus with two deaths as of Monday, while in Gaza, 61 cases and one death were registered. 
Soereide praised cooperation between Israel and the Palestinians on the issue, as well as between the Palestinians and the United Nations, but cautioned that a lack of testing meant the numbers could be higher.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi got an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump to attend the next Group of Seven summit, India's Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Tuesday.
Over a telephone call, Modi told Trump that New Delhi would be happy to work with the United States and other countries to ensure the success of the next G7 summit, it said in a statement.
Trump said on Saturday he was postponing until September the summit that had been scheduled for late June in Camp David, the U.S. president's country retreat, and that he wanted to invite Australia, Russia, South Korea and India to the meeting. 
Trump conveyed his desire to expand participation beyond the members of the group of the world's most advanced economies. 
""In this context, he extended an invitation to Prime Minister Modi to attend the next G7 Summit to be held in USA,"" the ministry said.
The leaders exchanged views on COVID-19 situation in the two countries, the India-China standoff at the border, and the need for reforms in the World Health Organisation, it added.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior congressional leader have reprimanded China for bullying behaviour towards India during a military standoff on their disputed border. 
During the call, Trump recalled his visit to India in February. Modi said the historic visit had added new dynamism to the bilateral relationship.

LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of British lawmakers spent over an hour in kilometer-long queues through the ostentatious corridors and halls of the Palace of Westminster on Tuesday, casting their first ever socially-distanced votes.
The government has ditched the coronavirus-induced measures introduced in April and May that tore up centuries of tradition by allowing remote voting and debates by video conference.
On Tuesday, lawmakers were required to attend in person and join a queue, spaced two metres (6.6 feet) apart, that stretched out of the wood-panelled debating chamber, zigzagged through an 11th-century hall where monarchs and prime ministers have lain in state, and outside into a tree-lined courtyard.
They voted 261-163 in favour of the government's plan to end the so-called hybrid parliament and restore a system that requires all those who wish to vote to attend in person. 
""Voting while enjoying a sunny walk or whilst watching television does democracy an injustice...We ask members to vote in person for a reason: because it is the heart of what parliament is about,"" House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said.
Unless a better method can be found, every vote will now involve the long queues that critics dismissed as a farce, and some on Twitter dubbed the #ReesMoggConga.
The first vote that rejected keeping the hybrid arrangements took 46 minutes, slowed down by many lawmakers being uncertain what to do when they reached the front of the queue. A second vote to approve the government plan took 36 minutes.
""A total farce ... This is supposed to be a functioning parliamentary democracy, not a theme park,"" opposition Labour lawmaker Afzal Khan said on Twitter.
Parliament speaker Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Hoyle directed proceedings with growing frustration, instructing each lawmaker to state their name and their vote as they passed his chair.
Normally lawmakers vote by walking through crowded lobbies and having their names ticked off a list in a process that takes about 15 minutes. That has been ruled unsafe - a risk of coronavirus contagion. 
Many, including a group of rebels in the governing Conservative Party, objected to the decision to end flexible working arrangements. They said it disenfranchised those who are unable to attend parliament.

Rees-Mogg argued the hybrid system was too slow at processing legislation and nullified the cut and thrust of the adversarial debating chamber.

A robotic trio of waiters named Amy, Aker and James roll back and forth from the bar at the Asian fusion restaurant, handing out drinks -- and lessening the number of trips that human staff need to make through the restaurant.
Each robot has a simple humanoid figure, including arms to hold serving trays. Simple displays on their faces shows a smile, or occasionally a frown.
The service can be a bit stiff.
""Hi, here is your order. Please take it away from the tray. I will go back automatically in 20 seconds"", Amy informs a pair of women seated at a booth, after presenting them with two glasses of ice tea. 
Customers must pick up their own drinks.
Though robotic servers were introduced in China several years ago and have since become a novelty at restaurants around the world, only a handful of Dutch eateries have so far introduced them. 
For now, Dadawan's robo-service is limited to drink delivery, but the owner hopes to quickly widen their repertoire.
Restaurant representative Paul Seijben said waiters' jobs are not threatened by the newcomers.
""Our team is actually really happy with the robots"", Seijben said. 
Staff, who wear face masks, load drinks onto the trays, press a table number, then stand back as the robot rolls away.
Restaurants in the Netherlands were closed from mid-March to June 1 for everything but take out and delivery. Since Monday, restaurants have been allowed to receive up to 30 people with a minimum distance of 1.5 metres (5 ft) between tables. Diners must make an appointment in advance.

Cubans turn to barter as shortages worsen,"HAVANA (Reuters) - Nelson Aguilar used to sell the rabbits that he raises on his Havana rooftop to restaurants. Now, with an ongoing pandemic, the 70-year-old uses them as currency, exchanging them for food or detergent to avoid multi-hour queues at poorly stocked shops. 
He's not alone. More Cubans are turning to bartering to meet their shopping needs, be it in person or on social media groups, as the novel coronavirus crisis worsens existing shortages of basic goods in the Communist-run island.
""Since they closed all the restaurants ... I now raise them to eat and to exchange,"" Aguilar said, in front of row after row of caged white rabbits. 
""I exchanged rabbit for detergent or example, because I don't like these queues,"" he said, adding, ""So far, I haven't done even one (queue).""
Shoppers had already faced long lines for some staple goods over the last year-and-a-half as Cuba’s economic situation worsened with the implosion of ally Venezuela and amid tougher U.S. sanctions under President Donald Trump.
Now, the pandemic has halted tourism, slowed remittances and raised shipping costs, plunging Cuba into its worst economic crisis since the fall of its former benefactor, the Soviet Union, in the 1990s.
Cubans are not new to bartering. During the patronage of the Soviet Union, Cubans would swap local rum for Soviet tinned products from merchant sailors. And during the 1990s depression, farmers exchanged fruit and vegetables for city dwellers' manufactured goods. 
While the government, which appears to have contained the country's virus outbreak, has added more items to Cubans' ration cards, this still does not cover all their needs.
Some Cubans, clad in face masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus, camp out overnight in front of shops to be first in line when they open. Others buy on the state retail monopoly's new website whenever items appear, but it is often empty.
""Given money is of no use at the moment, I'm going to put in practise barter - I have 100 liter black bin bags, toilet paper and potatoes in exchange for milk and flour,"" a participant wrote on a WhatsApp group originally meant for selling items.
Lenin Damián, who raises chickens and rabbits on his rooftop just east of Havana, usually keeps them for his own family. But these days, he uses them in barter swaps with his neighbors.

""Here, there are people who buy oil but they can't get meat,"" he said. ""So instead of buying (oil) in the shop, I barter it for rabbit meat.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is soaring in the polls amid widespread approval of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic but has little chance of cashing in soon on his popularity with voters, insiders and analysts say.
Trudeau - working with powerful Conservative provincial premiers who usually oppose him - avoided a U.S.-style battle over how to tackle the outbreak, in part by promising hundreds of billions in spending.
But six sources within the federal and provincial governments with direct knowledge of bilateral relations say the consensus between Ottawa and the regions is starting to fray as they begin to reopen for business and a possible ""second wave"" of contagion looms.
Ottawa is already on track to spend C$300 billion, or 15% of gross domestic product, on wage subsidies, monthly income support for the jobless, and other measures meant to help bridge the crisis. 
""I heard from a federal official that... they are terrified of the second wave because they will be out of money to give away,"" said a provincial source familiar with communications between the two levels of government.
The heavily indebted provinces have more trouble raising money than the federal government and will need the taps left open if there is another round of lockdowns, said a source in a second province.   
It is unclear if the government has budgeted for this eventuality. A spokeswoman for Finance Minister Bill Morneau, when asked how much cash would be available, said Ottawa ""will continue to constantly monitor economic developments and take appropriate action.""
Trudeau's Liberals, who barely held onto power in an election last October, would crush their federal Conservative Party rivals if another vote were held now, several polls show.
An Angus Reid poll published on June 1 put the Liberals at 37%, a 6 percentage point lead over the Conservatives.
NO SNAP ELECTION
Trudeau now has a minority government and depends on opposition parties to pass legislation. But with more than three years left in his mandate, ""the last thing anyone is thinking about"" is an early election, a senior government official said. 
The reason a snap election is unlikely is that the Liberals would be seen as taking advantage of a crisis, Ekos pollster Frank Graves said.
""The public would be very angry at the idea that we need an election right now,"" said Graves, who added the Liberal bounce is ephemeral because the longer the crisis goes on the more public unhappiness will mount.
Indeed, some Liberals are concerned the 48-year-old Trudeau, a progressive leader viewed as a counterweight to U.S. President Donald Trump, will never be able to cash in on his windfall in the polls.
""If this (outbreak) continues for two years, people are going to be so fed they up they might be looking for a real change,"" said a senior Liberal advisor.
For now, the new political dynamic has served Trudeau well. As the premiers delivered the bad news on social restrictions and shutting down businesses, Trudeau made announcements about federal help and funding. 
""He doesn't wear the hard decisions but he also gets to be something of a savior,"" said the first provincial source, predicting there was little chance the new-found camaraderie would be permanent.
The same source noted that premiers were irritated by Ottawa's refusal to give them advance warning of announcements. Canada's 13 provinces and territories have already begun to loosen quarantine restrictions as Trudeau has repeatedly cautioned against lifting them prematurely. 
""Where the risk lies is what happens after the immediate coming weeks and months,"" said the second provincial source.

""Over the years, there has been a real commitment to shine a bright light on human rights in China and to say to those who are affected by that, 'you are not alone,'"" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a signing ceremony for the legislation.
The Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate passed legislation nearly unanimously calling for sanctions against those responsible for repression in China's Xinjiang province, after U.N. estimates that over 1 million Muslims have been detained.
The bill singles out the region's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, a member of China's ruling Politburo, as responsible for ""gross human rights violations"" against Muslims.
""This is a genocide. More than a million people are in concentration camps. Millions more are harassed every day,"" said Republican Representative Chris Smith, a lead supporter of the legislation.
China denies mistreatment.
Sending the bill to the White House starts a 10-day clock, minus Sundays, for Trump to sign the bill into law or veto it. Otherwise, it becomes law without his signature.
Trump has not disclosed his plans. White House aides did not respond to requests for comment.
Relations between Washington and Beijing have become increasingly tense as Trump has blamed China for worsening the coronavirus pandemic. His administration also recently moved toward ending special treatment for Hong Kong.
The bill also calls on U.S. companies operating in Xinjiang to ensure their products do not include parts using forced labor.

The House vote on the bill was the first use of proxy voting because of the pandemic. Republicans have sued to prevent it, complicating questions about the legislation's fate.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Genetic sampling of the Dead Sea Scrolls has tested understandings that the 2,000-year-old artefacts were the work of a fringe Jewish sect, and shed light on the drafting of scripture around the time of Christianity's birth.
The research - which indicated some of the parchments' provenances by identifying animal hides used - may also help safeguard against forgeries of the prized biblical relics.
The Dead Sea Scrolls, a collection of hundreds of manuscripts and thousands of fragments of ancient Jewish religious texts, were discovered in 1947 by local Bedouin in the cave-riddled desert crags of Qumran, some 20 km (12 miles) east of Jerusalem.
Many scholars believed the scrolls originated with the reclusive Essenes, who had broken away from the Jewish mainstream. But some academics argue the Qumran trove had various authors and may have been brought from Jerusalem for safekeeping.
DNA sequencing conducted by Tel Aviv University and the Israel Antiquities Authority has allowed for finer matching or differentiation among the scrolls.
While the sheepskin of some of the scrolls could be produced in the desert, cowskin - found in at least two samples - was more typical of cities like Jerusalem, where Jews, at the time, had their second temple and were under Roman rule.
""The very material, the biological material of which the scrolls are made, is as telling and as informative as the content of the text,"" Noam Mizrahi, Bible studies professor at Tel Aviv University, told Reuters.
The Israeli researchers, assisted by a Swedish DNA lab, determined that two textually different copies of the Book of Jeremiah were brought to Qumran from the outside.
Such findings, the researchers say, indicate that the wording of Jewish texts was subject to variation and interpretation - contrary to later views of holy writ as fixed. 
The lesson, Mizrahi said, is that ""Second Temple Jewish society was much more plural and multifaceted than many of us tend to think"". 
Tiny slivers of parchment - or just dust - were taken for testing. The process could prove a godsend for spotting counterfeits, such as five supposed Dead Sea Scrolls that were removed from the Museum of the Bible in Washington in 2018.

""Since we can distinguish scrolls that originated from Qumran from other scrolls, we think that maybe in the future it could help identify real versus false scroll pieces,” said Oded Rechavi, neurobiology professor at Tel Aviv University.

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has suspended his decision to scrap a two-decade-old troop deployment agreement with the United States due to political and other developments in the region, his foreign minister said on Tuesday, 
The termination of the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), which is central to one of Washington's most important alliances in Asia, was due to take effect in August and was Duterte's biggest move yet towards delivering on longstanding threats to downgrade ties with the Philippines' former colonial ruler. 
Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin said the news that the Philippines was no longer abandoning the pact was well received by the United States.
The mercurial Duterte, known for his stinging rebukes of Western powers, has clashed with Washington over numerous issues and has been open about his disdain for his country's most important diplomatic ally and main provider of military hardware and training.
His embrace of historic rival China, a country deeply mistrusted by his U.S.-allied defence apparatus, has attracted considerable criticism, with opponents accusing him of gambling with sovereignty in pursuit of massive investments that have not materialized.
The VFA provides the legal framework for which U.S. troops can operate on a rotational basis in the Philippines and experts say without it, their other bilateral defence agreements cannot be implemented.
Duterte pulled the plug on the VFA on Feb. 11 in an angry response to the revocation of a U.S. visa held by a former police chief-turned-senator who led his war on drugs. 
The official reason for Duterte's withdrawal was to enable the Philippines to diversify its foreign relations. 
The U.S. Embassy in Manila welcomed the suspension.
""Our long-standing alliance has benefited both countries, and we look forward to continued close security and defense cooperation with the Philippines,"" it said.
Critics had said the suspension was a knee-jerk reaction that would weaken the Philippine military, denying it access to scores of annual training exercises, including expertise in tackling Islamist militants, natural disasters and maritime threats. 

The official notice of the suspension said the decision was taken ""in light of political and other developments in the region"". It did not specify what those were.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Dirce Villas Boas, a 93-year-old resident of a nursing home in western Sao Paulo, had gone 70 days without seeing her daughter until this weekend, when the pair hugged and danced together in an emotional reunion.
The new coronavirus pandemic has yet to reach its peak in Sao Paulo, the site of the worst outbreak in Brazil, where nearly 30,000 people have lost their lives to the virus. 
But thanks to the ingenuity of local businessman Bruno Zani, Villas Boas and her daughter Dircyree were able to embrace again. The two were separated by a translucent plastic curtain outfitted with holes for Dircyree's arms, which were also wrapped in protective equipment. 
The pair did not seem to mind.
""When you think about the feeling of a mother hugging her daughter, the heart beats, it really beats,"" said Dirce.
Zani, who produced the curtain, makes a living in the party-decoration business, which has all but ceased in the pandemic. He typically donates flowers from the parties to nursing homes, where he noticed residents now have few chances to see family.
After talking with psychologists, therapists and other specialists, Zani tried a pilot program with the plastic curtain at one nursing home, and he plans to offer them in nursing homes throughout the city.

""The starting point was the heart itself,"" Zani said, ""seeing that difficulty of a family member and a confined (loved one) not being able to meet.""

1260,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>","EU eyes overhaul of pharma rules to tackle vaccine, antibiotic shortages","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission on Tuesday started a process that could lead to reforms of drug manufacturing to limit shortages of vaccines and antibiotics and make medicines more easily available.
The move comes as the European Union continues to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, an effort that has exposed some healthcare shortcomings and the bloc's dependence on foreign supplies of essential drugs and chemicals, mostly from India and China.
""The unprecedented coronavirus pandemic clearly demonstrates the need to modernise the way the EU ensures access to medicines for its population,"" an EU Commission document said on Tuesday, listing shortages and unequal access to medicines as the main issues to address.
The document seeks feedback from the public on possible reforms of rules on clinical trials, marketing of medicines and their production and distribution in Europe.
The 27-nation bloc has long experienced shortages of medicines, and the COVID-19 crisis worsened its predicament as global supply chains were disrupted while supplier countries temporarily curbed exports of some drugs.
Antibiotics, cancer medicines and vaccines are cited in the document as essential items which are often in short supply in Europe, a problem likely to worsen as the bloc has insufficient lab capacity to produce the huge amounts of vaccine doses that will be needed if a COVID-19 shot is developed.
The overhaul, whose details are due by the end of the year, will review incentives and requirements for pharmaceutical companies to place new drugs on the market and ensure their supply. Brussels proposed last week a budget of 9.4 billion euros ($10.5 billion) until 2027 to underpin these reforms [nL8N2D9444].
Among possible changes, information on medicines could be increasingly provided online or on multilingual packs to address bottlenecks in their distribution. The EU could also try to curb differences in drug prices, which are set at national level.

MINSK (Reuters) - In the Belarusian capital Minsk, a long queue formed outside a covered food market on Sunday as people waited for hours to give their signature to opposition candidates contesting a presidential election in August.
Some carried a slipper, the symbol of a protest movement against President Alexander Lukashenko, comparing him to a cockroach character from a children's fairytale book that they want to squash.
Such queues are increasingly familiar across Belarus and Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm boss who has tolerated little opposition since taking office in 1994, faces his biggest political challenge in years.
Police have arrested two of his opponents in recent days, but repeating previous crackdowns on dissent could damage his efforts to improve ties with the West at a time when he is distancing the country from Russia, its traditional patron.
Russia and Belarus, a former Soviet republic of 9.5 million strategically placed between Russia and European Union member state Poland, have a long-standing union treaty.
But Lukashenko has publicly dismissed Moscow's push for tighter integration as a backdoor annexation, and Russia has cut oil supplies and subsidies that have propped up his rule. 
Public frustration with Lukashenko's handling of the coronavirus pandemic has combined with grievances about the economy and human rights, reinvigorating opposition to his rule.
To challenge him on Aug. 9, candidates need the signatures of 100,000 voters. In Minsk on Sunday, many stood in a line stretching back about 1 km (0.6 mile) to sign up for multiple candidates. 
""I would like this action to show that a huge number of people are unhappy with what is happening in the country, are ready to take to the streets and show the authorities that the time has come for change,"" said Semyon, an engineer. 
Lukashenko compared opposition supporters to criminal gangs on Monday and accused them of fomenting unrest akin to the 2014 Maidan protests that toppled Ukraine's Moscow-backed president. 
""I want to warn you and everyone who is listening to us that there will be no Maidan in Belarus,"" he said. 
The wife of a blogger, Syarhei Tsikhanouski, is standing as a candidate after her husband was barred from registering. Tsikhanouski was arrested at a protest on Friday.
Viktor Babariko, former head of the local unit of Russia's Gazprombank, has secured 85,000 signatures.
Belarusians are tired of the lack of change, Babariko told Reuters, despite Lukashenko's efforts to cast himself as a guarantor of stability.
""Everyone understands that our notorious stability is no longer stability,"" Babariko said. ""This stability is like that of a cemetery."" 
""The behaviour of the authorities during the coronavirus pandemic period was the last trigger that showed complete disrespect,"" he said.
RISKS OF GOING TOO FAR
Lukashenko, 65, resisted calls for a lockdown or social distancing measures, and suggested remedies such as vodka or saunas. 
Belarus had 44,255 official coronavirus cases and 243 deaths as of Tuesday. 
""The authorities have enough brute force, but Lukashenko certainly does not want to go too far. He needs to somehow sell these elections to the West,"" said political analyst Alexander Klaskovsky. 
""But if serious protests ensue, Lukashenko has repeatedly shown that as soon as he feels a real threat to his power, he does not stand on ceremony and thinks least of all about the international image, because power is everything for him.""
A crackdown on protests a decade ago over alleged election rigging prompted U.S. and EU sanctions. Sanctions now would risk Lukashenko drifting back to Russia.

""For the West, Belarusian independence from Russia is now more important than the problem of human rights,"" political analyst Valery Karbalevich said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - With fuel for decades the cheapest in the world and gas-guzzling vehicles a sign of status, few Venezuelans could be bothered to jump on a bicycle. 
But as chronic fuel shortages become the latest manifestation of an agonizing, six-year economic crisis, many are dusting down old bikes and taking to the streets on two wheels out of sheer necessity. 
Once-quiet bicycle workshops are humming with new trade: a rare boom for this small sector during the otherwise paralyzing impact of Venezuela's coronavirus lockdown. 
Veterinarian Pedro Villegas took his two-decade-old bike for a tune-up and now happily uses it for his half-hour daily ride to the office in Caracas, including partly on a motorway.
""I started using it little-by-little, because I am over 50 and I had to improve my lung capacity,"" he said. 
Pepe Segura, 74, owner of a bicycle workshop in an affluent area of eastern Caracas, now arrives at 6 a.m. each morning to begin working on the burgeoning list of orders. 
""I have four times more work,"" he said.
While bicycle use has increased in other nations this year for exercise, environmental and health reasons during the coronavirus crisis, in Venezuela the main factor has been the fuel crisis. 
Despite having the world's largest crude reserves, Venezuela's refineries are nearly paralyzed due to years of under-investment. U.S. sanctions, meant to force President Nicolas Maduro from office, have snarled fuel imports.
Since March, motorists have been spending as long as three days in lines at military-controlled gas stations - though recent shipments from Iran may give some relief.
After decades of selling fuel so heavily subsidized it was almost free, the government this week created a new system under which drivers can buy 120 liters per month (31.7 gallons) of subsidized fuel for around $0.02 per liter.
Above that, they have to pay $0.50 per liter.
PRICED OUT
At the latter price, a month of minimum wage salary would buy only six liters (1.6 gallons) of gasoline, about 10 percent of the tank of a typical sedan.
""If I drive five kilometers with my car, I consume a liter of gasoline. I've got to ration it,"" said Jorge Ramirez, 54, an accountant, who now travels short distances on an old bicycle he found in his home.
Many Venezuelans say the COVID-19 pandemic, with only about 1,500 cases reported, causes them less stress than lack of fuel.
""I had to come up with something so that I could keep taking care of my patients, so I bought a used bicycle,"" said pediatrician Alejandro Crespo, who rides half an hour up a hill to his office in Maracay, a city west of Caracas.
Before that, Crespo never had the day or longer required to wait in a special line at the single Maracay service station designated for doctors and nurses to buy 20 liters a time. 
Mechanics say they mostly sell patches and new tires, to get old punctured bikes back on roads. 
A basic tune-up costs between $7 and $20, less than a tank of gas under the new pricing system.
Used bikes sell for between $150 and $300 in stores and websites, but they are scarce. Most shops had stopped importing new bikes amid the economic crisis due to lack of demand.
Increased home delivery during the lockdown has been another factor behind seeing more bicycles on streets where the car had always been king and bike lanes are virtually non-existent.
Mechanic Juan Alvarez, who this year began repairing bicycles in clients' homes, says most bikes he sees have been sitting for years. ""Things have gone much better for me because of the lack of gasoline,"" mused Alvarez before setting off on a job on his own two wheels.

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and a senior congressional leader have reprimanded China for bullying behaviour towards India during a military standoff on their disputed border.
Thousands of Indian and Chinese troops have faced each other for weeks at three or four locations in the western Himalayas after Beijing's forces intruded into Indian territory, according to Indian security officials and local media. 
China denies it breached the ""Line of Actual Control"", as the 3,488 km de facto border is known, and says there is stability in the area near the Galwan River and Pangong Tso lake in the remote snow deserts of India's Ladakh region.
In comments released by the State Department, Pompeo told the American Enterprise Institute thinktank that China's moving of troops to the line of control echoed similarly heavy-handed behaviour over the coronavirus, South China Sea and Hong Kong.
""These are the kinds of actions that authoritarian regimes take,"" he said.
One possible trigger for frictions is India's construction of a road near the Galwan valley to narrow the gap with China's superior network of roads that it built years ago, Indian and foreign military experts say. China is opposed to any Indian construction in the area, saying it is disputed territory. 
The chairman of the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Eliot Engel, said China should respect norms and use diplomacy to settle the border issue with India. 
""I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control,"" he said.
""China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbours rather than resolve conflicts according to international law,"" he added in a statement on Monday.
Soldiers are billeted in tents and both sides have brought in artillery and other heavy equipment to back them up, Indian officials said. India has also started construction of an emergency landing strip near the main highway of Kashmir which adjoins Ladakh.
Konchok Stanzin, a resident of Lukung village on the Indian side, about 40 kilometres from the border, said thousands of Indian troops had arrived in the last week alone. 

""There is panic in the village as the area has never seen such a military buildup,"" he said.

With more than 233,000 confirmed cases, Italy is one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic and the government only recently decided to gradually lift draconian restrictions it had imposed in early March to rein in contagion. 
The demonstration was organized by the right-wing League, the far-right Brothers of Italy and the centre-right ""Go Italy"" parties to protest against the coalition government led by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
Live streaming on social media showed protesters marching next to each other with a large Italian flag along Via del Corso, leading to the Piazza del Popolo in Rome's historic centre. 
Some protesters were not wearing face masks, made compulsory in Italy when sufficient distancing between people is not possible.
League leader Matteo Salvini took selfies with supporters and spoke to reporters wearing an Italian flag-coloured face mask under his chin, images showed.
""I've have got a mask but experts say that the virus is dying,"" Salvini said, referring to recent declarations by Italian professors that the coronavirus is losing its potency.
The demonstration was staged to coincide with celebrations for June 2, a public holiday, commemorating the vote in favour of the creation of a Republic after the Second World War. 
The opposition rally took place as Head of State Sergio Mattarella visited Codogno, a small town in the north of Italy, home to the country's first coronavirus patient and symbol of the emergency which has cost almost 33,500 lives so far. 
""(Today) we celebrate what holds our country together: its moral strength. From here is where we want to start again,"" Mattarella said.

1269,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 09:22AM ET</span>","Special Report: U.S. school closures dramatically shrinking public education, Reuters finds","By M.B. Pell, Kristina Cooke and Benjamin Lesser
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jennifer Panditaratne’s third-grade daughter had been seeing a reading specialist once a week before her Florida school closed abruptly in March due to the novel coronavirus.
Since then, her child has had no contact with the specialist. Panditaratne is left to download her daughter’s special education material and sit with her as she does her school work—in between her own calls as a maritime lawyer in South Florida.
“Is it the same material? Sure,” she said. “But is it being administered by a professional who knows what they are doing? No.”
More than two months after schools across the United States began closing in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus, the shutdown is taking a profound toll on the nation’s system of education, Reuters found by surveying nearly 60 school districts serving some 2.8 million students.
Almost overnight, public education in the United States has shrunk to a shell of its former self, the review found, with teacher instruction, grading, attendance, special education and meal services for hungry children slashed back or gutted altogether.
The survey encompassed school districts from large urban communities, such as Miami-Dade County Public Schools and the Houston Independent School District, to the smallest rural settings, including San Jon Municipal Schools in eastern New Mexico and Park County School District 6 in Cody, Wyoming. The survey reflects what is happening only in those districts that responded.
Reuters found:
- A large majority of responding districts, 47 of 57, reported they are providing elementary and middle school students with half or less the usual face time with teachers. Eight of those districts said students receive little to no direct instruction. In Philadelphia, tens of thousands of elementary and middle school pupils receive little to no live instruction—and high schoolers receive none at all.
- Fewer than half of districts even take attendance, and many of those that do say fewer kids are showing up for class. Riverbank Unified School District in Stanislaus County, California, no longer takes attendance. But educators there learned through Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Classroom and phone calls that only about half of their 3,000 students are participating in virtual school and completing assignments.
- Public schools play a crucial role in feeding America’s poor children—but the lockdown is gutting that role. About three-quarters of districts reported they served a cumulative 4.5 million fewer meals a week. In Washoe County, Nevada, the school district provided 251,000 meals a week before the shutdown. Since then: Just over 39,000 a week.
- About a third of districts aren't providing federally required services to their special needs students, such as physical and occupational therapy, like they did before schools were closed. “One of the many things keeping me up at night is, how are we providing education to those who most need it?” asked Michael Lubelfeld, superintendent of the North Shore School District 112 outside Chicago.
In the School District of Philadelphia, superintendent William Hite already sees young children falling behind, including those missing critical face-to-face teacher time through the district’s early literacy program. For older students, he worries that the loss of the school structure’s safety net could lead to delinquency and crime.
“This is in no way a sufficient replacement of teacher instruction of students in classrooms,” Hite said. “I think the impact has already been felt here.”
Several education researchers who reviewed the survey results said that, if anything, the responses likely represent a rosy picture of what is actually happening in the nation’s schools.
Betheny Gross, associate director at the Center on Reinventing Public Education at the University of Washington, believes the results reflected more “optimism” than may be warranted. “This is reflective of what superintendents think is happening,” Gross said, while the reality may actually be worse.
Gross cited the high percentage, 84%, of districts reporting that at least some students are still receiving at least some live instruction. She said her own review of material posted online detailing what administrators across the country expected instruction to look like during the closure revealed that only a “small share” of districts were setting a standard that included live instruction.
While few children have died from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and serious complications for them have been rare, public officials shut down schools to prevent the disease from spreading. Nineteen children under the age of 14 died from COVID-19 from February 1 through May 23, estimates the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a figure hovering just above 0% of all U.S. virus deaths.
Data on how school closures affect the disease’s spread in the community is limited because the pandemic is still under way. But researchers at University College London found evidence from past epidemics, previous research and modeling of coronavirus transmission in other countries that closing schools has only a slight impact on preventing contagion.
To be sure, public schools, like businesses and governments, were forced into a sudden new world with the pandemic’s spread.
Teachers, parents, researchers and district administrators told Reuters that while distance learning can improve, for the vast majority of students it will fall far short of in-person instruction. If students are not in front of teachers next school year, the public should expect only a fraction of the live instruction, special needs services going unfulfilled and far fewer meals served.
“I just don’t know how we call off school next year,” said Gregory Cizek, who studies education at the University of North Carolina.
For students, parents and educators, the Reuters survey shows, the loss of live instruction has been significant.
LIMITED HOME RESOURCES
Eliza McCord, 16, wasn’t able to participate in her math class for the first six weeks after her Fort Wayne, Indiana, high school went virtual, because her sister had a college class at the same time. Inside their home, there weren’t enough devices to go around.
Even now, her family writes a class schedule on a white board. Also in the rotation for devices and WiFi: Her mother, an elementary school special education teacher; her father, a librarian; and her younger brother, in sixth grade.
Many of Eliza’s classmates have told her they don’t have regular access to a computer to download files, or reliable access to the Internet to join Zoom calls. That said, Eliza thinks some students are not participating because their grades for the final quarter of the year don’t count.
“There are students who just have essentially given up on the rest of the school year,” she said.
Charles Cammack, chief operations officer for Fort Wayne Community Schools, said the majority of students remained engaged after schools were closed. Still, he acknowledged that after the system announced grades would not count for the fourth marking period, some students checked out.
“It would be naïve to say we didn’t know there was a risk some kids would take that position, but given the circumstances I don’t know how we could avoid that happening,” he said.
Special education services such as occupational and physical therapy are challenging to provide remotely, and some services can only be provided face-to-face, survey respondents said.
Schools also rely heavily on parental support. “For any therapy, the parents will need to follow the instructions of the teacher to complete the exercises with the students,” said Dr. Jason Lind, superintendent at Millburn School District 24 in Illinois. “This works well if parents have time to spend helping their children. If parents are also working full-time, this does not work.""
When Fort Wayne’s public school district shut down, Eliza’s mother, special-ed teacher Dawn Cortner-McCord, called the parents of her students. She gave them her personal cell number, and talks with about a third of her students daily, dropping off books and other learning materials at their homes.
But talking on the cell phone is no match for in-class teaching, Dawn said. She cited the example of twin third-grade girls who do math at a first-grade level and had been making progress with hands-on learning. Now she worries they, and other students, are falling back.
""We are just trying to maintain the skills that they have,” she said. “A lot of my students still need that sensory input.”
In Broward County Public Schools in Florida, where Jennifer Panditaratne’s daughter has not seen a reading specialist since schools closed, the district found not all teacher engagement is equal. Panditaratne said her third-grade daughter has a daily 15 minute group Zoom call with her class teacher, going over assignments for the day. Her daughter in fifth grade is getting more live video instruction, but it varies by teacher.
In March, the teacher’s union and district agreed teachers would provide at least three hours a day of deep engagement with students. Many teachers conducted live video instruction, while others used email, phone calls or discussion boards, said Daniel Gohl, the district’s chief academic officer. That left a sense of inequity. So starting this summer, all teachers will provide at least three hours of live-video instruction daily.
“We now know students and teachers need to see and talk to each other,” Gohl said. “We acknowledge we did not get everything right and we are committed to improving.”
MISSING MEALS
By law, U.S. public school districts are required to provide free or reduced-cost meals to children in need. With schools shut, getting those vital meals to the qualifying students has been hindered, in several instances, by significant hurdles.
Despite school districts’ efforts, Reuters found children are missing school meals they should have received. Thirty-four districts, or about three-quarters of those that responded, said they were providing fewer meals a week than before the closure, the Reuters survey found.
Miami-Dade County Public schools provided 1.33 million free breakfasts, lunches and after-school meals a week to its students prior to the March 16 closure. As of May 1, the district said it was serving less than one-third of that number, about 420,000 meals a week.
One reason, according to four parents in the county, was that the district made meals available, but limited pickup to twice a week, leading to long lines. Another roadblock: Lack of transportation to reach the pickup locations. Three of the parents said they were forced to find other sources of food, such as a food bank or a state-funded lunch program.
Victoria Lynn Dennis, a 29-year-old customer service agent in Miami, said she hasn’t been able to access school meals for her 5-year-old pre-kindergartner and 6-year-old kindergartner because she doesn’t have a car. A week after the schools closed, someone from a nonprofit program that partners with the district came to her door with macaroni and cheese. There have been no visits since.
“Telling my kids they can’t eat as much, because we have to save it, it kills me,” she said.
Penny Parham, the food and nutrition officer for Miami-Dade schools, said her heart goes out to the students they aren’t serving. But while they are serving many students, the system can feed more young people in school cafeterias than in the district’s 50 remote distribution sites. As unemployment rises in Florida, she’s seen the lines at these sites grow longer.

BUDGET DEFICITS, QUESTIONS LOOM
As they look ahead, nearly 70% of districts told Reuters they face a budget deficit. The total shortfall of these districts alone exceeds $450 million.
Philadelphia already faces a $38 million deficit, even after receiving federal assistance. With local revenue plummeting, that number could expand in the weeks to come.
Many school districts are now confronting a question most on the minds of parents: Will they reopen schools in the fall, or continue the distance learning?
Dan Domenech, executive director of AASA The School Superintendents Association, a group representing school district chiefs, meets every week with a task force on reopening consisting of 30 superintendents from across the country.
Three options are being considered for the fall, he said: fully reopening schools as they were prior to the pandemic; a hybrid model in which some students attend school in-person and some continue with remote learning; and continuing with complete remote learning.
The hybrid option, Domenech said, appears to have the most support. But staying entirely remote, he added, is “beginning to get some traction because the cost of opening schools and following the guidance the CDC has offered is going to be cost prohibitive.” The added costs include more buses to maintain social distancing, protective equipment for students and staff and the daily cleaning of each school.
As districts weigh that question, some parents and teachers worry what comes next.
Portia Hudson (NYSE:HUD), a math teacher at Edwin Fitler Academics Plus School in the Germantown neighborhood of Philadelphia, recalls teaching virtually this spring and watching one student, already battling anxiety problems, fall five weeks behind. During another session, a second student played on a swing during class time.
“If we have virtual learning in September, that’s when I’m really going to be concerned, because virtual learning will look like it does now,” Hudson said. “Kids not logging on. Kids on swings.”

After decades of debate about what to do with the building in the town of Braunau am Inn on the German border, Austria carried out a compulsory purchase in 2017 and said last year it would be turned into police offices so that it ""will never again evoke the memory of National Socialism"".
""It is the most appropriate use (for the building). Why? The police are the protector of fundamental rights and freedoms,"" Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told a news conference announcing the winning design by architects' firm Marte.Marte. 
There is currently little to indicate that the building was once home to the boy who would become leader of the Third Reich, trigger World War Two and carry out the Holocaust. An engraved rock on the pavement says ""Fascism never again"" without mentioning Hitler by name.
Pictures of the winning design showed a fresh facade with a largely unchanged ground floor and a new roof.
The renovation should be completed by early 2023 at a cost of 5 million euros ($5.6 million), and the rock will be transferred to a museum in Vienna, Interior Ministry official Hermann Feiner said. 
""The neutralisation of this whole location was ultimately at the heart of this result,"" Feiner said, adding that neutralisation meant an architectural overhaul and a new use for the building.
Unlike Germany, Austria long denied any responsibility for Nazism, portraying itself as its first victim due to Hitler's annexation of his homeland in 1938, though many Austrians at the time enthusiastically supported the move.
Successive governments have said Austrians were both victims and perpetrators of crimes under the Nazi regime, but there are few reminders now in everyday life of that period of the country's past.

Duterte, who has drawn international criticism for his bloody war on drugs and his human rights record, is trying to expedite the passage of a law that expands the definition of terrorism and bolsters police powers of surveillance, arrest and detention.
Opponents of the bill fear it could be used to suppress free speech and harass those who challenge Duterte, who commands a legislative majority and influence within the judiciary and state institutions. 
""We think this is against the constitution,"" said human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno. ""Given the broader definition of terrorism, the administration's critics could be tagged as suspected terrorists.""
The bill authorises the government to wiretap suspects, arrest them without warrants and hold them without charge for 14 days, among others provisions.
Opposition lawmaker Edcel Lagman criticised Duterte for prioritising the passage of a bill he described as ""draconian"" over an economic stimulus package pending congressional approval, which aims to help mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Duterte was ""tightening the noose on suspected terrorists at the expense of the protection of human rights and civil liberties,"" said Lagman who is also a human rights lawyer.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque dismissed the criticism and said elements of the bill were patterned on those used in countries that had dealt effectively with extremism. 
He said the five-month takeover in 2017 of the southern city of Marawi by militants loyal to Islamic State showed the extent of extremist influence in the country. 

""Let us not forget, the remains of Marawi is still there,"" Roque said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom warned Beijing on Tuesday to step back from the brink over an ""authoritarian"" national security law in Hong Kong that it said risked destroying one of the jewels of Asia's economy while ruining the reputation of China.
China’s parliament last week approved a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. Mainland security and intelligence agents may be stationed in the city for the first time.
""There is time for China to reconsider, there is a moment for China to step back from the brink and respect Hong Kong's autonomy and respect China's own international obligations,"" British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament.
""The sad reality is that if China continues down this track, it will be strangling what has long been the jewel in the economic crown,"" Raab said, when asked about the future of the Hong Kong dollar peg.
Hong Kong fell to sixth place from third in the latest ranking of global financial centres, according to the Z/Yen global financial centres index, behind New York, London, Tokyo, Shanghai and Singapore. It was Asia's top hub in 2019.
Raab said the security law was in breach of the ""one country, two systems"" principle enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Declaration, and also conflicted with Article 23 of China's own basic law.
Raab, though, cautioned that he did not expect China to change course. ""We think that it is unlikely that will happen,"" he said.
If it goes ahead, Raab said the United Kingdom will form an alliance of countries to resist China, whose $14 trillion economy dwarfs every Western economy apart from the United States which has a $21.4 trillion economy.
Raab said the United Kingdom could not coerce China but would seek to persuade it to change course.
If China does not change course, British National Overseas passport-holders in Hong Kong will be offered a path to British citizenship.

Asked if London would go further, Raab said that the offer was already generous: around 300,000 holders of BNO passports and another 3 million were eligible.

The Paris police department said in a statement that there were risks of social disorder and health dangers from large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The demonstration had drawn attention on social media in France from those supporting the ""Black Lives Matter"" movement and backing protests in the United States.
Unrest has broken out across the United States after the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25.

""The reasons are completely a matter of principle,"" Fahrudin Radoncic, who heads the centrist SBB party in the nationalist-led coalition government, told a news conference. 
""We have a political disagreement,"" he said, referring to disputes over how to bar entry to illegal migrants, adding that he would formally resign later in the day.
Last month, Radoncic proposed the deportation of 9,000 illegal migrants from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa. His proposal drew sharp criticism from human rights activists and failed to win approval of the multi-party cabinet. 
He has accused the Bosnian ambassador in Pakistan of having involvement in the issuing of fake visas and the Pakistani ambassador in Bosnia of failing to help authorities to identify undocumented migrants from Pakistan.
Both ambassadors denied the accusations, and the largest Bosniak party, the SDA, which is Radoncic's partner at different layers of governance, dismissed his allegations. 
Radoncic said he also disagreed with SDA pressure exerted on the judiciary relating to a corruption scandal over the procurement of defective ventilators for coronavirus patients, in which the premier of one of Bosnia's two autonomous regions, who is an SDA member, is one of the key suspects.
Radoncic said the loose ruling coalition of nationalist Serb, Croat, and Bosniak parties - the nature of the Sarajevo-based central government since the 1990s war - was dysfunctional. ""The long-term situation is not optimistic.""

PARIS (Reuters) - The Cafe de Flore in Paris, once a favourite drinking hole of Simone de Beauvoir and Jean-Paul Sartre, spread its tables along the pavement, in front of the neighbouring book store, and reopened on Tuesday for the first time in 11 weeks.
Locals could once again enjoy a morning espresso, albeit only at tables spaced a metre apart, as the government allowed cafes and restaurants to open outdoor terraces, lifted travel curbs within France and permitted sunbathing on beaches.
""We're back at home,"" said one regular, Rachel, at the cafe in the French capital's chic Left Bank neighbourhood. ""Morning time is coffee time. We're rediscovering old habits.""
Across Paris, cafe owners encroached on sidewalks to maximise the number of tables they could set. Each had to submit their new configuration to the local authorities online and in the days ahead their new layout will be inspected.
Those without little or no outdoor seating have been less fortunate.
Across the boutique-lined Boulevard Saint-Germain from the Cafe de Flore, the Brasserie Lipp, which kept serving through World War Two but was shut down by the coronavirus pandemic, remained closed.
Even under a bright blue sky, business started slowly. Servers wore masks and said they were still finding their way under the new conditions. Some cafes replaced menus with chalkboards, others asked patrons to scan a barcode to bring up the menu on their smartphone.
At the Le Bourbon brasserie, staff set out about a dozen tables in a small square behind the National Assembly. Manager Jean-Pierre Viala said they were at the mercy of the weather gods, with rain forecast later in the week.
""It's hard to predict how much food to buy in when you're dependent on the weather,"" he said.
Finance Minister Bruno le Maire on Tuesday promised a solidarity fund to help cafes and restaurants would run until the end of 2020. Many depend on the tourists who in normal times swarm through Paris, the world's most visited city.
""We desperately need borders to re-open,"" said Arnaud Lacroix, whose coffee and ice-cream bar is located opposite the fire-ravaged Notre-Dame of Paris cathedral.
In the past two years, his business has been hammered by anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests, the cathedral blaze and now the virus.
""We can't hold out much longer,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Battling its worst desert locust outbreak in decades, India is ordering new equipment to control the swarms before summer crop-sowing gathers pace in the middle of this month.
India has brought the locusts under control at 399 locations in five states and has placed an order to buy 60 new insecticide spraying machines, two government sources said.
Authorities have used specialist vehicles and fire engines to spray insecticides in an area of 55,542 hectares in the western states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, central state of Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, and Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the north.
The government also plans to buy five helicopter-mounted spray systems to curb the fast-spreading swarms by mid-June when monsoon rains help farmers boost rice, cane, corn, cotton and soybean sowing, according to the sources, who are directly involved in formulating plans to tackle the scourge.
Nearly half of the 60 insecticide spraying machines will arrive this week, they said.
India needs to stop the infestation from spreading further to ensure the swarms do not devour summer crops.
""We've been rather lucky that we've got a week or two to get our acts together and stop locusts before summer sowing gathers momentum,"" said Bhagirath Choudhary, director of the South Asia Biotech Centre, a non-profit scientific society.
The locust infestation has not caused significant damage so far due to the lean season - the gap between the previous harvest and the next planting season.

The farm ministry should be allowed to use drones to spray insecticides on vast swathes of northern, western and central plains - the main farm belt, Choudhary said.

The prominent democracy group Demosisto cited three protesters as saying they had been physically and verbally abused by Correctional Services Department (CSD) guards while in detention, including being beaten and slapped in places without CCTV surveillance cameras.
CSD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The city government has not commented on the accusations. Hong Kong police have in the past denied using excessive force during protests, saying they have acted with restraint in the face of violent unrest.
Joshua Wong, secretary-general of Demosisto, said the inmates' treatment fell under the definition of ""torture"" as laid out in the U.N. Convention Against Torture, and the complaint had been sent to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
The three protesters, whose names were given only as Tom, Ivan, and Jackson, were all held in Pik Uk Correctional Institution, a centre in the district of Sai Kung that is used for inmates aged 21 or under, Wong's group said.
They were detained as the novel coronavirus closed courts and they waited for Hong Kong's judicial system to determine their fate over charges related to anti-government protests. 
Nearly 9,000 people have been arrested and 1,671 people charged since anti-government protests escalated in June last year, according to police. 
According to Demosisto and city legislator Shiu Ka-chun, at least 34 male protesters have been remanded in custody in Pik Uk since June 2019. Of those, 14 are still in detention. 
The CSD said it does not have data on the number of people in detention related to the protests.

Earlier on Tuesday, thousands of Australians marched in Sydney to protest against the death of black American George Floyd in U.S. police custody, after days of demonstrations and clashes in the United States sparked by the killing.
The Sydney protest came as Australian police face questions about use of force during the arrest of a teenager of aboriginal descent.
Foreign Minister Marise Payne said the Australian government would support Channel Seven, where the cameraman worked, should it wish to lodge its concerns over the incident in Washington with U.S. authorities through the embassy there.
""I want to get further advice on how we would go about registering Australia's strong concerns with the responsible local authorities in Washington,"" Payne told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
""So our embassy in the United States will approach the relevant authorities, and Channel Seven will also provide us with their views on how they wish to deal with it.""
Video footage posted on social media showed Channel 7 correspondent Amelia Brace and cameraman Tim Myers broadcasting live on a street when riot police approached to clear the area, hitting Myers with a shield.
The pair are then seen trying to leave the scene while another policeman swung at them with a baton.
""This is obviously a very troubling period in the United States, and a very tough period,"" Payne told the ABC. ""We encourage all involved on both sides to exercise constraint and avoid violence.""
'EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM'
Earlier, protesters in Australia's biggest city defied coronavirus restrictions on crowds to march from a park towards government buildings, holding signs saying ""I can't breathe!"" and chanting ""Black lives matter"" and ""Take a knee"" while mounted police stood by. 
""This is everybody's problem,"" Kira Dargin, an aboriginal Wiradjuri woman at the protest told Reuters. 
""As a black woman, I'm tired of seeing my brothers go down. As a black mother I fear for my child. Got to stop.""
An investigation has been opened in Sydney into the arrest of a 17-year-old of aboriginal descent after video footage appeared on social media showing him being handcuffed and kicked to the ground after an argument with police.
The constable involved has been put on restricted duties while the investigation takes place. 

""This is not the United States of America,"" Assistant Commissioner Michael Wiling told reporters. ""We have very, very good relations with our local community. I'm concerned that people will pre-empt the outcomes of the investigation and draw conclusions prior to that.""

After above-average European spring temperatures, forest fires have already broken out in recent days in Sweden and northern France, data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) show. 
This is in addition to fires in Italy and Portugal, which are vulnerable because of their warmer climate.
The Commission, the EU executive arm, expects the situation will get much worse over Europe's summer.

He could not yet predict whether this year would be worse than last, when wildfires brought record levels of devastation to Europe, but said the Commission estimated the risk of vast and multiple wildfires was high.
Dry whether in usually wet regions is also spreading the risk beyond traditional hot spots.
""The areas that are prone to forest fires are no longer only in the southern part of Europe, but also in central Europe and even in the northern part of Europe,"" Lenarcic said, citing recent fires and projections from national authorities in EU states.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India began evacuating people from low-lying areas in and around Mumbai ahead of a cyclone that is expected to hit the country's west coast on Wednesday, officials said. 
The cyclone, expected to make landfall on Wednesday afternoon near India's financial capital Mumbai, will pressure emergency services already grappling with the nation's largest outbreak of the novel coronavirus. 
India's most populous city has more than 53,000 cases of COVID-19 infection, with more than 1,600 deaths. 
A deep depression in the Arabian Sea ""is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during next 12 hours, and further into a severe cyclonic storm during subsequent 12 hours,"" the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Tuesday. 
The cyclone designated Nisarga could make landfall between north Maharashtra and the adjoining south Gujarat coast, with winds gusting up to 120 km per hour (75 mile per hour), the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane, the IMD said. 
More than 30 disaster management teams have been deployed in the two states as Nisarga is expected to bring extremely heavy rainfall to west coast areas and could lead to flooding in low-lying areas, the state authorities said. 
Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, has been moving people living in slums and makeshift houses in the poorer sections of the state to places of shelter, the state's chief minister, Uddhav Thackeray, said. 
Cyclones often skirt densely populated Mumbai, which floods every year during the June-September monsoon season, said K.S. Hosalikar, a Mumbai-based senior official with IMD. 
Berthing operations at India's largest container port, Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust (JNPT), on the outskirts of Mumbai, are likely to be affected, its chairman, Sanjay Sethi, said. 

Last month, a powerful cyclone that tore through the eastern state of West Bengal caused damage of 1 trillion rupees ($13 billion) to infrastructure and crops and killed more than 100 people in India and Bangladesh.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - When Ming Wong saw that Britain was prepared to offer extended visa rights and a ""path to citizenship"" for British National Overseas (BNO) passport holders in Hong Kong, she seized the moment and re-applied for her lost passport.
Beijing's push to impose national security laws in the former British colony has stoked worry about its future and prompted Britain to offer refuge to almost 3 million Hong Kong residents eligible for the passport. 
""I started filling out the applications in December after the protests, but it's the national security legislation now that really prompted me to finish the process,"" said 39-year-old Wong who has two small children.
Her husband, brother and parents are also applying, she said.
The BNO passport was created for Hong Kong people before Britain returned the territory to Chinese rule in 1997. Though they are British passports that allow a holder to visit Britain for six months, they do not come with an automatic right to live and work there.
But British foreign minister Dominic Raab said the six-month limit could be removed if China imposed its national security legislation on the city.
Beijing and Hong Kong authorities reject criticism of the legislation, which they say is aimed at tackling sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference, and insist the city's high degree of autonomy will remain intact under the ""one country, two systems"" formula established in 1997. 
The formula guarantees freedoms, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary, not seen on the mainland. But Beijing's insistence on its national security laws has thrown the future of those freedoms into question.
""The national security law is about to be implemented but the details have not yet been confirmed so I want to apply for it before anything happens,"" said Don Wong, 35, who works in a government organisation, as he queued outside a courier company to send his BNO renewal application to Britain.
""I'm worried that I may not be able to use Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the law is enacted ... I may get prosecuted due to my words."" 
SAFETY NET
But even before China announced its plan for the security law there was a surge of renewals of BNO passports, highlighting what many Hong Kong people see as an urgency to secure a back-up plan.
According to figures obtained by the Mingpao newspaper from the British Passport Office, BNO renewal applications increased in the second half of last year, amid sometimes violent anti-government protests, with the number totalling more than 120,000 in 2019 compared with about 14,000 in 2017 and 2018.
The Passport Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Immigration consultants have reported a rush of enquiries about moving away from Hong Kong since China's announcement on May 21.
""Last week alone, the number of enquiries surged to about 100 a day,” said Swing Wong, a director the Midland immigration consultancy, from about 50 a day earlier this year.
As well as Britain, people ask about the United States, Canada, Australia, Taiwan and Malaysia, consultants said.
""Most people who enquire about the U.K. think it would be a safety net for their children,"" said Ivan Yam, director of immigration consultant Golden Emperor Properties.
""Many people in Hong Kong are really interested in such a scheme,"" he said of the possibility of extended visa rights for the BNO passport. 

""No country offers a faster way of immigration.""

Gulen, a former ally of President Tayyip Erdogan, has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. He denies any involvement in the attempted coup.
The prosecutor's office said it issued detention warrants for 42 military and gendarmerie personnel as a result of statements by previously detained people and analyses of pay phone calls. Among them were 24 officers on active duty.
It said it had requested the detention of 76 military, gendarmarie personnel and civilians in a separate operation after determining they had used pay phones to contact members of the network. Seventy-four of those were on active duty.
The detention orders included members of the land, air and marine forces, as well as one colonel and three lieutenants.
Erdogan has for years accused Gulen's supporters of establishing a ""parallel state"" by infiltrating the police, judiciary, military and other state institutions.
Since the coup attempt, about 80,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended from their jobs.
Turkey's Western allies including the European Union as well as rights groups have criticised the scale of the crackdown, while Ankara has defended the measures as a necessary response to the security threat.

The protesters rallied in support of George Floyd, a black American who died in police custody in the United States last week, their number swelling from an expected 200-300 to several thousands on Monday.
Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, of the Green Left party, said city authorities were caught off guard by the huge turnout and could not have intervened peacefully. She defended the public's right to demonstrate.
""I had seen how these gatherings grew into massive events in Berlin and London and U.S. cities,"" she told Dutch public television broadcaster NPO Monday night, but there had been ""absolutely no indication it would be this big"".
The Netherlands has recorded nearly 6,000 deaths from COVID-19. Authorities have issued fines of around $400 for violating rules not to hold public gatherings, but there were almost no police at Monday's event.
The demonstration, the largest in the Netherlands since lockdown measures were imposed in mid-March, sparked debate about whether the event could cause new infections.
""This is exactly what we don't want,"" Menno de Jong, a virologist at Amsterdam's UMC hospital and a member of the Dutch national coronavirus crisis team, told the Parool newspaper.
""You don't need to be a virologist to reach this conclusion. There is a reason we have been talking about social distancing for months. This could potentially be a so-called super spreading event.""
Klaas Dijkhof, a member of parliament for the VVD party of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte, said on Twitter he was ""not only angry, but worried by the images out of Amsterdam"". He called on demonstrators to voluntarily isolate themselves for two weeks.

Video footage of a white police officer in Minneapolis kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, for nearly nine minutes last Monday before he died, has led to global protests.

""Hello friends. Good news. Dr. Sirous Asgari is in the air on a flight back to Iran. Congratulations to his wife and family,"" wrote Zarif, who urged Washington in March to release Asgari, who he said was one of several Iranian scientists taken “hostage” by the United States.
In April 2016, the materials science professor was indicted as U.S. federal prosecutors accused him of stealing trade secrets in violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
A federal judge in Ohio acquitted Asgari in November and U.S. authorities said earlier last month that the 59-year-old Asgari, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus in April, was expected to be deported by the United States once he received medical clearance to leave. 
Asgari might be part of a rare prisoner swap between foes Tehran and Washington, whose relations have grown increasingly hostile since 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on the country that have battered its economy. 
If a swap goes ahead, Michael White, a U.S. navy veteran who has been detained in Iran since 2018, is a likely candidate to be exchanged. He was released from prison in mid-March on medical furlough but remains in Iran.

Iran last year freed U.S. citizen Xiyue Wang, who had been held for three years on spying charges, and the United States released Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.

1292,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>",'I can't be silent': Hong Kong people aim to mark Tiananmen despite ban,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Many Hong Kong people will find their own way to mark the 31st anniversary of Chinese troops opening fire on protesters in and around Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ), after an annual candlelight vigil was cancelled for the first time because of the coronavirus.
The anniversary of the crackdown on the student-led democracy protests has a special poignancy this year, coming a week after Beijing gave the green light to move ahead with national security legislation for Hong Kong, which critics fear will crush freedoms in the former British colony.
""I can't be silent. If people tell me to keep silent, I won't,"" said office worker Daisy Lam, 52, who has attended nearly every vigil since June 4, 1989, with her children.
Former Hong Kong student leader Chan Ching-wah, 56, was in Beijing on June 4, 1989, and recalled the kindness of a customs officer who let him to take a bag full of photos and video of the military crackdown when he left Beijing.
""I feel like I had never left because the danger that Hong Kong is facing, the repression it's going to face is no small thing,"" Chan told Reuters as he held a photo of himself in Tiananmen Square.
""I hope the battle in Hong Kong won't lead to a crackdown like the one on June 4.""
Fears have intensified over what many residents of Hong Kong see as Beijing's encroachment on its freedoms, and the impact of that on the city's status as a global financial hub. 
Mainland and Hong Kong authorities reject criticism of the security legislation and insist the city's high degree of autonomy will remain intact under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
In past years, Hong Kong's candlelight memorials have drawn tens of thousands of people to the city's Victoria Park. 
But police said this week a mass gathering would pose a serious threat to public health just as the city reported its first locally transmitted coronavirus cases in two weeks. 
Hong Kong has banned gatherings of more than eight people to prevent the spread of the virus.
Embattled city leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday the restrictions were not about limiting freedom and public health was also a part of national security.
Despite the ban, online forums and the organiser of the vigil have called on people to light candles to remember those who perished. 
Priscilla Leung, a retired civil servant who volunteers for non-government organisations, said she would continue to inform young people about the Tiananmen crackdown, which is a taboo issue on the mainland. The anniversary is not marked by the government.
""I have already bought some electronic candle lights and I plan to light them on the streets,"" said Leung. 

""It doesn't matter if it's one person or a few people, as long as there's fire in our hearts, we'll be able to pass on the message to the next generation.""

Trump said last week he will postpone a G7 summit he had hoped to hold next month until September or later and expand the list of invitees to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India.
Making the invitation directly, Trump called Morrison on Tuesday and the offer was accepted, a spokesman for the Australian prime minister said.
""The prime minister said he was once again pleased to take up the invitation to attend the G7, as he had done last year, when invited to do so by President Macron, in France,"" the spokesman for Morrison said in an e-mailed statement.
Morrison has been one of few world leaders to pay a state visit to Washington during Trump's tenure, and both leaders have openly signalled their camaraderie.
Morrison, unlike some European leaders, has avoided criticising Trump publicly and has teamed up with the United States in its tougher stance against China, Australia's main trading partner.
Relations between Canberra and Beijing have been strained amid Australian accusations of Chinese meddling in domestic affairs and concern about what Australia sees as China's growing influence in the Pacific region.
While Australia's presence at the next G7 meeting appears unopposed, Trump's suggestion that Russia be invited has been rejected by Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Still, Trump spoke to Putin on Monday and informed him about his plans to hold an expanded G7 meeting later this year, the Kremlin said on Monday.

1294,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 02, 2020 12:55AM ET</span>","In nod to #MeToo, China codifies sexual harassment by law","By Huizhong Wu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Two years ago, Zhou Xiaoxuan publicly accused one of China's most recognizable people of groping and forcibly kissing her, setting off a firestorm in a country that did not specify sexual harassment as a legal offence.
Last week Zhou and dozens of other women who started China's #MeToo movement won a small victory when the nation's parliament enacted legislation that for the first time defines actions that can constitute sexual harassment.
The reference in the new civil code, approved on Thursday by a session of the National People's Congress, is largely a symbolic step. While it holds schools, businesses and other organisations responsible for preventing and dealing with sexual harassment, it does not lay out guidelines for enforcement.
""The civil code is a big step, but much more will need to be fleshed out,"" said Darius Longarino, a senior fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at Yale Law School. ""After all, U.S. sexual-harassment law is still developing after decades and grappling with its failures, as laid bare by #MeToo."" 
Still, some lawyers and activists say the civil code offers for the first time a nationally recognised enumeration of sexual harassment as a legal offence.
Article 1,010 of the new code says a person may be held liable ""for speech, words, images or bodily actions that have been used to carry out sexual harassment against a person's wishes."" 
The development could pave the way for further changes to allow sexual-harassment victims to seek redress, six lawyers and activists interviewed by Reuters said.
The parliament's Legislative Affairs Commission and China's State Council did not respond to faxed requests for comment about the decision to define sexual harassment in the civil code.
VICTIMS COME FORWARD
China's #MeToo movement took off in 2018 when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment. It spread to NGOs, media and other industries.
Zhou's accusation against Zhu Jun, a well-known TV personality, was one of the most prominent. In a series of social media posts, she described a 2014 incident when she was an intern working for him at state broadcaster CCTV.
She says he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. Zhou's accusation quickly went viral. 
Zhu denies the allegations and is countering Zhou. He could not be reached, and his lawyer declined to comment on the case or the new legislation.
Some activists and lawyers are hopeful that the movement is starting to lead to real change, starting with the mention in the civil code. 
""MeToo's spread has made a huge push on this matter of law,"" said Zhou, who says much more needs to be done to protect the rights of sexual-violence victims. ""But this may be a process, and you can't solve it in one leap."" 
More than a year and a half later, there have been no hearings in the case brought by Zhou in September 2018. Most Chinese #MeToo cases remain unresolved, activists say. 
Zhou filed hers under the category ""personality rights"" - a broad term in Chinese law that includes rights applying to one's body and health - because sexual harassment was not recognised as a legal cause of action.
""If you wanted to go bring a court case, then you had to bring a labour dispute - it was very difficult,"" said a woman who brought her own #MeToo accusation against a prominent charity founder in 2018 and who works under the name Huahua for privacy and safety. She ultimately chose not to take her accusation to court.
Sexual harassment remains sensitive in China. The movement, despite bursts of grassroots activity, has faced government pressure and censorship, the activists said.

The State Council did not respond requests for comment about the allegations of pressure and censorship.

The conflict between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi group has left 80% of Yemen's population reliant on aid. The country now faces the spread of the novel coronavirus among an acutely malnourished people.
""Anything below $1.6 billion and the operation will be facing catastrophic cutbacks,"" Lise Grande, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, told Reuters just days prior to the conference.
""We won't be able to provide the food people need to survive, or the health care they need or the water or sanitation or the nutrition support which helps to keep 2 million malnourished children from dying,"" she said.
The U.N.-coordinated humanitarian plan received $3.2 billion last year, but so far in 2020 has only secured $474 million, aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Thursday, adding that most agencies are weeks away from being broke.
Lowcock, asked about Saudi Arabia co-hosting the event, said Riyadh was a large donor and the U.N. would continue to call out warring parties on actions ""they should not be doing"". 
Saudi Arabia has already pledged $525 million. The United States said last month it would extend $225 million in emergency aid for food.
Some $180 million of required funding is needed to combat coronavirus in a country with shattered health systems and inadequate testing capabilities.
""Yemen is at a precipice. All indications point to COVID19 spreading fast and wide across the country, overwhelming the health system,"" pledge organisers said in a statement on Tuesday.
Yemen has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the Saudi-backed government from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene a few months later.
Donors had cut funding to Houthi-held areas over concerns the group is hindering aid delivery, a charge it denies.

Grande said several issues had now been addressed by Houthi authorities, including waiving a 2% tax on aid operations, allowing needs assessments and providing the World Food Programme with approval to start a pilot on a biometric registration and verification system.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - With temperatures checked, masks fitted, and hand sanitizers at the ready, many Singapore children returned to school on Tuesday after a novel coronavirus lockdown of nearly two months.
Across the island, the hum of the morning rush hour resumed while staff at schools urged students to maintain a safe distance as they lined up to return to class. 
With one of the highest coronavirus tallies in Asia, Singapore has said it will ease restrictions gradually, with the registry of marriages and some businesses, including pet salons, also reopening on Tuesday. 
""You have to restart your normal life at some point,"" said Harsha Yavagal, who was sending his boys aged five and 12 back to school. 
""Schools are taking all possible measures to cope with the virus,"" he said.
Studies in some European countries have shown reopening schools has not led to a rise in coronavirus infections, while other studies have shown fewer cases of the disease among children compared with adults.
But Singapore is not taking any chances.
At one secondary school, Reuters observed the precision of the ""new normal"" morning routine.
After a bell, students sang the national anthem through face masks that are required by law. The teacher then asked everyone in the class to put thermometers in their mouths and he went desk-to-desk noting temperatures.
The students then cleaned their thermometers with an alcohol wipe and, one-by-one, dropped the wipes in a bin.
Recesses will be staggered and children will have to sit apart at the canteen, the teacher said, then asked students to respond to an online poll via their smartphones about how they felt about returning to school.
The results appeared on a screen behind him: more than half said they were happy with a further third ""very happy"".

Singapore has recorded more than 35,000 coronavirus cases and 24 deaths. Most cases have been among migrant workers living in dormitories.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam accused foreign governments of ""double standards"" in their reaction to Beijing's plans to impose national security laws on the city, pointing to anti-police brutality protests in the United States.
In her first public appearance after Washington said it will remove Hong Kong's preferential treatment in U.S. law in response to Beijing's proposal, Lam warned countries threatening actions against the city they may hurt their own interests.
""They are very concerned about their own national security, but on our national security...they look through tinted glasses,"" Lam told a weekly news conference.
""In the U.S., we see how the riots were being handled by the local governments, compared to the stance they adopted when almost the same riots happened in Hong Kong last year.""
Having lost patience with Hong Kong after large-scale and often-violent pro-democracy protests last year plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest crisis in decades, Beijing authorities last month advanced plans to introduce laws tackling secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference.
The laws could also see Chinese intelligence agencies set up shop in the global financial hub.
U.S. President Donald Trump, saying Hong Kong was no longer sufficiently autonomous from Beijing as promised at the time of the 1997 handover of the territory by Britain, said Hong Kong will no longer be treated differently from mainland China in U.S. law.
Hong Kong and Beijing authorities have repeatedly insisted rights and freedoms will be preserved, remarks echoed by Lam on Tuesday. She said ""public concerns"" about the legislation were understandable as a draft was yet to be finalised.
In Washington, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday as Trump vowed a massive show of force to end violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody.
Dozens of cities across the United States remain under curfews not seen since riots after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Police in some places were also seen joining marches and kneeling in solidarity with the protesters.
Protesters in Hong Kong have mainly been asking for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into how police handled the demonstrations. 

Hong Kong, where protesters reject Lam's description of the anti-government demonstrations as riots, has not enforced curfews. Police have been accused of disproportionate use of force, which officials have denied.

The Northern Territory has no active COVID-19 cases. It closed its borders to other parts of Australia in March and requires a quarantine period for all arrivals to help protect remote indigenous communities from the virus.
The rotation of U.S. marines will be halved to 1,200, from a peak of 2,500 last year, and they will arrive in groups of 200 over eight weeks, a spokeswoman for Australia's defence minister Linda Reynolds said.
The Marines, who left the United States two weeks ago, arrived via Japan, where they underwent a separate quarantine period, the spokeswoman said. They were tested for COVID-19 on arrival in Darwin and will undergo another 14 days of quarantine in defence facilities.
Reynolds said the arrival of the Marines, which was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, required extensive planning between the U.S. and Australian governments, and the cooperation of local health authorities.
The Northern Territory's success in containing the coronavirus saw it lead other states in relaxing restrictions on public gatherings, with bars and pubs reopening last month.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea will open schools this month after delays over concern about the novel coronavirus, state media has reported, the latest sign of opening up even though the isolated country has said it has had no confirmed cases of the disease.
North Korean schools usually begin their spring term on April 1, but it was postponed as the government took various steps to ward off the virus, including sealing its borders.
State media has said high schools and universities started classes on April 20. 
All other schools, kindergartens, day-care centres and nursing homes will reopen early this month, state radio reported late on Monday. 
""Teachers and helpers will thoroughly follow hygiene rules, with thermometers and hand sanitizers installed at entrances of all classrooms and offices, while parents are advised to educate their children,"" the official Korean Central Broadcasting Committee (KCBC) said.
While North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, South Korea's main intelligence agency has said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out as the North had exchanges of people with China before closing the border in late January.
Children at kindergartens and day-care centres will get checked for the virus and buildings will be disinfected, the KCBC added. 
Naenara, a North Korean state internet portal, released photos of high-school students having temperature checks when their schools opened in late April. 
There have been other signs of a relaxation of coronavirus restrictions. 
A video posted last month on YouTube by another state outlet, DPRK Today, showed a restaurant in the capital, Pyongyang, full of customers with many people, including staff, wearing masks.

(Reuters) - A popular black restaurateur was fatally shot in Kentucky early on Monday as police and National Guard troops fired weapons while dispersing a crowd protesting against police killings of African Americans.
The chief of police in Louisville was fired and two officers placed on administrative leave after authorities learned the officers had fired their weapons without using body cameras to record what happened, Mayor Greg Fischer said at a press briefing on Monday. 
""We had a horrible tragedy last night at 26th and Broadway,"" Fischer said. ""We lost a wonderful citizen named David McAtee.""
The death of McAtee, who owned YaYa's BBQ near the site of the shooting, marked the second time Louisville police did not use their body cameras during a shooting incident in which an unarmed black resident was killed.
Like protesters across the country, the Louisville marchers were incensed by the treatment of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis police custody after being pinned beneath a white officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes. But they were also protesting against the Louisville officers who shot 26-year-old Breonna Taylor while serving a ""no knock"" search warrant at her apartment.
Protests over racial inequality have engulfed the nation's major cities for a week, as officials extended curfews in hopes of preventing a seventh night of looting and vandalism over the death of Floyd.
Details were not immediately available about the circumstances of McAtee's death, Fischer said. 
He added, however, that authorities know two Louisville police officers and two National Guard soldiers had fired their weapons. The officers say they returned fire after someone shot at them, Fischer said.
Kentucky Governor Andy Bashear, a Democrat, promised an exhaustive investigation.

Thousands of New Zealanders marched peacefully on Monday amid protests in the U.S. and around the globe decrying how Floyd, a black American, died in police custody last week.
""I think I stand with everyone else in being horrified in what we've seen,"" Ardern told state broadcaster TVNZ in an interview. 
""I don't want to stop peaceful protests... but rules are there to protect people,"" she added, referring to social distancing restrictions on large gatherings. 
Ardern has been described by some liberal supporters as an ""anti-Trump,"" promoting issues such as social justice, multilateralism, and equality. 
She was praised globally for her compassionate handling of the country's worst mass shooting on March 15, 2019, when a suspected white supremacist killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch.
Ardern said her country's response to that attack demonstrated that New Zealanders call out racism and hatred.
""Equally that means as a nation we call it out wherever we see it in a globalised world,"" she told TVNZ, adding that she understood the sentiment of the protesters. 
New Zealand has had no new coronavirus infections in the last 10 days and is on the verge of eliminating the virus domestically, with just one active case. The country was under lockdown for nearly seven weeks.
Ardern said all restrictions may be removed next week, as she plans to review them on June 8, earlier than the planned date of June 22. Pressure has been growing from the public and party leaders to ease curbs. 

""We are exceeding our expectations in terms of our progress, which is a fantastic position to be in,"" she said.

Although the final date of the election has not yet been announced, the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has said June 28 is the last date the European Union's largest post-communist state could hold the vote in order to have a head of state in place before the current president's term ends.
The bill, including several amendments, was passed with 94 senators voting in favour, one against and four abstentions. It will now go back to the lower house of parliament, the Sejm. 
The election had been scheduled for May 10 but planning for the vote collapsed because of the coronavirus pandemic, forcing the government to abandon the original schedule. It had planned to hold the election in May as a postal ballot.
Victory for incumbent President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, is crucial to the government's hopes of implementing their conservative agenda, as the president has the right to veto laws and to trigger early parliamentary elections.
Since coming to power in 2015 PiS has been in conflict with the European Union over judicial reforms which critics say increase political control over the courts, but which PiS says are necessary to remove a residue of communism.
While Duda remains ahead in most polls, his lead has been narrowing.

(Reuters) - Two doctors who carried out an independent autopsy of George Floyd, the black man whose death in Minneapolis police custody last week triggered nationwide protests, said on Monday that he died from asphyxiation and that his death was a homicide.
The doctors also said Floyd had no underlying medical conditions that contributed to his death.
That contradicts the initial findings of the official autopsy by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner. It said there was no evidence of ""traumatic"" strangulation and also said coronary artery disease and hypertension also likely contributed to his death. The county's full autopsy report has not yet been released. 
""The evidence is consistent with mechanical asphyxia as cause of death and homicide as manner of death,"" said Dr. Allecia Wilson, one of the two doctors who performed an independent autopsy, who is the director of autopsy and forensic services at the University of Michigan. 
Dr. Michael Baden, who also took part in the independent autopsy at the behest of Floyd's family, said he agreed with Wilson's findings and that the death was a homicide. 
Baden added that ""the autopsy shows that Mr. Floyd had no underlying medical problems that caused or contributed to his death."" 
Baden has worked on several high-profile cases, including the 2014 death of Eric Garner, a black man who died after being choked by police in New York City. 
It was not just the knee to Floyd's neck that killed him, Baden said, but also the pressure that two other officers were applying to Floyd's back that cut off oxygen from flowing in or out of his lungs. 
Attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Floyd's family, said the family wants first-degree murder charges lodged against all four officers who were at the scene - and they want the violent protests that has wracked the United States to end.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Torrential rains at the weekend caused by Tropical Storm Amanda have killed at least 20 people in Central America, authorities said on Monday, as remnants of the weather front moved north into Mexico and threatened to form a new cyclone.
The bulk of the victims were in El Salvador, where Amanda led to the deaths of 15 people and the disappearance of seven more, as well as destroying hundreds of homes and damaging roads, the National Commission for Civil Protection said.
Carolina Recinos, a senior aide to Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, told a news conference that Amanda had dumped the equivalent of ""almost 10 percent"" of the annual rainfall on the country in a relatively short space of time.
In Guatemala, officials reported the deaths of two people due to the storm, including a boy of nine. The rains killed at least three people in Honduras, including a brother and sister swept into a river in a car, local authorities said.
By Monday afternoon, remnants of Amanda were on the western flank of Mexico's Yucatan peninsula and expected to drift west into the Bay of Campeche, a major oil producing area, according to projections by the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).

The weather front is likely to form a tropical depression later on Monday or by Tuesday, the Miami-based NHC said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Liberal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his rivals in the opposition vowed on Monday to fight racism at home as violent protests continued in the United States following the death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis last week.
Thousands staged a peaceful protest on Saturday in Toronto to demand answers in the death of Regis (NYSE:RGS) Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old black woman who fell from her 24th-floor apartment balcony last week while police were present. 
Vancouver and other Canadian cities also held peaceful protests over the weekend, but tensions flared after a march in Montreal on Sunday when protesters smashed windows and set fires.
Trudeau addressed ""young black Canadians"" during his daily news conference, saying: ""I want you to know that I am listening and that your government will always stand with you. Together, we will keep taking meaningful action to fight racism and discrimination in every form.""
The prime minister went on to condemn the vandalism in Montreal.
Trudeau has long spoken about the need to end racism, but his re-election campaign was almost derailed last September after pictures of him in blackface from years earlier emerged.
Conservative leader Andrew Scheer, who heads the largest opposition party, also spoke out against racism, and left-leaning New Democratic Party head Jagmeet Singh, the first minority leader of a Canadian political party, talked about the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd, which sparked the protests. 
""When you see someone that looks like you being killed like that, it makes you feel like you have no worth and no value,"" Singh told reporters. 

When asked if demonstrations could trigger a spike in coronavirus cases, Health Minister Patty Hajdu said people should bring hand sanitizer, wear a mask and try to maintain a safe distance if they attend a protest.

Most dressed in black and wearing face masks due to the coronavirus crisis, the demonstrators held signs saying: ""Racism is choking us,"" ""Justice for Floyd"" and ""I can't breathe"" - the last words Floyd gasped as a white officer knelt on his neck.
""George Floyd was a victim of a racist crime, a racist murder in the United States by a policeman,"" said Dominique Sopo, head of French anti-racism group SOS Racisme which helped organise the protest.
In a statement, organisers urged widespread solidarity among anti-racist groups in France to denounce a crime that ""unfortunately"" was commonplace in the United States. 
""We also call for the utmost firmness in France, including at the state level, where acts of racism in the police have been recently reported,"" the statement said.

After less than an hour, the protesters were peacefully escorted away from the embassy perimeter by police in riot gear.

Speaking to reporters, U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad also sought to play down an independent U.N. experts report that ties between the Taliban and al Qaeda remain close despite the Taliban's pledge to cut such links.
Khalilzad, who helped broker a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban troop withdrawal agreement, said the Afghan government has freed 2,400 to 2,500 Taliban prisoners since that pact was reached and the militant group has freed more than 400 government detainees in return.
""We are in a good place,"" Khalilzad said, adding that levels of violence in Afghanistan have remained relatively low since May's Eid al-Fitr ceasefire. ""We are optimistic that finally we're moving forward to the start of the intra-Afghan negotiations.""
Under the U.S.-Taliban deal - to which the Afghan government was not a party - the United States committed to reduce its military footprint in Afghanistan to 8,600 troops by mid-July and, conditions permitting, to zero by May 2021. U.S. troop strength already is down to nearly 8,600, U.S. and NATO officials said last week.
Under the agreement, up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners and up to 1,000 government prisoners were to have been freed by March 10, when talks between the Kabul government and the Taliban were to have begun.

Khalilzad said the United States was trying to help resolve the prisoner issue and ""we are hoping that violence will stay low. So with the release of prisoners, we can begin inter-Afghan negotiations.""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday cited economic losses to justify his government's decision to lift a coronavirus lockdown despite rising infections and deaths, urging people to ""live with the virus.""
Pakistan has rolled back almost all shutdown measures, primarily to avert an economic meltdown. The country would open to tourism but cinemas, theatres and schools remain closed.
The South Asian nation of 220 million has reported 72,160 novel coronavirus cases and 1,543 deaths, which jumped lately to as high as 80 a day. 
Its economic losses included a decline in exports, a 30% shortfall in revenues and remittances were expected to fall in coming months, Khan said. With the fiscal deficit likely to rise as high as 9.4% and the revenue shortfall, Pakistan is facing a balance of payment crisis.
The country couldn't afford to match the losses incurred during the lockdown as many other countries had done, Khan said in a televised address.
He cited 50 million people who live below the poverty line and 25 million daily wagers. 
Khan said his government gave cash handouts to the poor, which wasn't possible to continue on such a large scale, adding around 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the shutdowns. 
""Our conditions don't allow that we keep feeding money to them, how long we can give them money,"" Khan said.
He urged people to act responsibly but more infections and deaths were inevitable.

""This virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,"" Khan said. ""If people do take care they can live with the virus.""

Prague will place 19 European states, mostly central, eastern and southeastern nations, in the least-risky category under its new colour-coded system, while putting travel to and from Britain and Sweden in its riskiest category.
Czechs have undone most restrictions, with restaurants and hotels fully reopened on May 25. But tourism suffered as lockdown measures hit the economy, and only short-term businesss travellers from the European Union, people in transit or students were allowed into the country.
Czechs will be able to travel without restrictions to immediate neighbours Germany, Austria, Poland and Slovakia, along with Hungary, Romania or Bulgaria as part of its green tier. Other safe countries include Croatia, Greece, Cyprus, Switzerland, the Baltic states, and Finland, Norway and Iceland. 
Citizens from those countries will be allowed in without having to present a negative COVID-19 test, Health Minister Adam Vojtech said on Twitter.
The government placed France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, as well as Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium in its orange tier, allowing Czechs to travel to those countries without restrictions. However, those countries' citizens will need to present a COVID-19 test.
Britain and Sweden were placed in the riskiest red category, meaning Czechs returning from trips there and citizens of those countries need to have a test. 
The government also agreed to raise the number of people allowed at events to 500 from June 8, and 1,000 later.
The country reported less than 100 new coronavirus cases a day for most of May. It has reported 9,286 cases of the virus, with 6,642 recovering so far. The death toll has reached 321, a fraction of the rate in western Europe.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations chief Antonio Guterres urges Americans protesting racial inequities and excessive police force to do so peacefully and calls on U.S. leaders and authorities to listen to them and show restraint, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said on Monday. 
Dujarric was responding to a wave of U.S. demonstrations over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis a week ago. Some of the largely peaceful protests have spiraled into civil unrest in many cities.
""Grievances must be heard, but they must be expressed in peaceful ways and authorities must show restraint in responding to demonstrators,"" Dujarric told reporters. 
""In the U.S. - as in any other country in the world - diversity is a richness and not a threat, but the success of diverse societies in any country requires a massive investment in social cohesion,"" he said. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has asked the Justice Department and the FBI investigate the death of Floyd, but has made no major public statement aimed at deescalating the crisis. He has issued several tweets, describing demonstrators as ""thugs"" and urging mayors and governors to ""get tough"" and threatened to use the military against protesters.
On accusations of excessive force by police against protesters, Dujarric said all cases should be investigated. 
""We have always said that police forces around the world need to have adequate human rights training, and there also needs to be an investment in social and psychological support for police so they can do their job properly,"" he said.

In a joint statement, Canada's department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces said a detailed analysis of video footage recovered after the crash last month showed a single bird near the jet's right engine intake during takeoff. 
Investigators are also looking at the performance of the jet's escape system, which the ministry said is standard in all accidents involving ejections.
Capt. Jennifer Casey, the public affairs officer for the Canadian airforce's Snowbirds, died when the plane she was in lost altitude and smashed into a residence shortly after takeoff.
The Snowbirds had been on a cross-Canada tour in a bid to lift peoples' spirits during the coronavirus lockdown when the crash occurred in the Pacific-coast province of British Columbia.

The Snowbirds have temporarily suspended their flying operations since the accident and the investigation is ongoing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday urged U.S. states to crack down on violent protests that have engulfed cities, saying officials should ""dominate"" and arrest people to restore order after a sixth straight night of vandalism and looting, media reported. 
Residents and business owners in cities from New York to Santa Monica, California, spent Monday sweeping up broken glass and taking stock of damage after protests over racial inequities and excessive police force turned violent again overnight.
""You have to dominate,” Trump told the governors in a private call, the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) reported. ""If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time - they’re going to run over you, you’re going to look like a bunch of jerks.""
CBS News, which also obtained audio of the call, said Trump had pinned the violence on the ""radical left."" 
Dozens of cities across the United States remain under curfews at a level not seen since riots following the 1968 assassination of civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. The National Guard deployed in 23 states and Washington, D.C.
Authorities fought to put out fires near the White House and halt the looting of shops in numerous cities. The Federal Emergency Management Agency reported ""significant ongoing"" civil unrest in 36 U.S. cities, including smaller ones like Fargo, North Dakota, and Roanoke, Virginia. 
One person was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, overnight where police and National Guard troops returned fire while trying to disperse a crowd.
""It’s devastating and heartbreaking,"" Alex Flowers, 30, said as she swept broken glass from the sidewalk outside Wasteland, a used-clothing store in Santa Monica, California, early on Monday. ""I came to help clean up the city that has been destroyed and help the business owners and employees.""
The unrest, which erupted as the country was easing lengthy lockdowns to stop the spread of the coronavirus, began with peaceful protests over the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis last Monday.
Video footage showed a white police officer kneeling on the neck of Floyd, 46, for nearly nine minutes before he died. Derek Chauvin, a since-fired 44-year-old police officer, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. He was released on $500,000 bail and is due to appear in court on June 8, according to jail records. 
'I'LL FIGHT WITH YOU'
On Monday, dozens of people quietly paid their respects to Floyd at the scene outside the Cup Foods where he lost his life. Visitors left flowers and signs honoring Floyd on the pavement. A little girl wrote, “I’ll fight with you,” in aqua blue chalk in the road.
“This is therapeutic. My heart was real heavy this morning so I came down extra early and when I got here, the heaviness lifted,” said Diana Jones, 40, the mother of four children. “This right here let’s me know that things are going to be ok.”
In the U.S. capital, St. John's Episcopal Church, a historic place near the White House where many U.S. presidents have worshipped, suffered minor damage while the nearby headquarters of the AFL-CIO labor group was vandalized.
Floyd's death was the latest in a string of similar incidents to prompt an outcry over racism in law enforcement. It reignited outrage across a politically and racially divided country that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Many cities affected by the unrest are just restarting some normal economic activity after more than two months of stay-at-home orders to stem the outbreak, which has killed more than 104,000 people and plunged more than 40 million people into joblessness. 
White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told Fox News that Antifa, an anti-fascist group, was ""certainly behind"" the violence. Trump branded the group a terrorist organization, though it was unclear whether they were involved in any violence.
New York City Police Commissioner Dermot Shea told a news briefing with Mayor Bill de Blasio that police are seeing ""outside agitators coming and trying to rally people to do bad things.""
Trump has condemned the killing of Floyd and promised justice but has made no major public statement to address the crisis. In tweets he has described protesters as ""thugs"" and threatened to use the U.S. military.
Critics accuse the Republican president, who is seeking re-election in November, of stoking conflict and racial tension rather than seeking to bring the country together and address the underlying issues.
Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, critical of Trump's handling of the crisis, met black community leaders in a church and said he would create a police oversight board within his first 100 days in the White House.

Black people account for 6.8% of Minnesota's population but 29% of coronavirus cases, state and federal data show.

Speaking to the American Enterprise Institute on Friday, Pompeo gave no details about immigration quotas or visas, and merely said: ""We are taking a look at it.""
President Donald Trump on Friday ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China, but stopped short of immediately ending privileges that have helped the territory remain a global financial center.
Last week, Britain has said it was prepared to offer extended visa rights and a pathway to citizenship for almost 3 million Hong Kong residents.
Asked if Washington was considering following suit to ""welcome Hong Kong people to come here and bring their entrepreneurial creativity,"" Pompeo replied:
""We are considering it. I don’t know precisely how it will play out. The British have, as you know, a different relationship. A lot of these folks have British national passports. There’s a long history between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom; it’s very different. But we’re taking a look at it.""
Last year, Trump signed legislation stating that Hong Kong residents may not be denied visas because they have been subjected to politically motivated arrest, detention, or other ""adverse"" government action.
On Friday, Trump also issued a proclamation suspending entry of Chinese nations identified as potential security risks, something sources said could affect thousands of Chinese graduate students.

In a statement on Monday, Pompeo said the move would apply only to graduate students and researchers ""targeted, co-opted and exploited"" by the Chinese government, representing ""only a small subset"" of such applicants.

Lithuania closed its borders and entered a strict month-long lockdown in mid-March shortly after first virus infections were detected. It recorded 1678 total cases and 70 deaths as of Monday.
Most restrictions have been removed since then as new cases of the virus slowed down to less than half a dozen per day.

BILBAO, Spain (Reuters) - Two dozen visitors queued to get their temperatures taken at the entrance to Bilbao's Guggenheim Museum on Monday as it became the first of Spain's major cultural centres to reopen its doors after a long lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Attendance appeared modest on the grand opening day of the Frank Gehry-designed Guggenheim, which, with its sweeping metallic curves reflecting the murky waters of the Nervion River, is one of Spain's most recognizable structures. 
Visitors must wear masks, while capacity has been reduced by half and hand-sanitizing stations have been dotted at strategic points around the cavernous structure.
A couple strolled through the cathedral-like atrium, with more than enough space to maintain the requisite 2 metres safety distance.
""We thought we'd make the most of there not being too many visitors so we could enjoy the museum a bit more,"" said Imanol Sierra as he waited outside with his two children.
Along with the rest of the country's museums and galleries it has been closed since a state of emergency was declared in mid-March.
But as the Basque Country progresses to the third stage of a four-step easing plan, the centre has reopened, albeit with several limitations. 
""The first measure they will find is that we are taking temperatures at the entrance,"" director Juan Ignacio Vidarte said. 
A masked cleaner meticulously wiped down the handrail of a spiralling walkway as masked visitors approached an automatic non-contact thermometre at the lobby.

The election was originally set for May 10 but no voting was held due to the coronavirus pandemic. With the lockdown imposed to contain the virus now being eased, the vote is now likely to be held at the end of June, but the final date has not been set.
Duda, an important ally of the ruling right-wing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, was long seen as the clear favourite but recent polls have narrowed his lead, especially since the main opposition centre right Civic Platform (PO) party changed its candidate to liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski.
Critics have said that the PiS, which was determined to press ahead with a postal vote on May 10, is concerned about the economic fallout from the pandemic eroding Duda's popularity.
According to the SWPS survey, conducted on May 28-29, Duda, would win the first round, but would lose in the second round run-off against either independent candidate Szymon Holownia, a Catholic journalist, or Trzaskowski.
Duda would score 32% in the first round, according to the survey. In the second, he would lose to Holownia by 61%-39% and to Trzaskowski by 57%-43%.
Other surveys have consistently shown Duda scoring 40% or more in the first round and defeating all other candidates in the run-off, with one indicating a narrow 49%-46% margin over Trzaskowski.

Victory for Duda is crucial to the PiS government's hopes of implementing their conservative agenda, as the president has the right to veto laws and trigger early parliamentary elections.

Protests demanding justice for Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, have spread across the United States and turned violent. 
Robert O'Brien, President Donald Trump's national security advisor, told ABC news in an interview on Sunday that countries such as Russia, China, Iran and Zimbabwe were adversaries that were using the unrest to stoke tensions in the United States.
Washington has frequently criticised Zimbabwe's human rights record in the past, including crackdowns on opposition protests.
In a statement, Zimbabwe's Foreign Minister Sibusiso Moyo said O'Brien's accusations were ""false and deeply damaging to a relationship already complicated due to years of prescriptive megaphone diplomacy and punitive economic sanctions"".
""We take due note of the measures deployed by the U.S. authorities to deal with the challenges currently confronting them. At the same time, we recall the harsh U.S. criticism and condemnation of our own response to multiple instances of illegal, violent civil unrest,"" said Moyo.

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday praised the United States' ""immense"" and ""generous"" contribution to global health in a push to salvage relations after President Donald Trump said he was severing ties with the U.N. agency. 
Accusing it of pandering to China and overlooking an initially secretive response to the COVID-19 outbreak, Trump said on Friday he was ending Washington's relationship with the WHO.
But WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online media briefing he hoped his organisation could continue its longstanding collaboration with the United States.
""The United States' contribution and generosity towards global health over many decades has been immense, and it has made a great difference in public health all around the world,"" he said.
China has reacted furiously to Trump's move, calling it selfish and petulant politics by a U.S. administration ""addicted"" to quitting international bodies and treaties.
Tedros, who is Ethiopian, said he only knew about the U.S. decision from the media, with no formal communication yet from Trump's government. He declined to answer further questions about the U.S. stance.
RISK AT U.S. PROTESTS
Asked about potential health risks from protests that have flared up in the United States over racism, another WHO official, epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove, said close contact could heighten the risk of spreading the COVID-19 disease. 
Unrest erupted in the United States after last week's death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody, bringing thousands onto the streets and adding to a sense of crisis as the nation already faces the world's worst coronavirus outbreak.
At the briefing, chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said the WHO should have enough information in 24 hours to decide whether to continue suspending trials of hyrdroxychloroquine.
Trump has been one of those promoting the anti-malaria drug to help combat the COVID-19 disease, despite medical warnings about associated risks. 
With many nations easing lockdowns as the rate of new coronavirus cases drops, emergencies expert Mike Ryan said it was ""laudable"" to see economies being put back on track, but a cautious ""stepwise"" approach was still needed. 

Central and South America were current COVID-19 hotspots which had not yet reached their peak, he warned.

""Russia was excluded from the G7 after it invaded Crimea a number of years ago, and its continued disrespect and flaunting of international rules and norms is why it remains outside of the G7, and it will continue to remain out,"" Trudeau said during his daily news conference.
Trump said on Saturday he would postpone a Group of Seven summit he had hoped to hold next month until at least September and expand the list of invitees to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India.
On Saturday Trump said the G7, which groups the world's most advanced economies, was a ""very outdated group of countries"" in its current format.
When asked if he would attend the G7 if Russian President Vladimir Putin came, Trudeau did not answer, saying that there were still ""many discussions"" needed before the meeting.
But he did say the G20 group, which includes Russia, was a forum that included countries ""we don't necessarily have great relations with"". 
""The G7 has always been a place for frank conversations with allies and friends who share so much. That's certainly what I'm hoping to continue to see,"" Trudeau said.
Trump spoke to Putin on Monday and informed him about his plans to hold an expanded G7 meeting later this year, the Kremlin said on Monday.

Russia was expelled from what was then the G8 in 2014 when Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, was U.S. president, after Moscow annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine. Russia still holds the territory, and various G7 governments have rebuffed previous calls from Trump to re-admit Moscow.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's theatres, cinemas and other cultural venues got the go-ahead to reopen on Monday as the country entered the third phase of its exit from lockdown - but many stayed shut, fearing audiences would not show up.
The coronavirus pandemic was a bitter blow to the already fragile arts sector and performers are desperate to be reunited with their audiences, but reopening too soon could be counter-productive.
""Opening doors to only have half a dozen people would do a disservice to the audience and the actors, so we opted to reopen in September if everything goes well,"" Diogo Infante, artistic director at Trindade, one of Lisbon's oldest theatres, said. 
The cultural sector has long struggled to win government support. Many artists say the 30 million euros ($33.36 million) announced for the sector last month was insufficient.
""The fragility of the cultural sector has been chronic for many years,"" said Infante, himself an actor. ""There has never been the political courage to look at culture as important for society.""
Sector associations said the government should provide financial help to artists, as well as to venues, so they can buy equipment needed to reopen.

""People are still very afraid to leave home. We have to fight that. We have all safety measures in place,"" Belchior said.
Some cinemas said they still needed time for safety measures and were unsure what to show as production constraints have delayed some premieres.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 12:45PM ET</span>",Israeli defence chief says he's preparing for consequences of West Bank annexations,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz said on Monday he ordered the military to step up preparations for Israel's pending annexation of parts of the West Bank, a plan that could stoke Palestinian violence.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged to begin cabinet discussions on July 1 on extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, occupied territory that Palestinians seek for a state.
Gantz's directive appeared to indicate that the centrist politician had either signed on to the move, or at least believed it would be inevitable, given right-wing support in the Netanyahu-led coalition cabinet.
In public remarks to legislators of his centrist Blue and White party, Gantz noted a recent uptick in anti-Israeli violence in the West Bank and the Palestinians' declaration last month that they were ending security cooperation with Israel over the annexation issue.
He said he had subsequently ordered the chief of staff, Lieutenant-General Aviv Kochavi, to ""examine all the ramifications and the required preparations"" stemming from moving ahead with the peace plan U.S. President Donald Trump announced in January, a blueprint that could ease annexation.
In a separate written statement, Gantz said ""preparations by the Israel Defence Forces should be stepped up ahead of pending diplomatic moves regarding the Palestinians"".
The Palestinians have rejected Trump's proposal, under which the vast majority of West Bank settlements built by Israel on land captured in the 1967 Middle East war would be incorporated into ""contiguous Israeli territory"".
The Palestinians and most countries consider such settlements illegal. Israel disputes this.
The Trump plan also envisages a Palestinian state under near-complete Israeli security control, creating what Palestinians leaders say would be an unviable country.
Sami Abu Zuhri, an official with Islamist group Hamas which rules the Gaza Strip, another part of Palestinians' hoped-for future state, told Reuters: ""The call of the occupation army to get ready for annexation of the West Bank is a call for war, and the occupation will regret this crime, and soon realise they are committing a grave mistake.""

""Leave things alone on Sunday,"" the right-wing president said, referring to the protests, at the gates of his official residence the day after he greeted supporters on horseback at a rally against the top court.
Bolsonaro's critics blame him for undermining Brazil's democracy by endorsing almost weekly protests against the top court, which authorized an investigation into the president for allegedly interfering with police appointments for personal motives.
The judge heading that probe said the way Bolsonaro was endangering democracy was comparable to Hitler's Germany. 
In rallies in Brasilia, Sao Paulo and other big cities on Sunday, his supporters urged the military to intervene and close down Congress and the Supreme Court. 
Anti-Bolsonaro demonstrators protesting against what they said was ""fascism"" threatening Brazil's democratic system clashed with police in a counter-demonstration on Sao Paulo's main avenue, hurling stones at riot police who responded with tear gas.
Bolsonaro said he had no role in organizing the protests against the Supreme Court. ""I don't coordinate anything ... I just attend,"" he said.
The confrontation between Bolsonaro and the court thrust Brazil into a political crisis in the midst of the world's second worst outbreak of coronavirus that has paralyzed Latin America's largest economy and raised fears of a military coup.
In a newspaper interview published on Monday, Vice President Hamilton Mourao, a retired army general, said there was no danger of a coup. But he urged the country's institutions to allow the democratically elected Bolsonaro to govern the country.
""Let the guy govern! If he makes mistakes, as others have in the past, there are elections in 2022 and he will be judged by voters,"" the vice president told Valor Economico.

Ahmed Mismari, spokesman for the eastern-based Libyan National Army under Khalifa Haftar, said in a message that the LNA had retaken Asaba, and footage was published online that appeared to show LNA fighters inside the town. 
Haftar launched an offensive in April 2019 to capture the capital Tripoli, seat of the U.N.-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), but has lost ground recently. 
With Turkish backing, the GNA has retaken a string of towns near the Tunisian border, a strategically important airbase and much of the LNA's foothold in Tripoli's southern suburbs. 
The GNA took Asaba last month, putting pressure on the LNA's last major stronghold in northwestern Libya, the town of Tarhouna. There was no immediate comment from the GNA on Monday on whether it had lost Asaba. 
Mismari said the LNA had captured Asaba after air strikes there. During LNA losses of ground last month, Turkish drones were crucial to GNA advances and the GNA said they had destroyed several LNA air defence systems. 
The LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, has been targeting Tripoli for months with artillery fire and on Sunday shelling killed civilians in an area held by the GNA.

MADRID (Reuters) - Dancing with masks on, sipping drinks with straws and keeping to marked off areas of the dance floor are among post-lockdown safety proposals aimed at helping Spain's nightclubs reopen their doors in time for the summer season.
Clubs have been shut since the government imposed one of the most stringent coronavirus restrictions in Europe in March, which devastated the tourism sector that accounts for more than 12% of Spanish GDP.
With the lockdown now easing, the National Federation of Leisure and Entertainment Businesses (FNEOE), an industry group, and the Institute for Quality Tourism, a lobby group, have drawn up safety guidelines as they wait for the green light for clubs to open.
The plan recommends masks should be compulsory on the dance floor and clubbers would have to wash their hands as they enter and leave discos. Dance floors would be clearly marked off from other parts of clubs so customers did not mix and drinks would only be served with disposable straws.
The nightlife sector, including ""super clubs"" on the island of Ibiza such as Pacha, Amnesia, and Eden that are popular with tourists, produces annual revenue of some 20 billion euros ($22 billion), according to the FNEOE.
Getting it restarted will depend on the approval of the government, which has so far only allowed bars to open outdoor terraces, and with limited capacity. There is no word yet on when nightclubs will be allowed to open.
""These guidelines were drawn up by doctors to try to ensure that people can enjoy an essential part of the Spanish life in a safe way,"" said FNEOE spokesman Vicente Pizcueta, adding that he hoped things will return to normal in July.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday a nationwide vote on constitutional reforms will be held on July 1, announcing a new date for a delayed ballot that could extend his rule until 2036.
Putin postponed the original vote, which had been set for April 22, because of the coronavirus outbreak, saying the health and safety of citizens was his top priority as the global coronavirus pandemic worsened.
But he told a government meeting on Monday that the situation had broadly stabilised and the vote could go ahead.
The number of coronavirus infections in Moscow has dropped sharply, he said, allowing the capital to start easing some restrictions. 
The changes that Russians will vote on, already approved by parliament and Russia's Constitutional Court, would reset Putin's presidential term tally to zero, allowing him to serve two more back-to-back six year terms until 2036 if reelected.
""I really hope the country's citizens will take part actively in the vote on the amendments to the constitution,"" Putin, whose current term ends in 2024, told a televised government meeting.

Critics have dismissed the vote as a constitutional coup which they fear will be rigged and urged voters to stay away or to reject the proposed changes.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - As Lebanon's debilitating economic crisis drags on, Lebanese whose living standards have plunged are relying more and more on a growing support system of charities and private initiatives to fend off hunger.
The financial crisis that came to a head last year has inflicted mounting hardship on Lebanese who have seen prices soar, jobs disappear and the value of the pound currency sink - and that was before the added blow of the coronavirus pandemic.
As Beirut negotiates an International Monetary Fund programme it is counting on to spark a recovery, an array of charitable initiatives have scrambled to fill a void left by the heavily indebted state.
Last month nearly 100 non-governmental organisations jointly began what they called one of the largest food campaigns ever in the country, gathering donations from expatriates to provide a month's worth of food for 50,000 families.
""We will keep trying as much as we can to collect money and keep distributing (food). But we can't feed 1.2 million or 2 million Lebanese...This is a state's work and we are not a state,"" said Maya Ibrahimchah, president of Beit El Baraka, one of the organisations involved.
The food drives have spawned scenes that would have seemed unimaginable just a year ago in the Mediterranean country of 6 million people, where banking and tourism once brought relative prosperity.
On Sunday, needy Lebanese queued on Beirut's seafront across from luxury car dealerships and designer shops to take home rations of potatoes, onions and bread, part of a separate initiative run by businessman Fadi Khairo. 
""Families across Lebanon are appealing to us to stand by their side during this crisis so they can feed their families,"" Khairo said as car trunks were loaded with chicken, dairy produce, biscuits and cabbages.
""There are people telling us, 'Our fridges are empty. We can't feed our children. I don't have milk for my children',"" said Khairo. ""It makes you cry.""

Trump and Moon spoke by phone at the U.S. president's request, the Blue House said.
Trump said on Saturday that he was postponing until September the G7 summit that had been scheduled for late June, and that he wanted to invite Australia, Russia, South Korea and India to the meeting. 
Trump said the G7 was an old system that did not reflect the current international situation, according to the Blue House.
Moon told Trump he would welcome the inclusion of other countries and said it would be a sign of progress in the face of the global coronavirus crisis.

""If at an appropriate time, a (leaders') meeting can take place successfully, it will be a signal that the world is returning to normal conditions and economy,"" Moon said, according to the statement.

Health Minister Eteni Longondo said four people who died in Mbandaka were confirmed as positive cases following testing at the national biomedical laboratory in the capital Kinshasa.
""We have a new Ebola epidemic in Mbandaka,"" Longondo told reporters. ""We are going to very quickly send them the vaccine and medicine.""
The outbreak was confirmed by World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who tweeted: ""This outbreak is a reminder that #COVID19 is not the only health threat people face."" 
Congo has been struggling to put an end to a nearly two-year-old Ebola outbreak near its eastern borders with Rwanda and Uganda, which has killed more than 2,200 people, the world's second-deadliest outbreak of the disease on record.

Those who fail to comply with the rules on masks risk a fine of around $252.
""This was supposed to happen from the very beginning, so that (people) learn discipline and learn the rules. We are a country that needs discipline,"" Isis said, standing near a shop in central Cairo and wearing a mask. 
Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country, has registered nearly 25,000 cases of the coronavirus and reported 959 deaths.
Infections rose sharply during the last week marking the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan, when families typically gather for the festivities. A total of 1,536 cases were confirmed on Sunday, double the number on the same day a week ago.
Egypt's population is overwhelmingly young, but cities are crowded, making it more difficult for people to socially distance.
Reuters witnesses said that police in Cairo were not allowing people inside some banks and metro stations on Sunday and Monday if they were not wearing masks.
""Today people are following the rules. It is good that people are becoming more aware and abiding by this decision ... People today are protecting themselves, protecting their homes, protecting their families,"" Adel Othman said through his mask, as he stood in line to enter a bank.
Some people worried that the new rules would add to the financial burden on a population where millions live in poverty.

The government said in May that it was going to offer cloth face masks at 5 Egyptian pounds ($0.31) a piece that were viable for use for one month.

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Philadelphia's new voting machines under scrutiny in Tuesday's elections,"By Julia Harte
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When Pennsylvania holds primary elections on Tuesday, some election security advocates will be watching closely to see if more than 2,000 new voting machines acquired last year by Philadelphia and two other counties perform without glitches. 
Philadelphia and Northampton counties first used the new “ExpressVote XL” machines in last November's local elections and will deploy them again in the presidential nominating contests and local races on Tuesday. A third county, Cumberland, will use the machines for the first time.
Their first widespread use in 2019 in Pennsylvania was marred by miscounted vote tallies in Northampton, a politically divided county in eastern Pennsylvania. Some ExpressVote XL machines incorrectly recorded votes for several candidates in the November election, prompting the county to count backup paper receipts to identify the correct winners, according to Maudeania Hornik, chair of the Northampton Election Commission.
The manufacturer of the ExpressVote XL equipment said in a December press conference that some of Northampton's 320 machines ""were configured improperly at our factory prior to delivery to Northampton County."" The manufacturer told the county as many as 30% of the machines were affected, Hornik said. 
Problems with at least 366 ExpressVote XL machines also arose in Philadelphia, according to public records exclusively obtained by Reuters. The city last year replaced its old voting equipment with a new fleet of 3,750 ExpressVote XL machines. Reuters could not ascertain how many of those machines were deployed in the November 2019 election there.
Philadelphia is home to 20% of registered Democrats in Pennsylvania, a crucial battleground state that could determine who wins the presidency in November. 
Poll workers and technicians reported issues with the new machines at more than 40% of polling locations in Philadelphia during last November's election, according to the records reviewed by Reuters. Problems included touchscreens that were hypersensitive or that froze; paper voting receipts getting jammed in the machines; and panels opening on some machines to expose the equipment's electronic controls, the records show.
Katina Granger, a spokeswoman for the ExpressVote XL’s manufacturer, ES&S, said the company was “wholly confident” in the machines, and that it was ""simply inaccurate"" for anyone to imply there were widespread issues with the ExpressVote XL.
The machines face a big test on Tuesday. After Pennsylvania postponed its 2020 primary originally scheduled for April due to COVID-19 pandemic fears, Philadelphia reduced its in-person polling sites to 190 locations, down from more than 800 that would typically be operating. Those sites are more concentrated in neighborhoods dominated by low-income and minority voters, U.S. Census data show. Pennsylvania allows residents to vote by mail for any reason, but just 20% of Philadelphia's electorate requested absentee ballots for the June 2 contest.
(For a graphic showing voting disparity in Philadelphia, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2XOmdoS)
Philadelphia, Northampton and Cumberland, in central Pennsylvania, have yet to announce if the machines will also be used in November’s presidential race between Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Counties typically avoid switching voting systems in major election years. 
Reuters reviewed records of 605 phone calls from Philadelphia poll workers who reported problems with the ExpressVote XL machines last November to an Election Day technical help line run by the city. Reuters also spoke with 13 poll workers and voters who said they experienced some of those issues firsthand. 
Reuters received copies of the call records -- known as “trouble cards” -- from four Philadelphia voters, two of whom are among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit demanding Pennsylvania end use of the machines. The case, which was brought by two nonpartisan election integrity groups and several voters, is currently pending in a Pennsylvania state court. 
Philadelphia Deputy City Commissioner Nick Custodio made the records available to the voters in accordance with a law that allows Pennsylvania voters to view and copy such information. 
When asked for comment about the trouble cards, Custodio said there were fewer and less serious calls about the ExpressVote XL machines in November 2019 than there had been about the city's previous machines in past elections. Custodio did not address the number of trouble cards, or provide comparable totals of trouble cards from previous elections.
In an email to Reuters, he called the city’s experience with the new voting equipment “overwhelmingly positive,” and also said the news agency had engaged in “bias (sic) fact gathering” by obtaining copies of some records from the two voters who are plaintiffs in the state lawsuit. Reuters requested the records under Pennsylvania's right-to-know law. Philadelphia's deputy solicitor turned down that request, citing a state law that said the records ""may be inspected and copied by any qualified elector of the county,"" meaning Pennsylvania voters. Reuters then asked some voters to copy and share them with the news agency, four of whom did so.
Matthew Lilly, president of a company that serviced the old voting machines in Philadelphia that were replaced by the ExpressVote XLs, disputed Custodio's assertion that previous elections generated more machine issues. Lilly said that in his two decades working with the city, he did not recall any election that resulted in more than 500 trouble cards.
Reuters could not independently confirm how many trouble cards Philadelphia's voting machines typically generated in previous elections.
ES&S spokeswoman Granger said ""additional quality control and training have been instituted"" for the Pennsylvania machines since November.
Based in Omaha, Nebraska, ES&S is one of the largest election-machine manufacturers in the United States. The company released the ExpressVote XL in 2018. The machine was a successor to its earlier ExpressVote model that is used by 1,838 counties around the country. 
When voting on an ExpressVote XL machine, voters insert a blank page into the machine and make their choices by tapping an interactive screen. The machine then prints a receipt for voters to review, with their choices listed both in human-readable text along with an accompanying barcode that represents each candidate they selected. The machine uses the barcodes to tabulate results. 
Even before last November, some election security experts in Pennsylvania raised concerns that ExpressVote XL machines are vulnerable to vote tampering, in part because voters have no way of knowing if those barcodes accurately reflect the candidates for whom they voted. Separate from the state suit, a different group of voter advocates filed a federal suit to stop Pennsylvania from using the machines over similar concerns.
A federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed that suit in April, saying plaintiffs had not proven the machines were recording votes incorrectly or were vulnerable to being hacked.
Marian Schneider, who served as Pennsylvania’s deputy secretary for Elections and Administration from February 2015 until May 2017, said that “hiccups” could be expected with the rollout of any new voting system.
""But this number of trouble cards recorded in a low-turnout election year (2019) is concerning,"" said Schneider, who is currently president of Verified Voting, a secure voting technology advocacy group. Schneider is not part of litigation involving the ExpressVote XL machines.
West Philadelphia voter Susie Mizelle told Reuters she was shocked last November to see a panel on top of her ExpressVote XL open, with a USB drive and a power button visible. Mizelle, 44, asked precinct captain Thelma Peake why the machine’s internal system was accessible to voters. Peake told her the panels on the machines kept “popping open,” according to both women.
Peake said she eventually got the panel closed, but it remained “easy to tamper with.”
ExpressVote XL machines only accept ""certified and approved USB flash drives containing encrypted data,"" according to ES&S, making it impossible for other devices to ""change the election definition or system firmware.""
Three of six counties in New Jersey and Delaware that also use ExpressVote XL machines said they had not experienced any problems with them. Combined, they have used 700 machines so far.
    ""There were no issues relative to tabulating the votes, or how voters marked their votes,"" said Nicole DiRado, the elections board administrator of Union County, New Jersey, which has deployed 432 machines in local elections so far.
    The other three counties did not respond to requests for comment.
'ANOTHER CHANCE'
In Philadelphia, at least 1,703 ExpressVote XL machines will be deployed in Tuesday’s election, the city elections board said.
Philadelphia residents who show up in person to vote on June 2 will likely be “older, blacker, and poorer,” said Pennsylvania State Representative Chris Rabb, who also runs Philadelphia’s ninth ward Democratic committee.
Rabb, who last year asked Pennsylvania to investigate concerns that ExpressVote XL machines were not secure, said he was “deeply concerned” that those voters will have to crowd into fewer polling places and use the machines on Tuesday.
Northampton County will deploy 315 machines. It is one of the most competitive counties in America's presidential battleground states, places set to play an outsized role in November. Cumberland County will operate 384 ExpressVote XL machines. 
The three counties are home to 17% of the state’s registered voters and nearly a quarter of its registered Democrats. Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by less than a percentage point in Pennsylvania in 2016, a narrow victory that helped propel him to the White House.
More than one third of the 605 trouble cards from Philadelphia’s 2019 election showed the ExpressVote XL machines were unusable for some period of time during the voting.
The most frequently reported issues -- mentioned in 117 cards -- were screen problems, such as screens being too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Two dozen reported security issues, such as panels popping open to reveal software installation areas of the machines.
One in five trouble cards reviewed by Reuters said the city help line had not resolved the issue that prompted the call. 
Custodio said in an email that the machines underwent testing before the 2019 election to ensure accuracy, and that the “vast vast majority” of issues with them were solved by phone.
Amanda Feifer, who oversaw Election Day staffing and logistics in a South Philadelphia ward last November, cited issues with touchscreens not highlighting the choices voters tapped. She said it took voters longer to vote than usual, leading to long lines that some voters walked away from.
“Nobody could tell me a story that would convince me that (the machines) were okay, because I witnessed it firsthand,"" Feifer said.
Custodio said more than 86% of election judges, the officials who supervise polling places, reported that wait times at their sites were less than 20 minutes, according to a post-election survey conducted by the city. He did not share the survey with Reuters. 
Northampton election commission chief Hornik said she was the “Number One supporter” of the ExpressVote XL machines when the county procured them for $2.88 million in 2019.

Her county's experience last year now has left her fearful about potential, possibly undetectable errors that could affect results. However, the county has not allocated funds to invest in a new voting system, Hornik said, “so we have to give them another chance.”

Until earlier this year, Zaidi Recyclers had a thriving business in processing waste paper which it exported to customers in China and India, earning it around $37,000 in revenues monthly, according to its founder Allen Kimambo. 
New orders dried up, however, as country after country imposed lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, reducing global trade to a trickle. 
Yet Kimambo quickly spotted an opportunity which allowed him to save his business and the jobs of all its 38 workers. Zaidi Recyclers switched to the production of face shields, a vital piece of personal protective equipment for health workers during the coronavirus pandemic.
""I think key is to remain relevant. You should not panic, because these crises have been there, this is not the first time we are facing this kind of crisis,"" he said.
""If you panic, you will get lost and then you will not be able to come up or be active as you used to be before.""
Orders are flooding from the health sector from across Tanzania, Kimbabo said. In recent weeks they had made 6,000 units that go for about $2 apiece. 
Tanzania has so far recorded 509 coronavirus cases and 21 deaths.
Authorities have said the disruptions from the pandemic are expected to slow economic growth in 2020 to 4% from a projection of 6.9% made before the outbreak. 

The firm has had to meet extra costs to protect its employees while keeping the business in operation, including for special transportation to and from the workplace.

AYUTTHAYA, Thailand (Reuters) - Momentum is building behind Thailand's push to create its own coronavirus vaccine, with more manpower and resources dedicated to the effort amid hopes it could boost medical tourism.
Thai trials of an experimental vaccine using monkeys started last month, one of at least 100 potential vaccines being developed globally. The government is hopeful it will have a cost-effective vaccine ready for next year.
Bionet-Asia, a local firm working with the government and a top Bangkok university, has put all other activities on hold and dedicated 250 personnel and all of its labs, technology and production facilities to developing a COVID-19 vaccine.
""In the case of COVID, there is a global effort to speed up experiment, trials, to share information, share diagnostics and that's why we are in a position too, to move very fast,"" chief executive officer, Pham Hong Thai, told Reuters.
He said tests on animals had so far shown encouraging results and the next step would be seeking government approval for clinical trials involving humans.
With just over 3,082 cases and 57 deaths, Thailand has had some success in containing the coronavirus and eased many of its restrictions in response to low infection numbers.
It has been seven days without a case of local transmission, with all infections this past week found among quarantined nationals returning from overseas.
Public Health Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said it was important to channel all efforts towards the development of a vaccine and put Thailand on the medical map.

""Thailand has a good healthcare system, good medical practices. It will garner a lot of interest from tourists and investors and boost us as a medical hub,"" he said.

The Southeast Asian nation is one of several states globally that have made masks in public compulsory, but transparent shields attached to headbands or glasses that do not touch the face have become a popular replacement. 
Singapore is due to reopen schools and some businesses on Tuesday, the first tentative steps in emerging from a two-month COVID-19 lockdown. 
""The design of face shields typically leaves a gap... Masks that are worn closely and completely over the nose and mouth do not have such gaps,"" the health ministry said. 
""With the re-opening of our economy and society, we can expect more activities and close contact amongst people, including on public transport. So masks will now be required as the default.""
Face shields would only be allowed for children under the age of 12, those who face medical difficulties wearing masks or persons speaking to a large group, such as in a classroom. 
First-time offenders caught without a mask in Singapore are fined S$300 ($212).

Singapore confirmed 408 new coronavirus cases on Monday, its health ministry said, bringing the city-state's tally to 35,292.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has approved sweeping new rules for procurement and spending in the Vatican meant to cut costs, ensure transparent competition and reduce the risk of corruption in awarding contracts.
An Apostolic Letter and 30 pages of new norms released on Monday are the culmination of a four-year process to rationalise spending procedures and tackle nepotism and cronyism.
They come as the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc with the Vatican's finances, forcing it to implement some of the toughest cost-control measures ever.
In his letter, Francis said the new norms would allow for ""a considerable reduction in the danger of corruption"".
The new rules mandate highly detailed, transparent procedures for awarding contracts for goods and services. Most Vatican contracts are with Italian companies. 
Documents leaked during the pontificate of Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict, showed that a Vatican department paid an Italian construction company an exorbitant amount to build a nativity scene in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ).
An important change is the institution of a single list of approved suppliers for all Vatican departments, whereas previously each kept their own list.
Professor Vincenzo Buonomo, rector of the Pontifical Lateran University, told the official Vatican News website that this measure would help eliminate favouritism, and ensure fair competition and economy of scale.
Vatican sources have said that in the past, for example, they had to buy office supplies from a firm that had been used for years even though they were available for less elsewhere.
Buonomo said the new norms would bring the Vatican into full compliance with the United Nations' Merida Convention against corruption, which the Holy See signed in 2016.

Giuseppe Pignatone, a former Italian anti-Mafia prosecutor who now heads the Vatican's court system, said the norms give judicial officials the power to suspend suspicious contracts.

An Airbus test plane, unusually commissioned to transport the boxes because of disruption from the coronavirus crisis, was due to arrive on Monday afternoon at Le Bourget near Paris where France's BEA air accident agency was standing by to open them.
The French agency is involved in the Pakistan-led probe because the crashed A320 was designed by France-based Airbus, and is additionally carrying out the crucial task of decoding the recorders because it has state-of-the-art equipment.
The A320 operated by Pakistan International Airlines crashed short of the runway on May 22, killing 97 people on board after the pilots reported the loss of both engines. 
Two passengers survived and there were no reports of casualties on the ground. The crash site remained sealed off on Monday.
BEA experts are expected to open and download information from the boxes - one containing cockpit voice recordings and the other aircraft data - on Tuesday, subject to the recording chips being intact inside their crash-resistant shells.
Initial reports suggested the jetliner scraped its engines along the runway on a first attempt to land following what appeared to be an unstable approach, arriving steep and fast.
Investigators will analyse the cockpit data to try to understand whether damage to the engines from the first landing attempt caused them to cut out before the second attempt, leaving the airplane unable to make it to the airport perimeter.
Experts warn it is too early to say what caused the crash.
In Karachi, as officials continued to try to identify victims' bodies using DNA samples, families took to social media to voice their grief at not being able to perform the last rites of their loved ones. 

The airline said on Sunday problems in identifying victims were caused by delays in DNA identification outside its control.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese state media is giving extensive coverage to violent protests roiling cities across the United States, while the unrest has also featured widely in Chinese social media.
The death of George Floyd, a 46-year old black man, while in police custody last week has sparked demonstrations and unrest across the politically and racially divided country.
China's state-run CCTV aired parts of an interview that his brother, Philonise Floyd, gave to U.S. news channel MSNBC in its noon broadcast on Monday, where he said U.S. President Donald Trump did not give him the opportunity to speak during a phone call and where he cried at the mention of his brother.
While the unrest in U.S. cities has been widely reported by international media, China's interest comes at a time when relations between the two are particularly strained.
CCTV featured reports from one of its reporters running with protesters in Minnesota, as well as short videos shot by Americans depicting police violence against protesters. 
On China's social media platform Weibo (NASDAQ:WB), at least five news items on the protests were among the top 20 trending topics by midday, led by reports Trump had been temporarily taken to a bunker as protesters surrounded the White House.
On Twitter, the protests also featured widely among the top 20 trending items, with the hashtag #BunkerBoy at a prominent second place.
For some analysts, the Chinese media coverage of the protests echoed their reporting on the coronavirus situation in the United States.
""The number one thing they want to show is that the Communist Party is doing a better job in terms of fighting the coronavirus and managing society,"" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.
""That's the main message: the U.S. is not doing good.""
Some Chinese media have made comparisons between the U.S. protests and those in Hong Kong, the latest flashpoint in U.S.-China tensions. Trump has begun the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish Beijing's decision to impose new national security laws on the territory.
The state-run China Daily posted a political cartoon showing a coronavirus patient saying ""I can't breathe"" - the dying words of Floyd - as a figure resembling Trump walks away after cutting the line to an oxygen tank labelled ""WHO"". 
That was a reference to his decision to withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization on Friday. 

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying wrote on Twitter on Saturday ""I can't breathe"" in response to a tweet from U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus criticising China's actions in Hong Kong.

LONDON (Reuters) - English schools reopen on Monday for the first time since they were shut 10 weeks ago because of the coronavirus pandemic, but many parents planned to keep children at home amid fears ministers were moving too fast.
The easing of strict measures will mean classes will restart for some younger children, up to six people can meet outside in England, outdoor markets can reopen, elite competitive sport can resume without spectators and more than 2 million of the most vulnerable will now be allowed to spend time outdoors.
But with Britain recording one of the highest death rates from COVID-19, many are worried that it is happening too soon, including a number of scientists who advise the government who have warned it could lead to a second spike in infections.
""The overall view from SAGE - the scientific advisory group on emergencies which advises the government - their overall view is that we must do this cautiously and that is precisely what we are doing,"" business minister Alok Sharma told BBC TV.
""These are very cautious steps that we are taking,"" he said, while adding it was a ""very sensitive moment"".
Ministers have been wrestling with how to kickstart the economy, which has been devastated by the lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, while avoiding a possible second wave of infections which would cause further damage. 
The government says the relaxation of rules on Monday represents only a limited easing but there has been concern that the country is still not ready for the changes, and that more people are beginning to ignore guidelines on social distancing. 
A survey for the National Foundation for Educational Research found school leaders estimated 46% of parents would keep their children at home because of concerns, fears echoed by some health officials. 

Britain has recorded more than 38,000 deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases while the Office of National Statistics and other sources of data put the figure of fatalities from suspected and confirmed cases at 48,000.

The two drones were launched toward the border town of Khamis Mushait, SPA said, accusing Houthi forces of targeting civilian facilities and residential areas.
The Houthis did not confirm the attacks. The group's media reported dozens of air strikes on Sunday by the coalition's warplanes against several provinces including Marib, where fighting has raged over the last three months.
A unilateral ceasefire announced by the Saudi-led coalition in April expired last week without leading to a permanent truce, after the Houthi movement rejected the offer. Violence has continued in several provinces. 
However, missile and drone attack against Saudi cities have decreased significantly this year thanks to peace efforts led by United Nations' special envoy Martin Griffiths and to indirect talks between the kingdom and Houthi officials.

1351,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>",Factbox: China's numerous diplomatic disputes,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is engaged in diplomatic disputes on numerous fronts, from acrimony with the United States to a backlash over its clampdown on Hong Kong, a border dispute with India and criticism over its handling of the novel coronavirus.
Following are some of the main points of contention between China and other countries:
UNITED STATES
From disputes over trade and technology, to U.S. criticism over the coronavirus outbreak and China's accusation of U.S. backing for protests in Hong Kong, ties between the world's two biggest economies are at their lowest point in decades.
HONG KONG
China's plan to impose national security legislation on Hong Kong provoked U.S. retaliation and disapproval from other Western capitals. The city's former colonial ruler Britain said it would offer extended visa rights to British national overseas (BNO) passport holders from Hong Kong.
CORONAVIRUS
Several countries, including the United States and Australia, have called for China to be held to account for its early handling of the coronavirus, which emerged late last year in the city of Wuhan. China has also faced criticism for what some have characterised as heavy-handed ""virus diplomacy"".
TAIWAN
China has stepped up diplomatic and military pressure on Chinese-claimed but democratically ruled Taiwan, trying to coax it into accepting Chinese rule. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, re-elected by a landslide in January, has rejected that, saying only Taiwan's people can decide its future.
INDIA
China and India are engaged in the most serious military standoff on their disputed border since 2017, with soldiers in the remote Ladakh region accusing each other of encroachment.
XINJIANG
China has been criticised in Washington and elsewhere over its treatment of ethnic Uighur Muslims in its western Xinjiang region. Last month, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved legislation calling for sanctions on officials responsible for oppression of Uighurs.
HUAWEI
The United States has raised security concerns over equipment provided by Chinese telecoms gear giant Huawei, warning that allies that use it in their networks risked being cut off from valuable intelligence-sharing feeds. Last month, the United States moved to block global chip supplies to Huawei, which denies that its equipment poses a security risk.
CANADA
Ties have been strained since Canada arrested Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, daughter of the firm's founder, in late 2018. Soon after, China detained two Canadians and blocked imports of some canola seed. Meng lost a court ruling last month in her fight against extradition to the United States. 
EUROPEAN UNION
EU foreign ministers agreed last week to toughen their strategy on China to counter its increasingly assertive diplomacy against a backdrop of concern about Hong Kong. The bloc has been frustrated over market access for its companies in China, which has sought to block an EU report alleging that China was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to diplomatic sources. 
AUSTRALIA
China last month imposed tariffs on barley imports from Australia, the latest escalation between them. Relations soured in 2018 when Australia banned Huawei from its 5G broadband network, and China has been angered by Australia's call for an independent enquiry into the coronavirus.
SOUTH CHINA SEA

China has overlapping claims in the energy-rich South China Sea, which is also an important trade route, with the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan. The United States has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the coronavirus to advance its presence in the waters.

China's parliament last week voted to move forward with imposing national security legislation on Hong Kong, which U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday was a tragedy for the people of the city, and which violated China's promise to protect its autonomy.
Trump ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China, ranging from extradition treatment to export controls.
But he stopped short of calling an immediate end to privileges that have helped the former British colony remain a global financial centre.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China firmly opposed the U.S. steps.
""The announced measures severely interfere with China's internal affairs, damage U.S.-China relations, and will harm both sides. China is firmly opposed to this,"" Zhao told reporters during a regular briefing.
""Any words or actions by the U.S. that harm China's interests will meet with China's firm counterattack,"" he said.
But Hong Kong shares (HSI) surged more than 3% on Monday as investors took comfort that Trump did not immediately end the special U.S. privileges. 
At the close of trade, the Hang Seng index (HSI) was up 3.36%, its biggest one-day percentage gain since March 25.
""Chinese policymakers would likely want to see precisely what the US implements before responding with further policy adjustments or retaliation of their own,"" Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) wrote in a note on Sunday.
In making his Friday announcement, Trump used some of his toughest rhetoric yet against China, saying it had broken its word over Hong Kong's autonomy by moving to impose the new national security legislation and the territory no longer warranted U.S. economic privileges.
Trump said China's ""malfeasance"" was responsible for massive suffering and economic damage worldwide.
He said the United States would also impose sanctions on individuals seen as responsible for ""smothering - absolutely smothering - Hong Kong's freedom"" but he did not name any of the potential sanctions targets. 
Trump gave no time frame for the action, suggesting he may be trying to buy time before deciding whether to implement the most drastic measures, which have drawn strong resistance from U.S. companies operating in Hong Kong.

Earlier, Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government told the United States to keep out of the national security debate, and warned that withdrawal of the financial hub's special status could backfire on the U.S. economy.

Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a daily briefing that the international community disagreed with what he described as the selfish behaviour of the United States.
""The U.S. has become addicted to quitting groups and scrapping treaties,"" said Zhao. 
President Donald Trump announced on Friday the United States would cut ties with the WHO, accusing the U.N. agency of becoming a puppet of China.
The WHO has denied Trump's assertions that it promoted Chinese ""disinformation"" about the virus.
Trump's decision came after a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping to give $2 billion to the WHO over the next two years to help combat the novel coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year.
The EU on Saturday urged the United States to reconsider its decision.
China calls on the international community to provide more political support and funding for the WHO, said Zhao. 
The U.S. decision to quit the Geneva-based agency comes amid growing tension between the United States and China over the coronavirus outbreak.
Since taking office, Trump has questioned the value of the United Nations and scorned the importance of multilateralism as he focuses on an ""America First"" agenda.
He has quit the U.N. Human Rights Council, the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO, a global accord to tackle climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and opposed a U.N. migration pact.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Several Australian states eased social distancing restrictions further on Monday, allowing restaurants to host more people and public attractions to reopen, as the government moves to revive an ailing economy through accelerated infrastructure spending.
Australia has recorded about 7,200 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths. And, with new infections now largely under control, the government has embarked on a three-step plan to remove the bulk of curbs by July.
In Australia's most populous state, New South Wales (NSW), a maximum of 50 people are now allowed to sit down for a meal in a cafe or restaurants, while 20 can attend a funeral. The previous limits were set at 10.
Public attractions, such as art galleries, museums, and libraries and zoos were also allowed to reopen.
""It's pretty crazy being back out into society and we’re super excited to get to the zoo,"" Elizabeth Conlon, who took her two kids to Sydney's Taronga Zoo, told Reuters.
""They were very excited this morning, getting up and knowing that it was a zoo day. We used to come to the zoo all the time as well, so it’s very exciting to get back here.""
While reopening public spaces for the first time in several months, authorities have said there will be limits on the number of people allowed to enter in a bid to ensure there is no second wave of infections.
Each site will need to ensure a social distancing norm of 1.5 meters between visitors is observed at all time.
In Victoria state, which has taken the most cautious approach to reopening, restaurants and cafes could reopen on Monday. However, patrons are restricted to a maximum of 20 people.
Australia hopes removing restrictions will boost economic growth, though Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday that additional, targeted stimulus would be needed.
Australia's government and central bank has pledged about A$250 billion ($167 billion) in stimulus, though the bulk of this is expected to end by September.
The government is considering a plan to offer homeowners one-off grants for renovations, while federal infrastructure projects will be bought forward, Morrison said.
He added that the government plans to spend another A$5.25 billion to extend a train route to a airport being constructed in the west of Sydney.

""A big part of coming out of the COVID-19 crisis is our infrastructure spending,"" Morrison told 2GB Radio.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jun 01, 2020 02:27AM ET</span>",Scientists hunt pandemic hotspots in race to test vaccines,"By Kate Kelland and Julie Steenhuysen
LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic may be waning. For vaccine developers, that could be a problem.
Scientists in Europe and the United States say the relative success of draconian lockdown and social distancing policies in some areas and countries means virus transmission rates may be at such low levels that there is not enough disease circulating to truly test potential vaccines.
They may need to look further afield, to pandemic hotspots in Africa and Latin America, to get convincing results. 
""Ironically, if we're really successful using public health measures to stamp out the hot spots of viral infection, it will be harder to test the vaccine,"" said Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States.
A vaccine is seen as essential to ending a pandemic that has killed nearly 370,000 people and infected more than 6 million so far, with world leaders looking at inoculation as the only real way to restart their stalled economies. 
But running large-scale clinical trials of potential vaccines against a completely new disease at speed is complex, scientists say. Showing efficacy in those trials during a fluctuating pandemic adds extra difficulty - and doing so when outbreaks are waning makes it harder still.
""For this to work, people need to have a risk of infection in the community. If the virus has been temporarily cleared out, then the exercise is futile,"" said Ayfer Ali, an expert in drug repurposing at Britain's Warwick Business School.
""The solution is to move to areas where the infection is being spread widely in the community – that would be countries like Brazil and Mexico at the moment."" 
Vaccine trials work by randomly dividing people into a treatment group and a control group, with the treatment group getting the experimental trial vaccine and the control group getting a placebo. 
All participants go back into the community where the disease is circulating, and subsequent rates of infection are compared. The hope is that infections within the control group will be higher, showing the trial vaccine is protecting the other group.
With COVID-19 epidemics in Britain, mainland Europe and the United States coming down from their peak and transmission rates of the coronavirus dropping, a key task for scientists is to chase fluctuating outbreaks and seek volunteers in sections of populations or in countries where the disease is still rife.
A similar problem emerged when scientists were seeking to test potential new vaccines against Ebola during the vast 2014 outbreak in West Africa. Then, drugmakers were forced to drastically scale back plans for large trials because their vaccines were only test-ready late in the epidemic when case numbers were dwindling. https://reut.rs/36OmkVu

Among the first COVID-19 vaccines to move into phase two, or mid-stage, trials is one from the U.S. biotech company  Moderna  (O:MRNA) and another being developed by scientists at Oxford University supported by AstraZeneca (L:AZN). The United States in July is planning to launch vast efficacy trials of 20,000 to 30,000 volunteers per vaccine. 
Collins said U.S. health officials will tap government and industry clinical trial networks in the United States first and use mapping to detect where the virus is most active. They will also consider looking abroad if domestic disease rates fall too far, he said.
The U.S. government has experience in Africa of testing vaccines against HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.
""Africa is now beginning to experience lots of cases of COVID-19. We might very well want to run part of the trial there, where we know we can collect the data effectively,"" said Collins.
Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Britain's Oxford University which has teamed up with AstraZeneca, started mid-stage trials last month which he said would aim to recruit around 10,000 people in Britain.
He told Reuters that with COVID-19 disease transmission rates dropping in the UK there is a possibility that the trial would have to be halted if they didn't have enough infections to yield a result. 
""That would be disappointing, and at the moment it's unlikely, but it's certainly a possibility,"" Hill said. 
CHALLENGE TRIALS
Underscoring the level of concern in the industry, AstraZeneca's chief executive Pascal Soriot said his researchers were even contemplating running so-called ""challenge"" trials - where participants would be given the experimental vaccine and then deliberately infected with COVID-19 to see if it worked. Such trials are rare, high risk and hard to get ethical approval for.
As a more practical and swifter option, Soriot and others are looking to Brazil and other countries in South America, as well as parts of Africa where COVID-19 outbreaks are still growing and peaking, as ripe drug and vaccine testing grounds.
Difficulty recruiting candidates for mid-stage vaccine trials in countries where the COVID-19 pandemic is on the wane may be foreshadowed by the experience of doctors seeking infected cases for the World Health Organization's multi-country Solidarity trial of potential treatments for the disease - including the generic drug hydroxychloroquine and Gilead's (O:GILD) remdesivir. 
In the Swiss portion of that trial, for instance, it took three weeks to get all of the ethical and regulatory approvals from authorities, and another week to get all the drugs, said Oriol Manuel, an infectious disease expert and national coordinator of the Solidarity study in Switzerland.

""We were able to enroll some patients in (one trial centre in) Lausanne,"" Manuel said. ""But when all centres were ready, the cases were fortunately disappearing.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa partly lifted a two month-old coronavirus lockdown on Monday, letting people outside for work, worship, exercise or shopping, and allowing mines and factories to run at full capacity to try to revive the economy.
President Cyril Ramaphosa was widely praised when he ordered one of the world's strictest lockdowns at the end of March, confining people to their homes, forcing miners and manufacturers to slash operations by half, and banning the sale of alcohol and cigarettes.
But the measures have battered the economy of Africa's most industrialised nation, which was already in recession before the virus, owing mostly to power cuts at its dysfunctional state provider, Eskom. 
The central bank expects it to contract by 7% this year.
The government hopes Monday's move to ""level 3"" lockdown will sputter businesses to a start. It will inevitably increase the number of coronavirus infections, which over the weekend jumped past 30,000. 
""The move to level 3 ... marks a significant shift in our approach to the pandemic,"" Ramaphosa was quoted in South Africa's Independent as saying on Sunday at an editors' forum. 
South Africa has so far had fewer than 700 COVID-19 deaths, while vastly more people - half of whom live below the official poverty line - are at risk from hunger because of the shutdown.
Industry officials said the outlook for the manufacturing sector remained bleak, despite the opening up. Output fell for the ninth consecutive month in February.
Philippa Rodseth, executive director of the Manufacturing Circle association, said she expected demand to come ""first and foremost in medical textiles and equipment and PPE (personal protective equipment), although that's not going to contribute to overall aggregate demand"".
Ramaphosa's move to re-open so quickly, long before new COVID-19 infections reach their peak, has been controversial.
Schools had been ordered to open on Monday for the last years of primary and secondary school, but teachers' unions and governing associations urged their staff to defy the order, saying schools were not equipped to keep staff and pupils safe. 
The education ministry backed down late on Sunday, saying pupils would only return the week after next. Teachers will report this week for training and to receive protective gear.
However, Western Cape province, which is run by the opposition Democratic Alliance, announced that its schools would re-open for those grades as planned on Monday, because they were well-equipped. 
The province is the main coronavirus hotspot, with two thirds of cases.
The Marxist main opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) have meanwhile accused authorities of sacrificing poor and vulnerable workers to the interests of a wealthy elite.
The EFF and others have also criticised the government's decision to re-open churches and other places of worship if they limit to 50 people, despite the risks of spreading the virus. 

(This story corrects to make clear central bank expects economy to contract by 7%, not 4%).

1360,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 11:46PM ET</span>","Taiwan recall vote stirs acrimony, brings new problems for KMT","TAIPEI (Reuters) - A recall vote for a high-profile mayor is stirring political acrimony in Taiwan, with accusations of voter intimidation and official interference, and could bring new problems for the main opposition party, already reeling from losing January elections.
The Kuomintang (KMT) soundly lost the presidential and parliamentary polls. Since then, under a youthful new leader, Johnny Chiang, it has tried to rethink its unpopular policy of seeking closer ties with China.
Now it faces further headaches if its defeated presidential candidate, Han Kuo-yu, loses a recall vote for mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung, a major port whose leadership post he unexpectedly won in late 2018.
On Sunday, thousands of people took to the streets there in a rally against Han, vowing to ""reclaim Kaohsiung"" and urging people to recall him in the vote on Saturday. 
Han and the KMT have called on people to boycott the vote, which the election commission approved after a petition organised by WeCare Kaohsiung, a civic group.
""Please, good friends who support Han Kuo-yu, don't vote on June 6, and don't attend any political activities,"" Han wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page last month.
Han says the government is conspiring with the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) to kick him out, alleging that the government has scheduled more trains on Saturday so people can vote. The DPP-led government says that is untrue.
Han's critics say he lacks interest in the city, pointing to the three-month leave of absence he took from his new mayoral duties to run for president.
Chang Po-yang, one of the recall vote organisers, said Han's defeat would present a ""major setback"" for the KMT's China policy as well as a rejection of closer ties with China. 
""If we succeed, it means the Kuomintang's China policy no longer has any market,"" he told Reuters. 
President Tsai Ing-wen and the DPP won January's elections on promises they would stand up to China, which claims Taiwan as its sovereign territory.
Meanwhile, Taiwan police say that they will deploy about 500 officers to polling stations after receiving reports that gangsters plan to intimidate people into not voting on Saturday.
The DPP has stepped up its attacks on the KMT's China stance. 
Premier Su Tseng-chang on Friday accused the Kuomintang of supporting ""one country, two systems"", China's proposal of autonomy to win Taiwan over.
Hong Kong, which China rules under such a system, is in the midst of protests over a Beijing-imposed security law that critics say would undermine most freedoms.

Kuomintang chairman Chiang said this was ""standard DPP trickery"" to smear the party red, a reference to the colours of China's Communist Party, and that he had repeatedly expressed his opposition to ""one country, two systems"".

Rio Tinto blew up the cave last week in Juukan Gorge, about 1,075 km (667 miles) north of Perth, as part of an expansion programme in the Pilbara iron ore region, provoking a local outcry and calls for reform of heritage protection laws.
Explosives destroyed two ancient rock shelters, where artefacts discovered included 4,000-year-old plaited human hair with genetic links to the present day traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people.
""That site, for us, that's where our ancestors were occupying their traditional land,"" PKKP director Burchell Hayes told Australian Broadcasting Corp, adding that the community felt sorrow and sadness over the loss of heritage.
The mining giant, which had been granted state government approval in 2013 to damage or destroy the site under a legal framework that is currently under review, apologised on Sunday.
""We pay our respects to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, and we are sorry for the distress we have caused,"" Iron Ore chief executive Chris Salisbury said in a statement.
The miner said that it had performed archaeological work in 2014 to preserve significant cultural heritage artefacts, recovering approximately 7,000 objects. 
Rio said that it would work with traditional owners to look at its approach to preserving heritage.
""As a matter of urgency, we are reviewing the plans of all other sites in the Juukan Gorge area,"" Salisbury said.
Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister Ken Wyatt last week flagged a need to strengthen the protection of indigenous sites, while his state counterpart said Western Australia was moving to fix out-of-date legislation.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 11:10PM ET</span>",Japan considering re-opening door to some foreigners: media,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is considering re-opening its borders to travellers from selected countries which have low levels of coronavirus infections, as it begins to ease restrictions put in place earlier this year to control the outbreak.
As schools, cinemas, sports clubs and department stores reopened in the nation's capital Tokyo on Monday, media have reported that the government is also planning to allow travellers from Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand into the country in the coming months.
There was no immediate comment from the foreign ministry.
Around 17,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Japan as of early Monday, with roughly 900 deaths.
Since February, Japan has banned entry by foreigners to limit the spread of the virus from overseas visitors.
The government is considering allowing business travellers from the four countries to enter if they test negative for COVID-19 in two separate tests conducted upon departure from their home country and arrival in Japan, the Asahi Shimbun reported, citing unnamed sources.
Once permitted into the country, visitors' movements would be restricted to areas including place of stay, company offices and factories, the newspaper said, adding that use of public transportation would be banned.
Along with Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, Australia and New Zealand are members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP-11), and have strong trade ties with Japan. 
Southeast Asia accounts for just 4.4% of global COVID-19 infections, according to the World Health Organisation, much lower than the Americas or Europe, which each account for roughly 40%.

Vietnamese youth are the fastest-growing group of foreign workers in Japan. Many arrive as part of a technical trainee programme set up by the Japanese government, which is widely seen as a way to bring in blue-collar labour in immigration-shy Japan.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 10:12PM ET</span>",Australia's stalled migrant boom derails golden economic run,"By Swati Pandey and Sam Holmes
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's three decades of uninterrupted prosperity are coming to an abrupt end as the global coronavirus pandemic crashes one of its most lucrative sources of income – immigration. 
The country has been successful in managing the outbreak and reopening its A$2 trillion ($1.33 trillion) economy, thanks in part to an early closure of its borders. 
But the policy has led to a halt in mass immigration - a key source of consumer demand, labour and growth - in an economy which is facing its first recession since the early 1990s.
Net immigration, including international students and those on skilled worker visas, is expected to fall 85% in the fiscal year to June 2021, curbing demand for everything from cars and property to education and wedding rings.
Gurmeet Tuli, who owns a jewellery store in the Sydney suburb of Parramatta, said his business is already hurting in a neighbourhood which is home to tens of thousands of migrants.
""My main clientele is young people who come here to study, they find work here and settle down, fall in love and want to get married,"" Tuli said. 
""I have not sold a single diamond ring in the past two months,"" he added, noting business is down about 40% so far this year.
So critical is migration to Australia that analysts reckon the economy would have slipped into a recession last year without new arrivals to boost population growth. 
AMP (OTC:AMLTF) Capital Chief Economist Shane Oliver estimates that population growth in recent years has boosted the economy by about one percentage point per year.
But as migration stalls, education, housing and tourism sectors are seen among the worst hit.
The drought in international student arrivals, who in recent years made up about 40% of the migrant intake, is expected to hit the A$37 billion education sector, Australia's second largest services export after tourism.
A fall in new arrivals could also dampen the construction boom in Australia's all important housing sector, which has been fuelled by migrants in big cities like Sydney and Melbourne.
(Graphic: Australia GDP - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/gjnvwywwovw/Pasted%20image%201590640931580.png)
""REAL IMPACT""
Even though immigration is a politically divisive topic in Australia, there is a broad recognition that the country needs its 200,000 to 300,000 annual intake to grow consumption demand and fill skills shortages in various sectors.
While a large share of these migrants arrive on what are considered ""temporary"" visas, many later gain permanent residency and employment, adding to long-term population growth.
Australia's population would grow an average 1.6% annually over the decade to 2027, according to the latest official projections from 2018. Without immigration, it was forecast to grow only 0.5%. 
""During a slowdown and when the unemployment rate is high there is popular pressure to slow down migration,"" said AMP Capital's Oliver. ""But if we want the economy working back again, we need migration to return.""
Concerns over immigration range from sustainability and housing affordability to more populist complaints about social integration and foreigners taking local jobs.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said last week Australia needed 160,000 to 210,000 arrivals to sustain GDP per capita growth, and acknowledged the great uncertainty current restrictions cast over the outlook. 
""It's going to be one of the real impacts of this crisis because our borders aren't opening anytime soon,"" he said.
SAFE BUBBLE
That has prompted urgent calls for solutions from some businesses and political leaders.
The premier of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, is lobbying her federal counterparts to allow international students in to rescue universities, which contribute A$13 billion to the economy of the country's most populous state.
Australia's government is also working with New Zealand to establish a ""Trans-Tasman bubble"" that would re-open the movement of people between the two closely integrated economies.
New Zealand is a large source of labour for Australia, home to about 600,000 kiwi expatriates.
To be sure, Australia still enjoys its ""lucky country"" status, benefiting from resilient global demand for some commodities and having been able to re-open large parts of the economy sooner than many other advanced economies..
But even though Australia's central bank expects the economy to expand 6% next year after a projected 6% contraction in 2020, analysts and businesses warn a sustained recovery is unlikely without the full resumption of immigration.Over the years, immigration has helped transform Australia's retail and urban landscape, reviving down-at-heel suburban high streets, spurring swanky commercial property development and creating new consumer markets.
Gotcha Fresh Tea is one of a host of bubble tea franchises that has expanded rapidly in Australia, with demand fuelled in large part by international students but also by growing interest for the Asian tapioca beverage from the wider community.
Orlando Sanpo, business development manager at EFC Group Australia, the chain's franchisor, said the student freeze has hit sales by up to 80% in some downtown stores and even closed an outlet at a Sydney campus.

""We need people to come back to the country,"" Sanpo said.

1365,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 31, 2020 09:09PM ET</span>",Security Law Sends Hong Kong Residents Dashing for the Exit,"(Bloomberg) -- Phyllis Lam has lived in Hong Kong for 42 years. It’s where she was born, went to school, met her husband and planned to raise her two children.
But like a growing number of Hongkongers disillusioned by China’s tightening grip on the city, Lam now feels she has little choice but to leave. “I have no confidence in Hong Kong’s future,” she said in an interview. “I have two young kids, so I have to plan for them.”
For many in Hong Kong who’ve long feared an erosion of their freedoms under Chinese rule, last week marked a tipping point. Spurred to action by Beijing’s decision to impose controversial national security legislation on the former British colony, residents have been flooding migration consultants with questions on how to move their families overseas.
“We get an inquiry every 2 to 3 minutes,” said Gary Leung, chief executive officer of Global Home, a property and migration consultancy. The firm’s client requests have swelled to about 20 times normal levels, with Taiwan and Europe among the most asked-about destinations, Leung said.
With many countries still enforcing travel restrictions to fight the coronavirus, it’s too early to gauge how many Hongkongers will ultimately move out. But consultants say the odds of an eventual exodus are growing as lawmakers from the U.K., the U.S. and Taiwan signal they may ease entry requirements for some Hong Kong citizens.
A wave of emigration could erode Hong Kong’s attractiveness to multinational companies, hundreds of which rely on local talent to drive their growth across the Greater China region and the rest of Asia. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has warned that retaining top-tier employees in the city may become more difficult.
Signs that more Hongkongers are planning to leave have been increasing since last year, when a now-scrapped extradition bill sparked mass protests and violent clashes with police in the heart of the city’s central business district.
While Hong Kong doesn’t publish high-frequency immigration statistics, applications for good citizenship cards -- which certify a person doesn’t have a criminal record -- serve as a proxy because they’re often needed to apply for foreign visas. The monthly number of applications averaged 2,935 from June 2019 to April 2020, a 50% jump versus 2018.
It’s not the first time the city has faced the prospect of a brain drain. An estimated 300,000 people left between 1990 and 1994, fearing Hong Kong’s handover to China from Britain would destroy the city’s civil liberties and capitalist system. Yet predictions of Hong Kong’s demise ultimately proved unfounded, with its status as Asia’s premier financial hub only becoming more entrenched over the following two decades.
Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Friday that the security law will only target “an extremely small minority of illegal and criminal acts” and that the “life and property, basic rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of citizens will be protected.” China’s central government has made similar remarks in the past week.
Jolie Lo, an administrative executive, is among Hongkongers who plan to stay. She wants to be close to her aging parents and is wary of the challenges she might face overseas.
“I may encounter other problems such as racial discrimination,” said Lo, who has studied in New York and worked in Beijing. “I won’t say I regret my decision to come back to Hong Kong. Since we are here now, we should just try our best to preserve our homes.”
Read more: What Are the New Laws China Is Pushing for Hong Kong?
Others see emigration as their best option. David Hui, managing director at Centaline Immigration Consultants (HK) Ltd., said his firm is now receiving as many as 100 inquiries a day from Hongkongers interested in moving to countries including Australia, the U.K. and Canada. Taiwan, Malaysia and Portugal are also becoming increasingly popular. “The national security law is definitely a push factor,” Hui said.
Critics of China’s Communist Party worry that it will use the law to crack down on dissent and undermine the “one country, two systems” principle that has kept Hong Kong’s judiciary separate from the mainland’s since the 1997 handover. In a survey of 9,477 pro-democracy supporters last week by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Program, 96% said they opposed the law. Among those who said they weren’t pro-democracy, 29% opposed it and 62% supported it.
“Now I fear censorship could be even more serious in Hong Kong,” said Ming, 30, who works in the art world and declined to give her surname, citing the sensitivity of the subject. “I don’t see a future here anymore, so it’s time to look for options.”
Phyllis Lam and her husband, who are both holders of British National (Overseas) passports, haven’t decided yet where they’ll move. Canada is high on the list, but their top choice is the U.K. The country’s Home Office has said it may open a path to citizenship for almost 3 million Hong Kong residents who have BN(O) status.
“In any case, we will send the kids away,” Lam said. “We don’t think the current environment in Hong Kong is good for them.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has supplied Brazil with 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine for use against the coronavirus, the two governments said on Sunday, despite medical warnings about risks associated with the anti-malaria drug.
The White House released a joint announcement on the drug, whose use has been touted both by U.S. President Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, just days after the World Health Organization suspended testing it in COVID-19 patients because of safety concerns.
Trump himself said in mid-May that he was on a regimen of hydroxychloroquine as a preventive measure, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had issued a warning about its use for the coronavirus.
Bolsonaro, a right-wing leader who has forged personal ties with Trump, said recently he kept a box of the drug in case his 93-year-old mother needed it.
""The American and Brazilian people stand in solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus,” the statement said. “We are announcing the United States Government has delivered two million doses of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) to the people of Brazil.”
“HCQ will be used as a prophylactic to help defend Brazil’s nurses, doctors and healthcare professionals against the virus. It will also be used as a therapeutic to treat Brazilians who become infected,” it said.
The two countries will also conduct a joint research effort that will include “randomized controlled clinical trials,” the statement said, adding that the United States would soon send 1,000 ventilators to Brazil.
Brazil reported a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its Health Ministry said, and the death toll surpassed that of France and now ranks only below the United States, Britain and Italy.

Demand for the decades-old hydroxychloroquine has surged as Trump repeatedly promoted its use against the coronavirus despite a lack of scientific evidence.

Palestinian officials said the 32-year-old man, Iyad Khayri, suffered mental health issues and decried his killing.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro joined a rally on Sunday on horseback as supporters urged the closing of the Supreme Court for investigating the right-wing leader, as one of its justices compared the risks to Brazil's democracy with Hitler's Germany. 
Deepening a political crisis during one of the world's worst novel coronavirus outbreaks, Bolsonaro has slammed the top court for investigating his interference in police affairs and opening an inquiry into his supporters' alleged libel and intimidation campaigns on social media. 
The former army captain and defender of Brazil's 1964-1985 military government has denounced the investigations, suggesting ""absurd orders"" should not be followed and warning that the court may ""plunge Brazil into a political crisis.""
Bolsonaro flew in a military helicopter over the rally in Brasilia where protesters held banners calling for the closure of Brazil's Congress and top court.
Supreme Court Justice Celso de Mello, who is responsible for investigating a former justice minister's allegation that Bolsonaro tried to meddle with law enforcement for personal reasons, said the president's supporters were seeking a military dictatorship.
""We must resist the destruction of the democratic order to avoid what happened in the Weimar Republic when Hitler, after he was elected by popular vote ... did not hesitate annulling the constitution and imposing a totalitarian system in 1933,"" de Mello told other judges in a message seen by Reuters.
A person familiar with the matter confirmed the authenticity of the message, which was also reported in Brazilian newspapers.
Bolsonaro has said his aims are democratic and that his opponents are trampling the constitution in their efforts to oust him.
After his helicopter ride, the president walked to the rally and shook hands with supporters, wearing no face mask despite its use being mandatory in the capital to fight the coronavirus outbreak. He then mounted a police horse and trotted past the crowd.
On Saturday night, a group of masked backers of Bolsonaro marched to the court carrying torches to call for its closure.
During Sunday's demonstrations in Sao Paulo, opponents of Bolsonaro took to a main avenue to protest against ""fascism"" and clashed with riot police who intervened to stop them getting close to a rally by supporters of the president. 

Police used tear gas to push back stone-hurling youths.

Dorothy Shea also told OTV it was a mistake to scapegoat any one person or institution for Lebanon's economic collapse in response to a question about the role of central bank Governor Riad Salameh, who she said ""enjoys great confidence in the international financial community"".
Lebanon is suffering an acute financial crisis seen as the biggest threat to its stability since the 1975-1990 civil war.
Shea said the United States was still assessing the government, formed with backing from the heavily armed, Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, listed as a terrorist organisation by Washington.
""The government has demonstrated a good intention to fight corruption and make itself committed to reforms. Now it needs to take that commitment to the next level and begin to make these ideas reality,"" Shea said.
""Are they willing to push these reforms forward? We haven't yet made a final judgement on that.""
The government launched IMF negotiations in May.
Asked what Lebanon must do to secure support, Shea said the international community was looking for concrete reforms. ""It is easy to say and much harder to do.""
The crisis is rooted in decades of waste and corruption and exploded last year as capital inflows slowed and protests erupted against the ruling elite.
On the role of Salameh, Shea said the United States had worked very closely with him over the years. Central bank appointments were a sovereign matter, she added.

1373,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 03:31PM ET</span>",Workers living in Mexico helping California's pandemic health response,"By Laura Gottesdiener
EL CENTRO, Calif. (Reuters) - Hundreds of Mexicans and Americans who live south of the border enter southern California's hospitals every day.
But these are not the patients — they are medical workers and support staff keeping a saturated healthcare system running amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Over a thousand nurses, medical technicians, and support workers who live in the Mexican border towns of Tijuana, Tecate and Mexicali work in the United States, Mexican census data shows. They staff emergency rooms, COVID-19 testing sites, dialysis centers and pharmacies.
Well over a thousand more clean contaminated hospital rooms and biotech labs; wash doctors' scrubs and patients' bed sheets; and provide in-home care to the elderly and others vulnerable to the virus.
""From the receptionist to nurses, doctors, surgeons, and pharmacists, there's cross-border workers in every single stage,"" said Paola Avila, vice president of international business affairs at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce.
In recent weeks, U.S. officials and California hospitals raised alarms about U.S. citizens living in Mexico crossing the border for treatment as COVID-19 cases surged in Tijuana and Mexicali.
At El Centro Regional Medical Center, the largest hospital in California's Imperial Valley, which employs dozens of cross-border workers, a wave of such patients helped saturate the intensive care unit and forced the hospital to begin airlifting people to hospitals over 100 miles (160 km) away.
The healthcare workers are a reminder that in the interconnected region the state also benefits from cross-border travel, at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has warned that infections in Mexico are a risk for the United States and senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have expressed concerns about dual nationals living in Mexico. 
""This is a workforce that is needed in the hospital,"" said Dr. Andres Smith, medical director of emergency services at Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) Chula Vista in San Diego.
Angel Esquivel, El Centro's base hospital trauma manager, who coordinates the flow of patients with ambulance and helicopter services, said living in Mexico enabled him to prepare better for the recent rise in patients crossing the border.
It gave him first-hand knowledge of how that outbreak was unfolding, he said, ""so we can have a picture of how that emergency can impact our emergency room.""
Emerald Textiles, the largest health care laundry service in San Diego, said more than half its employees live in Tijuana.
""Without my people being able to cross the border it would be very, very difficult for us,"" said president Jaye Park.
That concern was echoed by representatives of two hospital systems in the San Diego area — Scripps Health and Sharp HealthCare — who sent a letter to Trump administration officials in April warning of a brewing public health crisis at the border, yet acknowledging the health care system's dependence on cross-border workers.
""It is critical that our healthcare personnel be able to move freely,"" the letter stated.
Hundreds are U.S.-born workers who reside in Mexico for personal or financial reasons, Mexican data shows. Melody Thomas, a registered nurse and director of clinical services for Scripps Mercy Hospital, said she lives in Mexico because of her husband's immigration status.
The majority of this workforce were born in Mexico and have dual citizenship or U.S. work documents. 
""The president says we Mexicans who live in Tijuana are carriers (of the virus),"" said Ada Loera, a janitor in a San Diego biotech company researching a COVID-19 vaccine.

""But when the pandemic started, (our bosses) sent us email after email saying we were essential personnel and that we were required to come,"" she said.

Casual passersby and faithful alike flocked to the Parvis de Notre-Dame as the square reopened with the partial lifting of lockdown restrictions.
The coronavirus pandemic ""has unquestionably delayed the work"", said Jean-Louis Georgelin, the army general put in charge of the mammoth rebuilding programme. 
But the goal remains to reopen for religious services in April 2024, Georgelin said, standing in front of the closed-off cathedral grounds. ""There's no reason to believe it cannot be met - we'll have to find a way to catch up.""
The fire that engulfed the 850-year-old building on April 15 last year destroyed its spire and much of the roof. While the final renovation cost remains uncertain, an appeal for funds has raised close to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion)

Renovation workers returned to the site six weeks after the pandemic halted operations. But health rules that remain in place are still limiting the pace of work, officials say.

The plan for grades 7 and 12, the last years of primary and secondary school respectively, to return on Monday backfired after teachers' unions and governing associations urged school staff to defy the government order, saying schools did not have protective equipment (PPE) to keep educators and pupils safe.
The department said its decision followed three reports by industry players that raised concerns about the state of readiness.
""The Council of Education Ministers was concerned that, in some provinces, personal protective equipment for learners in particular had not been received and some schools had not been made ready for the arrival of teachers and learners,"" it said.
Many of South Africa's government schools are in poor shape, especially in rural areas, and analysts say that a quarter of them have no running water, making hand-washing nearly impossible.

On Monday schools will reopen only for management teams, teachers and non-teaching staff for instruction on health and safety measures, to finish cleaning and focus on supply chain matters.

The incident highlighted a continuing risk to civilians despite a relative lull in fighting around Tripoli since eastern-based forces staged partial withdrawals earlier this month. 
The U.N. mission to Libya has condemned ""indiscriminate attacks"" on civilian areas of Tripoli which it says are mostly attributable to forces affiliated with eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
The LNA has been waging an offensive on Tripoli since April 2019, though it has recently suffered setbacks amid the latest escalation of foreign involvement in the conflict. 
Sunday's shelling hit on the edge of the Hay al-Andalus neighbourhood, west of central Tripoli. 
Malek Marsit, spokesman for the Medical Field and Support Centre, said at least three people died and 12 were wounded when the shelling hit an expanse of grass that residents often use to relax. 
Osama Ali, a spokesman for local ambulance services, said five people had been killed there and at another nearby location.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's Congress passed a new emergency bill to address the impact of the coronavirus crisis and gradually reopen the Central American nation's economy, while President Nayib Bukele has vowed to veto the measure.
Bukele argues it is too risky to reopen the country as it could lead to a rise in coronavirus infections. El Salvador has registered 46 deaths from coronavirus and a total of 2,517 cases.
Lawmakers voted 56 to 6, with one abstention, late on Saturday to pass the bill that would establish guidelines for restarting production, lay out worker's rights, and regulate quarantines.
Bukele had asked Congress to prolong current quarantine measures for another 15 days, to give time for coronavirus infections to come down. He said economic activity could resume once the quarantine extension expired.
""They know that this bill will be vetoed. Their interest is not to reactivate the economy. They are even less interested in people's lives and health. Their job is to trip up the government,"" Bukele wrote on Twitter.
Bukele has repeatedly angered rights groups, who say he has shown authoritarian tendencies, and clashed with lawmakers. In February, Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied congress.

The protesters knelt in central London's Trafalgar Square (NYSE:SQ), chanting ""No justice, no peace"", and then marched past the Houses of Parliament and finished up outside the U.S. Embassy. 
The Metropolitan police said they had made five arrests outside the U.S. Embassy, three for violations of the coronavirus lockdown guidelines and two for assault on police.
Several hundred protesters also staged a rally outside the U.S. Embassy in Berlin, holding up posters saying ""Justice for George Floyd"", ""Stop killing us"" and ""Who's neckst"".
The death of George Floyd after his arrest on Monday has triggered a tide of protests in the United States, unleashing long simmering rage over racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.

Turning down a prosecution request for the three to be detained for 30 days, the Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina said in a statement that detention was not necessary for the smooth conducting of the criminal procedure.
Fadil Novalic, prime minister of the autonomous Bosniak-Croat Federation, had been held since Thursday first in police custody and then in the state prosecution where he was questioned.
Also released were Fahrudin Solak, an official in charge of procuring equipment to combat the outbreak, and Fikret Hodzic, owner of a raspberry processing firm that procured the ventilators. 
Prosecutors have accused the three men of abuse of office, taking bribes and money laundering, while not formally charging them. Solak and Hodzic were additionally accused of forging official documents.
The prosecutors said they would appeal the court's decision.
The three men all denied any wrongdoing. Novalic's lawyer said the prosecutors have not presented valid evidence that they should be detained.
The case arose after the government relaxed public procurement rules in face of the pandemic to allow purchases of medical equipment through direct bargaining with suppliers rather than via public tender.
Srebrena Malina, a raspberry processing firm which had no licence to import medical equipment, was recruited by the Federation's civil protection authority, headed by Solak, to procure 100 ventilators from China for 10.5 million Bosnian marka ($6 million), public documents showed.
The firm received a permit for the transaction only after 80 ventilators had been delivered, the data from the authorised drugs agency showed, spurring allegations of irregularities and prompting the investigation on how and why the company was selected to do the deal.
The prosecutors' initial report said the ventilators did ""not meet even a minimum of necessary characteristics for adequate treatment"" of coronavirus patients and that it was not advisable to use them in intensive-care units.

""We've seen people asking for help, asking for the government. We haven't deployed everywhere, the situation is overwhelming,"" said Duran.
Among those killed was an eight-year-old boy, who died after the house he was in collapsed, while another person was killed by a falling wall and another drowned in a swollen river, Salvadoran civil protection authorities said.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said Amanda or its remnants are expected to produce rain totals of 10 to 15 inches over El Salvador, southern Guatemala, western Honduras, and the Mexican states of Tabasco and Veracruz.
The storm's heavy rainfall could ""cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides across portions of Central America and southern Mexico, and these threats will continue over the next several days even after Amanda is no longer a tropical cyclone,"" said the NHC.
Amanda was packing maximum sustained winds of nearly 40 miles per hour (65 kilometers per hour) with higher gusts and was expected to weaken ""very soon"" as its center moves farther inland, said the NHC.
It is forecast to degenerate into a remnant low or dissipate over the mountains of Central America later on Sunday.

LONDON (Reuters) - British foreign minister Dominic Raab on Sunday defended the government's careful loosening of the coronavirus lockdown, saying it was the ""right step to be taking"" at this time.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has come under fire from some scientists for easing a lockdown put in place 10 weeks ago, with several saying it was a premature and risky move in the absence of a fully functioning system to track new outbreaks.
Britain has one of the world's highest death rates from COVID-19 and the government says it is easing the stringent lockdown cautiously to balance the need to restart the economy while also trying to prevent another increase in the number of infections. 
""We are confident that this is the right step to be taking at this moment in time,"" Raab told Sky News. ""We are taking those steps very carefully, based on the science but also based on our ability now to monitor the virus."" 
From Monday, up to six people will be able to meet outside in England, some school classes will restart, elite competitive sport can resume without spectators and more than 2 million people who have been ""shielding"" will be allowed to spend time outdoors. 
Housing minister Robert Jenrick said the government was ""reasonably confident"" the easing would not boost the rate of infection, but some pictures of people apparently flouting the new rules has caused concern.
England's deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, emphasised the need for people to remain on their guard.
""This is a really, really critical time. So where we are seeing (that) government is easing measures, the public really, really need to stick to those measures,"" she told a news conference.
Johnson, meanwhile, is under pressure from some in his governing Conservative Party and businesses to start reopening the economy after spending billions to help to protect companies and workers from the impact of the coronavirus crisis.
TEST AND TRACE
At the heart of the strategy to ease the lockdown is a system to test and trace those people who have come into contact with confirmed cases of COVID-19.
On Sunday, the government said it had met its 200,000 capacity testing target, including the means for 40,000 antibody tests a day, which health minister Matt Hancock described as ""an important milestone"".
Ministers also say the tracing system is already working, though some scientists warned that it is too early to say whether it is fit for purpose and fear that it might not be able to cope if the lockdown easing increases the transmission rate. [L8N2DC056]
Britain has recorded more than 38,000 deaths from confirmed COVID-19 cases. The Office of National Statistics and other sources of data put the figure of fatalities from suspected and confirmed cases at 48,000.
Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group and who sits on the government's scientific advisory group, said he shared other scientists' ""deep concern"".
""I think unlocking too fast carries a great risk that all the good work that has been put in by everyone to try to reduce transmission may be lost,"" he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show.
Scotland's first minister Nicola Sturgeon, who has offered the nation slightly different guidance to that in England, agreed with scientists urging caution.

""I agree with the opinion that has been expressed over the weekend that we've got to be very cautious,"" Sturgeon told Sky News. ""This virus hasn't gone away, there is still a significant risk that it could run out of control again.""

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lanka plans to reopen its tourism sector on Aug. 1 by allowing only small groups of visitors to begin with, a tourism official said on Sunday. 
Kimali Fernando, chairperson of the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, a government body, denied a report in the local Sunday Times that said the sector would re-open in mid-June. 
A limited number of small groups from around the world would be allowed to visit from August and stay in approved five-star hotels that have put strict safety measures in place, Fernando told Reuters.
He confirmed that tourists will be required to carry a COVID-19-free certificate issued either by their governments or a reputed agency, as reported by the Sunday Times which quoted Sri Lanka's Tourism Ministry Secretary S. Hettiaarachchi. Tourists would also need to wait on arrival at the airport for coronavirus testing.
Fernando also confirmed that individual travelers will still not be allowed to enter the country.
Sri Lanka reported another 20 cases of the virus on Saturday, taking the total number of cases so far to 1,613, including 10 deaths.
The country attracted around 2 million tourists last year and the sector contributes around 11% to the nation's gross domestic product. 
President Rajapaksa discussed the proposals at a meeting with representatives of the tourism industry this month, Fernando said. 
The main tourist season typically begins in around November.
If the government approves the plan, Bandaranaike International Airport and Mattala International Airport, which have been closed under coronavirus restrictions, would partially reopen. Testing facilities would be set up at the airports and private hospitals are expected to provide assistance to tourists as part of the plans, Fernando said. 

Popular sites such as the Yala national park, Udawalawe, Arugam Bay, Trincomalee and selected beach areas would be among those open for tourists, whose temperatures would be monitored daily, he added.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain's prime minister said on Sunday the country needed 15 more days of lockdown until June 21 ""to finish with the pandemic once and for all"", and he would ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay home rule.
""We have almost set out what we set out to do,"" Pedro Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases of COVID-19 in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically.
From June 21 a national state of emergency will end and with it the lockdown, allowing citizens to move freely in their regions. From July 1, citizens will be able to move throughout the country. 
Spain's death toll rose by four on Saturday to 27,125, the health ministry said, while the number of COVID-19 infections rose by 271 overnight to 239,228 on Saturday. 
Spain imposed a state of emergency on 14 March which involved a strict lockdown under which people could only leave their homes to buy food, seek medical care or for jobs where they could not work from home. Children were initially confined inside all day. Restrictions are being gradually eased. 

Despite opposition to the most recent lockdown extension from parties on the right and demonstrations across Spain, Sanchez has struck a deal with a Catalan separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) which should guarantee his minority government secures enough support to extend the lockdown.

The WTO post will become vacant at the end of August after incumbent Roberto Azevedo said he would step down a year early.
The next director-general will be faced with intensifying U.S.-China tensions and rising protectionism, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The new chief will also have to push forward talks to limit overfishing and set new rules on e-commerce.
Hogan, an Irishman, has been a European commissioner since 2014, initially responsible for agriculture and since late 2019 for trade.
He told the European Parliament on Thursday that it would be ""wonderful"" if a European became the next head of the Geneva-based trade body.
Two other potential European candidates are Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya and Dutch trade minister Sigrid Kaag.
The issue could become a central topic of a meeting of EU ministers responsible for trade provisionally set for June 9. Europe could then put forward a single candidate.
WTO members can nominate their own nationals as candidates from June 8 to July 8.
With three of the previous six directors-general from Europe and the others from Thailand, Brazil and New Zealand, there is some pressure to choose a leader from Africa, with four names from the continent being cited.
Some in Europe though say that there is an unwritten rule at the WTO that the director-general post should alternate between the developed and developing world. Azevedo is Brazilian. 
There is also a general consensus that the body itself needs reform, with critics saying it must take into account the rise of China and state-owned enterprises.

Francis made his comments, departing from a prepared script, at the first noon address from his window overlooking St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) in three months as Italy's lockdown drew to an end.
""Healing people, not saving (money) to help the economy (is important), healing people, who are more important than the economy,"" Francis said.
""We people are temples of the Holy Spirit, the economy is not,"" he said.
Francis did not mention any countries. Many governments are deciding whether to reopen their economies to save jobs and living standards, or whether to maintain lockdowns until they are sure the virus is fully under control.
The pope's words were met with applause by hundreds of people in the square, many of whom wore masks and kept several meters from each other. The square was reopened to the public last Monday. Normally tens of thousands attend on a Sunday.
The last time the pope delivered his message and blessing from the window was March 1, before Italy, where more than 33,000 people have died from the virus, imposed a lockdown. The last restrictions will be lifted on Wednesday.
Francis led the crowd in silent prayer for medical workers who lost their lives by helping others.
He said he hoped the world would come out of the crisis more united, rather than divided.

The government has been paying 800 euros ($888) per month per employee in order to discourage layoffs in companies impacted by the virus and says it will maintain the scheme until the economy picks up again.
Tourism authorities are negotiating 'safe corridors' for travel with countries which have low COVID-19 numbers, including Luxembourg, Norway, Serbia, Slovakia, Austria, Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania and Israel.
They have not yet given the green light for travelers from Britain, which traditionally has close tourism ties to Malta.

India, with the world's longest lockdown, is set to largely lift containment measures in June, except in high-risk zones.
""The fight against the coronavirus is intense, we cannot drop our guard,"" Modi said in his national radio address, a day after his government extended the lockdown until June 30 in high-risk zones but permitted restaurants, malls and religious buildings to reopen elsewhere from June 8. 
""Wearing a mask, gloves and following social distancing rules is essential as everyone will soon start stepping out of their homes,"" Modi said. 
The novel coronavirus has infected more than 182,000 people and claimed the lives of 5,164 in India. 
The number of cases reached a daily record high in the last 48 hours, two months after the federal government enforced a rigid lockdown to stop the pandemic from spreading in a country with more than 1.3 billion people.
""We really need to be more vigilant now,"" he said.
Critics blame Modi's government for poor planning ahead of its abrupt declaration of a lockdown in March, leaving millions of the country's poor stranded.
""We are all sorry for the loss that has occurred,"" Modi said as he hailed the country's ""united"" efforts towards fighting the virus. 
State governments were expected to identify containment zones and find staggered ways to reopen public transport and businesses.
Critics said Modi had now left states with the responsibility of establishing rules to contain the virus.
""But this decision could have been taken at the start of May when there were fewer coronavirus cases,"" said Ajay Trivedi, a political scientist at the University of Mumbai.

The resumption of prayers at Islam's third-holiest site capped a sombre period for Jerusalem's Muslims, who this year marked the holy fasting month of Ramadan and the Eid al-Fitr holiday without their usual daily visits to Al-Aqsa and the adjoining Dome of the Rock.
""After they opened the mosque, I feel like I can breathe again. Thanks be to God,"" Jerusalem resident Umm Hisham said through a face mask, her eyes tearing up, after entering the compound for dawn prayers with hundreds of other Muslims. 
The Council of Islamic Waqf cited the slowed local spread of COVID-19 in lifting entry restrictions and reopening the compound's iconic shrines, which shut on March 15. 
But the council imposed some measures to reduce the risk of contagion, as new cases in Israel spiked in recent days.
Worshippers must wear face masks and bring personal prayer rugs should they wish to pray inside the shrines or on the compound's outdoor grounds. 
There did not appear to be a limit on the number of people allowed into the 35-acre (14-hectare) compound, known to Muslims as the Noble (NYSE:NE) Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
Around 700 worshippers were present for dawn prayers. Later in the morning, a group of Orthodox Jews, accompanied by Israeli police, entered the compound through a visitor entrance adjacent to Judaism's holy Western Wall. 

There have been 17,000 coronavirus cases and 284 deaths in Israel, and 386 cases and three deaths in the occupied West Bank.

CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - SpaceX, the private rocket company of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, launched two Americans into orbit from Florida on Saturday in a landmark mission marking the first spaceflight of NASA astronauts from U.S. soil in nine years.
A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center at 3:22 p.m. EDT (1922 GMT), launching Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a 19-hour ride aboard the company's newly designed Crew Dragon capsule bound for the International Space Station.
Just before liftoff, Hurley said, “SpaceX, we’re go for launch. Let’s light this candle,” paraphrasing the famous comment uttered on the launch pad in 1961 by Alan Shepard, the first American flown into space. 
Minutes after launch, the first-stage booster rocket of the Falcon 9 separated from the upper second-stage rocket and flew itself back to Earth to descend safely onto a landing platform floating in the Atlantic.
High above the Earth, the Crew Dragon jettisoned moments later from the second-stage rocket, sending the capsule on its way to the space station.
The exhilarating spectacle of the rocket soaring flawlessly into the heavens came as a welcome triumph for a nation gripped by racially-charged civil unrest as well as ongoing fear and economic upheaval from the coronavirus pandemic.
The Falcon 9 took off from the same launch pad used by NASA's final space shuttle flight, piloted by Hurley, in 2011. Since then, NASA astronauts have had to hitch rides into orbit aboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft.
“It's incredible, the power, the technology,” said U.S. President Donald Trump, who was at Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral in Florida for the launch. “That was a beautiful sight to see.”
The mission's first launch attempt on Wednesday was called off with less than 17 minutes remaining on the countdown clock. Weather again threatened Saturday's launch, but cleared in time to proceed with the mission.
SPACEFLIGHT MILESTONES
NASA chief Jim Bridenstine has said resuming launches of American astronauts on American-made rockets from U.S. soil is the space agency's top priority.
""I'm breathing a sigh of relief, but I will also tell you I'm not gonna celebrate until Bob and Doug are home safely."" Bridenstine said.
For Musk, the launch represents another milestone for the reusable rockets his company pioneered to make spaceflight less costly and more frequent. And it marks the first time commercially developed space vehicles - owned and operated by a private entity rather than NASA - have carried Americans into orbit.
The last time NASA launched astronauts into space aboard a brand new vehicle was 40 years ago at the start of the space shuttle program.
Musk, the South African-born high-tech entrepreneur who made his fortune in Silicon Valley, is also chief executive of electric carmaker and battery manufacturer Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc. He founded Hawthorne, California-based SpaceX, formally known as Space Exploration Technologies, in 2002. 
Hurley, 53, and Behnken, 49, NASA employees under contract to fly with SpaceX, are expected to remain at the space station for several weeks, assisting a short-handed crew aboard the orbital laboratory.
Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, producing its own launch system in competition with SpaceX, is expected to fly its CST-100 Starliner vehicle with astronauts aboard for the first time next year. NASA has awarded nearly $8 billion combined to SpaceX and Boeing for development of their rival rockets.
Trump also hailed the launch as a major advance toward the goal of eventually sending humans to Mars.
He was joined at the viewing by Musk, as well as Vice President Mike Pence, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz and Senator Rick Scott.
Earlier on Saturday, the crew bid goodbye to their families. Prior to climbing into a specially designed Tesla automobile for the ride to the launch site, Behnken told his young son, ""Be good for mom. Make her life easy.”

During the drive, Behnken and Hurley passed former astronaut Garrett Reisman who held a sign saying, ""Take me with you.""

1396,By Reuters,"<span>May 31, 2020 01:40AM ET</span>","China media, Hong Kong government bristle at Trump's pledge of curbs, sanctions","By James Pomfret and Stella Qiu
HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - China's state media and the government of Hong Kong lashed out on Sunday at U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to end Hong Kong's special status if Beijing imposes new national security laws on the city, which is bracing for fresh protests.
Trump on Friday pledged to ""take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory"", and to impose sanctions on unspecified individuals over Beijing's new laws on the Asian financial centre.
But China's state media pushed back, saying this would hurt the United States more than China.
""The baton of sanctions that the United States is brandishing will not scare Hong Kong and will not bring China down,” China's Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, wrote in a commentary. It used the pen name ""Zhong Sheng"", meaning ""Voice of China"", often used to give the paper's view on foreign policy issues.
The Global Times wrote, ""China has already prepared for the worst. No matter how far the U.S. goes, China will keep its company.""
A Hong Kong government spokesman expressed regret the United States continued to ""smear and demonise the legitimate rights and duty of our sovereign"" to safeguard national security.
In a sign of diplomatic manoeuvring, the U.S. government said it would put one of its prime Hong Kong properties up for sale - a luxury residential complex worth up to HK$5 billion ($650 million).
A spokesman for the U.S. consulate in Hong Kong said this was part of a global programme that ""reinforces the U.S. government's presence in Hong Kong"" through reinvestment in other areas.
China and Hong Kong officials have justified the laws that will be directly imposed by China to restore order to a city that has been wracked by sometimes violent anti-China, anti-government protests over the past year. They said the laws will only apply to a small number of ""troublemakers.""
Protesters, however, have said they are railing against China's deep encroachment on Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms despite Beijing's promise to grant the city a high degree of autonomy under a so-called ""one-country, two systems"" formula since it reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
More protests are planned in the coming weeks.
Countries including the United States, Canada and Britain have expressed deep concerns about the law, with Britain saying it may grant expanded visa rights to large numbers of Hong Kongers. 
Demosisto, an advocacy group led by prominent young Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong, said the security law will be ""the death of freedom in Hong Kong"".
A senior Hong Kong official, Erick Tsang, said he couldn't care less if he were sanctioned by the Washington. ""I wouldn't even go to Canada, just in case they try to catch me"" there, Tsang told local radio.
Details of the laws remain unclear, even to Hong Kong officials, but are expected to be enacted by China's parliament this summer. The laws will outlaw secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in Hong Kong, and will be imposed without any local legislative scrutiny.

""Some don't think #BlackLivesMatter,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter. ""To those of us who do: it is long overdue for the entire world to wage war against racism. Time for a #WorldAgainstRacism.""
""The U.S. government is squandering its citizens' resources,"" Zarif said in a tweet echoing a 2018 statement from U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The tweet featured an image of Pompeo's statement addressing protests in Iran, but with elements crossed out and replaced.
Iran's foreign ministry earlier denounced the killing in Minneapolis, which has sparked protests in several cities, some of which have turned violent.
A ministry statement condemned what it called ""the tragic murder of black people and deadly racial discrimination in the United States"".
""The voices of the protesters must be heard,"" it said.
Separately, Iran's interior minister indicated in an interview that the death toll in November street protests in Iran over fuel price hikes was below 225.
The reported toll has varied between an Amnesty International figure of over 300 and a Reuters account of 1,500 - both dismissed by the authorities.
Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli told state television late on Saturday that 40 to 45 of those killed in the unrest making up 20% of the death toll had not been shot by security forces.
Authorities are likely to announce the official toll in coming days, said Rahmani Fazli, who was blacklisted this month by the United States, which accused him of engaging in human rights abuse.

Hundreds of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 to protest against fuel price rises. The protests turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down.

ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would postpone a Group of Seven summit he had hoped to hold next month until September or later and expand the list of invitees to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7, which groups the world's most advanced economies, was a ""very outdated group of countries"" in its current format.
""I'm postponing it because I don't feel that as a G7 it properly represents what's going on in the world,"" Trump said.
It was unclear whether Trump's desire to invite the additional countries was a bid to permanently expand the G7. On several previous occasions, he suggested Russia be added, given what he called Moscow's global strategic importance.
Russia was expelled from what was then the G8 in 2014 when Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, was U.S. president, after Moscow annexed the Crimea region from Ukraine. Russia still holds the territory, and various G7 governments have rebuffed previous calls from Trump to readmit Moscow.
White House spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said Trump wants the countries to discuss China at the summit. 
Trump has attacked Beijing over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China, and on Friday he ordered his administration to begin the process of ending special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong in retaliation for China's decision to impose a new security law on the former British colony.
The decision to postpone the G7 summit is a retreat for Trump, who had sought to host the group of major industrialized countries in Washington as a demonstration that the United States was returning to normal after the coronavirus epidemic, which has killed more than 103,000 Americans to date.
Trump had canceled an in-person G7 meeting scheduled for March as the virus spread, but had recently sought to revive it.
French President Emmanuel Macron backed the idea of an in-person meeting, according to the White House, but Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to endorse it, saying there were too many health-related questions. This week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she could not attend.
South Korea is aware of Trump's invitation and will discuss the matter with the United States, a government official in Seoul told Reuters on Sunday.

The G7 groups the United States, Britain, France, Japan, Germany, Italy and Canada, and the European Union also attends.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>May 30, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>",Lack of protective gear leaves Mexican nurses battling pandemic in fear,"By Anthony Esposito and Diego Oré
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - As a nurse on the front lines of Mexico's coronavirus battle, Gisela Hernandez has stayed away from her children for nearly two months, sleeping in a hotel and even her car to avoid infecting them because she feels inadequately protected at work.
At night, she video calls Santiago, 5 and Renata, 9, who are both asthmatic, to hear about what they've done during the day and remind them how much she misses them.
While Hernandez says she loves her work, and considers the National Institute of Respiratory Diseases (INER) in Mexico City her second home, she is also afraid of contracting the novel coronavirus, which has killed 9,415 people in Mexico. 
""I don't regret becoming a nurse because I like to help my patients,"" said Hernandez, 40, whose hospital is one of the city's main treatment centers for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.
But she said she is ""scared of getting sick ... scared of never seeing my kids again.""
Health workers account for about a quarter of all of Mexico's coronavirus infections, government data shows, one of the highest rates in the world. The risks are made worse by shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE).
Coronavirus cases are surging in Latin America, which along with the United States is now an epicenter of the global pandemic. Frontline (NYSE:FRO) workers in Mexico City's hospitals, including Hernandez, have taken to the streets to complain about the conditions. A national march is planned for Monday.
INER, which has been at full capacity over the past week, said 49 of its workers have been infected at the hospital and another 54 have contracted the disease in the community, of which two have died.
In a May 8 memo seen by Reuters, INER's Biosafety Committee said a global PPE shortage would require workers to don reusable surgical uniforms and cloth hospital gowns, instead of disposable gear. The letter also told workers to use their N95 masks for full shifts. 
In response to requests for comment, the hospital shared with Reuters a statement it sent workers this week in which it said the measure regarding usage of masks was in line with World Health Organization advice. It also confirmed that workers were instructed to use non-disposable gowns and uniforms.
""To date, no sterilized N95 masks have been reused.""
However, a video seen by Reuters shows an official at INER telling staff to reuse sterilized N95 masks.
""We exploded when we were told we were going to recycle the N95s,"" said Alejandro Cabrera, an INER nurse with two decades of experience. 
Cabrera said workers are required to put their names on masks so the gear can be sent off for sterilization. ""It's terrible!"" he said.
HEAVY TOLL
Mexico ranks eighth in the world in COVID-19 deaths, with Mexico City and a neighboring state accounting for some 40% of the country's fatalities.
The Mexican government says it needs another 6,600 doctors and 23,000 nurses to battle the crisis, a shortage exacerbated by the high infection rate among medical staff - 11,394 health workers had contracted the virus and 149 had died as of May 17.
Medical professionals had accounted for 23% of all of the country's infections as of that date. That compares to 3.7% in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week. 
Despite the danger, Hernandez is doing her part to combat the disease.
She points to a box of chocolates and a yellow note from the family of one of her patients thanking and encouraging her to keep ""working to save lives.""

""That's one of the reasons I love my job so much, and despite the risks I still enjoy taking care of my patients,"" she said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Saturday urged politicians to divert funds spent on weapons to research to prevent another pandemic, as he led the largest gathering in the Vatican in nearly three months. 
Francis presided at an outdoor prayer service with about 130 people, including many directly affected by the pandemic.
They prayed the rosary in the Vatican gardens as tens of thousands of people in about 50 Catholic shrines around the world joined in. A large screen in the gardens showed video links with about 25 locations.
Among those who prayed were Italian doctors, nurses, and ambulance drivers, as well as people who had recovered from coronavirus or lost family members. More than 33,000 have died in Italy. 
Most wore masks except for when they led prayers at the microphone. Francis, 83, sat several meters away from most people during most of the service and did not wear a mask.
In his closing prayer, Francis said national leaders should take a far-sighted attitude, helping the most needy now and putting in place long-term economic and social solutions.
He prayed that the Madonna would ""touch (leaders') consciences so that enormous sums spent to possess more armaments and to perfect them be instead destined to the promotion of sufficient research to prevent such catastrophes in the future"".
Earlier this month, Francis called for international scientific cooperation to develop a vaccine and said any successful one should be shared globally.
For nearly three months, Francis has led televised Masses, general audiences and Sunday addresses from inside the Vatican with no public.
St. Peter's Basilica and St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) were fully reopened on May 18 as Italy entered the second phase of easing restrictions.

On Sunday, Francis will say a Mass with only about 50 people inside the basilica but will later deliver his Sunday message from his window overlooking the square for the first time since early March.

SOFIA (Reuters) - An Australian ex-soldier, released on parole after being convicted of a street murder in Bulgaria in 2009, fears he will be rearrested if he tries to leave the country and is now seeking a new trial to try to clear his name.
Jock Palfreeman, 33, who served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for murder and attempted murder in the 2007 stabbing of two Bulgarians, was released on parole in September.
The ruling angered nationalist politicians who criticized his release, while the government decision to keep him in a detention center after his parole strained relations with Australia.
The interior ministry said on Friday that the travel ban would be lifted, a day after the highest appeals court dismissed a request by the ex-chief prosecutor to review the parole.
But Palfreeman, speaking under a portrait of revolutionary Che Guevara which he kept in his cell to keep his spirits up, said he had doubts he would be allowed to leave.
""They could come and arrest me in five minutes,"" the bearded Palfreeman told Reuters in the office of his Bulgarian Prisoners' Association.
Palfreeman co-founded the association to draw attention to alleged abuse and corruption in the prison system.
He has consistently maintained he acted in self-defense, trying to protect minority Roma being attacked by a group of Bulgarians. He believes video footage of the attack, released by an anonymous user on YouTube, will support his case.
""I believe a fair trial would be possible,"" he said. ""I can speak Bulgarian, I can defend myself because 13 years ago I couldn't speak Bulgarian. I didn't know what was happening and there were a lot of things I missed because of the language barrier.""
Palfreeman said he was ""completely shocked"" by the systemic lawlessness in Bulgarian jails, adding that 90% of prisoners were not allowed to do any work.

Palfreeman, who was serving in the British army at the time of the street fight, said a motion for a new trial was expected to be filed on Monday.

The U.S. State Department said on Friday that it ""commends"" the seizure of $1.1 billion of ""counterfeit Libyan currency"" by Malta. 
The banknotes were printed by Goznak, the Russian state-owned company, and ordered by an ""illegitimate parallel entity"", the department said, in an apparent reference to Libya's eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.
""The Central Bank of Libya headquartered in Tripoli is Libya's only legitimate central bank.  The influx of counterfeit, Russian-printed Libyan currency in recent years has exacerbated Libya's economic challenges,"" the State Department statement said.
""This incident once again highlights the need for Russia to cease its malign and destabilizing actions in Libya,"" it added.
Russia's foreign ministry on Saturday said Libya has two central banks, one in the capital Tripoli and another in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, as the country is de-facto governed by two centers of power.
""So, that's not the dinars which are counterfeit, but America's statements,"" the ministry said.
It added that Goznak had sent the Libyan banknotes to the central bank's address in Tobruk under the terms of a contract signed in 2015.
In a separate statement, the Russian company said the cargo was seized by customs officials in Malta when it was on its way to Libya in September 2019 in ""breach of all norms of the international law"".
A parallel central bank in eastern Libya stepped up deliveries of new banknotes from Russia last year, before and after Haftar launched a military offensive to capture Tripoli, according to Russian customs data.
The data obtained by Reuters showed nearly 4.5 billion Libyan dinars (more than $3 billion) was dispatched in four shipments between February and June 2019.

LONDON (Reuters) - England risks losing control of the coronavirus pandemic again because it is starting to lift its lockdown without a fully operational track and trace programme in place, senior scientific advisers warned on Saturday. 
One of the slowest countries to lock down, Britain is now one of the worst-hit. To allow some parts of the economy to reopen while curbing the virus spread, a test and trace system was introduced on Thursday that will ask the contacts of people who have been infected to isolate for 14 days. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's office said the cautious steps, which allow for up to six people to meet outside their homes in England and the resumption of some school classes, would ease the burden of lockdown while keeping the virus' reproduction rate down. 
""We have at all times been informed by the data and evidence,"" it said. 
But the scientific advisers said the system was untested, would not be fully operational until the end of June and risked being overwhelmed by the infection rate - currently around 8,000 new cases a day. A mobile tracing app is not yet ready. 
John Edmunds, from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and a member of Britain's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), said the government was taking a risk. 
""Track and trace was only launched the day before yesterday, so we can't be sure that that is working effectively yet and yet we're going ahead and making these changes anyway,"" he told Sky News. ""I think that that is rather dangerous."" 
Three other SAGE members echoed this concern: Peter Horby, also the chairman of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, and Calum Semple of the University of Liverpool. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan also said he was also deeply concerned and urged people to act with caution.
Britain has recorded more than 270,000 cases of coronavirus and says more than 38,000 have died after testing positive for the illness. The Office of National Statistics and other sources of data put the figure of fatalities from suspected and confirmed cases at 48,000.
Johnson's government, which has been heavily criticised for its handling of the crisis, is now caught between the need to prevent a second wave and the need to reopen the economy and keep companies alive. 
It says that while it may have made some mistakes it is grappling with the biggest public health crisis since the 1918 influenza outbreak and that it has prevented the health service from being overwhelmed. 
Horby of the University of Oxford said there was still too much uncertainty about what would happen to the virus' reproduction rate if schools reopen and other activities resume.
""Returning to a situation where we've lost control again is far worse than a week or two of social measures,"" he told BBC Radio. SAGE includes more than 50 scientists, medics and academics who advise the government. 
Government officials have repeatedly said they are following ""the science"" as they respond to the pandemic, but Edmunds said the decision to ease the lockdown from Monday was political.

""My frustration has been recently at least that they're pretending that they're not making a decision, that in fact it's us who are making the decision, and that's not really the case,"" he said. ""They have to make the decision and clearly they have.""

""In this context, we urge the U.S. to reconsider its announced decision,"" they said a day after President Donald Trump announced the move, accusing the U.N. agency of becoming a puppet of China.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas also condemned the move and pledged intensive talks with Washington on the issue.
The decision is ""the wrong signal at the wrong time,"" Maas told German media group Funke. With the number of infections continuing to rise globally, ""we cannot tear down the dike in the middle of a storm"", he said.
The EU has led calls for a review of the international response to the coronavirus pandemic, including the U.N. agency's performance.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who has defended the agency against fierce criticism by Trump, has promised a review of its performance after the pandemic eases.
Trump last month halted funding for the 194-member organization, then in a May 18 letter gave the WHO 30 days to commit to reforms.
Speaking at the White House on Friday, Trump said Chinese officials pressured the WHO to ""mislead the world"".

The move to quit the Geneva-based body comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing over the coronavirus outbreak. The virus first emerged in China's Wuhan city late last year.

With public impatience mounting and temperatures up to 28 Celsius (82 Fahrenheit) forecast over the holiday weekend, authorities brought forward the parks' reopening, initially scheduled for June 2.
""At last we're free,"" said Anne, a Parisienne standing near the gates of the 400-year-old Luxembourg Gardens on the city's Left Bank soon after they reopened. ""This feels like being released from a kind of prison.""
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo has pressured the government to reopen parks since the national lockdown was eased on May 11. Hidalgo is standing for re-election next month.
Early risers beat the crowds, some bearing breakfast picnics as they waited for the gates of the northeastern Buttes-Chaumont to swing open at 7 a.m., according to TV reports.
Social distancing rules remain in force across Paris, one of Europe's most densely populated cities, and the recommended wearing of masks in parks may soon become compulsory as health officials remain watchful for any new increase in infections.

France, one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, has reported more than 186,000 cases and 28,714 deaths.

A preliminary probe showed a bomb attached by magnets to a bus used by Khurshid TV employees was blown up during the evening rush hour. No militant group claimed responsibility for the attack. 
""We can confirm that a journalist and a driver were killed on the spot,"" said Khurshid TV’s director Jawid Farhad, but gave no further details.
Last year two employees of Khurshid TV were killed and two were injured in a similar attack.
Taliban and other Islamist insurgents have repeatedly targeted Afghan journalists, killing 15 in 2018, the deadliest year yet for the Afghan media, according to the media freedom group Reporters Without Borders.
Last year the Taliban warned the Afghan media to stop broadcasting what it called ""anti-Taliban statements"" 
In 2016, a Taliban suicide bomber rammed his car into a bus carrying employees of Tolo TV, the country's largest private broadcaster, killing seven journalists.
The Taliban claimed Tolo was producing propaganda for the U.S. military and western-backed Afghan government.

European countries are cautiously reopening their borders as the coronavirus contagion subsides around the continent, with Italy set to let tourists back in from June 15.
However, some EU states are looking to keep the door shut on visitors from places that have suffered a particularly high number of COVID-19 cases. Greece, for example, said on Friday it would open its frontiers to citizens from just 29 countries, excluding Italians, Spaniards and the British.
""We do not accept blacklists,"" Di Maio wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), announcing a forthcoming round of bilateral meetings both in Rome and abroad to press Italy's case.
""If anyone thinks they can treat us like a leper colony, then they should know that we will not stand for it.""
Italy has the third highest death toll in the world from the new coronavirus, with some 33,229 people dying since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21. It has the sixth highest global tally of cases - some 232,248.
However new infections and fatalities have fallen steadily this month and the country is unwinding some of the most rigid lockdown restrictions introduced anywhere on the continent. 
The government confirmed late on Friday that it intended to push ahead with plans to lift all constraints on travel between Italy's regions from June 3 - one of the last curbs still in place.

""We have always acted responsibly and transparently and we will continue to do so. That is precisely why we expect respect,"" Di Maio said.

""Police units on patrol there spotted a suspect with a suspicious object that looked like a pistol. They called upon him to stop and began to chase after him on foot, during the chase officers also opened fire at the suspect,"" police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. 
Rosenfeld said the suspect, a Palestinian resident of east Jerusalem, was dead. Palestinian officials said he had mental health issues. 
Police did not confirm to reporters whether the man had been carrying a weapon and a gag order was placed on the investigation. Israel's Channel 13 News said earlier that he was unarmed. 
The secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Saeb Erekat condemned the incident on Twitter, saying: 
""Israeli Occupation Forces in East #Jerusalem assassinated Iyad Khayri, 32 a disabled Palestinian. A crime that will be met with impunity unless the world stops treating Israel as a state above the law &@IntlCrimCourt fulfils its mandate.""
Tension has risen in recent weeks with Israel saying it hopes to move ahead with a plan to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank - a de-facto annexation of land the Palestinians seek for a state.
The Palestinians, Arab states, the United Nations and European states have warned against the move and the Palestinians have declared an end to security cooperation with Israel and its ally, the United States, in protest.
On Friday, the Israeli military said its troops in the West Bank shot and killed a Palestinian attacker who had tried to run them over with a car.

LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping is so nervous about the position of the Communist Party that he is risking a new Cold War and imperilling Hong Kong's position as Asia's pre-eminent financial hub, the last British governor of the territory told Reuters.
Chris Patten said Xi's 'thuggish' crackdown in Hong Kong risked triggering an outflow of capital and people from the city which funnels the bulk of foreign investment into mainland China.
The West, he said, should stop being naive about Xi, who has served as General Secretary of the Communist Party since 2012. 
""We have long since passed the stage where, without wanting another Cold War, we have to react to the fact Xi seems to want one himself,"" Patten said.
Patten cast Xi as a dictator who was ""nervous"" about the position of the Communist Party in China after criticism of its early handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak and the economic impact of its trade disagreements with the United States.
""One reason Xi Jinping is whipping up all this nationalist feeling about Hong Kong, about Taiwan and about other issues, is that he is more nervous than any official would allow about the position of the Communist Party in China,"" he said.
The Chinese embassy in London did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Patten, now 76, watched as the British flag was lowered over Hong Kong when the colony was handed back to China in 1997 after more than 150 years of British rule. 
Hong Kong's autonomy was guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement enshrined in the 1984 Sino-British Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Declaration. But thousands of Hong Kong protesters have defied Beijing in recent months.
HONG KONG
China’s parliament this week approved a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference.
""Xi Jinping hates the things which Hong Kong has been promised under the ‘one country, two systems’ treaty lodged at the United Nations which he is wilfully breaking,"" Patten said. ""What he hopes he can do is to bash Hong Kong into shape.""
Patten said Xi's actions had placed Hong Kong's position as Asia's premier international financial hub under question.
""What does it mean? It means serious question marks not just about Hong Kong's future as a free society but also about Hong Kong's ability to continue as probably the premier international financial hub in Asia,"" Patten said.
""A lot of people will try to leave Hong Kong,"" Patten said, adding that he feared capital would also flow out. ""It is going to be pretty rough over the next few months.""
The autonomy of Hong Kong has, until now, given investors faith in the territory's legal and governance systems. China’s legal system is accountable to the Communist Party.
""What you have coming into conflict is a dictatorial idea of what the law is with the common law which is undoubtedly going to cause a constitutional clash,"" Patten said
He added the West had been even more naive with Xi's China than it had with post-Soviet Russia.
""What Xi has demonstrated so far is that unless you stand up to bullies they go on bullying you,"" he said.
Patten said the West should stand together when allies - such as Australia - were targeted by Beijing and be cautious with companies such as Huawei which Britain has allowed to help build its 5G network.

""Huawei is an agent of an unpleasant Chinese state,"" Patten said. Huawei has repeatedly denied claims that it is agent of the Chinese state.

Rouhani also said on state television that the hours of shopping malls, which had been allowed to open only until 6 p.m., will be extended, a further step in the government’s plans to ease coronavirus restrictions.
“Doors to mosques across the country will open to public for daily prayers,” Rouhani said, adding that social distancing and other health protocols should be observed. He did not say when they are due to reopen.
Authorities are taking tougher measures to ensure that health regulations are observed, including barring commuters not wearing masks from buses and metro trains, Iranian media reported.
Alireza Zali, head of the government-led Coronavirus Taskforce of Tehran, told state TV the situation in the capital was “still not favorable,” adding that the easing of restrictions should be accompanied by “more serious observance” of regulations.
As of Friday, Iran had recorded 146,668 infections, with 7,677 deaths.
Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said Friday there had been no deaths in the previous 24 hours in 15 of the country’s provinces and one in each of five provinces.
The provinces of Khuzestan in the southwest, and Baluchistan in the southeast of the country, have been declared “red” areas where there are still high levels of infection.

TUTAYEV, Russia (Reuters) - Russian women flocked to their small town's ""banya"" or public steam sauna when it reopened after the coronavirus lockdown, for the luxury of hot water after going without for six weeks.
The public banya is the only way for many Russians living in smaller towns to wash themselves in comfort as older homes do not have central heating or hot water supplies.
In Tutayev, a town some 300 km (190 miles) northeast of Moscow on the Volga River, only 71 percent of the 40,000 strong population have all the conveniences, official data shows.
""It's a necessity for us as we couldn't wash ourselves,"" one of the first banya visitors, Svetlana Travnikova, said. ""How is it possible (not to wash), pandemic or no pandemic?""
Another visitor at Friday's first session, Irina Kutavtseva, said going to the banya was a festive occasion for her.
Receptionist Tamara Bryukova, donning a mask and clad in rubber gloves, said calls from those in need of a hot steam were coming non-stop. Naked bathing means separate days are set aside for women and men and next week is fully booked, she said.
People had to book in advance to limit numbers for social distancing and have their temperature taken at the entrance, administrators said, and the hall-like steam room was disinfected after each 90 minute session.
Public banyas in many other Russian regions remain closed as the decision on easing lockdown measures is taken by local authorities according to the situation on the ground. 
Local officials in the Yaroslav region, where Tutayev is located, had recommended banyas work ""without visitors or online"" to prevent the spread of the virus, a decision which caused a public outcry at the time.
""Banyas working remotely without visitors is a joke,"" Tutayev resident Vladimir Kolomenskiy said, ""and when people can't wash it's a health risk too.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Senior Hong Kong government officials lashed out on Saturday at moves by U.S. President Donald Trump to strip the city of its special status in a bid to punish China for imposing national security laws on the global financial hub.
Speaking hours after Trump said the city no longer warranted economic privileges and some officials could face sanctions, security minister John Lee told reporters that Hong Kong's government could not be threatened and would push ahead with the new laws.
""I don't think they will succeed in using any means to threaten the (Hong Kong) government, because we believe what we are doing is right,"" Lee said.
Justice minister Teresa Cheng said the basis for Trump's actions was ""completely false and wrong"", saying the need for national security laws were legal and necessary.
In some of his toughest rhetoric yet, Trump said Beijing had broken its word over Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy from Beijing, by proposing the national security legislation and that the territory no longer warranted U.S. economic privileges.
""We will take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China,"" Trump said, adding that Washington would also impose sanctions on individuals seen as responsible for ""smothering - absolutely smothering - Hong Kong's freedom.""
Trump told reporters at the White House that China's move on Hong Kong was a tragedy for the world, but he gave no timetable for the moves, leaving Hong Kong residents, businesses and officials to ponder just how far his administration will go.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said Saturday marked ""a sad day"" for China's freest city.
""This is an emotional moment for Americans in Hong Kong and it will take companies and families a while to digest the ramifications,"" AmCham President Tara Joseph said in a statement.
""Many of us ... have deep ties to this city and with Hong Kong people. We love Hong Kong and it's a sad day,"" she said, adding the chamber would continue to work with its members to maintain Hong Kong's status as a vital business centre.

China's parliament this week approved a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. Mainland security and intelligence agents may be stationed in the city for the first time - moves critics say put the city's extensive freedoms at risk.
Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong insist the legislation will target only a small number of ""troublemakers"" who threaten China’s national security. They say such action is urgently needed after months of sometimes violent anti-government protests rocked the city last year.
Protests are simmering again as Hong Kong emerges from its coronavirus shutdown. Demonstrators are expected to take to the streets on Sunday.
Trump did not name any sanctions targets but said the announcement would ""affect the full range of agreements we have with Hong Kong"", including the U.S.-Hong Kong extradition treaty to export controls on dual-use technologies and more ""with few exceptions"".
China's Global Times, published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said Trump's decision was a ""recklessly arbitrary"" step.
The Hong Kong government has had a long history of working ties with U.S. counterparts, distinct from Beijing, with cooperation on counter-terrorism, trade and money laundering.

More than 1,300 U.S. firms have offices in Hong Kong and provide about 100,000 jobs. In the past decade, the U.S. trade surplus with Hong Kong has been the biggest among all its trading partners, totalling $297 billion from 2009 to 2018.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 10:47PM ET</span>","In broadside against China, Trump moves toward ending Hong Kong privileges","By Steve Holland, David Brunnstrom and Sarah Wu
WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China, but stopped short of calling an immediate end to privileges that have helped the territory remain a global financial center.
In making the announcement, Trump used some of his toughest rhetoric yet against China, saying Beijing had broken its word over Hong Kong's autonomy by moving to impose new national security legislation and the territory no longer warranted U.S. economic privileges.
At a White House news conference, Trump called this a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, China and the world, having already attacked Beijing over the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China. Trump said China's ""malfeasance"" was responsible for massive suffering and economic damage worldwide.
""We will take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment as a separate customs and travel territory from the rest of China,"" Trump said, adding that Washington would also impose sanctions on individuals seen as responsible for ""smothering - absolutely smothering - Hong Kong's freedom."" 
He did not name any of the potential sanctions targets. Trump said his announcement would ""affect the full range of agreements we have with Hong Kong,"" from the U.S. extradition treaty to export controls on dual-use technologies and more ""with few exceptions.""
""Our actions will be strong, our actions will be meaningful,"" Trump added.
China's state-run Global Times newspaper called Trump's announcement ""recklessly arbitrary.""
Trump gave no time frame for the moves, suggesting he may be trying to buy time before deciding whether to implement the most drastic measures, which have drawn strong resistance from U.S. companies operating in Hong Kong.
He also said he was issuing a proclamation to better safeguard vital university research by suspending entry of foreign nationals from China identified as potential security risks.
Sources, including a current U.S. official, told Reuters on Thursday that the latter move could affect 3,000 to 5,000 Chinese graduate students.
Financial markets saw Trump's announcement as more bark than bite and U.S. stocks finished mostly higher as it was seen as less threatening to the U.S. economy than investors had feared.
""I don't think a lot has changed,"" said Craig Allen, president of the U.S.-China Business Council. ""We haven't taken steps that really ratchet up the tension even more.""
He said he interpreted the actions rescinding Hong Kong's special status as being first subject to review by various agencies and not happening immediately.
REVVED-UP RHETORIC
Trump's revved-up rhetoric against China comes in the midst of his re-election campaign in which opinion polls show voters increasingly embittered toward Beijing, especially over the coronavirus. 
Trump may be mindful though that a more serious rupture with Beijing could upend his hard-fought Phase One trade deal with the world's second-largest economy, which he has counted on for economic benefit in major U.S. farm states.
Trump also has to take into account the effect on the more than 1,300 U.S. firms that have offices in Hong Kong and provide about 100,000 jobs. 
Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia until early in Trump's administration, said his Hong Kong provisions remained ""fairly vague"" and ""it remains to be seen how quickly and extensively they are implemented.""
But there was a risk that removing Hong Kong's special status might inadvertently accelerate its loss of autonomy.
""Beijing clearly calculated that the collateral damage to their overall interests from U.S. retaliation for would be manageable,"" Russel said.
While Trump gave no time frame for moves, two people familiar with the matter said that among options under consideration were to set a deadline of a year from now for China to step back or else face full revocation of Hong Kong's special status.
Such a deadline would buy time to avoid a major rupture in relations ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. election. By the end of that period, however, Trump might no longer be in office to make the final decision.
Trump's announcement came after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared China's erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy meant the territory no longer warranted special treatment under U.S. law. 
Earlier, Hong Kong's Beijing-backed government told Washington to keep out of the national security debate, and warned that withdrawal of the financial hub's special status could backfire on the U.S. economy.
""Any sanctions are a double-edged sword that will not only harm the interests of Hong Kong but also significantly those of the U.S.,"" it said late on Thursday. 
It said that from 2009 to 2018, the cumulative U.S. trade surplus of $297 billion with Hong Kong was the biggest among all U.S. trading partners.

Chinese authorities and Hong Kong's government say the security legislation poses no threat to the city's autonomy and the interests of foreign investors will be preserved.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A fund to compensate victims of Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse may begin making payouts soon, after the deceased financier's estate, his accusers and the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands resolved their differences over the process.
The accord came 9-1/2 months after Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sexual abuse and sex trafficking charges. The Virgin Islands probate court, which is handling the estate, must still sign off on the fund.
Lawyers for the estate, which was valued at $636.1 million before the recent global market plunge, had proposed the fund last year.
They drew objections from victims' lawyers who said they had not been consulted, and from Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George, who resisted requiring victims to sign broad releases that could block them from suing Epstein's associates.
""We resolved the release issue,"" Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing victims, said in an email on Friday. ""I can't say too much about that at this time but any of Epstein's friends who were also abusers will not be released.""
""My office will forcefully continue its work to hold accountable Epstein’s criminal enterprise,"" George, who announced the agreement, said in a statement.
Darren Indyke and Richard Kahn, executors of the estate, said they were ""pleased"" with the agreement, which they said would ensure claimants were treated with ""compassion, dignity and respect.""
Epstein was arrested in July on charges he abused and trafficked in women and girls from 2002 to 2005 in Manhattan and Florida and pleaded not guilty.
He died Aug. 10, two days after signing his will, by hanging himself in his cell.

George sued the estate in January, saying Epstein's sexual misconduct there stretched from 2001 to 2018 and included raping and trafficking in dozens of women and girls.

MEXICALI, Mexico/EL CENTRO, Calif., (Reuters) - Coronavirus cases are surging in a scorching hot desert region straddling south California and a city near Mexico's Tijuana, leading to saturated hospitals, a cross-border overspill of patients and airlifts from rural U.S. clinics.
Mexicali, capital of the Mexican state of Baja California, has the third-highest number of confirmed COVID cases in Mexico, with its main hospitals at four-fifths capacity, state health department data shows.
Only a few miles beyond the border fence, Imperial County, California, is coping with the most COVID hospitalizations per capita in the state - well over twice the rate of the next highest county.
For the past two weeks, Imperial County's largest hospital has used helicopters to fly some patients to other clinics, including those over 100 miles (160 km) away in San Diego and Palm Springs, because its intensive care unit is full.
""We continue to be in a surge with all our hospital beds being full,"" Judy Cruz, emergency room director for El Centro Regional Medical Center, told Reuters on Friday.
Part of the wave of patients are U.S. citizens who live in Mexico and cross to seek care, Cruz said.
At least 57 patients have arrived in ambulances that picked them up at the Calexico port of entry in the last two weeks, some unconscious by the time they reached El Centro, she added.
Many other cases are among the county's residents.
Like other heavily trafficked California border regions - where thousands of trucks and essential workers cross back and forth every day - Imperial Valley's infections are surging, with the number of confirmed COVID cases tripling throughout the month of May.
Over the past two weeks the county has registered 406 cases per every 100,000 residents — more than five times the state average.
   
""SATURATED""
Mexicali Fire Department Chief Ruben Osuna said his paramedics sometimes have to wait hours to deliver suspected COVID patients to hospitals because emergency rooms are saturated.
Some never make it, he added, saying three to four suspected COVID patients die in their homes in the city every day.
Emergency room doctor Ruben de la Torre, who works in both Mexicali General Hospital and IMSS Regional Hospital No. 30 — the city’s two largest COVID facilities — said widespread outbreaks among medical workers left both hospitals dangerously short staffed.
The Mexican government says health workers make up at least a fifth of coronavirus cases nationwide.
If Mexicali's infection rate fails to level off soon ""people are going to die right outside the hospital,"" de la Torre said.
IMSS and Baja California Health Department officials did not immediately respond to questions about staffing or infection among healthcare workers.
In Imperial County, Cruz said her hospital was unlikely to empty out anytime soon.

""Once they reopen things, I am concerned we will have another surge,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Shaken and angry, Minneapolis' telegenic young mayor stood in front of television cameras over and over this week - first to decry the police killing of George Floyd, and on Friday to impose a curfew as parts of his city burned in ongoing protests. 
Disturbing footage showing a Minneapolis law enforcement officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck and the ensuing unrest after the 46-year-old's death have drawn international attention to Mayor Jacob Frey, a 38-year-old attorney and former professional athlete who ran for office on a platform of reforming the police.
""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" Frey declared at a news conference after Floyd's killing, and called openly for the arrest of the officer involved, Derek Chauvin. He fired all four officers who had been at the scene as Floyd repeatedly cried out that he could not breathe, and Chauvin was charged Friday with third degree murder.
A former civil rights and employment attorney, Frey's political future may hinge on his handling of Floyd's death and its violent aftermath, which have followed the coronavirus pandemic that shut down his city for two months.
Frey grew up in Virginia near Washington, D.C., but fell in love with Minneapolis when running a marathon there, his official website said. He moved to Minneapolis after receiving his law degree from Villanova University near Philadelphia in 2009.
After four years on the city council, he became mayor in 2018, taking over a city that despite a longstanding liberal reputation had been wracked by high-profile cases of police shootings - the death of Jamar Clark, a black man, in 2015, and the death of Justine Ruszczyk, a white woman, in 2017.
Frey had vowed to reform the police department, and had won awards for his civil rights work in Minneapolis, a rapidly changing city where the black or African-American population grew by 36% or 95,000 people from 2010 to 2018, the Minnesota state website shows. 
But by this week's end, with the smell of burned plastic and building materials wafting through the city, Frey's credibility was ""understandably at a low point in communities of color,"" the Minneapolis Star-Tribune's editorial board wrote.
David Schultz, a professor of political science at Hamline University in St. Paul, said Frey is leading a city that, while politically mostly liberal, is divided among affluent white areas and poorer, mostly black areas that did not benefit as much from the region's booming economy. 
Taking over a city that before coronavirus had a miniscule unemployment rate, Frey has now been doubly challenged, Schultz said. His ability to bring the city back both from the devastating virus shutdown and Floyd's death and its aftermath, will be crucial to his mayoralty, as well as any future political ambitions, Schultz said.
""He has to come out of this addressing not only the disparity but now addressing the destruction,"" said Schultz.
On Friday, Frey became a target of Republican President Donald Trump, who called him ""weak"" for not quelling the unrest that included people breaking into stores and the burning of a police station. Trump has attacked Frey before, calling him a ""radical left"" Democrat on Twitter last October.

""Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis,"" Frey said Friday. ""We are strong as hell.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military believes a Russian introduction of warplanes into Libya may not tip the balance in its stalemated civil war but could further help Moscow eventually secure a geostrategic stronghold in North Africa, a U.S. general said on Friday.
Russian military personnel have delivered 14 MiG 29 and Su-24 fighter jets to the Libyan National Army's Jufra air base, the U.S. military says, despite denials from the LNA and a Russian member of parliament. 
U.S. Brigadier General Gregory Hadfield, deputy director of U.S. Africa Command's Intelligence Directorate, told a small group of reporters the Russian aircrafts' flight path originated in Russia and passed through Iran and Syria before reaching Libya.
Hadfield said the aircraft had not been used yet but could add new capability for Eastern commander Khalifa Haftar's LNA, which has so far failed in its year-long effort to capture Tripoli, the seat of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA). 
The GNA, in turn, has been receiving critical support from Turkey, including drone strikes.
But Hadfield cautioned that Moscow may not require an outright victory for Haftar to advance Russian interests.
""Backing the LNA and backing Field Marshal Haftar, it really isn't about winning the war, it's about developing strongholds,"" Hadfield said.
A big U.S. concern would be if Moscow used such a location to stage missiles.
""If Russia secures a permanent position in Libya and, worse, deploys long-range missile systems, it will be a game changer for Europe, NATO and many Western nations,"" he said.
Libya is once more on the brink after years of chaos that followed the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. With more arms and fighters flowing in, Libyans fear an unending conflict fueled by outside powers.

One Western diplomat warned of a ""stagnating conflict in which escalation is met with escalation.""

1426,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>",Videos of U.S. police killings spur protest - and sometimes charges,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The decision of Minneapolis prosecutors to criminally charge a police officer four days after the death of George Floyd shows how efforts to hold officers accountable often hinge on the level of public protest and whether the incident was caught on video.
Even then, it is rare for officers to be charged criminally in such incidents, with the swiftness of the Floyd charges something of an anomaly.
Derek Chauvin, the officer seen on a bystander's cellphone video kneeling on Floyd's neck on Monday before the 46-year-old man died, was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Friday said the FBI would conduct its own investigation.
The killing, the video of which has been widely viewed on social media and on television, spurred three nights of protest in Minneapolis that at times turned violent.
""Thank God a young person had a camera to video it,"" Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said of Floyd's death, noting that in many instances no footage exists.
In contrast, an investigation into the March 13 killing by Louisville, Kentucky, police of emergency medical technician Breonna Taylor, in which there was no viral video, remains ongoing. 
The FBI said it launched an investigation into her death on May 21, more than two months later. The city's police chief, Steve Conrad, will retire at the end of June, Louisville's mayor said the same day. None of the three officers involved in the raid have been charged as of Friday.
The sporadic nature of criminal charges frustrates civil rights activists.
""We are not seeing officers held accountable at the rates they should be. The number of shootings of unarmed African-Americans far exceed the number of officers being held accountable,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
In other high-profile cases, criminal charges have been brought after public protests, but not as quickly as in Minneapolis.
In Baltimore, police officers were charged over the death of Freddie Gray only after the aftermath led to riots. Gray was arrested on April 12, 2015 in an incident caught on video and subsequently given a ""rough ride"" in the back of a police van, injuring his spine. He died of his injuries a week later and hundreds of people attended his funeral on April 27. Later that night, riots erupted in the neighborhood where he was arrested.
Four days later, on May 1, the city charged six officers for their role in his death. All six were eventually cleared, and the federal Justice Department declined to charge anyone involved in the case.
In other cases there are no criminal charges, such as in the death of Eric Garner in New York in 2014, which was captured on video and led to protests. He died in a chokehold after repeatedly crying ""I can't breathe"" -- a plea that became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement and was heard again in videos of Floyd's death.
In one illustration of the power of bystander video, groups representing law enforcement officers say they do not object to the additional scrutiny of either bystander video or cameras that officers are increasingly required to wear.
""We favor the use of body cameras, and we don't have a position on the constitutional right of an individual in a public place to use a camera,"" said Jim Pasco, executive director of the National Fraternal Order of Police.

He also said he didn't see any particular problems with the speed with which charges were brought against Chauvin.

(Reuters) - Once the coronavirus pandemic forced her Orangetheory gym to close, Chiaki Osaka was eager to stay in shape while staying inside her home in Cupertino, California.
She had her heart set on an exercise bike from Peloton (NASDAQ:PTON), known for its high-tech equipment and virtual classes, but they were temporarily sold out. However, she was able to find a Schwinn equivalent from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). 
""I was afraid to, one, get out of shape, and, two, I'm staying inside and working on my computer all day,"" Osaka said. ""I needed a change, and I needed structure to my life."" 
With millions of Americans staying home, demand has soared for fitness equipment to create home gyms - both as a way to stay fit and to relieve stress. 
The NPD Group reported fitness equipment sales rose 130% in March from a year ago. Sales of exercise bikes were up 170%, free weights up 181%, and benches up 259%, according to the market research company.
Freelance journalist Hoda Emam in San Francisco bought a trampoline to keep her three kids under the age of five occupied. 
""The kids were waking up in the morning with a ton of energy,"" Emam said. ""Under normal circumstances, they would go to school or preschool, and we did not have a way to get out all this pent-up energy."" 
Now, she and her husband can focus on work. 
In the coronavirus era, companies are shifting gears, said Ryan McGrotty, co-founder of Rep Fitness, a fitness equipment supplier in Denver. 
""A lot of the companies that had previously specialized in commercial equipment are now starting to market things towards the home gym market,"" McGrotty said. ""I think a lot of companies, if they want to survive, that's honestly going to be the way that they have to go, at least for the next year or so.""
McGrotty declined to give numbers, but said his company was seeing demand that ""exceeds Black Friday levels, every day since March 13.""

1428,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 05:10PM ET</span>",Minneapolis police officer charged with murder in George Floyd case,"By Carlos Barria
MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The white Minneapolis policeman who pinned an unarmed black man with a knee to the neck before the man later died was arrested and charged with murder, a prosecutor said on Friday, after three nights of violent protests rocked the Midwestern city.
Derek Chauvin, the officer seen on a bystander's cellphone video kneeling on George Floyd's neck on Monday before the 46-year-old man died, has been charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman told a news briefing. 
""He is in custody and has been charged with murder,"" Freeman said of Chauvin. ""We have evidence, we have the citizen's camera's video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we have all seen over and over again, we have the officer's body-worn camera, we have statements from some witnesses.""
The cellphone footage showed Floyd repeatedly moaning and gasping while he pleaded to Chauvin, ""Please, I can't breathe."" After several minutes, Floyd gradually grows quiet and ceases to move.
Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, and an autopsy found the combined impact of his being restrained by the police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death, according to the charging document.
Chauvin and three fellow officers at the scene were fired on Tuesday from the police department of Minneapolis, a city of 425,000 people in Hennepin County. The city identified the other officers as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng.
Freeman said the investigation into Chauvin - who, if convicted, faces up to 25 years in prison on the murder charge - was ongoing and that he anticipated charges against the other officers. He said it was appropriate to charge ""the most dangerous perpetrator"" first.
In a statement U.S. Attorney General William Barr called the video of Floyd's encounter with Chauvin ""harrowing and deeply disturbing"" and noted that a parallel federal investigation was ongoing to determine if the officers violated civil rights laws.
Floyd's death is the latest killing to galvanize the nation's thinking about policing of racial minorities, and was eerily reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City, who died after being put in a police chokehold and telling the officers, ""I can't breathe.""
Mike Griffin, a community organizer in Minneapolis, said the protests reflected years of frustration over economic inequalities between whites and minorities and the feeling that black lives were not valued as highly by the police. 
He said anger has been building since the 2015 fatal shooting by Minneapolis police of 24-year-old black man Jamar Clark, and the 2016 killing of Philando Castile, a 32-year old black man shot by Minnesota police during a traffic stop.
""George's murder was just the last straw,"" Griffin told Reuters, calling the charges against Chauvin a step in the right direction. ""We need to change systemic issues with the police force.""
The protests, which threatened to carry into a fourth night, have been driven in part by the initial lack of arrests in the case. 
Responding to a reporter's question about why no officer was arrested sooner, Freeman stressed that charges in similar cases typically take nine months to a year.
""This is by far the fastest we've ever charged a police officer,"" said Freeman. 
Earlier on Friday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said he understood why people had ""lost faith"" in the police but argued Floyd's plight had gotten ""lost in 48 hours of anarchy"" and called for an end to destruction of property and the burning down of a police precinct Thursday night.
Walz has declared a state of emergency and called in the state's National Guard and patrol force to restore order after city police largely left protesters alone overnight. Walz apologized to CNN after arresting its TV crew during an early morning sweep of the city on Friday.
""None of us can live in a society where roving bands go unchecked and do what they want to, ruin property,"" Walz said, adding that a reckoning with the city's racial inequities could not happen without calm. ""We have to get back to that point of what caused this all to happen and start working on that."" 

Protests emerged in several other U.S. cities on Friday over the killing of Floyd and other unarmed black people, including Breonna Taylor, who was fatally shot by police in her home in Louisville, Kentucky, in March.

Trump made the announcement at a White House news conference, saying China had broken its word over Hong Kong's autonomy. He said its move against Hong Kong was a tragedy for the people of Hong Kong, China and the world.
""We will take action to revoke Hong Kong's preferential treatment,"" he said, adding that the United States would also impose sanctions on individuals seen as responsible for smothering Hong Kong's autonomy.
Trump's move follows Chinese plans to impose new national security legislation on the former British colony. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said the territory no longer warrants special treatment under U.S. law that has enabled it to remain a global financial center.
Trump said he was directing his administration to begin the process of eliminating policy agreements on Hong Kong, ranging from extradition treatment to export controls.
He said he would also issue a proclamation on Friday to better safeguard vital university research by suspending the entry of foreign nationals from China identified as potential security risks.
Sources, including a current U.S. official, told Reuters on Thursday that the latter move, which had been expected, could impact 3,000 to 5,000 Chinese graduate students.

The Orion V operation - which includes 26 countries from the Americas and Europe - took place from the start of April until May 15. Some 150 people were arrested and dozens of watercraft and four airplanes were confiscated.
""During the development of this phase, when we see that the confiscated tonnes (of cocaine) continues growing and are above the dozens, it allows us to reaffirm that the commitment to multilateralism in the fight against drug trafficking is fundamental,"" Duque said during virtual presentation.
The confiscated cocaine is equivalent to some 126 million doses and $1.7 billion in earnings for criminal gangs, Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said. The operation also confiscated 7 tonnes of marijuana worth about $36.7 million.
The South American country has come under sustained pressure from the White House to reduce cultivation of the coca, the base ingredient in cocaine. Colombia's potential cocaine production was up by 8% to 951 metric tons last year, the White House says.
The Orion operation - part of a series of joint efforts to combat trafficking - has confiscated 180.3 tonnes of cocaine and 22.6 tonnes of marijuana so far this year.
Drug trafficking has long fed the Andean country's internal armed conflict. Leftist rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), dissidents from the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas - who demobilized under a 2016 peace deal - and criminal groups all make money from the trade, according to security sources.

(Reuters) - Belgium will allow cross-border travel to visit family members in neighbouring countries from Saturday, in a slight easing of travel restrictions imposed to curb the coronavirus, the interior minister said on Friday.
Belgian Interior Minister Pieter De Crem said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that a ministerial decree will be published on Saturday. 
""From tomorrow it will again be possible to visit family members in our neighbouring countries,"" he said.
De Crem said travellers must comply with coronavirus precautions in bordering countries - France, Luxembourg, Germany and the Netherlands.
Non-essential travel to and from Belgium has been restricted since mid-March.
The European Union's (EU) executive Commission pushed this month to reopen the bloc's internal borders, but recommended that external borders remain closed for most travel until 15 June. 
The Belgian government has also drawn up rules that cafes and restaurants must follow when they reopen, although a date for this has not been fixed, economy and consumer affairs minister Nathalie Muylle told the VRT public broadcaster.
Restaurants and cafes must keep tables 1.5 metres apart, close at midnight, and take orders at a customer's table, not at the counter. Reservations will be required at restaurants, while in cafes one customer per table must leave their contact details to enable contact tracing in the event of an outbreak. 
Belgium has been among the worst-affected countries in Europe with 58,061 COVID-19 cases and 9,430 deaths, although the number of cases, hospital admissions and fatalities has declined since peaking in early April.

In this rural corner of South America, flanked by the high Andes on one side and the vast Pacific on the other, a strong internet connection is far from guaranteed.
Romero, who is studying chemistry and pharmacology, sits atop a corrugated metal rooftop wearing pink sneakers and a mask as she signs on to her online classes. The 18-year old from San Ramon, not far from an area hard hit by the pandemic, says the fast-approaching winter rains have only made things worse.
""There are times when the roof is so wet you can´t climb it,"" she said. Her parents, she said, have built a ladder that allows her easier access to rafters, and then, the roof, without sliding.
Chile is now in the throes of the pandemic, reporting nearly more than 90,000 total coronavirus cases and upwards of 900 deaths. The number of new cases emerging daily has quadrupled in May, to around 4,000 per day.
Schools in Chile were closed in March, early in the southern hemisphere school year. Officials have yet to announce a date to re-open.
Romero´s mother, Gloria Benavides, says she worries about her daughter perched on the roof, especially on the cold and wet days of winter, but sees no other option.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal gave the green light on Friday to the third phase of its lockdown exit, but some restrictions will remain in Lisbon due to localised outbreaks in industrial hubs and outskirts.
From June 1, shopping malls, childcare centres, gyms, cinemas, theatres and other cultural venues can reopen across most of the country but with capacity restrictions.
Gatherings of up to 20 people will be allowed, and the 50% capacity rule on restaurants in place since their reopening on May 18 will be lifted.
But in Greater Lisbon, where most recently reported cases were located, gatherings remain limited to ten people, and shopping malls stay closed until at least Thursday.
""Unfortunately, the evolution in Lisbon is significantly different from the rest of the country,"" Prime Minister Antonio Costa said. ""But as I said at the beginning, I have no shame in taking a step back if necessary.""
The prime minister promised widespread testing of construction workers and those on temporary contracts in Azambuja, an industrial hub where 340 workers tested positive for the virus at two warehouses in recent weeks.
Those living with workers will also be tested, Costa said, and housing made available to people needing to self-isolate.
Portugal, which has recorded 31,946 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,383 deaths backed by Europe's fourth highest testing rate, began lifting a handful of restrictions imposed during a six-week lockdown from May 4.
Concerns are spreading about localised outbreaks in poorer parts of Lisbon's outskirts such as the ""Jamaica"" neighbourhood where residents asked for cafes to be closed and the area cordoned off after a sudden spike in cases. 

Portugal's economy, which was slowly recovering from a severe debt crisis, is expected to contract by 8% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, above the European Commission's predictions of a 6.8% drop.

The most populous U.S. city, which has become the epicenter of the country's coronavirus pandemic, was on track to meet the metrics for a safe reopening, Cuomo said. 
""We are on track to open on June 8,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing but warned that ""reopening does not mean we're going back to the way things were.""
The first phase of reopening would allow non-essential construction and manufacturing to resume, and non-essential retail stores to offer curbside pick-up. 
Cuomo said he expected some 400,000 New Yorkers to be able to return to their workplaces starting June 8, and said the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) was working on a plan to make the city's mass transit system safe for commuters.
""I understand why people would be anxious about taking public transit,"" Cuomo said. ""The public transit system will be safe.""
New York City is the only one of the state's 10 regions that has not met the seven health benchmarks for reopening set by state authorities. 
The Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, Southern Tier, North Country and Central New York are the five regions cleared to enter phase two and allow services like barber shops and in-store shopping to resume, with restrictions like 50% occupancy and face coverings.
Cuomo also recommended that professionals in the phase two industries get tested before operations resume.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Five weeks after the International Monetary Fund gave Bosnia $370.46 million in emergency aid to help combat the coronavirus crisis, the funds have still not been disbursed due to a disagreement between its rival ethnic leaders, officials said.
Even though the lender had doubled the original amount, the leaders have not reached a consensus on how to split the funds, which have remained blocked at the central bank ever since.
The aid was approved and handed over only after a political deal was reached under which the Federation would receive 62% and the Serb Republic 38% of the funds, while each region would allocate 0.5% of its share to Bosnia's neutral Brcko District.
In the Letter of Intent signed with the IMF, the leaders of the Bosniak-Croat Federation also agreed to allocate 50% of the funds to its 10 cantons, the pledge that was later reflected in the region's revised budget for 2020. 
But in reality, Croat and Bosniak ministers in the national government have persistently argued over the legal procedure needed for the disbursal of the funds. 
""I would have never imagined that it would have dragged so long,"" said Andrew Jewell, the IMF resident representative in Bosnia. ""To my knowledge, this situation is unprecedented, for a country to request emergency assistance and not use it.""
Reuters tried to contact Bosnia's prime minister for comment but he was not immediately available to comment. 
Bosnia comprises two autonomous regions, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, tied via a weak central government.
Jewell said the IMF transferred the funds under its Rapid Financing Instrument on April 22, following an agreement among the Bosnian Serb, Croat and Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) leaders on how to distribute them.
The European Union delegation and U.S. Embassy in Bosnia, both of which have mediated in removing the impasse, have called on the national government to issue a decision to allocate the funds in accordance with the Letter of Intent.
""Bosnia-Herzegovina politicians should immediately unblock the IMF funds so they can be used for the good of the citizens,"" they said in a joint statement on Thursday.
Finance Minister Vjekoslav Bevanda, a Croat, said on Thursday that such a decision was not necessary, while the central bank governor, Senad Softic, a Bosniak, said the bank would not disburse the funds to the regions without the decision that is reflecting the Letter of Intent with the IMF. 
Jewell said that holding of the emergency assistance may have an impact of the future IMF loans.
""In this environment when they are sitting on 333 million euros it's highly unlikely that we would start negotiations on a new programme,"" he told Reuters.

Libya's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) said on Thursday it had issued arrest warrants for suspects in the killing of 24 Bangladeshi and six African migrants. 
Another 11 migrants survived the shooting and are in hospital in Mizda, a desert town 160 km (100 miles) south of Tripoli where the killings took place. 
The migrants had been crossing the desert from Benghazi in search of work when they were taken hostage by an armed group near Mizda 15 days ago, the Bangladesh ministry cited the survivor as saying. 
""They tortured them inhumanely for a ransom. At some point in their ordeal the captives killed the main kidnapper. In retaliation, the militia fired indiscriminately at them,"" it added in a statement. 
GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha said authorities were doing all they could to find the perpetrators. A local official in Mizda, speaking anonymously, said security forces there had not detained them because they had lost a family member. 
Mizda is under the control of eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) but not far from areas held by the GNA. 
The International Organisation for Migration, a United Nations agency, said the incident took place in a smuggling warehouse where a group of migrants was being held.

He escaped to Spain, hoping to secure King Philip III's backing for a renewed assault. But Philip was uninterested and O'Donnell died shortly before his 30th birthday near Valladolid, the site of the Spanish court at the time.

But the location of the chapel that holds his remains, and where explorer Christopher Columbus was originally buried, was a mystery until now. 
Last year, a retired Irish army officer passed through Valladolid while walking the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage route and started enquiring, according to Carlos Burgos, president of the Hispano-Irish association. 
""He spoke to city officials. They realized he (O'Donnell) was buried here where we are, but they didn't know the exact site, and that was the start of the story,"" he said. 
So far the dig has unearthed several skeletons, though none has been confirmed as O'Donnell. 
His body should be identifiable due to a lack of big toes, which he lost to frostbite during a daring winter escape from Dublin Castle, where he was imprisoned by the English. 
""He's a very dashing figure. He had a dramatic life and died young,"" said Hiram Morgan, a historian at University College Cork, who believes O'Donnell's native Donegal would likely want his remains repatriated.

""We're in touch with the Ministry of Culture in Ireland and that's a decision we will take together,"" Valladolid's Mayor Oscar Puente said.

The 87-year-old Kabuga has been indicted by U.N. prosecutors for genocide and incitement to commit genocide. He is accused of bankrolling and arming ethnic Hutu militias that killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus over around 100 days in 1994. He denied the charges this week.
He has been in a Parisian prison since May 16 when police swooped on his hideout in the capital's suburbs, ending a 26-year manhunt. A French court will decide whether to transfer him to a United Nations tribunal on June 3. 
""In recent years he has accumulated many pathologies: diabetes, hypertension and severe senile dementia,"" a statement from his 11 children said.
""He also had a colectomy last year. His state of health requires support and constant surveillance, like any weak and dependent elderly person,"" the statement said, adding that he had lost weight and become more incoherent since his detention.
A Paris court on May 27 denied a request by his lawyers for his release saying it could stir unrest in the Rwandan community and that there was no guarantee he would not flee, given the aid provided by his family to avoid capture in recent years. 
Kabuga was Rwanda's most-wanted fugitive with a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head, until French, British and Belgian intelligence agents tracked him down to his son's apartment in a northwestern Paris suburb.

""Leaving our father in prison, in his state, amounts to denying his fundamental human rights. It is a cry for help that we are making today to challenge his imprisonment which could be fatal to our father,"" the children said.

PARIS/NICE, France (Reuters) - Serge Coeroli has given the shelves behind the bar of his Paris restaurant a new lick of paint, in anticipation of customers returning now that lockdown rules in France are easing.
But the relief he feels is overshadowed by a nagging uncertainty over whether he can salvage his summer season.
From beach bars along the French Riviera to campsites in the Dordogne, businesses in the battered tourism industry faced a race against time to bring staff out of furlough, reactivate supply chains and secure bookings.
Few were under any illusions the return to business would be straightforward, particularly in Paris where the virus is more prevalent and restrictions more stringent. Restaurants and cafes, for example, will only be able to open outdoor areas.
""It allows us in a way to reopen the kitchen, to get into gear, contact suppliers, and reopen little by little,"" said Coeroli, whose restaurant Le Zebre has limited 'terrace' space.
""But it's not with three tables outside that we'll make a living, that's for sure.""
From June 2, France is reopening its beaches and allowing restaurants, bars and cafes to resume business. It is also ending travel curbs within the country and wants Europe to lift internal border restrictions by mid-June.
In Cannes, host in normal times of one of the world's biggest film festivals, public workers disinfected the beach ahead of the anticipated crowds.
Further east along the Mediterranean coast, in Nice, private beach operator Rene Colomban isn't short of outdoor space for his restaurant tables and sun loungers. But he does lack visibility on when foreign tourists will return.
""We have no idea how this is going to pan out,"" he said. He will be bringing his 14 permanent employees out of furlough but is keeping another 10 seasonal workers waiting to hear if they have a job this summer.
""I think we will be hiring fewer people this year,"" he added.
Nearly 90 million foreign tourists visited France in 2018, making it the most visited country in the world. Tourism accounts for about 7% of France’s 2.3 trillion euro ($2.48 trillion) economy.
Ge Kusters, owner of Le Paradis campsite in the Dordorgne, said he anticipated a slow start to June, with most early reservations now cancelled. But July looked promising, he said.
Pool (NASDAQ:POOL) opening times will be staggered and clients given disinfectant wipes to take to the bathroom blocks.

Asked if summer earnings could be saved, he replied: ""High season is 70-80% of our revenues. We're pretty confident.""

Libya's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) signed the maritime delimitation deal last year. Turkey says it creates an exclusive economic zone from its southern coast to Libya's northeast coast, and protects rights to resources. 
Greece, Cyprus and others oppose the accord and call it illegal, an accusation Ankara has rejected. The European Union also opposes the maritime deal that was signed alongside an agreement for Turkey to provide military support to the GNA, which has battled forces based in eastern Libya for more than a year.
Speaking at a ceremony to mark the launch of Turkey's Fatih oil-and-gas drilling ship to the Black Sea, Donmez said Turkish Petroleum (TPAO), which had applied for an exploration permit in the eastern Mediterranean, would begin operations in areas under its license after the process was completed.
""Within the framework of the agreement we reached with Libya we will be able to start our oil exploration operations there within three to four months,"" Donmez said. Turkey's new Kanuni drill ship would also go to the Mediterranean later this year, he added. 
The move could further stoke tensions in the region, where Turkey has been at loggerheads for years with Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel over ownership of natural resources. Turkey could also face possible EU sanctions over its operations.
Separately, Donmez said the Fatih drill ship would hold its first operation in the Black Sea on July 15, the anniversary of a 2016 failed coup attempt. Friday also marked the anniversary of Istanbul's conquest by the Ottoman Empire in 1453.

Whelan, 50, a U.S. national who also holds British, Canadian and Irish passports, has been held in Russia for 17 months and had complained of a hernia and other health issues in custody. He was detained in what he says was a set-up in December 2018.
Russia informed the U.S. embassy that Whelan had undergone the surgery on Thursday and the U.S. ambassador spoke to him on Friday once he had returned to his prison, embassy spokeswoman Rebecca Ross said. 
She accused Russia's authorities of having denied Whelan necessary medical care until now, despite what she said were repeated requests to allow him to be seen by an outside English-speaking doctor.
""Russian authorities waited until #PaulWhelan's condition was life-threatening to provide him medical attention. That is unacceptable and dangerous,"" Ross wrote on Twitter. 
Whelan's brother David was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying the operation had been on a hernia and that Whelan had experienced severe stomach pain late on Thursday. 
Whelan has pleaded not guilty to the charge of spying. But Russia says he was caught red-handed and prosecutors have asked the court to jail him for 18 years. A verdict is expected on June 15.
His trial, which the United States has called a mockery of justice based on spurious charges, has been closed to the public because Moscow says the case is classified. 

The U.S. ambassador, John Sullivan, said last month Whelan had potentially life threatening health issues that required medical attention, but that the embassy had not been allowed to have its own doctors visit Whelan.

Maesaiah Thabane was charged with ordering the killing of Thomas Thabane's then estranged wife Lipolelo, who was shot dead near her home in Lesotho's capital, Maseru, in June, 2017. She was released on bail in February.
The case has caused huge political upheaval in Lesotho, an independent kingdom lying in the middle of a South African mountain range, with Thomas Thabane also suspected of involvement in the killing and having appeared in court.
Both Maesaiah and Thomas Thabane have denied any role in Lipolelo's death.
The court set aside the bail, with a panel of three judges citing in court papers the unusual speed of the decision among the reasons for the ruling, as well as the lack of consideration of the likelihood of witness interference.

The court said it could not order police to re-arrest Maesaiah Thabane but ordered that the bail ruling be remitted to the High Court to be heard by a different judge.

Austria introduced a lockdown early in its outbreak and had far fewer deaths per capita than many of its neighbours. It was one of the first countries in Europe able to loosen restrictions, beginning on April 14. Shops, restaurants, bars, schools and hotels have all since reopened.
Authorities have required people to wear masks or alternative cloth face coverings in shops and on public transport, a move aimed at preventing the wearer from infecting others.
""Face masks will no longer be compulsory in shops or in school,"" Kurz told a news conference, saying the changes would take effect on June 15.
Masks will continue to be compulsory on public transport, in health facilities including pharmacies, and at service providers where social distancing cannot be ensured, such as at hairdressers, he added.
A limit allowing bars and restaurants to seat no more than four adults at a table will be lifted, and a mandatory closing time of 11:00 p.m. will be extended for two more hours.
""We are happy that we can make these adjustments because it means easing restrictions. But I am honest enough to add today that if the situation worsens it will be necessary to reintroduce measures regionally,"" Kurz said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN) would be willing to participate in a global three-month ceasefire being discussed at the United Nations to contain the spread of coronavirus, the head of its negotiating team said.
The group - whose nascent Cuba peace talks with the government were put on ice after a rebel bombing killed 22 police cadets last year - hopes President Ivan Duque would also back the ceasefire, Pablo Beltran told Reuters.
On March 23, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called for a ceasefire in global conflicts so the world can focus on the pandemic. The U.N. Security Council appears to back that call, but the 15-member body has failed to agree a resolution due to a stand-off by China and the United States over whether to mention the World Health Organization.
The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union, held a unilateral ceasefire during April.
""We are informed of that process. We're studying it and of course we would look favorably on that happening and that this time the Colombian government does implement it,"" Beltran said in a video-call interview. 
""Of course, our leadership in Colombia would responsibly take up the call,"" he said.
Colombia, which has more than 25,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 800 deaths, has been gradually loosening a nationwide lockdown now set to last until July 1.
No ELN member has been infected, Beltran said.
Duque, whose party opposed a 2016 peace deal with the FARC guerrillas, has demanded the ELN hold a unilateral ceasefire, halt kidnappings, free hostages and abandon the use of landmines and the forced recruitment of minors for talks to resume.
The ELN is willing to make gestures like freeing hostages, Beltran said, but other efforts to deescalate conflict must be agreed at talks. 
The group's ""willingness to find a political solution to the conflict"" remains, he said.
Duque's government has requested Cuba extradite Beltran and other negotiators on charges related to the police academy bombing in January 2019, but the ELN says if talks do not restart the team should be allowed to return to guerrilla areas in Colombia under the original terms of the negotiations.
""It's a critical point,"" Beltran said. ""We have told them our delegation is here, send your delegates. If you don't, return this delegation to Colombia.""

The breakdown of ELN negotiations with previous governments has been put down to the group's devolved command structure and disagreements within its ranks.

According to Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, about 100 people took part in the clashes, some of whom came from another region.
The footage, which Reuters could not immediately verify independently, showed men in masks and dark clothes exchanging fire with hidden adversaries who were obscured by trees. Reuters counted around 40 shots.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party is planning to push through measures with its nationalist allies that affect how political groups may contest elections and could hamper new opposition parties taking part in any snap elections. 
The move comes after two of Erdogan's leading long-time allies, former prime minister Ahmet Davutoglu and former economy chief Ali Babacan, formed separate political parties in recent months to challenge the ruling AKP.
Three AKP officials told Reuters there is no intention to hold elections before the scheduled polls in 2023. The planned measures are not meant to block new parties but rather to prevent a political manoeuvre used in the past, they said.
In 2018, 15 parliamentarians from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) switched to the new Iyi Party so that it could contest snap elections by forming a parliamentary group. One AKP official said the new measures will stop parties from forming parliamentary groups in this ""unethical way"".
The measures would lower the threshold for parties to enter the assembly to 5% of the vote from 10%, but crucially for new parties would prevent tactical transfers like those made in 2018. The government expects to submit the changes to parliament in June, the AKP official said.
The CHP has signalled it would offer support to the new parties, prompting senior AKP official Naci Bostanci to say his party is working with its nationalist MHP allies to prevent attempts to ""market"" lawmakers in an anti-democratic way. 
To take part in elections, parties must have held a congress and formed a party structure in half of Turkey's provinces or already have a group of at least 20 MPs in parliament - criteria which the two new parties do not yet meet.
""It's clear that any legal regulation about political parties is being brought on the agenda to prevent new parties like ours from entering elections,"" said a senior official from Babacan's Deva Party.

Selim Temurci, spokesman for Davutoglu's Future Party, said his party was on the verge of meeting the conditions of the law and will hold a congress in August.

MADRID (Reuters) - With air kisses and palms clasped, elderly patients in Madrid greet medics who come to check them at home during the coronavirus pandemic despite the risks involved.
""I don't know if it's right to say it but I've had little fear,"" primary care nurse Ana Arenal told Reuters after she and a doctor did the rounds in a taxi with plentiful gear to protect both themselves and their patients. 
The people they attend are usually virus-free and require regular injections, blood pressure or other checks. The medics wear masks, visors and gloves in most cases, but have full protective equipment for some patients with symptoms.
""In order to avoid the risk to patients (from going out), we've done a lot of daily home visits. We saw a lot of gratitude in them,"" added Arenal alongside doctor Carlos Balsalobre Sanchez as they visited middle-class apartments often adorned with figures of Catholic saints. 
""If we don't take care of ourselves, we won't be able to take care of them. That's one of the things they say a lot,"" said Balsalobre Sanchez, with an old-school leather doctor's bag. 
But it is not all kisses and gratitude for the home care crews. Many have painful memories from the epidemic that has killed more than 27,000 Spaniards.
""Seeing in our diaries the little red dot next to a name ... that during the pandemic meant the death of our patients, has been quite hard,"" recalled Arenal.
Balsalobre Sanchez's most poignant moment was seeing an elderly couple embrace for the last time before the wife was taken to a hospital, where she later died.
Another nurse, Maria Jesus Santamaria, who has been doing phone check-ups and visits, recalled an elderly woman saying ""goodbye"" by phone and asking her to take care of her husband.
""Many people have overcome the illness, thank God, but you take that with you,"" Santamaria said. 
But her 75-year-old patient Manuel Sanz Calderon said, after taking his injections, the nurse never shows anything but cheeriness: ""She is loving, kind and I can't say more about her.""
Santamaria blushes when medics like her are lauded. 
""Heroes have been all of us, those who have stayed at home, us doing our job,"" she said.

An excavator cutting through the coal rich soil had pulled out some muddy timber weeks before, but coronavirus restrictions had meant the retrieval had to wait.
The ship was part of Viminacium, a sprawling Roman city of 45,000 people with a hippodrome, fortifications, a forum, palace, temples, amphitheatre, aqueducts, baths and workshops.
Lead archaeologist Miomir Korac said the vessel dated from the 3rd century AD when Viminacium was the capital of the Roman province of Moesia Superior and near a tributary of the Danube river.
""A Roman (river) fleet was based here to defend this region from barbarian invasions,"" he told Reuters. ""Such findings of Roman ships are really rare, especially in such a good condition where one could see how the boat was built.""
The ship originally measured 19 meters. It had a flat bottom, six pairs of oars and fittings for a triangular sail. The nine-metre front section had thick wooden sides and was discovered along with the remains of two smaller boats.
It will eventually go on display with some of tens of thousands of other artefacts unearthed from the site near the town of Kostolac, some 70 km (45 miles) east of Belgrade.
They include golden tiles, jade sculptures, mosaics and frescos, along with 14,000 tombs and the remains of three mammoths. The archaeologists are now working on what they believe to be the headquarters of a Roman general.

Excavations of Viminacium have been going on since 1882, but the archaeologists estimate that they have only covered 4% of the site, which they say is 450 hectares - bigger than New York's Central Park - and rare in not being buried under a modern city.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - A third night of racially charged arson, looting and vandalism gripped Minneapolis as protesters vented rage over the death of an unarmed black man after a white police officer knelt on his neck as he lay on the ground following arrest.
The latest unrest in Minnesota's largest city went largely unchecked late Thursday, with the mayor ordering a tactical police retreat from a police station that was set ablaze. 
National Guard troops called out earlier in the day by the governor kept a low profile. Governor Tim Walz had ordered the Guard to help keep the peace after two previous nights of disturbances sparked by George Floyd's death on Monday.
In a late-night Twitter message, President Donald Trump said he would send in National Guard troops to ""get the job done right"" if the ""weak"" mayor failed to restore order, suggesting lethal force might be needed.
""Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts,"" Trump wrote.
The arrest of Floyd, 46, was captured by an onlooker's cell phone video that went viral and showed a police officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck as he moaned: ""Please, I can't breathe."" 
Four police officers involved in the arrest of Floyd, who was accused of trying to pass counterfeit money at a corner store, were dismissed on Tuesday, but unrest has continued unabated.
Sympathy protests erupted on Wednesday in Los Angeles and Thursday in Denver, with freeway traffic blocked in both cities. In Phoenix, protesters faced off with police in riot gear at City Hall, and a rally was held at the Arizona state Capitol.
Thursday night's disturbances in Minneapolis also spread into adjacent city of St. Paul, the state capital, with fires and vandalism breaking out there.
In contrast with Wednesday night, when rock-throwing demonstrators clashed with police in riot gear, law enforcement in Minneapolis kept mostly out of sight around the epicenter of Thursday's disturbances, the Third Precinct police station.
Protesters massing outside the building briefly retreated under volleys of police tear gas and rubber bullets fired at them from the roof, only to regroup and eventually attack the building, setting fire to the structure as police withdrew. 
National Guard troops were absent, as were members of the fire department. Protesters were later observed on the roof, and a crowd of hundreds lingered around the building for hours, feeding flames with hunks of plywood and other debris.
STRONG AS HELL""
At a news briefing early Friday, Mayor Jacob Frey defended his decision to evacuate the precinct station due to ""imminent threats to both officers and the public.""
Asked by reporters if he had a response to Trump's tweet, Frey said: ""Weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your own finger at a time of crisis.""
""Donald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell,"" he said.
The Minnesota National Guard said it activated 500 of its soldiers in the greater Minneapolis area, mostly to provide security support to firefighters.
The mayor said many of the troops had been posted around the city to help police prevent looting of banks, grocery stores, pharmacies and other essential locations during the coronavirus pandemic.
Several other buildings and a car were set ablaze and looters plundered several businesses, including a burning liquor store and nearby discount store that had been ransacked the night before. Fire officials said 16 buildings were torched on Wednesday night.
The upheaval followed concerted efforts by law enforcement officials to ease tensions by promising justice for Floyd.
The Floyd case was reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City who died after being put in a banned police chokehold as he, too, was heard to mutter, ""I can't breathe."" 
Garner's dying words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that formed amid a wave of killings of African-Americans by police. 
At a peaceful daytime rally and march on Thursday around a county government center in Minneapolis, protesters pressed their demands for the four policemen to be arrested and charged.
""We're not asking for a favor. We're asking for what is right,"" civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said as he addressed the crowd. 
Police Chief Medaria Arradondo publicly apologized to Floyd's family on Thursday morning, conceding his department had contributed to a ""deficit of hope"" in Minneapolis. 
Officials overseeing investigations from the U.S. Justice Department, FBI, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and prosecutors appealed for calm, vowing a thorough investigation.
Floyd was a Houston native who had worked as a nightclub security guard. An employee who called police described the suspect as appearing to be drunk, according to an official transcript of the call.

Neither the police nor the prosecutor's office could comment further but said more information about the case would come out later.
The SDA said Novalic had been held for questioning since late on Thursday alongside fellow member Fahrudin Solak, the official in charge of procuring equipment to combat COVID-19. 
Local media reported Fikret Hodzic, the manager of the fruit processing firm which procured the ventilators, was also questioned as part of a criminal probe into the procurement. 
All three men have denied any wrongdoing and the SDA questioned the credibility of the investigation into suspected corruption and fraud.
""From the very beginning, by selectively publishing the collected documentation and evidence, the Prosecutor's Office has shown that their only intention is to discredit the prime minister and involve him in the affair at any cost,"" it said. 
The case arose after the coronavirus pandemic prompted the Federation government to relax public procurement statutes to allow purchases of medical equipment through direct bargaining with suppliers rather than via public tender.
The raspberry processing firm, Srebrena Malina, which had no licence to import medical equipment was recruited by the Federation civil protection authority (FUZC) to procure 100 ventilators from China for 10.5 million Bosnian marka ($5.92 million).
It received a permit for the transaction only days after 80 out of the 100 ventilators arrived, spurring allegations of irregularities and prompting the state prosecutor to open the investigation.
Prosecutors are investigating how and why Srebrena Malina was chosen to do the deal when several other firms with experience in procuring medical equipment had said they could obtain effective machines at a lower cost.
Their initial report showed the ventilators did ""not meet even a minimum of necessary characteristics for adequate treatment"" of COVID-19 patients and that it was not advisable to use them in intensive-care units.
Solak was suspended as the head of FUCZ earlier in May.

Turkey had suspended prayers, limited travel and closed shops and restaurants. However, the government has started to ease the measures amid a slowdown in infections and deaths.
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday intercity travel restrictions will be lifted and cafes, restaurants, gyms, museums, and beaches will reopen on June 1.
Prayers, suspended on March 16, resumed on Friday under new guidelines aimed at minimizing the risk of infection, and only at certain mosques and outdoor public spaces, the religious affairs directorate (Diyanet) said.
Initially, only Friday, noon and afternoon prayers will be permitted and worshippers must wear face masks during prayers, Diyanet said last week. Everyone must bring their own prayer mats or are provided with single-use mats at the mosques.
Limits were set on the number of worshippers and the ground will be marked to ensure social distancing, it said.
Erdogan said Koranic verses would be recited at the Hagia Sophia on Friday to commemorate the conquest of Istanbul in 1453, in a rare occurrence at the UNESCO World Heritage site.
Hagia Sophia was the main cathedral in Christendom for 900 years before becoming one of Islam's greatest mosques for 500 years until 1935, when it was converted to a museum. Last year, Erdogan said he planned to change its status back to a mosque.

CLUJ, Romania/BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Soon after a two-month lockdown to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus eased in Romania in mid-May, Grigore Lup, a Romanian shoemaker from the Transylvanian city of Cluj, noticed people were not respecting the rules of social distancing.
So Lup came up with the idea of long-nosed leather shoes to help keep people apart. They come in a European size 75.
""You can see it on the street, people are not respecting social distancing rules,"" said Lup, who has been making leather shoes for 39 years.
""I went to the market to buy seedlings for my garden. There weren't many people there but they kept getting closer and closer.
""If two people wearing these shoes were facing each other, there would be almost one-and-a-half metres between them.""
While he also sells ready-made shoes, Lup's shop, which he opened in 2001, relies heavily on custom orders from theatres and opera houses across the country, as well as traditional folk dance ensembles.
His business ground to a virtual standstill as live events were cancelled or postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but he was cautiously optimistic that sales would recover over time.
The European Union state, which has reported 18,791 cases of the coronavirus and 1,240 deaths, began gradually easing its lockdown on May 15.
Lup, who said he adapted the long footwear from a model he made for actors, said he had so far received five orders for social distancing shoes.
It takes him two days to make a pair, which requires almost one square metre of leather. They cost 500 lei ($115) a pair.

Now 55, Lup first started making shoes when he was 16, learning from a cobbler who at 93 today still makes traditional ethnic Hungarian footwear.

TUNIS/ANKARA/CAIRO (Reuters) - As Turkish drones helped drive eastern Libyan forces back from Tripoli this month, Russia was said to be reinforcing them with warplanes, raising the stakes in a stalemated civil war that has partitioned the country. 
Recent weeks have marked a turning point in a complex conflict between two uneasy coalitions that are each backed by an array of foreign states whose competing regional agendas make them unwilling to countenance defeat.
Eastern commander Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) now face the likely failure of their year-long effort to capture Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). 
Backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt with arms, mercenaries and air strikes, according to U.N. experts, Haftar had last summer advanced into Tripoli's southern suburbs before his offensive stalled. 
However, aid from Turkey helped turn the tide with air defences and drone strikes that neutralised LNA air power before hammering its ground troops and long supply lines this month. 
""In the last few weeks, there has been a significant change in balance in Libya,"" said a senior Turkish official, crediting Turkish drones and ""untrained soldiers"" operating LNA air defences. 
It led, over the past month, to the LNA's sudden loss of a string of towns near the Tunisian border, a crucial air base, a dozen of its own air defence systems and most of its foothold in Tripoli. With them went Haftar's hopes of victory.
Over the same period, Russian military personnel have delivered some 14 MiG 29 and Su-24 fighter jets to the LNA's Jufra air base in central Libya, the U.S. military said this week. They are aircraft that could again turn the tide of war. 
A Russian member of parliament and the LNA have denied the aircraft arrived. 
Libya is once more on the brink after years of chaos that followed the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, leading to rival administrations in Tripoli, in the west, and Benghazi in the east. 
With more arms and fighters flowing to local proxies, Libyans fear an unending conflict in which outside powers keep fuelling warfare to protect their interests, while suffering little pain themselves. 
One Western diplomat working on Libya warned of a ""stagnating conflict in which escalation is met with escalation, increasingly violent and with no resolution or way out"".
France, which has also been broadly supportive of Haftar, warned this week that the situation in Libya risked replicating Syria's descent into an endless war driven by outside forces. 
Russian and Turkish officials spoke last week and issued a statement agreeing on the need for a ceasefire, a possible sign they have hashed out a backroom deal to avert a direct confrontation after the arrival of the Russian jets. 
""They put the gun on the table to signal to Turkey that there are limits to where its forces can advance towards the east,"" said a second Western diplomat working on Libya. 
FIGHTER JETS
The jets at Jufra could now act as a deterrent to a new offensive by the GNA once it has consolidated its gains in the west said Wolfram Lacher of the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. 
""It appears the purpose of these fighter jets and the redeployment to central and southern Libya now is to stabilise and freeze the military situation,"" he said.
With Haftar's offensive collapsing, and with it his wider project of uniting Libya by force and replacing the GNA, his role as the lynchpin of the eastern bloc is also in question. 
""So much of Haftar's campaign and his narrative over many years has been built on success and momentum,"" said one of the diplomats. 
In late April as his war stuttered, Haftar suddenly declared that his military would seize power nationally, a move that would sideline the civilian administration in east Libya that had recognised him as head of the army there.
But he did not follow through by forming a new government - apparently because he could not mobilise enough support among his own coalition in the east or from foreign backers. 
In Cairo, where the priority is stability in eastern Libya, diplomats said there was some impatience with his war in the west. However, ""Haftar is still popular in the east,"" said a former senior official. 
""I don't think his power structure is going to collapse overnight in the east,"" Lacher said. 
However, the repercussions of his failure to take Tripoli will be felt, Lacher added. ""All of this makes a combustible mix that could produce challenges to Haftar's authority eventually.""

It was the latest in a series of exchanges underscoring the friction between the two countries after denuclearization talks launched by U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stalled late last year.
""We want to make it clear that our country has nothing to do with the so-called 'cyber threat' that the U.S. is talking about,"" North Korea's Foreign Ministry said in the statement.
It said Washington was trying to use the allegations as leverage, along with the issues of nuclear missiles and human rights as well as accusations of terrorism funding and money laundering. The aim was to ""smear our country's image and create a way to shake us up"", it said.
The U.S. State Department, Treasury, and Department of Homeland Security Issues, along with the FBI, issued a new warning last month about the threat of North Korean hackers, calling particular attention to financial services.
North Korea is alleged to be behind an ambitious, years-long campaign of digital theft, including siphoning cash from ATMs, stealing from major banks, extorting computer users worldwide, and hijacking digital currency exchanges.
Since 2006, the country has been subject to U.N. sanctions that have been strengthened by the Security Council over the years in a bid to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
This week, the U.S. Justice Department accused the country's state-owned bank of evading U.S. sanctions laws and said it had charged 28 North Korean and five Chinese citizens in its latest crackdown on alleged sanctions violations.

All 27 victims were from the Mermaid, a small tourist boat which sank in just half a minute after it was hit by a much larger cruise liner under a bridge in Budapest in torrential rain on May 29, 2019. 
Panorama Deck, the shipping company that owned the Mermaid, held a small ceremony on the river near the site of the accident, lowering a wreath and flowers into the river and blasting a ship horn in memory of those who died.
""May 29th will always be a day of mourning for Hungarian shipping, said Mihaly Toth, spokesperson for Panomara Deck. Behind him a black flag flew fluttered at half mast.
Budapest Mayor Gergely Karacsony was joined by Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto and South Korean Ambassador Kyoo Sik Choe for the ceremony on the embankment.
""For those families who had a piece broken off their hearts ... it perhaps feels as if this all happened just yesterday,"" Karacsony said. ""We share their pain."" 
The foreign minister and South Korean ambassador also gave speeches, before the three officials bowed their heads to observe a minute's silence. 
Near the Margaret Bridge, where the accident occurred, mourners left flowers and candles at a makeshift memorial. A sign said: ""We love you Korea.""
""No such accident had occurred in 75 years until in 2019. Everyone was shocked that such a dramatic event could happen in what is a well regulated form of transport,"" Toth said.
The trial of the captain of the cruise liner, the Viking Sigyn owned by Swiss-based Viking Cruises, began in Budapest in March. 
Prosecutors have charged Yuri Chaplinsky, a Ukrainian national, with one count of gross negligence leading to an accident with mass casualties. They also charged him with failing to provide assistance to those aboard the Mermaid.

He denies any wrongdoing.

The court however set Zitto Kabwe, the head of ACT Wazalendo party, free on condition that he refrain from saying or writing anything that would be considered sedition.
Kabwe, who is member of parliament for Kigoma urban constituency, in western Tanzania, was charged in November 2018 with three counts related to incitement after saying that 100 people were killed in clashes between herders and police in the region. 
He pleaded not guilty to the charges.
At the time, the head of police in Kigoma said just two herdsmen and two officers had died during an operation to stop pastoralists keeping livestock illegally on a government-owned ranch. 
Huruma Shaidi, principal magistrate of Kisutu Resident Magistrate's court in Dar es Salaam, said he found Kabwe guilty on all three counts.
In a written order setting out conditions for Kabwe's discharge, Shaidi said Kabwe should commit no seditious offence for a period of one year, and if he did, he would be liable to be sentenced for the offence.
Kabwe's defence lawyers said they were going to appeal the verdict. 
""Zitto Kabwe is a politician and we are in the elections period, we are going to appeal this ruling to clear him,"" Jebra Kambole, Kabwe's lead counsel, told reporters outside the court.
Kabwe split away from the main opposition CHADEMA movement in 2015 and is now his party's only lawmaker.
The East African country has been one of the continent's most stable, but opposition leaders and rights groups have accused the government of cracking down on dissent - an accusation it dismisses.

Tanzania is expected to hold presidential, parliamentary and local government elections in October.

The decision comes after Bulgaria's highest appeals court dismissed a request by the former chief prosecutor to review the parole granted to Jock Palfreeman in September.
Palfreeman's parole angered nationalist politicians who have decried his release from prison, while the government's decision to keep him in a detention centre after his release and prevent him from leaving the country strained relations with Australia. 
Palfreeman served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for murder and attempted murder in the 2007 stabbing of two Bulgarians, one of whom died, during a street melee in Sofia, before being granted parole by a court panel. 
He was serving in the British army at the time of the offence and has said he acted in self-defence and was trying to protect minority Roma being attacked by the two Bulgarians.
After being released, Palfreeman was transferred to a detention centre for foreigners staying illegally in the country. In October, the government released him from the centre after an unprecedented call to do so from the top court, but said he could not leave the country due to an old ban. 
""The interior minister has ordered to the head of the migration directorate to start coordinating procedures for the lifting of the travel ban on Palfreeman,"" the ministry spokeswoman said.
She declined to say how long these procedures might take.
Earlier on Friday, 33-year-old Palfreeman said in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that he had not yet been allowed to leave the country.

""Please do not believe the false news, I have not been allowed to leave the country as the decision to not allow me to travel is not based on law, but the decision of the government,"" he wrote.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A craze for homebrewing has swept across South Africa since the government banned the sale of alcohol to help hospitals and keep order during the coronavirus lockdown - good news for Frank van Wensveen, who owns a home beer brewing supply shop.
South Africa, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption per capita in the world, imposed a lockdown on March 27 and banned alcohol in a bid to ease hospital workloads, help the public stick to social distancing rules and prevent a rise in domestic violence. 
South Africans have improvised, brewing their own beer and umqombothi, a traditional African beer made from sorghum, as well as distilling mampoer, a potent Afrikaner fruit-based moonshine. 
""The market has absolutely gone crazy,"" said van Wensveen, standing in his Johannesburg store before empty shelves. ""When the liquor ban was initially announced, people were coming to the shop in a panic and essentially buying everything in sight.""
Since the government reopened e-commerce earlier this month, online orders have ballooned, with sales up 15-fold from pre-pandemic levels, he said. 
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) searches on homemade beer recipes have spiked in South Africa, according to Google trend data, and a run on pineapples for beerbrewing forced supermarket giant Shoprite to limit their sale to five per customer. 
Predictably, illegal liquor sales and smuggling of the contraband across South Africa's land borders has also been on the rise. 
Yet the ban on alcohol sales appears to have had the desired effect. Before lockdown, hospitals in South Africa took in around an estimated 17,100 alcohol-related trauma admissions per week, compared to 10,300 per week since lockdown began, said Charles Parry, director for alcohol, tobacco and drug research at the South African Medical Research Council.
Parry expects the numbers to rise again once lockdown restrictions are eased from June 1 and alcohol sales will once again be permitted, although under tight restrictions and only for home consumption.
While the temporary prohibition has caused a rise in spawned a booming business in workarounds, it has come at the expense of traditional purveyors of booze. 
Bars and liquor stores are suffering, as are the largely informal and sometimes improvised neighbourhood taverns - known locally as shebeens - scattered throughout South Africa's working-class townships.
""The people I am worried about are the shebeens, the Mama Ruby's corner, the Uncle Jack's liquor store,"" said Collin Kambi, a resident east of Johannesburg, who misses his local dive. ""They are going to get poorer and poorer.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine taxi dispatcher Meliza Venal heaved a sigh of relief when she learned that hundreds of her company's drivers can finally go back to work after being stuck in their homes for 11 weeks.
But she's worried about venturing out when some transport services resume in the capital Manila from Monday, and feels the threat of the new coronavirus still lingers.
The Philippines saw its highest daily spike in coronavirus cases on Thursday, but that didn't stop President Rodrigo Duterte from easing one of the world's toughest and longest lockdowns.
""I'm still nervous because the virus is still out there but glad that the taxi drivers and I can go back to work,"" she said.
Those drivers will now be separated from passengers by a plastic barrier and sanitizers and disinfectants will also be provided to them, she said.
Though taxis, trains, buses and ride hailing services are allowed to reopen, the country's iconic jeepneys - the crowded and colourful budget passenger trucks - must remain off the road.
Their drivers are dismayed.
""It is difficult and painful not knowing when we can go back to work,"" said Jude Recio, a Manila jeepney driver.
""Trying to take care of ourselves is difficult enough and we still have our children to feed."" 
A typical jeepney crams in 10 to 16 commuters sitting knee-to-knee on twin benches, making it difficult to enforce social distancing measures. 
Under the relaxed rules in place for the next two weeks, workplaces and shops will reopen and movement in and out of Manila will be permitted, provided that people wear masks and observe social distancing.

The easing could help restore much-needed activity in an economy facing its deepest contraction in 34 years as the pandemic-induced lockdown shuttered businesses and sapped domestic demand.

And after a 10-week closure due to the coronavirus outbreak, the hotel hopes to attract guests when it reopens on Friday by building on its tradition of discretion.
""The idea of going out but not being seen by anyone has accompanied the Sacher hotel from the very beginning,"" said Managing Director Matthias Winkler. 
In the past, politicians and celebrities including John F. Kennedy, Sophia Loren and Justin Bieber have appreciated the offer. This time, Winkler hopes to lure locals and guests coming by car or train from Austria and neighbouring countries to help bring up revenue to 10% of pre-crisis levels.
Up to four guests plus two children can rent one of the hotel's 152 suites or rooms for up to three hours and have breakfast, lunch or dinner served by a private butler. Prices are from 45 euros ($50) per person for breakfast and from 75 euros per person for lunch and dinner. 
Referring to experiences after the 2001 attacks in New York and the financial crisis, Winkler assumes that it will take three to four and a half years before revenues reach pre-crisis levels. Usually more than 90% of the hotel's guests come from abroad.
All of the Sacher Group's around 800 staff are under a short-time work regime introduced by the government to save jobs. They will deliver Sacher-Torte, their signature cake, to people's homes and sell a newly created ice cream soon to boost sales. 

But Winkler said an extension of the jobs scheme, in place until mid-September, well into next year would be needed to avoid layoffs.

1471,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Black voters don't trust mail ballots. That's a problem for Democrats,"By John Whitesides
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sharon Fason used to accompany her mother to their south Chicago polling place every Election Day as a little girl, watching as she joined their African-American neighbors in the hard-won right of casting a ballot.
Now 47, Fason says she always votes in person, a ritual she has no intention of changing even if the deadly coronavirus still rages in November.
""I will put on protective gear and I will still walk in and cast my ballot,"" said Fason, a black public librarian in Chicago. 
The Democratic Party is pushing mail-in voting as the safest way to cast ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the party is struggling to persuade a bedrock constituency: African Americans.
Their votes will be crucial if Democrat Joe Biden hopes to unseat Republican President Donald Trump on Nov. 3. In 2016, turnout among black voters declined for the first time in 20 years, aiding Trump's surprise win over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
During the most recent national elections, the 2018 congressional midterms, only about 11% of black voters cast their ballots by mail, according to Census figures. That's the lowest percentage of any measured ethnic group, and it's just under half the rate of white voters.
There are a variety of reasons. For African Americans such as Fason, striding to the polls is a powerful act, both symbolic and substantive. Some black voters fear their mail ballots might get lost or rejected. African Americans are more transient than other racial groups and have high rates of homelessness, government statistics show, major barriers to mail voting.
That could pose a problem for Democrats if in-person voting is severely restricted in November and many polling stations closed because of coronavirus worries. That was the case in recent primary elections in Wisconsin and Ohio, crucial battleground states where turnout was down by double-digit percentages from 2016.
In Georgia, a once solidly Republican state that polls show could be competitive in November, early requests for mail ballots in the state's June 9 elections show voters of color have been slow to embrace the process.
As of May 19, 25% of white registered voters in Georgia had requested mail ballots in Georgia, compared to 17% of black voters and 11% of Latino voters, according to a study by the Brennan Center for Justice.
Georgia's Republican Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger sent all of the state's 6.9 million active voters an application for an absentee ballot, a move that was widely applauded in a state where more than 1,900 people have died of COVID-19.
But Raffensperger also formed a task force to investigate absentee ballots with irregularities such as mismatched signatures, a move he said was needed to combat fraud. Many Georgia Democrats criticized that as an intimidation tactic that could lead to more challenges of mail ballots and a suppression of Democratic votes.
Trump and his Republican allies say mail voting is prone to fraud and favors Democrats, even as numerous independent studies have found little evidence of either claim.
Democrats ""are using a pandemic to completely destroy the integrity of our elections,"" Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said. 
Some Democrats fear such efforts to discredit mail balloting, coupled with a possible reduction of in-person polling places if a second wave of coronavirus hits this fall, could depress African-American turnout and doom Biden's chances. 
""It's unfortunate the Republican Party would rather play games with people's health and people's votes just so they can try to come out on top in an election,"" said Nikema Williams (NYSE:WMB), the first black woman to chair the Georgia Democratic Party.
DIFFICULT CHOICE
The new coronavirus has killed and infected African-Americans at disproportionately high rates, in part because they are more likely to work in frontline service jobs than whites, and tend to have more chronic health problems. As of May 19, the mortality rate for black Americans was 2.4 times the rate for whites, according to the American Public Media (APM) Research Lab. 
That could force a difficult choice on many African-American voters in November: Risk in-person voting or pivot to a mail system that many do not trust.
Tumultuous April 7 elections in Wisconsin offered a potential preview. The state shifted to a nearly all-mail format and drastically reduced the number of polling places open on Election Day amid concerns about coronavirus.
Milwaukee, home to more than two-thirds of the state's African-American residents, had only five polling places operating, down from the usual 180 locations. People were forced to wait in long lines for hours, many wearing masks.
Robin Reese, an African American voter from Milwaukee, requested her first-ever absentee ballot after she contracted COVID-19. She immediately hit a hurdle: Wisconsin requires a witness to sign the envelope to verify the voter's identity and Reese didn't want to risk infecting anyone.
Her health eventually improved enough that she could use Milwaukee's drive-up voting service, where a worker took her absentee ballot and served as a witness.
""I feel if I don't put the ballot in the machine myself, who knows what happens to it?"" said Reese, the manager of a Milwaukee business improvement district.
Such fears are not unfounded. 
A report released in April by researchers at the University of Florida and Dartmouth College found that mailed ballots cast in 2018 by blacks, Hispanics and other racial minorities were twice as likely to be rejected in Florida as those cast by white voters, often for missing or mismatched signatures. Florida, with 29 electoral votes, is one of the biggest prizes in the November general election, where early polls show a tight matchup between Trump and Biden.
Democrat Stacey Abrams, who fell just short in her 2018 Georgia bid to become the first black woman elected governor in the United States, supports the push to make it easier for all voters to obtain mail ballots. Still, she said a variety of options are needed to prevent disenfranchisement in black communities, such as an expanded period for early voting and drive-through voting.
""There will be legitimate fears about using absentee ballots,"" said Abrams, who has been considered a possible vice presidential pick for Biden. ""We have to use every tool in the toolbox."" 
'NO REASON TO TRUST GOVERNMENT'
Even in states such as Pennsylvania, which last year made absentee voting easier for all of the state's voters, African Americans appear to lag whites in signing up.
Ahead of Pennsylvania's June 2 primary, Philadelphia County - the state's largest with a population that is about 44% black - received 206,961 requests for mail ballots, according to state data as of May 26. That's nearly 25% fewer requests than in the state's second-most-populous area around Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, where just 13% of residents are black.
The Democratic National Committee and black voter mobilization groups have launched broad educational programs to encourage mail balloting and help African Americans navigate the requirements. The DNC has teamed up with state parties in Florida, Pennsylvania and Georgia to text millions of supporters.
Other efforts could include transforming African-American communities' traditional ""Souls to the Polls"" early voting programs. Black churches long have bused parishioners to polling places after services during election season. Alternatives could include socially-distanced marches to early voting sites or online church programs to help parishioners fill out their ballots.
    ""We have to do a ton of education ensuring that black voters feel their vote will be counted,"" said Quentin James, founder of Collective PAC, a group working for the election of black officials.
James, an African American who lives in Ohio, voted by mail in that state's April 28 primary. Still, he submitted his ballot via a drop box at the elections office instead of mailing it. 

""We just don't trust the government, and I don't think government has given us a reason to trust them,"" James said.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian security forces in the Oromiya region have executed 39 opposition supporters and arrested thousands of others accused of being members of an armed group, Amnesty International said on Friday.
The rights group said in a report that victims were accused of being supporters of the Oromo Liberation Army, the breakaway armed wing of the Oromo Liberation Front, which the government had previously declared a terrorist movement but which has been unbanned by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed.
""Security forces have continued to violate human rights despite reforms introduced by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, and this is due to widespread impunity and lack of accountability for those violations,” Amnesty International's Ethiopia researcher Fisseha Tekle said. 
The Ethiopian army, the prime minister's office and the Oromiya and the Amhara police did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Daniel Bekele, the head of Ethiopia's human rights commission, told Reuters that Amnesty's findings ""should be taken very seriously"".
Abiy has brought in reforms that included removing a ban on political parties, releasing political prisoners and welcoming home exiled militant groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front. 
But the new freedoms have also meant long-repressed tensions have surged between the country’s many ethnic groups. 
Since December 2018 the Ethiopian army has been deployed in Western and Southern Oromiya to combat an insurgency by the Oromo Liberation Army.
""The report is further proof that the new administration has not parted ways with the practice of forcefully stifling dissent, committing egregious human rights violations and carrying out extrajudicial killings,"" the Oromo Liberation Front and the Oromo Federalist Congress, an opposition party, said in a joint statement, calling on the government to investigate the findings. 

Based on interviews with 80 victims or direct witnesses of violence, Amnesty's report said the Ethiopian army and regional security forces in Amhara and Oromiya were involved in inter- ethnic killings, mass arbitrary detentions and rape.

1473,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 06:05AM ET</span>",Taiwan decriminalises adultery in landmark ruling,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's constitutional court on Friday decriminalised adultery in a landmark judgment aimed at upholding personal rights and privacy, scrapping a law that activists said discriminated against women.
The democratic island became the latest place in Asia to strike down a ban on marital infidelity following South Korea in 2015 and India in 2018.
The constitutional court struck down the adultery law that meant those who had sex with a married person, or with a person outside marriage, could face up to a year in jail. 
""The adultery law offers limited help to maintaining marriage relationships ... State power interfering in people's marriages actually has a negative impact on marriage,"" Lin Hui-Huang, secretary-general of the Justice Ministry, said as he read out the judgment. 
The adultery law was a violation of a person's sexual autonomy as well as a ""serious invasion of privacy"", he said.
Despite its reputation as a beacon of freedom and human rights in Asia, conservative groups have long argued that the law was essential to uphold the sanctity of marriage.
But questions have been growing for some time about a law that rights activists have criticised as an outdated infringement, with more than 20 petitions brought to courts by people and judges demanding interpretation of it.
While jailings are rare for adultery in Taiwan, activists say women have been disproportionately targeted under the law as the threat of charges has often been used in matrimonial disputes to put pressure on women.
Right activists welcomed the ruling a ""new milestone"" for Taiwan's reforms following the landmark legalisation of same-sex marriage last year. 
The legalisation was the first in Asia and came after President Tsai Ing-wen had campaigned on a promise of marriage equality in a 2016 presidential election.
Adultery is still considered a crime in various places including some U.S. states.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not spoken with U.S. President Donald Trump about the south Asian nation's military standoff with China, a government source said on Friday, after Trump suggested Modi was upset about border tension. 
The neighbours' troops have been facing off along the disputed border in the western Himalayas since early May, after Chinese troops intruded into Indian territory, Indian military officials say.
""They have a big conflict going with India and China. Two countries with 1.4 billion people. Two countries with very powerful militaries,"" Trump told reporters, according to a White House transcript. 
""And India is not happy, and probably China is not happy. But I can tell you, I did speak to Prime Minister Modi. He's not - he's not in a good mood about what's going on with China,"" Trump added.
The comments followed a Twitter post the previous day in which Trump said the United States had told India and China that it was ready to arbitrate their ""raging border dispute"", the first time he has thrown himself into India-China diplomacy.
But Indian officials expressed surprise at Trump's latest remarks. 
""There has been no recent contact between PM Modi and President Trump,"" a government source said. ""The last conversation between them was on April 4, on the subject of hydroxychloroquine.""
The source spoke on condition of anonymity, citing diplomatic sensitivities.
On Trump's offer to mediate between the two nuclear-armed nations, the source said, the ""Indian foreign ministry had also made it clear that we are directly in touch with the Chinese through established mechanisms and diplomatic contacts.""
On Friday, China's foreign ministry said there was no need for a third party to mediate. Both countries lay claim to thousands of kilometres of territory in each other's possession along a vast stretch of the Himalayas.
They went to war in 1962 and have not been able to settle the border since, prompting occasional flare-ups between border troops.
Military observers say one likely reason for the renewed border tension in the Ladakh sector is India's effort to build new airstrips and roads near the de-facto border to try to narrow the gap with China's superior infrastructure. 

During talks to resolve the crisis, the Chinese side have demanded that India stop all construction activity in the area, saying the whole area is disputed, one of the sources said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union foreign ministers sought to toughen their strategy on China on Friday to counter Beijing's increasingly assertive diplomacy and accelerate efforts to end unfettered access for Chinese business in Europe.
Amid European criticism of Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, EU foreign ministers met via videolink for their first discussion before two possible EU-China summits this year, one expected at the end of June and another in September.
The EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell called this week for a ""more robust"" China strategy and told the U.N. Security Council of his ""deep concern"" about China's new security law for Hong Kong, calling on Beijing to reconsider.
Borrell is due to hold a news conference at 1100 GMT.
The EU is trying to find a middle path between U.S.-Chinese rivalry, but the bloc is also divided internally over China, with some countries benefiting from its largesse.
Three senior diplomats said there was increasing frustration with what the EU says is Beijing's failure to make good on an April 2019 agreement that China reciprocate the broad market access that Chinese companies enjoy in Europe.
Next month, the European Commission, the EU executive, is expected to come forward with guidelines on ways for EU governments to potentially limit China's access to public tenders in Europe, seen as a way to pressure Beijing.
The EU is frustrated by what Europe says is a lack of progress in negotiations with Beijing, albeit partly hampered by COVID-19 lockdowns that limit diplomacy.
This week, German ambassadors told their counterparts at two separate meetings that host Germany could delay the summit between European Union leaders and China's President Xi Jinping in September because of the impasse.

However, another EU diplomat said Berlin is working on hosting a summit in the town of Leipzig on Sept. 14. A German government spokesman declined to comment.

1477,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 04:45AM ET</span>",Irish PM says good chance social distancing rule can be relaxed,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar raised the prospect on Friday of halving social distancing rules from two metres to one if the rate of coronavirus infections comes down further in a potential boost to still shuttered restaurants and pubs.
Facing one of the longest shutdowns in Europe, Ireland's hospitality sector has called for the guidelines to be eased in line with a number of other European countries, saying it could be the difference between some operators reopening or not.
""Before we can relax that rule and maybe reduce it to 1 (metre), which I know a lot of people would like, we just need to see the virus come down a bit more. We're not at that point yet but I think there's a good chance we get there, just not quite yet,"" Varadkar told Ireland's FM104 radio station.
The daily number of new COVID-19 cases has stayed below 100 for 13 of the last 14 days and the so-called ""reproduction rate"" narrowed further to 0.4 to 0.5 this week, a trend the country's top epidemiologist described as ""astonishingly stable.""
Ireland partially eased stay-at-home restrictions last week, the first of a five-stage plan that currently only sees restaurants opening in late June, hotels in July and finally pubs in August, far later than many European countries.
Restaurants in Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal and Germany have reopened with looser 1 to 1.5 metre guidelines. Operators in the Czech Republic, Iceland and Switzerland that have had to stick to 2 metres have had the benefit of being open since May to try to salvage some of the busy summer season.
Varadkar said on Wednesday that he hoped to be in a position to speed up the reopening plan next week.

""I certainly want to accelerate it. It's really the numbers next week that tell us whether we're still going in the right direction,"" he added on Friday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The former leader of an advocacy group for South Korean victims of Japanese wartime sexual violence on Friday denied allegations of misusing funds meant for the victims but apologised for ""banking errors"". 
Yoon Mee-hyang is under prosecution investigation over allegations she had used government subsidies for her own benefit, not to help the ""comfort women"" - a euphemism for those forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels. 
She recently stepped down as longtime leader of the group, the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, better known as Jungdaehyup, to contest a national election and won a seat in parliament. 
Lee Yong-soo, a prominent victim and activist, this month accused Yoon of exploiting the women to garner government funds and public donations while spending little money on them.
After weeks of silence, Yoon held a news conference and denied the accusations and calls for her resignation, saying she did not embezzle the money.
The investigation includes allegations she embezzled funds to buy apartments and support her daughter's U.S. college education, and incurred losses by buying and selling a property meant to shelter victims.
Yoon apologised for taking donations via nine of her personal banking accounts, though none of them have been spent for personal purposes, she said. 
""I used my accounts because the money was raised for special occasions, not for all victims, but it was a wrong decision,"" she told the conference. ""I had wired it to Jungdaehyup accounts but there were some errors. But I did not spend it personally."" 
The group is also being investigated and has said it ""never loosely used money"" but apologised for ""accounting flaws"" for which it has requested an independent audit. [L4N2CU2EL]
The feud threatens to undermine the wartime sexual violence movement, led for decades by Yoon, Lee and Jungdaehyup, which together played a key role in effectively nullifying a controversial 2015 settlement with Japan.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>May 29, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>","Attack on Taiwan an option to stop independence, top China general says","By Yew Lun Tian
BEIJING (Reuters) - China will attack Taiwan if there is no other way of stopping it from becoming independent, one of the country's most senior generals said on Friday, a rhetorical escalation from China aimed at the democratic island Beijing claims as its own.
Speaking at Beijing's Great Hall of the People on the 15th anniversary of the Anti-Secession Law, Li Zuocheng, chief of the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Staff Department and member of the Central Military Commission, left the door open to using force.
The 2005 law gives the country the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or seems about to, making the narrow Taiwan Strait a potential military flashpoint. 
""If the possibility for peaceful reunification is lost, the people's armed forces will, with the whole nation, including the people of Taiwan, take all necessary steps to resolutely smash any separatist plots or actions,"" Li said.
""We do not promise to abandon the use of force, and reserve the option to take all necessary measures, to stabilise and control the situation in the Taiwan Strait,"" he added.
Although China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, it is rare for a top, serving military officer to so explicitly make the threat in a public setting. The comments are especially striking amid international opprobrium against China for new national security legislation for Chinese-run Hong Kong.
Li is one of China's few senior officers with combat experience, having taken part in China's ill-fated invasion of Vietnam in 1979.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue. Beijing says it is a Chinese province, and has denounced the Trump administration's support for the island.
Li Zhanshu, the third-most-senior leader of China's ruling Communist Party and head of China's parliament, told the same event that non-peaceful means were an option of last resort.
""As long as there is a slightest chance of a peaceful resolution, we will put in hundred times the effort,"" Li said. 
However, he added: ""We warn Taiwan's pro-independence and separatist forces sternly, the path of Taiwan independence leads to a dead end; any challenge to this law will be severely punished"".
Taiwan has shown no interest in being run by autocratic China. It has denounced China's repeated military drills near the island and rejected China's offer of a ""one country, two systems"" model of a high degree of autonomy.
China is deeply suspicious of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist bent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai and her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party won presidential and parliamentary elections by a landslide in January, vowing to stand up to Beijing.
The mood in Taiwan toward China has further soured since China's parliament passed new national security legislation for Chinese-ruled Hong Kong on Thursday.
There was no immediate reaction from Taiwan's government to the comments out of Beijing.

But a senior Taiwan official familiar with the island's security planning told Reuters Beijing was seizing the occasion of the law's anniversary to ""intimidate Taiwan"" and ""challenge the status quo in the Taiwan Strait"" as Beijing draws heat for its Hong Kong plans.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court ruled on Friday that the country's archives must release letters between Britain's Queen Elizabeth and her local representative during the 1970s, a move which may shed light on the sacking of its then prime minister Gough Whitlam. 
The firing of Gough Whitlam by Governor-General John Kerr in 1975 remains one of Australia's most polarising political events because it represented an unprecedented level of intervention by the Commonwealth.
Historians say the country still has not been told the full story behind Whitlam's removal during a political deadlock over the Budget, and in 2016 a historian sued the National Archives of Australia for access to letters between Kerr and the queen at the time. The lawsuit failed on grounds that the letters were private.
On Friday the High Court overturned the Federal Court ruling and said the historian, Jenny Hocking, should get access to the so-called ""palace letters"" since they were the property of the governor-general's office, which was a Commonwealth institution.
""It's a wonderful decision for transparency, for accountability of government,"" Hocking told reporters in Melbourne.
""It's a story that has been absolutely clouded in secrecy, in distortion and in so much unknown. With this decision one of those last remaining areas of secrecy and great unknown will be released to the Australian public.""
Kerr died in 1991 without disclosing the extent of his coordination with the queen. Australia federated in 1901 but the British monarch remains the country's official head of state, although the relationship is usually ceremonial.
Many government documents from the Whitlam era have been made public in recent years because of a rule which requires commonwealth documents to be released after 31 years. The ""palace letters"" were kept secret since they were deemed private.
Whitlam died in 2014 but his sacking prompted one of the country's most often quoted political barbs.
""Well may we say 'God save the Queen' because nothing will save the Governor-General,"" he said on the day of his removal, walking out of Parliament House.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Minnesota's governor activated the National Guard on Thursday to help police restore order following two days of violent protests in Minneapolis city over the death of a black man seen in graphic video footage gasping for breath as a white officer knelt on his neck. 
Governor Tim Walz ordered Guard troops to assist police as local, state and federal law enforcement officials sought to ease racial tensions sparked by Monday night's fatal arrest of George Floyd, 46, by vowing to achieve justice in the case.
Four city police officers involved in the incident, including the one shown pressing his knee into Floyd's neck as he lay on the ground, moaning, ""please, I can't breathe,"" were fired from their jobs the next day.
The Floyd case was reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City who died after being put in a banned police chokehold as he, too, was heard to mutter, ""I can't breathe."" 
His dying words became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement that formed amid a wave of killings of African-Americans by police.
Protesters thronged Minneapolis streets for a third day on Thursday chanting ""I can't breathe,"" as they rallied peacefully at the Hennepin County Government Center and marched through downtown, demanding the four officers be swiftly arrested.
""There is probable cause right now"" to make those arrests, civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton said as he addressed the crowd. ""We're not asking for a favor. We're asking for what is right.""
Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said Floyd's case had renewed the trauma she suffered six years ago. ""This is just opening up an old wound, and pouring salt into it,"" she said.
Separately, hundreds of demonstrators milled around a police station and  Target  (NYSE:TGT) discount store that were the center of running clashes Wednesday night between rock-throwing protesters and riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets.
A car in the Target parking lot was set ablaze, and looters periodically ducked inside the vacant Target store to make off with whatever was left inside.
Both gatherings began with little police presence and no immediate sign of National Guard troops.
At a morning news briefing, Police Chief Medaria Arradondo apologized to Floyd's family, conceding his department had contributed to a ""deficit of hope"" in Minnesota's largest city.
'GIVE US TIME TO DO THIS RIGHT'
Hours later, officials overseeing investigations from the U.S. Justice Department, FBI, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and local prosecutors appealed for calm at a joint news conference, as they gathered evidence.
""Give us the time to do this right, and we will bring you justice,"" County Attorney Mike Freeman told reporters. He acknowledged the policeman's conduct depicted in the video was ""horrible,"" but said, ""My job is to prove that he has violated a criminal statute.""
Minnesota's U.S. attorney, Erica McDonald, pledged a ""robust and meticulous investigation into the circumstances surrounding"" Floyd's arrest and death. 
The federal investigation, which Attorney General William Barr had designated a ""top priority,"" will focus on whether the arresting officers used the ""color of law"" to deprive Floyd of his civil rights, a crime under U.S. law, she said.
Floyd, a Houston native known affectionately to friends as ""Big Floyd"" and who had worked as a nightclub security staffer, was reportedly suspected of trying to pass counterfeit money when police took him into custody. 
Wednesday's disturbances, punctuated by looting, vandalism and arson, began hours after Mayor Jacob Frey urged local prosecutors to file criminal charges in the case.
Most protesters had been peaceful, while a smaller, core contingent engaged in unruly behavior, the police chief said.
Sympathy protests erupted on Wednesday in Los Angeles and Thursday in Denver, with hundreds of demonstrators blocking freeway traffic in both cities.
In a sign the Floyd case had garnered international attention, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet urged U.S. authorities on Thursday to deal with ""entrenched and pervasive racial discrimination"" in America's criminal justice system.
The city named the four officers involved in the encounter as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. Local news media have identified Chauvin as the officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck.
Chauvin's attorney, Tom Kelly, declined comment in an email to Reuters.

Police department records posted online show 18 internal affairs complaints filed against Chauvin, 16 of which were closed without discipline.

(Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has prompted the United Nations to delay until late 2021 a crucial climate summit that had been scheduled for Britain this year, officials said on Thursday.
This year's meeting, known as the COP26 summit, had been billed as the most important climate change summit since the 2015 talks that produced the Paris Agreement. Hundreds of world leaders had been expected to respond to public pressure for stronger global climate action by delivering pledges to slash greenhouse gas emissions more rapidly.
The summit will be rescheduled to Nov. 1 to 12, 2021, the UN's climate body decided, dates proposed by the British government. Glasgow, Scotland will remain the host city, and there will first be a warm-up summit in Italy.
British climate official Alok Sharma said the delay would give countries more time to rebuild economies with climate change prioritized. Negotiators from bloc of less developed countries also urged governments not to use the pandemic to delay stronger climate plans, but instead to boost renewable energy, conservation and other green measures as economies recover.
European Union leaders proposed such a plan on Wednesday to tie a 750 billion euro recovery fund to climate goals.
""The postponement of the COP should not affect the resolve of countries to deliver on these commitments in 2020,” said Sonam Wangdi of Bhutan, a member of the LDC bloc.
This year's COP26 summit was supposed to serve as a deadline for governments to commit to the more-aggressive emissions-cutting goals needed to deliver the Paris Agreement's target to cap global temperature increases at 2 degrees Celsius and aim for 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times.

Current pledges put the world on track for roughly 3 degrees Celsius of warming this century. Scientists say that level would have severe consequences for sea-level rise, extreme weather events and mass migration as people flee regions where the local climate becomes uninhabitable.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's Constitutional Court ruled late on Thursday that a new government can be formed without holding a snap election, a decision opposed by the caretaker prime minister's party, which has vowed street protests.
Albin Kurti's government was dismissed on March 25 after less than two months in office, following disagreements with its main partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and removal of tariffs on Serbian goods.
""The biggest political party does not have the exclusivity to propose the candidate of the prime minister to form the government,"" the court said in its verdict.
Kurti backed a snap election after seeing that other parties rallied together with his former coalition partner the LDK to form a new government. His party said it will organise protests in coming days.
The task to form the government is now given to LDK nominee Avdullah Hoti, former deputy prime minister and a past finance minister.
Hoti has promised he will return to negotiations with Serbia to normalise ties under EU and United States mediation. Such talks were halted in 2018 when a previous government introduced a 100% tariffs on goods produced in Serbia.
The move has angered the European Union and the United States, which backed Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008 after wars tore apart the former Yugoslavia.
Kurti has said the change of the government is fuelled by President Hashim Thaci, who Kurti said agreed to a land swap with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, under a plan for Serbia to recognise Kosovo, which would help Belgrade join the European Union. Thaci has denied the accusations.
“We ask all leaders to work together for an orderly transition in the interest of peace, stability, and prosperity for all the people of Kosovo,” the US embassy in Pristina said in a statement.

Trump in March canceled the Group of Seven leaders meeting scheduled for June 10 in the United States as the coronavirus outbreak was spreading around the world and international travel was curtailed.
Last week, Trump said he may seek to revive the idea of a face-to-face meeting because he said it would send a message that the world is getting back to normal. He proposed holding the conference at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland.
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Sunday that if there were to be an in-person meeting, it would be at the end of June.
Macron is open to traveling to the United States for a G7 meeting if the coronavirus epidemic situation allows, an Elysee official said last week.

The G7 is made up of the United States, Italy, Japan, Canada, France, Germany and Britain, as well as the European Union.

Firefighters backed up by police were able to contain the blaze and stop it spreading beyond New Bell jail, which sits in a densely populated neighbourhood of the commercial capital, close to the central market.
""The operation was made more difficult by the layout and the large number of inmates,"" fire brigade chief Kadrey Abdiel said.
Human rights groups say Cameroon's prisons suffer from chronic overcrowding, poor sanitation conditions and disease, and cases of violence and torture are frequent. New Bell was built in the 1930s for 800 inmates, but held around 2,500 as of 2011, according to Amnesty International.
Three severely burned prisoners were evacuated, while two firefighters were injured, Abdiel said.
Crowds of onlookers had gathered outside the prison, where a large plume of dark smoke billowed from the roof.
A few inmates had tried to climb over the prison's walls, but police around the perimeter stopped them escaping, regional Governor Samuel Ivaha Diboua told journalists. 

It was not immediately clear what started the fire.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday outlined the first steps for reopening the United States' most populous city, envisioning up to 400,000 people heading back to their workplaces, an easing of the lockdown that began in March.
De Blasio said he expected the reopening's first phase to be announced by the second week of June and, in line with the state's plan, would include four sectors: construction, manufacturing, wholesale suppliers and non-essential retail.
""We're now actually in a position to start talking about opening things up, step by step, phase by phase,"" he said at a daily briefing.
The city's famed restaurants and bars will remain closed, except for takeout and delivery, but the City Council unveiled legislation to allow outdoor dining to help the industry recover from the economic crisis spurred by the coronavirus pandemic.
Outdoor spaces might be the only lifeline for many small restaurants that have struggled to stay afloat, said Sean Pearson (NYSE:PSO), beverage manager at popular Mexican eatery La Esquina's Soho location.
""It might be one of the only ways that they can recoup the revenue that's been lost throughout this whole thing,"" Pearson said in a phone interview. ""I think as long as tables are at an appropriate distance and crowds are managed and maintained and ... the level of cleanliness is upheld, I think it's totally fine.""
COVID-19 has killed more than 20,000 of New York's over 8 million people, making the city the American epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.
With hospitalizations and deaths trending lower across New York state, all regions except the city - which is still working to increase hospital bed capacity and meet other criteria - have begun the process of restarting their economies.
The mayor added that authorities would monitor business compliance with reopening guidelines by conducting random visits, and handing out summonses in egregious cases. 
At a separate briefing, City Council members unveiled legislation to allow restaurants and bars to set up chairs and tables on approved stretches of sidewalks, streets and parking lots while social distancing rules remained in force. 
Council Speaker Corey Johnson criticized de Blasio for moving more slowly than other cities in repurposing outdoor spaces, and said the legislation was partly intended to force the mayor's hand.
""New York will not be New York if we do not have restaurants and bars and an enlivened streetscape,"" he told a news conference via Zoom. ""If Cincinnati can do this, no offense to Cincinnati, New York City can do it.""
De Blasio said outdoor dining would be considered but that it would not be included in the first of the four phases in the state's plan, which slates restaurants to reopen in the third phase. 
Before the Memorial Day weekend, the mayor had said the sheriff's office would patrol nine ""bar-heavy"" parts of the city after some bars, restaurants and their patrons appeared to be flouting guidelines, which include people keeping six feet apart.
Restaurants generally struggled to make much of a profit even when they could fill every seat inside, Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, a trade group supporting the City Council legislation, said in an interview.
The law would require the city to identify open spaces that can be used for outdoor dining, and New York City's Health Department to create social distancing and cleaning protocols.

""We have to remember that New York City is the hospitality capital of the world,"" Melba Wilson, the owner of Melba's Restaurant in Manhattan's famed Harlem neighborhood, said at the news conference on the legislation. ""We cannot be followers on this front; we have to be leaders.""

CARACAS/LONDON (Reuters) - An English court on Thursday said it would need to decide which of Venezuela's dueling political factions to recognize before ruling on President Nicolas Maduro's request for the Bank of England to hand over gold the country has in its vaults.
Venezuela for decades stored gold that makes up part of its central bank reserves in the vaults of foreign financial institutions including the Bank of England, which provides gold custodian services to developing countries. The bank since 2018 has refused to transfer the funds to Maduro's government, which Britain does not recognize. 
Earlier this month, Venezuela's central bank made a legal claim to try to force the bank to release 930 million euros ($1.03 billion) in gold to fund Venezuela's coronavirus response. The government says it has a deal with the UN Development Programme to administer the funds.
But according to statements from both parties, the court said it would begin hearings no earlier than June 22 to determine which party could represent Venezuela in the case: Maduro or Juan Guaido, the leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly.
Dozens of countries, including Great Britain, recognize Guaido as Venezuela's interim president, arguing Maduro rigged his 2018 re-election. Guaido has appointed a parallel central bank board of directors.
Maduro, who retains the support of Venezuela's armed forces and allies Russia and China, calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup.
Lawyers at Zaiwalla & Co, which represent the central bank of Maduro's government in the case, called the result ""a fair and good outcome."" 
Guaido's chief overseas legal representative confirmed the contents of the ruling and said ""the Maduro regime's true aim is to use central bank resources outside of parliamentary controls."" 
The Bank of England declined to comment.

MEXICALI, Mexico (Reuters) - Every night, hundreds of farm workers in Mexico crowd for hours in a cramped tunnel to a border station to reach day jobs in Imperial Valley, California, with no social distancing enforced despite coronavirus cases saturating hospitals in the region.
By 2 a.m. on Tuesday, tense men and women with cloth face masks and bandanas jostled for position in a line hundreds deep through the underpass leading from the city of Mexicali to the U.S. port of entry. Vendors sold tamales. A mariachi player lightened the mood. But the only hand-washing station was broken.
The daily back and forth flow to work in the United States and sleep back in Mexico, essential to both the $2 billion Imperial Valley fruit and vegetable harvests and to thousands of families in Mexico, is a testament to the deeply entwined economies on either side of the border. 
But the lack of safety measures and the late night crowds stand in contrast to a curfew imposed in Mexicali this week to try to stem the city's fast rising contagion, as well as to six-feet (1.83 meter) distancing measures in the border station itself. 
While no infections have been definitively linked to the Calexico West crossing, both the documented day laborers and U.S. border agents worry the lack of social distancing on the Mexican side and the slow processing at the port of entry put them at risk.Jose Salazar, who earns $500 to $600 harvesting melon in California six days a week, said U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) should add agents to cut the time spent in the line. 
""'La migra' has not taken care to put on more officers, and that makes the pandemic grow,"" he said, using slang for border agents. 
The stifling underground tunnel, smelling of sweat and the occasional cigarette and lined with pharmacies advertising Viagra, passes underneath the border fence to a flight of crowded stairs ending at the Calexico West port of entry gate. 
Eight farmworkers told Reuters they wait two to three hours each night to cross and worry they are more exposed to the virus before the port of entry than in the fields.Fearful of spending so much time in line, some nights Salazar stays with his son in El Centro, California, rather than head home, he said.
On the U.S. side of the port of entry, CBP agents impose social distancing rules. But some officers said the measures were undermined by the conditions in the tunnel.
""It's kind of pointless for us to be six feet apart if they (the border crossers) are all crowded up first,"" said one CBP agent, waiting for a test at a Calexico clinic after relatives contracted coronavirus and his son developed a fever. 
The officer, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, told Reuters he was worried about on-the-job exposure.Mexico's National Immigration Institute did not immediately respond to questions about lack of distancing enforcement and other sanitary measures in the tunnel.

A spokeswoman said CBP was ""taking every available precaution to minimize the risk of exposure to our workforce and to members of the public."" In California, 84 CBP employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the agency said. It did not give data specifically for Calexico. Employers have asked for Calexico's second port of entry to open at night to avoid bottlenecks.""We have continued to request that CBP increase the hours of its Calexico East Port of Entry as well so that our agricultural employees can utilize that border crossing,"" said Brea Mohamed, executive director of the Imperial County Farm Bureau.

ISLAMABAD/PARIS (Reuters) - The captain of a Pakistani airliner that crashed last week, killing 97 people on board, approached Karachi airport without announcing he couldn't open his landing gear and hit the runway three times, a government minister said on Thursday.
Search teams recovered the cockpit voice recorder from the wreckage of the Pakistan International Airlines Airbus A320 that crashed into a residential neighbourhood of Karachi last Friday, a spokesman for the airline said. Two people on board survived. 
Flight PK8303, from the eastern city of Lahore, came down less than a mile short of the runway as it was making a second attempt to land.
The flight data recorder has already been found. 
Minister for Civil Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan told reporters the plane's engines touched the ground three times on the first attempt at landing.
""The pilot never announced his landing gear wasn't opening. He haphazardly touched the engines thrice with the ground,"" Khan said.
""All marks are present (on the runway). He was not at the proper height... Control tower informed him you aren't at the required height, lower your altitude,"" he said, adding that the pilot replied: ""I will manage.""
According to communications posted on liveatc.net, an aviation radio monitoring website, the pilot told controllers ""we're comfortable now"" during the approach, but the reason for the remark has left most experts puzzled.
Shortly after the engines scraped along the runway in the aborted first landing attempt, the pilot reported problems in maintaining altitude, then said both engines had failed.
Investigators are expected to examine whether the engines shut down because of their collision with the runway, following what appeared to be a steeper and faster approach than normal.
The lower part of the engine housing contains key components including an accessory gearbox and hydraulic pumps.
""All sorts of things can happen to an engine if you bounce it down the runway,"" a person familiar with its design said.
The engines were made by CFM International, a French-American venture co-owned by  Safran  (PA:SAF) and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), and are among the most widely used in the industry with a strong overall record of reliability.
The recorders will be read in France by the BEA air accident agency, which is part of the Pakistan-led probe.

Safety experts caution it is too early to say what caused the crash and stress most accidents result from a cocktail of factors.

(Reuters) - People are hitting the beach as coronavirus restrictions start to ease and summer begins in the northern hemisphere, but access might be limited and public health officials still urge caution, including continued physical distancing.
While rules vary across the world, here is what you would find at Los Angeles County beaches like Santa Monica and Malibu:
* Check local restrictions before heading to a beach.
* No lounging around on the sand. Use of the beach is limited to activities such as swimming, surfing, and biking.
* Vendors are not allowed, so bring everything you need.
* Both in and out of the water, stay at least six feet (1.8 meters) from others who are not members of your household.
* No gatherings - including athletic competitions or youth camps.
* Wear a face covering while out of the water if there are other people nearby.
THE BEACH IS GENERALLY LOW RISK...
Spending time outdoors is a low-risk activity in the era of the coronavirus. It has many benefits - as long as you keep your distance.
""People have been cooped up for several weeks now,"" said Dr. Timothy Brewer, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""Going to visit beaches or mountains are relatively lower-risk activities compared to being around people in an enclosed indoor space like a store or a theater.""
Brewer said there is very little risk of the virus being transmitted through ocean water.
""The advantage of being outside is that if someone does have COVID-19 and they are releasing respiratory droplets, the droplets will be rapidly dispersed.""
...BUT DITCH THE BARBECUE
The real change, experts advise, is to plan a beach outing around specific activities for a limited period of time during the day, rather than settling in for hours of food, socializing, or naps by the shore. In some place, picnicking and sunbathing may be prohibited. Orange County, California has banned the building of sandcastles.
""The important thing to remember is that the COVID-19 pandemic has not gone away,"" said Brewer. 
Even where more leisurely activities are permitted, avoid large gatherings or crowded areas of the beachfront, they say.
""If it is a nuclear family having a picnic that is perfectly fine, but don't have a birthday bash,"" said Dr. Neha Nanda, medical director of infection prevention with Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.N. agencies trying to help the millions at risk from the conflict in Yemen are nearly broke, U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock said on Thursday, announcing a drive to raise some $2.4 billion next week to pay for the world biggest aid operation.
Around 80% of Yemen's population - 24 million people - need aid. The country has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted Yemen's government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition intervened in 2015 in a bid to restore the government.
The United Nations and Saudi Arabia are hosting a virtual pledging conference for Yemen on Tuesday. 
""There's no way to describe this situation other than alarming,"" Lowcock said. ""Is the world ready simply to watch Yemen fall off the cliff?""
""There are tens of millions of people whose lives are now at risk unless we get, not just pledges, but the money,"" he said. 
Lowcock said the United Nations received $3.2 billion last year for Yemen, but so far in 2020 it has only received $474 million. Saudi Arabia pledged $525 million nearly two months ago and Lowcock said he hoped Riyadh would pay soon. 
""Most of the U.N. agencies are just a few weeks away from being broke. We've never had so little money for the Yemen aid operation ... this late in the year,"" he said. ""Last year it was well-funded essentially because the countries of the region stepped up and we're hoping that's going to happen this time.""

Lowcock said that of the $2.4 billion needed to fund the aid operation for the rest of the year, $180 million was to combat the outbreak of the coronavirus in Yemen, which the United Nations said was spreading rapidly.

Burundi's election commission said on Monday the ruling party candidate, retired General Evariste Ndayishimiye, had won the presidential election with 69% of votes cast. 
It said Rwasa had garnered 24% of the vote.
The commission's Chairman Pierre Claver Kazihise said the turnout had been huge and the election was peaceful.
""Appalling errors were made across the country, no district or province was spared. We have provided evidence that there has been a massive fraud,"" Rwasa told reporters after filing his complaint.
""The announced results are false.""
He said the court had eight days to decide the case.
The May 20 vote to replace President Pierre Nkurunziza, however, had been preceded by political violence including the arrest, torture and murder of opposition activists, according to a local rights group. 
There was also controversy over holding the election during the coronavirus crisis. 
Hundreds of Burundians were killed and hundreds of thousands exiled after unrest surrounding the last election in 2015, when the opposition accused Nkurunziza of violating a peace deal by running for a third term.
Rwasa said the evidence in his filing showed that people had voted using dead voters' identities and use of an electoral register which has never been published by the electoral body and ballot box stuffing. 
The Conference of Bishops of Burundi on Tuesday also criticised the election conduct, saying some parties' observers had been chased from polling stations.
The electoral body's officials were not immediately reachable to comment on Rwasa's complaints.

Five other candidates also stood in the polls, in which 5.11 million registered voters were eligible to participate.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain will open gradually to tourism this summer, starting with European countries, and will ensure visitors only go to areas that have the coronavirus under control, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya said.
Spain usually welcomes more than 80 million visitors each year, making it one of the most visited countries in the world, with tourism a key part of its economy.
But it has been hard hit by the coronavirus crisis and wants to be cautious as it opens to visitors from July 1, Gonzalez Laya told Reuters.
""In this very atypical year of 2020, we will not be able to behave as usual,"" she said.
""It's health. It's making sure that we do not import cases as we are trying to control the cases we have in the country. It's very prudent management on our side to make sure we put COVID under control.""
Much remains to be decided as to who will be able to travel where and on what criteria, with talks going on first with European countries on when a territory can be deemed safe, Gonzalez Laya said.
""We need to define what is safe. Is it to have 50 infections? Is it four? It's very important that this definition be made at European level, because this is ultimately the guarantee of non-discrimination,"" she said, calling for common rules on issues such as testing visitors.
Spain is considering opening its own territory gradually to foreign tourism as regions exit lockdown, Gonzalez Laya said.
""We have to consider territories ... that have finished (the lockdown) and reached what we call the new normality,"" she said. ""Only then, we can imagine that these territories will be open for freedom of movement for foreigners.""
Asked if this meant hardest hit areas like Barcelona or Madrid could be opened up to foreign visitors after other parts of Spain, she said: ""That's what the European Commission has said, consider the possibility that you could do a gradual opening in an asymmetric manner.""
Gonzalez Laya declined to say when the rules would be announced. But with the summer season fast approaching, she said she hoped it would be soon ""so citizens can prepare"".

""We will do the opening in a gradual manner, for us that means starting, obviously, with the European Union ... and even within this area we want to be sure we open to countries or territories that are safe from an epidemiological point of view.""

1502,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 01:25PM ET</span>","Exclusive: As Trump ramps up attacks, Republicans less confident than Democrats in voting by mail, poll finds","By John Whitesides and Grant Smith
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans are much more skeptical than Democrats their ballots will count if cast by mail and less confident they will be able to vote in November's election if their state switches to all-mail voting, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Thursday.
In a sign of the deep partisan divisions around voting by mail sparked by Republican President Donald Trump's relentless criticism of the practice, the poll found nearly twice as many Democrats as Republicans support efforts to expand mail balloting options.
A national push for more use of voting by mail, which Democrats back as a safe way to cast a ballot as long as infection from the highly contagious coronavirus remains a problem, has set off a fierce political battle with Trump, who has repeatedly slammed the method as prone to fraud.
Numerous studies have found little evidence of that, and Trump himself has not offered any. Trump voted by mail in Florida's primary in March.
The poll found half of Republicans, compared to three-quarters of Democrats, were confident their mail-in vote would be accurately counted. And 67% of Republicans thought they would be able to cast a ballot in the Nov. 3 election if their state switched to voting by mail, compared to 85% of Democrats.
Overall, 59% of Americans believe their state should expand mail-in voting, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted from May 20 to 27. By party, that broke down to 43% of Republicans and 83% of Democrats.
Only 25% of Republicans polled said voting by mail would result in more fair voting, compared to 66% of Democrats.
A number of states have moved to expand their use of absentee mail ballots to protect voters from the coronavirus outbreak, including states with Republican election officials such as Georgia, Iowa and Nevada.
Past studies by election researchers have shown neither party has an advantage in states with a history of mail balloting and where officials automatically mail ballot applications to all registered voters.
Voting-rights advocates have denounced Republican efforts to limit mail-in voting as particularly unfair to minorities and low-income Americans, who tend to vote Democratic and also have been hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak.
Experts say Trump may have created problems for his own party by sowing doubts among its own members about casting absentee ballots if coronavirus is still raging in November, and that depresses in-person turnout.
Those without a college degree were less likely to believe they would be able to get a mail-in ballot cast and counted. About half of those without a college degree believed their mail-in vote would be accurately counted, compared to two-thirds of those with college degrees.

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,429 American adults, including 3,732 who identified as registered voters. The poll had a credibility interval - a measure of precision - of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

THE TESTS
Johnson said five tests had been met for there to be an easing of lockdown in England.
The tests are:
1. Protect the NHS’s ability to cope. 
2. Sustained fall in the daily death rates from COVID-19.
3. A fall in the rate of infection.
4. Testing capacity and PPE supplies able to meet demand.
5. Confidence that any adjustments to the current measures don't risk a second peak of infections that overwhelms the NHS.
Johnson said all the tests had been met, but that the easing of lockdown measures was conditional on scientific advice. Measures could be re-imposed in response to local outbreaks.
SCHOOLS
On Monday, primary schools will reopen reception, year one and year six, with nurseries and other early-years settings also restarting.
On 15 June, secondary schools will begin to provide some face-to-face contact time for years 10 and 12.
SHOPS
On Monday, outdoor retailers and car showrooms can reopen.
On 15 June, Johnson said the intention was to reopen other non-essential retail, if the shops were compatible with social distancing and the five tests were being met. 
SOCIAL MEET-UPS 
From Monday, groups of up to six people can meet outside. Those from different households must stay two metres apart from each other, in line with social distancing rules.
People will also be allowed to meet in gardens and other private outdoor spaces.
Johnson said that, to best control the virus, people should avoid seeing people from too many households in quick succession.
He also reiterated that people should not be inside the homes of their friends and families, unless it is to access the garden.
SHIELDING
Johnson said it was too early for the most vulnerable, who have been asked to ""shield"" themselves to avoid infection, to be allowed greater social interactions.

He said they were looking at how to make the lives of the clinically vulnerable easier and was hoping to have more to say soon.

Iran is providing up to 1.53 million barrels of gasoline and refining components to help Venezuela ease an acute shortage, the result of the near-complete breakdown in its refining network and U.S. sanctions on its oil industry. Washington has criticized the arrangement, as both OPEC nations are sanctioned. 
The Eikon data showed that the Faxon, the fourth in the five-tanker Iranian flotilla, was passing north of eastern Venezuela's Sucre state as of 11:49 p.m. local time (0349 GMT) Wednesday night. It has not transmitted its location since then. 
The Faxon had followed a similar path as the first three tankers, which began arriving last weekend. The Fortune was docked at a port at the El Palito refinery in central Venezuela, and the Petunia was anchored nearby. The Forest was docked at a port at the western Cardon refinery. 
The tankers' unimpeded arrival in Venezuelan waters came despite warnings by U.S. officials that Washington was considering a response to the fuel shipment, prompting a complaint from Iran to the United Nations. A fifth tanker, the Clavel, was still crossing the Atlantic Ocean toward the Caribbean. 
Venezuela's socialist government has celebrated the arrival as a sign of solidarity from a fellow U.S. ideological foe. But officials have also pledged to reform the gasoline distribution system, with President Nicolas Maduro stating citizens would have to start paying for fuel after decades of heavy subsidies.

Doctors and nurses wearing face masks, clanging bells and banging pans gathered in front of the Robert Debre Hospital, in the north of the city, some carrying banners reading: ""no medals, no tear gas but beds and money!"" 
The rally was taking place as the government is working on a new support plan for healthcare workers who have been at the forefront of the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
Health workers have long complained about low salaries and insufficient staffing at French hospitals, leading to a wave of strikes over the past year to demand funding increases.
The coronavirus pandemic has further exposed the problems faced by the sector with medical facilities in one of the world's richest countries left short of staff, masks and ventilators at the start of the crisis.
""The difficulties of public hospitals started quite long ago,"" said intensive care pediatrician Stephane Dauger. 
""Everybody said that all went fine for the COVID (crisis) and that we have been extraordinary, which is a fact, since we've done more than we could have imagined ... but the difficulties have persisted,"" he said.
The coronavirus outbreak has killed more than 28,000 people in France, though the number of daily deaths has fallen sharply since the peak of the outbreak.
The government has announced that all staff working in public hospitals and nursing homes in the regions hardest hit by the virus will get a 1,500-euro bonus from the state.

On Monday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe promised healthcare workers further, significant pay hikes as part of the planned reform of the public health system.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is in talks with China to deal with the most serious military standoff on their disputed border in recent years, the Foreign Ministry said on Thursday, sidestepping U.S. President Donald Trump's offer to mediate.
Soldiers have been facing off in the remote Ladakh region in the Himalayas since early May, accusing each other of trespassing and in recent days they have dug in defences and brought equipment. 
Trump said in a Twitter post the United States had told India and China that it was ready to arbitrate their ""raging border dispute"", the first time he has tried to throw himself into India-China diplomacy.
""We are engaged with the Chinese side to peacefully resolve this issue,"" Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava told reporters, responding to Trump's offer. China has not yet made an official comment.
The dispute is the most serious since India and China, who fought a brief border in 1962, were locked in a similar faceoff in the eastern Himalayas that lasted nearly three months in 2017.
Srivastava said India wanted peace and stability at the border but would defend its territory. 
Despite talks spread over two decades, the two countries have not been able to settle their 3,500-km border and lay claim to large tracts of remote territory in each other's possession.
""Our troops have taken a responsible approach towards border management and are following protocols,"" Srivastava said.
Military observers say one likely reason for the renewed border tensions is India's effort to build new air strips and roads near the de-facto border to try to narrow the gap with China's superior infrastructure.
Despite ongoing talks between the local military commanders and diplomats, there is no sign of a de-escalation, Indian sources aware of the situation said. 
New Delhi says Chinese troops have intruded into Indian territory and must withdraw to defuse the crisis. The Chinese side wants India to stop all construction activity in the area, saying the whole area is disputed, one of the sources said.

Business travel from other countries and visits for medical reasons and funerals will be also allowed.
""We shall continue to monitor the epidemiological situation and gradually start re-opening the borders for other countries as well,"" Tegeltija told a news conference after the government session, adding the borders' re-opening was without limitations.
Of the three neighbours, only Serbia has opened its borders with Bosnia so far. Croatia allows entry to Bosnians under certain conditions, while Montenegro has kept its entry ban in force. 
Bosnia had recorded 2,462 cases and 153 deaths of the COVID-19 lung disease as of Thursday.
The national government in March imposed a state of disaster over the novel coronavirus, locking down the country after its two regions, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, introduced emergency situations. 
Last week, the Serb Republic lifted a state of emergency, returning legislative powers to parliament from the region's president. [L8N2D23LK]
The two regions have re-opened most businesses, shops and kindergartens in an effort to ease the impact of the disease on their fragile economies. 
The International Monetary Fund has estimated that Bosnia's economy would shrink by around 5% this year because of the pandemic.

Ladislas Ntaganzwa, head of the commune of Nyakizu in southern Rwanda, was indicted in 1996 by the Arusha, Tanzania-based International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda on charges of direct and public incitement to commit genocide, murder and rape.
The tribunal closed five years ago and was replaced by a successor body, International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, with offices in Arusha and the Hague, Netherlands.
About 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus were killed during the genocide.
The tribunal's indictment accused Ntaganzwa of plotting to exterminate Rwanda's Tutsi population and personally ordering the massacre of more than 200,000 Tutsi civilians in one parish in April 1994. It passed the case to a Rwandan government court.
“Ladislas Ntaganzwa was today sentenced to life imprisonment over genocide crimes committed during the genocide against Tutsi in 1994,” the court spokesman, Harrison Mutabazi, said.
Alexis Musonera, Ntaganzwa’s lawyer, said he planned to appeal the ruling.
“We plan to appeal because evidence in the hearing was based on witnesses' testimony but that was not enough as some witnesses were contradicting themselves. We are not happy about this lengthy life jail term,” Musonera told Reuters.
The judgement was announced by video conference while Musonera used Skype to follow it with Ntaganzwa at Mpanga prison in the southern province. 
Ntaganzwa was arrested in December 2015 in Democratic Republic of Congo. Rwanda took him into custody in March 2016.
The United States had offered up to $5 million for information leading to his arrest.
Félicien Kabuga, the top-most fugitive from the genocide, was arrested in France last week.

The International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals said it concluded that former defence minister Augustin Bizimana, another key suspect, had died.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. and European trade groups are lobbying China to allow foreign workers back into the country after it shut its borders in late March to non-Chinese nationals to curb the coronavirus.
Having managed to all but halt domestic transmission of the virus, China now sees cases imported from abroad as the biggest threat.
Currently, it has only relaxed rules to allow some business travel from South Korea and Germany. It has also consulted with Japan about easing border controls.
A charter flight from Frankfurt, the first organised by the German Chamber of Commerce in China, is scheduled to land in Tianjin on Saturday carrying around 200 German company employees who obtained visas via a ""fast-track"" programme.
A second charter flight to Shanghai on June 3 is also planned and there are likely to be more given that 2,000-2,500 employees are waiting to enter China, said Jens Hildebrandt, the chamber's North China executive director.
But staff of many nationalities employed by firms in China are still waiting for permission to return.
China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement to Reuters that China was willing to explore ways to steadily resume the exchanges of Chinese and foreign professionals, provided that the easing measures would not jeopardise controlling the pandemic.
The China-Britain Business Council said China was communicating with the British embassy to implement a ""fast-track"" entry arrangement for UK nationals on essential and urgent visits.
The European Union Chamber of Commerce has provided Beijing with a list of foreigners seeking return to China, according to Jacob Gunter, the chamber's senior policy and communications manager for China.
""Although the process has been challenging ... the European Chamber believes things are heading in the right direction,"" he said.

KIEV (Reuters) - Business is thriving for a company manufacturing portable houses in Ukraine as people cooped up in tower blocks under lockdown yearn to live closer to nature.
Unitfab, which launched in November, makes a basic house for $55,000 in three months. At around 70 square metres, it is bigger and cheaper than the average apartment, although land, fittings and optional extra floors would add to the price.
For couples such as Volodymyr Sherstiuk and Yulia Paramonova, a prefab means cleaner air and fewer people.
""We were fed up with the apartment style of living,"" Paramonova told Reuters. ""We want to walk on grass, we want to sit next to the trees. And in general, I think the modern world is moving towards this .. way of living.""
Ukraine began imposing lockdown measures in March, banning or restricting travel, shutting many businesses, and asking people to stay indoors whenever possible. For a period, people were only allowed to go out alone or in pairs.
Unitfab's chief executive Volodymyr Melnychuk said the company had stopped advertising at the start of the lockdown but people called anyway, saying they were fed up of their apartments and wanted to move into a house.
""The lockdown proved how inconvenient it is to live in small boxes,"" he told Reuters, adding that the company has orders until July and plans to expand into foreign markets next year.
Melnychuk's own prefab home and garden are tucked among concrete apartment buildings in a Kiev residential area and he said similar patches of land were available elsewhere.
While still under lockdown, he gave potential customers virtual tours. He said one client, based in the Caribbean, bought a house for her mother in Kiev as a result.

Jock Palfreeman, who served 11 years of a 20-year sentence for murder and attempted murder in the 2007 stabbing of two Bulgarians, one of whom died, during a street melee in Sofia, was granted parole by a panel of three judges in September.
The parole meant he could be released on condition of good behaviour.
Then Chief Prosecutor Sotir Tsatsarov, now head of the anti-corruption commission, made an application to the Supreme Court of Cassation to have Palfreeman's parole revoked, arguing that two of the judges had a conflict of interest.
""The request for reopening of the case is inadmissible and should be dismissed and the proceedings terminated,"" the court said in a statement.
Palfreeman, 33, who was serving in the British army at the time of the offence, has said he acted in self-defence and was trying to protect minority Roma being attacked by the two Bulgarians.
""Today, the Supreme Court of Cassation ruled that the chief prosecutor's request to cancel my early release on parole is unfounded and invalid,"" Palfreeman said on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page in Bulgarian.
""I now call on Tsatsarov to resign as head of the anti-corruption commission for abuse of office.""
After being released from prison, Palfreeman was transferred to a detention centre for foreigners staying illegally in the country.

In October, the government released him from the centre and he is now free to leave the country.

Central Mali has been ravaged in recent years by ethnic reprisal killings, as recriminations between herding and farming communities over jihadist violence compound longstanding grievances.
Local officials told Reuters they believed the three attacks, between Tuesday night and Wednesday evening, were carried out by jihadists, who often say they are defending Fulani herders against rival Dogon farmers.
""We were surprised by the attack on the village of Tillé. Seven were killed, all Dogons, some of them burned alive,"" said Yacouba Kassogué, the deputy mayor of Doucombo, the municipality in which Tillé is located.
Attacks on villages in the neighbouring areas of Bankass and Koro killed another 20 civilians, most of them shot or burned to death, local officials there said.
A spokesman for Mali's army was not immediately available for comment. The army has been criticised by rights groups and residents for failing to protect civilians in central Mali.
Fulani civilians have also been frequent victims of violence by vigilante militias who accuse them of supporting jihadists. More than 150 were killed in a single village by suspected Dogon vigilantes in March last year.
Mali has been in chaos since 2012, when al Qaeda-linked jihadists seized the northern two-thirds of the country. French forces intervened the following year to drive them back, but the militants have since regrouped and expanded their operations into neighbouring countries such as Burkina Faso and Niger.
The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), a consultancy that tracks political violence, says it recorded nearly 300 civilian fatalities in Mali in the first three months of 2020, a 90% increase over the previous quarter.

EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan told EU lawmakers that the negotiations had not made much progress to date.
""Perhaps the United Kingdom has come to the conclusion that there's not going to be a deal. I hope not because we want a deal, but speed is of the essence because time is short,"" he told the trade committee of the European Parliament, before the next round of negotiations next week.
Britain told the EU on Wednesday it needed to break a fundamental impasse to clinch a Brexit trade deal by the end of the year and said an agreement on fisheries might not be ready by July.
""We hope that we will see a bigger effort than we've seen to date from the United Kingdom side to move on certain issues, because we stand ready to move on ours, to move forward some of the solutions that are required on many issues of concern to both sides,"" he said.

The stockpile would be funded from a new health budget worth 9.4 billion euros ($10.3 billion) which the EU executive commission proposed on Wednesday.
The reserve would complement a 380-million-euro emergency stockpile created at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic after many countries in the 27-nation bloc faced acute shortages of face masks, testing kits, ventilators, intensive care drugs and other vital items.
The EU is seeking to stockpile disinfectants, testing and diagnostic reagents, protective gear and essential medicines, according an EU document.
The extra funding, which needs to be approved by EU governments and lawmakers, would also be used to acquire vaccines, which are often in short supply in the EU and are mostly manufactured outside the bloc.
The Commission said it wanted to offer incentives to pharmaceutical companies to develop and produce vaccines in Europe, and relocate manufacturing capacity of medicines and their chemical ingredients which are now mostly imported from India and China.
EU lawmakers urged subsidies to encourage relocation, but health commissioner Stella Kyriakides declined to comment on the matter on Thursday. 
She said incentives would be addressed in proposals for an EU pharmaceutical strategy due at the end of the year - a timetable that raised some eyebrows in the industry in view of the risks of a second wave of the epidemic in autumn.
In a draft report, the Parliament also urged the creation of one or more ""European nonprofit pharmaceutical undertakings"" to manufacture priority medicines.
The United States has also been looking to build up the ability to produce drugs and their raw materials at home after the pandemic exposed the industry's dependence on China and India.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is planning to cancel the visas of thousands of Chinese graduate students believed by President Donald Trump's administration to have links with China's military, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.
The move, first reported by the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), could impact 3,000 to 5,000 Chinese students and could be announced as early as this week, according to the sources, including a current U.S. official and another individual who was briefed on the administration's internal discussions.
The United States and China are at loggerheads over China's decision to go forward with national security legislation for Hong Kong that democracy activists in the city and Western countries fear could erode its freedoms and jeopardize its role as a global financial hub.
Chinese students who are in the United States will have their visas canceled and will be expelled, the source briefed on the plans said, while those already outside the United States will not be allowed to return. 
The main purpose of the action is to clamp down on spying and intellectual property theft that some Chinese nationals are suspected of engaging in on U.S. university and college campuses, the source said, adding that the administration expected significant push back from those institutions because of their financial interests in Chinese student enrollment.
Some 360,000 Chinese nationals who attend U.S. schools annually generate economic activity of about $14 billion, largely from tuitions and other fees.
The decision on the visas is likely to further sour ties between the world's top two economies - also at odds over the coronavirus pandemic and trade.
Deliberations on the visa move have been in the works for months, the sources said. While not directly related to the tensions over Hong Kong, the timing appears to be part of ""an overall pressure campaign"" against China that has intensified in recent months, the source familiar with discussions said.

On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told Congress China had undermined Hong Kong's autonomy so fundamentally he could not support recertifying the city's special pre-1997 trading status established when it was a British colony.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's ruling party on Thursday terminated the membership of his predecessor Mahathir Mohamad, a move widely seen as an attmept to consolidate power as he faces a possible challenge to his nascent premiership.
Mahathir, 94, had said he would seek to oust Muhyiddin from office for making a ""backdoor arrangement"" that brought back into power a graft-tainted party rejected by voters in an election in 2018.
In a letter circulated widely on social media, the party stated that Mahathir automatically ceased to be a member after he made a show of rejecting Muhyiddin's leadership as prime minister and party president by sitting with the opposition when parliament met last week.
Similar letters were also issued to Mahathir's son and party deputy president, Mukhriz, and three others aligned with the former prime minister.
An aide to Muhyiddin confirmed the letters were authentic.
Mahathir's office declined an immediate response to a request for comment as it had not yet seen the letter itself, an aide said.
Muhyiddin, once a trusted lieutenant to Mahathir, unexpectedly emerged as prime minister in March after forging an alliance with the former ruling party, the United Malays National Organisation, to gain a parliamentary majority.
The opposition have accused him of stealing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.

Mahathir, who resigned the premiership in February as his multi-ethnic ruling coalition collapsed, has said he will seek a confidence vote in Muhyiddin's leadership.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian-language Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group that started off as a playful attempt by a group of friends to get through the coronavirus lockdown by recreating art masterpieces using everyday items has become an unexpected global hit.
The project - Izoizolyacia - was launched at the end of March, shortly after President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia to adopt lockdown measures to try to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Within a day, it had garnered 2,500 members. Now it has over 600,000, with people the world over submitting their versions of famous masterpieces using everything from vegetables to old clothes.
""It's a child of today's quarantine situation, because none of it would have happened without it,"" said co-founder Katerina Brudnaya-Chelyadinova, who never thought the idea would become so popular.
""It's cool content, it's easy to produce, it's full of humour and it helps to distract you when you look at those works,"" she said.
Some of the group's creations include versions of self-portraits by Henri Matisse and Vincent Van Gogh, Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" crafted from slippers and clothes and Kazimir Malevich's ""Black Square (NYSE:SQ)"" canvas composed of socks hanging from a towel rack. 
The group's co-founders say moderating it had become a full-time occupation, as hundreds of new art works flood in from across the world daily.
Participants dress themselves and family members in elaborate costumes — or shed layers — to reproduce portraits of the past as well as modern art and movie scenes, sometimes with striking accuracy.

The United States said on Wednesday it will terminate the waivers, which had allowed Russian, Chinese and European companies to carry out work at Iranian nuclear sites.
The role of the foreign firms was agreed in Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2015, and was intended to help ensure Iran's nuclear programme would not be used to make weapons.
""The ending of waivers for nuclear cooperation under (the nuclear deal) will not in practice have any effect on Iran’s work,” AEOI spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi said, in remarks reported by ISNA news agency. “Of course America wants its actions to have an effect in line with pressure on Iran, but in practice nothing will happen.”
Under the 2015 nuclear agreement, Iran agreed to curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and has since reimposed sanctions. Iran has scaled back its commitments under the deal but says it still abides by its overall terms.
The waivers, which officials said expire on July 27, covered the conversion of Iran’s Arak heavy water research reactor, the provision of enriched uranium for its Tehran Research Reactor and the transfer of spent and scrap reactor fuel abroad.
Iran agreed to shut down the reactor at Arak - about 250 km southwest of Tehran - under the 2015 deal. Iran was allowed to produce a limited amount of heavy water and Tehran has been working on redesigning the reactor. Tehran says it will make isotopes for medical and agricultural use.

Work on redesigning the Arak reactor is continuing, albeit at a slow pace because of sanctions and problems with carrying out the nuclear deal, Kamalvandi said.

Cummings, the campaigner who helped deliver the 2016 Brexit referendum win and Johnson's 2019 election landslide, has been fighting for his job after revelations about a long road trip at the height of lockdown provoked outrage across Britain.
Cummings has refused to apologise for the trip, involving a 400 km (250 mile) trip to his parents' property in northern England and another trip to a local castle that he said he took to test his eyes and driving ability after falling ill.
Durham Police said Cummings did not commit an offence by locating himself at his father's property in Durham but that the 26-mile trip to Barnard Castle with his wife and son might have been a minor breach of regulations.
Police said they had ""concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention.""
They added: ""Durham Constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing.""
Police said that had an officer stopped Cummings during that drive they would have advised him to return to his parents' house.
Johnson and senior ministers in his government have repeatedly said that Cummings did nothing wrong by travelling to his father's property while nearly 70 million British citizens adhered to the government's advice to stay at home.
The story of Cummings' trip was first published by The Mirror and The Guardian newspapers.
Johnson and his Downing Street office have said some of the reporting on Cummings was inaccurate.
Police said they found insufficient evidence to support news reports that Cummings was in Durham again on April 19.
""Durham Constabulary will take no further action in this matter and has informed Mr Cummings of this decision.""
Downing Street said Johnson believed the matter closed.

""The Prime Minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed,"" a Downing Street spokesman said.

MARACAIBO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuelans struggling to cope with chronic fuel shortages are jury-rigging vehicles to run on cooking gas cylinders, a practice industrial safety experts describe as dangerous and which has led to at least one explosion.
Venezuela, an OPEC member that sits atop the world's largest crude reserves, is suffering the worst gasoline shortages in its modern history due to a near-complete collapse of its refineries combined with U.S. sanctions that make it difficult to import fuel.
Mechanics and in some cases drivers themselves revamp vehicle fuel systems with a propane cylinder of the sort used for kitchen stoves, to avoid service station lines that sometimes leave people waiting for days to buy gasoline. 
""There's no fuel in Venezuela and I had to set my car up like this to be able to work and bring home my daily bread,"" said Senen Aguirre, 25, in the city of Maracaibo.
Aguirre says the system is safe, but says the car smells strongly of the liquefied gas. He worries more about having to pay off the police not to impound his car, because the arrangement is illegal. 
But the practice is not without risks. In the eastern city of Puerto La Cruz, one car running on cooking gas suffered an explosion earlier this month, a municipal official told Reuters.
The situation is a stark contrast to Venezuela's oil boom era when fuel was abundant and heavily subsidized. Fuel officially remains nearly free for those who can wait in lines or have connections, but gasoline now fetches $3 per liter ($11.34 per gallon) on the black market.
Following a request for information by Reuters, Maracaibo's citizen security division chief, Cesar Garrido, said in a statement that running cars on cooking gas ""represents a high level of risk and is prohibited.""
Venezuela's information ministry did not reply to a request for comment.
Alfredo Gonzalez used basic equipment including kitchen faucets to convert a pickup truck to run on cooking gas so that he could continue providing public transportation in Maracaibo - but he spends most of his time ducking the law. 
""We're working like smugglers,"" he said. ""The police persecution is really heavy. They say it's dangerous.""
Experts recommend against the practice due to the potential for explosions and health risks associated with prolonged exposure to propane gas. 

""Over time these vehicles are going to have (gas) leaks because people are not careful,"" said oil engineer Jorge Leon.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will divert A$280 million ($185.25 million) in overseas aid this year to bolster the response of its closest neighbours to the coronavirus pandemic, with Canberra warning the stability of the Indo-Pacific region is at risk.
The Pacific Islands, Timor-Leste and Indonesia will be the focus of the coronavirus aid strategy, said Australia's Minister for International Development and the Pacific Alex Hawke.
Pacific Island nations that closed borders have been able to limit the first wave of COVID-19 cases, but are experiencing economic shock as tourism is shut down, and government revenues, foreign reserves and cash balances collapse, an Australian government report said.
Australia has provided direct financing support to Pacific Island governments to fund essential services.
""The growth, openness and stability of the Indo-Pacific, which has underpinned Australia's prosperity and security for decades, is at risk,"" Australia's foreign minister Marise Payne said in the report. 
Australia has an annual international aid budget of A$4 billion. 
The coronavirus aid strategy will refocus on health security, social stability and stimulating economic recovery in the nations considered to be on Australia's doorstep. 
""How our neighbourhood emerges from this crisis will determine Australia's economic and strategic circumstances for decades to come,"" Payne said.
The government has provided 2.6 million items of personal protective equipment to the Pacific. 
Australian officials will help Pacific islands set up quarantine centres and coronavirus contact tracing programmes, seen as key steps for nations to join a proposed ""travel bubble"" with Australia and New Zealand that could allow tourism to resume.
The World Bank estimates 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty this year.
China has increased aid to the Pacific, including coronavirus aid this year, and is viewed warily in Canberra as seeking influence in a region described by Prime Minister Scott Morrison as Australia's ""backyard"".
The coronavirus pandemic is straining the global rules-based order and Australia will ""support partners' independence and sovereignty"", the report said.

1530,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>","For Lebanese families made poor by crisis, dinner means bread and no meat","By Dala Osseiran and Issam Abdallah
BEIRUT (Reuters) - At a street market in southern Beirut, Lebanese crowd around volunteers handing out free rations of bread and pasta, staples that have become a lifeline to families whose living standards have plunged during a financial crisis.
""People can't buy meat or fish anymore. Chicken is getting more expensive. They can only afford vegetables and bread,"" said Salwa Hable, an organiser helping distribute the privately donated food.
Lebanon's economic crisis has brought mounting hardship for its roughly 6 million people. Prices have soared, the result of a dollar crunch that has sunk the local currency since October and eviscerated purchasing power.
""It's going to soon turn into hunger protests,"" said Hable.
It was getting harder to solicit donations from better-off Lebanese, themselves feeling the pinch of the most destabilising crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war, she said.
The worsening conditions have already threatened more serious unrest. Last month protesters defying a coronavirus curfew rioted, burning banks and leaving a demonstrator dead.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab said last week the double-blow of the financial meltdown and coronavirus pandemic could tip Lebanon into a full-blown food crisis as basics like bread become unaffordable.
People are eating less, with butchers complaining of shrinking sales, restaurants empty, and families making do with simple carbohydrates - even during the holy month of Ramadan, typically a time of nightly feasts.
""We stopped buying fruits for ourselves. We get something small for my daughter, but that's it,"" said George Ortass, 46, a taxi driver. 
At a Beirut market, fish seller Noureddine Mhaysa said his sales have dipped 75% as his prices have more than doubled.
""You used to see overcrowding at the market, with people buying food, clothes, sweets. Ramadan has passed, and no one bought anything - no sweets, no clothes, no food,"" said Mhaysa. 
Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt in March and has entered talks with the International Monetary Fund. Beirut hopes an economic reform plan will draw billions of dollars in financing to re-launch its economy, but the near-term austerity is likely to bring further pain.
Even before the coronavirus lockdown, hundreds of businesses were shuttered and workers laid off. As the government has eased restrictions, many businesses have remained shut anyway, the rising dollar making costs too expensive at a time when customers are scant.
At Snack Henri, where previously people would line up outside for mid-day sandwiches, the restaurant sat entirely empty at noon.
""I've been here 20 years and I've never seen anything like this, said Henri, the owner. 
""A few days ago, someone came in and ordered a ham sandwich. I told him I don’t have ham anymore because it's too expensive but if he can buy some, I’ll do it. And that's what he did.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Skirmishes between Taliban fighters and Afghan security forces recommenced in Afghanistan in the day since a three-day ceasefire expired, but government officials said on Thursday that the incidents were minor and the truce could still hold.
The Taliban have remained silent on government appeals for an extension of the ceasefire, which was announced for the Eid al-Fitr holiday that ends the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
""Taliban attacked checkpoints in the Syagird district of central Parwan province late Wednesday night,"" a spokeswoman of the province's governor said, adding that seven Afghan security forces personnel were killed.
Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, meanwhile, said the government had carried out air strikes on Wednesday in the southern province of Zabul despite the group's fighters not having carried out any attacks.
The United States has reached an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces after more than 18 years in Afghanistan, leaving the Afghan government to negotiate a peace deal with the Islamist insurgents to end the war.
But so far the conflict has not subsided, with the holiday ceasefire having come at a time of intensified fighting. Since the truce formally ended on Tuesday night, senior Afghan government officials say there have been some violations from both sides, but not big enough to doom the ceasefire effort.
“The ceasefire is not over yet; there have been violations because it is a complicated technical process that requires good coordination between both sides,” said Javid Faisal, spokesman for the Afghan National Security Advisor (NSA).
The Afghan government freed 900 Taliban members from prison on Tuesday, the biggest such release yet, as part of a prisoner swap under the deal struck by the Islamist group and the United States in Qatar in February. 
The prisoner exchange is a precursor to the peace talks, and the government said an extension in the ceasefire was important to furthering the peace process. The Taliban welcomed the prisoner release and said they would reciprocate soon, but said nothing about extending the ceasefire.

A Taliban delegation has arrived in Kabul to work with a government team on the release of prisoners on both sides, spokesmen for both sides said on Twitter on Thursday.

1534,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>",Musicians in lockdown rage against industry machine,"By Natalie Thomas and Andy Bruce
LONDON (Reuters) - Lockdown bans on live performances have left many British musicians on the breadline, fuelling a campaign for them to get a bigger share of the profits from streaming their songs online.
""I'm getting contacted by lots of young artists who have millions of streams from 200,000 monthly listeners and don't make the minimum wage,"" musician Tom Gray from English indie band Gomez told Reuters.
Gray has founded the Broken Record campaign to pressure the industry into doing more for the people who make the music.
While platinum-selling Gomez has racked up millions of plays on Spotify (NYSE:SPOT), the market-leading online music platform, this amounts to ""a few pennies"" of income for Gray.
That is because the money paid by consumers for major online music platforms goes into a central pot that is distributed to artists according to market share.
So if someone pays 10 pounds ($12) a month and listened only to Gomez, their money would still find its way to the world's top artists and their record labels.
The streaming companies say they are doing their utmost to help artists during the lockdown. Spotify has pledged to match donations to music charities up to a total of $10 million and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Music launched a $50 million fund for independent record labels and distributors. 
The Help Musicians UK charity has paid 8.5 million pounds to 17,500 musicians who have run out of money for essentials.
But many more musicians are struggling, shut out of state lockdown support programmes because their incomes are irregular. A Musicians Union survey earlier this month found 38% were not eligible for government help.
""I know how hard this is already for so many people and I can see how truly terrifyingly bad it's going to get,"" said Gray, whose campaign is backed by Boy George, John Grant, and the Shins.
Hot Chip, a popular electro-tinged indie band, had planned a global tour through 2020. Now, the musicians and their nine-strong crew have lost much of their income, despite millions listening to their music online every month - a fanbase that might have earned Hot Chip a ""bed of gold"" decades ago.
""We ourselves don't know where the next chunk of cash is really coming from,"" said Al Doyle, a member of Hot Chip.
Despite a likely 25% drop in global music revenues this year because of the pandemic, the industry is set to double in value by 2030, a Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) research note published this month showed. But many artists have doubts about their future.
""If coronavirus continues like this for the whole of the summer, then really that's going to feel like my life in music has been decimated,"" said Theo Bard, a songwriter who was hoping to promote an album set for release this summer.
Doyle from Hot Chip conceded that only consumers might have the power to redress the balance, by buying music directly from their favourite artists's websites or via online platforms such as Bandcamp where the artists control the prices.
""If it's unsuccessful, then I think you'll find lots of mid-level artists, probably kind of on our level, deciding that this is not a feasible way to support ourselves.""

1535,By Reuters,"<span>May 28, 2020 05:55AM ET</span>",China's same-sex couples heartened by property protection rights in new civil code,"By Colin Qian and Huizhong Wu
BEIJING (Reuters) - It was an ambush, said He Meili, a 51-year-old lesbian woman, describing how she met with her dead partner's step-parents at a police station where they demanded she leave the apartment the couple had shared for 12 years.
""It was that very moment at the police station when I truly felt the pain of not being protected by the law,"" she told Reuters.
Her partner, Li Qin, out of superstition that talking about death could hasten it, had not drafted a will or explicitly discussed property ownership matters.
When Li died from lupus in 2016, her step-parents, legally next-of-kin, inherited the apartment in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou and were quick to stick an eviction note on the door.
Chinese law does not criminalise same-sex relationships, but neither does it recognise them, leaving couples like He and Li without recourse in legal disputes.
But with parliament's Thursday passage of China's first civil code, which seeks to better protect the rights of individuals, same-sex couples have been offered hope in property claims. Tucked away among the code's 1,260 articles is a chapter on ""the right to reside"".
It gives a property owner the power to grant another individual the right to live on the property for a term or for life, offering far more legal protection than a will which can be challenged by family members.
""The civil code doesn't put restrictions such as kinship or gender on the people who can be given the right to reside,"" said Zhang Qianlin, a Shanghai-based lawyer specialising in property law. 
In theory, the right can be applied to same-sex couples, he added.
""It could become gospel for the LGBT community,"" said He, who had been barred from co-owning the apartment as she was not an official resident of Guangzhou, having moved to the liberal megacity from her hometown in the autonomous Guangxi region.
PROGRESS BUT WORRIES REMAIN
Concerns remain, however, about how implementation of ""the right to reside"" will work in practice.
While the civil code, due to take effect on Jan. 1, 2021, is second only to the Chinese constitution in legal effect, it is general in nature and the country's judicial system will later issue guidelines on its implementation to judicial officers employed by local authorities. 
It is not clear if those guidelines will specify same-sex couples are protected by the ""right to reside"" and if the wording is vague, the fear is that some local authorities will ignore it.
""Whether it can protect the property rights of same-sex couples is still up for debate,"" said Yang Jianwei, a lawyer specialising in property law.
For the time being, however, members of China's lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community like Peng Yanhui, 36, are thrilled about the new civil code.
A Guangzhou native, he worries about his 31-year-old partner Yang Yi.
Yang has contributed the most financially to the cost of their 50-square-metre apartment, putting up the 300,000 yuan ($42,000) downpayment, but cannot co-own it as he is from the northwestern province of Gansu.
Their life together is one of domestic bliss, Peng says.
""It is also very dangerous, because the apartment is mine and if anything happens to me, legally the property will go to my parents,"" said Peng, who never discusses his gender preference with his parents.
He says that while the civil code represents progress, the LGBT community's ultimate goal is for same-sex couples to be included in China's legal definition of marriage.
""Every judicial officer would know what marriage means – no explanation needed,"" he said.

Reuters has captured some of those reflections along with portraits from across Africa and the Middle East of people inside their rooms looking out and outside looking in.
""The lockdown ... has been a great time for me to breathe, to re-evaluate how I've been living my life and trying to focus more on the things that truly matter to me,"" said Adetona Omokanye, a 29-year-old photographer who lives in Lagos.
Alexander Caiafas, from the same teeming Nigerian city, has also seen the bright side of being cooped up at home. The data analyst, 25, has relished time spent with family, on his studies and connecting with friends online.
But in rural Eastern Cape Province in South Africa, housewife Zodidi Desewula drew little comfort from weeks in her tiny, cylindrical ""rondavel"".
""Myself and my husband were stuck in this single room house unable to go to work. We were struggling in getting food to eat because there was no income,"" she told Reuters.
For Yael Ben Ezer, a performer with Israel's Batsheva Dance Company, there is something to be said for doing nothing.
""I will miss the comfortable feeling of 'it's OK not to do anything, it's OK not to be productive in the way we usually think',"" she said. ""Things would come and go, the sun would rise and set, and I would just be living. And that's totally enough.""
STAGE, SEA AND HOME
For her and many others, there are also plenty of downsides to life away from friends and work.
She craves the adrenaline rush of dancing on stage, and the open expanse of the sea.
In the Egyptian capital Cairo, Nada Maged, a 20-year-old student, described lockdown as ""prison"".
""When I look out I see the same view but have a different feeling - the streets are more sad and mysterious, and there is no hope of getting out soon,"" she said.
Zineb Mohamed ""Om Hany"" also lives in the city, and misses regular contact with her family and friends.
""I need to go to the zoo with my grandchildren,"" the 59-year-old concierge said in a sparsely furnished room with the television glowing through the gloom. ""Also, I want to take them to the sea - I dream about that many times.""
With a sea view from her window in the ancient Lebanese city of Tyre, Lama Nadra, 28, has the luxury of seeing it every day.
""I like the calm and being away from the noise of the capital, Beirut,"" she said, adding that once she was free to move around she wants to go swimming again.
For her, the end of lockdown will mean seeing family less.
""My brother will go back to Dubai and I ... to Beirut. I will be separated from my father and mother too.""
For many though, the pandemic has brought little noticeable change.
Abu Ghazi lives in a makeshift tent on the edge of a cemetery in Syria's northern town of Maarat Misrin. Like millions of his compatriots displaced by nine years of war, he longs to return home.

""We quarantined ourselves with the dead,"" the 53-year-old told Reuters. ""We wake up and sleep looking at graves.""

The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself. 
China, which claims the democratically-ruled island as its own territory, routinely denounces U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
Answering questions in parliament, Deputy Defence Minister Chang Che-ping confirmed that Taiwan was planning to buy Harpoon missiles from the United States to serve as a coastal defence cruise missile.
If the United States agrees to sell the Harpoons, Taiwan should receive them in 2023, Chang added.
Taiwan has been bolstering its defences in the face of what it sees as increasingly threatening moves by Beijing, such as regular Chinese air force and naval exercises near Taiwan.
While Taiwan's military is well-trained and well-equipped with mostly U.S.-made hardware, China has huge numerical superiority and is adding advanced equipment of its own such as stealth fighters.
The U.S government last week notified Congress of a possible sale of advanced torpedoes to Taiwan worth around $180 million, further souring already tense ties between Washington and Beijing. [nL4N2D31SL]

State TV said 230 lawmakers, out of 264, voted for Qalibaf, whose record as a veteran of Iran's eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s and as a national police chief has endeared him to Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and boosted his chances of becoming speaker.
A former Tehran mayor, Qalibaf ran unsuccessfully in two presidential races and was forced to drop out of a third to avoid splitting the hardline vote. He revived his political ambitions by standing for parliament. 
Separately, Khamenei appointed former parliament speaker Ali Larijani as his adviser and member of the Expediency Council, a body intended to resolve disputes between parliament and the powerful Guardian Council, state TV also reported on Wednesday. 
The Guardian Council, a hardline watchdog body, must approve all candidates for elections in Iran, including for parliament.
The Council disqualified thousands of moderate and leading conservative candidates from taking part in Iran's Feb. 21 parliamentary election, leaving voters to choose mainly between hardline and low-key conservative candidates loyal to Khamenei. 
Like hardliners, conservatives back the ruling theocracy, but unlike them support more engagement with the outside world.
Iran's 290-seat parliament has no major influence on foreign affairs or Iran's nuclear policy, which are determined by Khamenei. But it might bolster hardliners in the 2021 election for president and toughen Tehran's foreign policy.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday promised to settle Hong Kongers who flee the Chinese-ruled city due to political reasons, offering help from employment to counselling as China pushes new security legislation that has triggered fresh protests. 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen this week became the first world leader to pledge specific measures to help people from Hong Kong who may leave the former British colony due to the new legislation, a move that is certain to sour already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing.
Chen Ming-tong, head of Taiwan's top China-policy maker, the Mainland Affairs Council, told parliament the government will establish an organisation to deliver ""humanitarian relief"" that includes settlement and employment in a joint effort with activists groups.
He said counselling services will also be available for Hong Kongers, some of whom may take part in increasingly violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. 
""Many Hong Kongers want to come to Taiwan. Our goal is to give them settlement and care,"" Chen said, urging the public not use the word ""refugee"" as it could be ""emotionally harmful"" for people from the city. 
Chen, however, did not give details such as scale, timing and qualification of the relief programme when pressed by lawmakers, saying the government is still working on the details. 
Hong Kong's demonstrators have won widespread sympathy in democratic Taiwan, which China considers as its territory to be taken by force, if necessary. Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.
Help for Hong Kong has won rare bipartisan support in politically polarised Taiwan and three opposition parties have introduced bills to make it easier for Hong Kongers to live in Taiwan if they have to leave the city due to political reasons. 
Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to protesters seeking asylum, but its laws promise to help Hong Kongers whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.
Some say Tsai's government is not moving fast enough. 
""Please come up with details of the humanitarian relief at the soonest. Don't wait until people shed blood like water,"" said Chen Yu-jen, a lawmaker from main opposition Kuomintang party.
Ivan Tang, a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist, welcomed Tsai's support but cautioned a sense of urgency among protesters in the city, some of whom had been barred from entering Taiwan due to travel restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
""They have nowhere to go... but the security law could be implemented soon,"" he said. 
Taiwan has become a popular destination for Hong Kongers leaving the city, with the number of Hong Kong citizens granted Taiwan residency jumping 150% to 2,383 in the first four months of 2020 compared with a year ago, official data shows.

University applications to Taiwan from Hong Kong also rose 62% in 2020 from a year ago, and island's education ministry said this week it was planning to raise the quota for Hong Kong students.

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Protesters clashed with riot police firing tear gas for a second night in Minneapolis on Wednesday in an outpouring of rage over the death of a black man seen in a widely circulated video growing limp and lifeless as a white officer knelt on his neck.
The video, taken by an onlooker to Monday night's fatal encounter between police and George Floyd, 46, showed him lying face down and handcuffed, gasping for air and groaning for help, repeatedly saying, ""I can't breathe.""
The second day of demonstrations, accompanied by looting, began hours after Mayor Jacob Frey urged prosecutors to file criminal charges against the white policeman shown pinning Floyd to the street.
The policeman and three fellow officers who participated in Floyd's apprehension were dismissed from the police department on Tuesday as the FBI opened an investigation into the incident.
Floyd, reportedly suspected of trying to pass counterfeit bills at a corner eatery, was taken by ambulance from the scene of his arrest and pronounced dead the same night at a hospital. 
Hundreds of protesters, many with faces covered, thronged streets around the Third Precinct police station late on Wednesday, about half a mile from where Floyd had been arrested, chanting, ""No justice, no peace"" and ""I can't breathe.""
The crowd grew to thousands as night fell and the protest turned into a standoff outside the station, where police in riot gear formed barricade lines while protesters taunted them from behind makeshift barricades of their own.
Police, some taking positions on rooftops, used tear gas, plastic bullets and concussion grenades to keep the crowds at bay, while protesters pelted police with rocks, water bottles and other projectiles. Some threw tear gas canisters back at the officers.
Television news images from a helicopter over the area showed dozens of people looting a  Target  (N:TGT) store, running out with clothing and shopping carts full of merchandise.
Fires erupted after dark at several businesses, including an auto parts store, and eyewitnesses said the blazes appeared to be the work of arsonists. Media said a smaller, peaceful protest was held outside the suburban home of one of the police officers.
On Twitter, President Donald Trump said he had urged the FBI investigation ""to be expedited,"" adding that he appreciated ""all the work done by local law enforcement.""
""My heart goes out to George's family and friends. Justice will be served!"" he said.
""I CAN'T BREATHE""
The video of Monday's deadly confrontation between police and Floyd has stirred a national outcry and led Mayor Frey to call on Wednesday for Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman ""to charge the arresting officer in this case.""
The city identified the four officers as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng. It did not say who had his knee against Floyd's throat, and gave no further information.
The Police Officers' Federation of Minneapolis, a police union, said in a statement the officers involved were cooperating with investigators and it was ""not time to rush to judgment.""
""We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report,"" the union said, asking the community to remain calm. 
Frey did not say what charge was appropriate for the officer, but said he has relayed his wish to Freeman.
On Tuesday, the county attorney's office said it would make a charging decision after state investigators and the FBI conclude their inquiries.
The case is reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City who died after being put in a police chokehold. 

Garner's dying words, ""I can't breathe,"" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to a wave of killings of African-Americans by police using unjustified lethal force.

Schools closed in Japan in March because of the coronavirus outbreak, stoking concern over the shorter academic year and re-igniting debate over starting it in September, in line with many Western countries.
High-profile politicians like Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike backed reforms, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) set up a panel to review options.
But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Monday lifted a state of emergency for Tokyo and four other prefectures, the last remaining region in the country to be subject to restrictions, and many schools are already gradually resuming classes.
The Asahi newspaper quoted Masahiko Shibayama, a former education minister heading the LDP working group, as saying, ""Most lawmakers felt that this time, introducing a system to delay the start of the school year by half a year to September ... was not a good idea."" 
The LDP working group is expected to finalise its recommendations to the government as early as next week.
Public broadcaster NHK also said the view was spreading in the education ministry that an early introduction of a new school year would be difficult.
Advocates have said the September start would make it easier for Japanese college students to study abroad. Critics have cited numerous obstacles and said the focus should be on helping students catch up through online learning and other steps.

The U.S. Security Force Assistance Brigade (SFAB) will arrive in Colombia in early June, the embassy said, without specifying the size of the unit.
""SFAB's mission in Colombia is an opportunity to demonstrate our mutual commitment against drug trafficking and support for regional peace, respect for sovereignty and the lasting promise to defend shared ideals and values,"" said U.S. Southern Commander Admiral Craig Faller in a statement. 
Last year Colombia saw cultivation of coca leaves, the chief ingredient in cocaine, rise to 212,000 hectares (523,863 acres), from 208,000 hectares in 2018.
At the same time cocaine production capacity rose to 951 tonnes in 2019, from 879 tonnes the previous year, according to the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy.
Colombia faces constant U.S. pressure to reduce coca cultivation. President Ivan Duque has set a target to destroy 130,000 hectares of coca crops in 2020, up from 100,000 hectares last year.
Duque has also raised the possibility of restarting aerial fumigation of coca crops using the herbicide glyphosate. 
Colombia halted the practice in 2015 after the World Health Organization warned against using the herbicide, which it said can potentially cause cancer and is harmful to health and the environment.
Duque's government must comply with various health and environmental requirements demanded by Colombia's Constitutional Court if it is to renew aerial spraying of coca crops this year. 
Colombia and the United States hope to cut coca cultivation and cocaine production capacity in half by the end of 2023. 

The commander of the Colombian Military Forces, General Luis Fernando Navarro, said the U.S. unit will train task forces dedicated to fighting drug trafficking.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Wednesday it will terminate sanctions waivers that had allowed Russian, Chinese and European companies to carry out work originally designed to make it harder for Iranian nuclear sites to be used for weapons development.
The waivers, which officials said expire on July 27, covered the conversion of Iran's Arak heavy water research reactor, the provision of enriched uranium for its Tehran Research Reactor and the transfer of spent and scrap reactor fuel abroad.
In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo gave no precise justification for the move, which will halt some work originally designed to make it more difficult for Iran to potentially develop fissile material for nuclear bombs.
However, Pompeo said Washington would extend for 90 days a waiver allowing foreign work at a Russian-built nuclear power plant at Bushehr to ensure safety.
The wider decision seemed aimed at tightening the U.S. ""maximum pressure"" policy applied since Washington abandoned the 2015 Iran nuclear deal two years ago. That deal eased economic sanctions on Iran in return for curbs on its nuclear program.
""Because of our pressure, Iran's leaders are facing a decision: either negotiate with us or manage economic collapse,"" U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook told reporters.
Since the U.S. withdrawal and the revival of U.S. sanctions to cut Iran's oil exports, Tehran has boosted its nuclear work in what analysts see as an effort to change U.S. policy or increase Iranian leverage in any negotiation.
""The Iranian regime has continued its nuclear brinkmanship by expanding proliferation sensitive activities,"" Pompeo said, adding this ""will lead to increased pressure on Iran.""

Pompeo announced U.S. sanctions on Atomic Energy Organization of Iran officials Majid Agha'i and Amjad Sazgar, whom he accused of potentially contributing to the spread of weapons of mass destruction.

Colombia has reported more than 24,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, as well as 803 deaths. 
The country began a nationwide quarantine in late March.
""The pandemic hasn't gone away,"" Duque said in his televised nightly address. ""This is going to be a very important month for all of us.""
Sectors like retail and non-COVID-related medical care can begin normalizing gradually once the lockdown ends, but large events, bars and nightclubs will continue to be closed. Restaurants will be open for takeaway orders only, Duque said.
""We are not reviving social life,"" Duque said. ""We have to continue protecting health and lives and going forward we have to adapt to a disease that will be around for a long time.""
Even as restrictions begin to ease, public transport in cities must not exceed 35% of their capacity and land borders will continue to be closed. International flights, domestic flights and inter-city buses will continue to be suspended.
As part of the relaxed rules, children aged 2 to 5 years old will be allowed out three times a week for 30 minutes from the first of June, while those aged 6 to 17 will be permitted outside three times a week for up to an hour.
Adults under 70 years old will be allowed out three times a week for up to two hours at a time. People aged 70 and over are considered a high-risk population and should remain at home, though they may go out for 30 minutes three times a week.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Public approval of President Donald Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic remained steady this week as the number of U.S. deaths from the illness surpassed 100,000, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.
Asked to rate Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, 41% of Americans approved and 53% disapproved, about the same as last week but down significantly from late March when Americans approved of Trump's response to the pandemic by a small margin. 
Earlier this year, Trump downplayed the seriousness of the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 1.7 million people in the United States since the first reported case in late January.
Trump's performance in office received similar ratings, with 41% of U.S. adults approving and 54% disapproving. The president’s overall popularity has been about the same for more than a year.
Trump's likely Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election, former Vice President Joe Biden, has a higher favorability with registered voters despite a slight dip from last week. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has a six-point net lead in support over Trump, down about three points from last week.
Trump has been widely criticized for the federal government's response to the pandemic, which has battered the economy and led more than 38 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits.
The president has accused Democratic governors -- without any evidence -- of keeping states locked down to damage the economy and hurt his chances in the November election.
Some states have begun to relax stay-at-home guidelines while health experts warn that ending the orders too early or without sufficient precautions could cause a second deadly wave of the virus. 

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 4,429 American adults, including 3,732 who identified as registered voters. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 2 percentage points.

1550,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",U.S. weighs options 'across the spectrum' to punish China over Hong Kong,"By Matt Spetalnick and Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is crafting a range of options to punish China over its tightening grip on Hong Kong, including targeted sanctions, new tariffs and further restrictions on Chinese companies, according to U.S. officials and people familiar with the discussions.
Such moves could mark the opening salvoes of the U.S. response as President Donald Trump weighs how far he is prepared to go after the State Department’s assessment on Wednesday that Hong Kong is no longer autonomous enough from Beijing to deserve special treatment https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-protests/pompeo-says-hong-kong-no-longer-warrants-special-u-s-treatment-idUSKBN233053 under U.S. law that helped make it a global financial hub.
Internal U.S. deliberations, unfolding amid increased U.S.-China tensions over the coronavirus pandemic, are continuing and final decisions have yet to be made, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
But they suggested that the severity of U.S. measures could depend, at least in part, on the extent to which China’s Communist Party rulers implement planned national security rules in the former British colony. Beijing says there is no threat to Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and that it would counter any foreign interference.
Still uncertain is whether Trump would be prepared to deploy what has been called the “nuclear option” – stripping Hong Kong of its special economic status that the United States has conferred on it since the end of British rule more than two decades ago.
Among the likeliest early steps could be sanctions against Chinese officials, government and security entities and companies involved in enforcing the proposed legislation, which has triggered renewed street protests in Hong Kong and threatened the future of China’s freest city, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.
David Stilwell, assistant Secretary of State for East Asia, said the long list of potential U.S. responses could be ""across the spectrum,"" including visa and economic sanctions. He declined to elaborate but said measures would be calibrated to mitigate the impact on Hong Kong people and U.S. businesses there.
“They will be as targeted as possible to change behavior,” Stilwell told reporters in a telephone briefing. “We're not hopeful that Beijing will reverse itself.” 
Another option under consideration would call for suspending Hong Kong's preferential tariff rates for exports to the United States, three sources told Reuters. Such action could put Hong Kong's goods under the same tariffs that Trump has slapped on exports from the Chinese mainland, they said.
STRICTER WITH CHINESE COMPANIES 
The administration could also get stricter with Chinese companies that have set up legal counterparts in Hong Kong to take advantage of the territory’s special status, by more closely auditing the registry of Chinese firms that trade on U.S. markets, a U.S. congressional aide said.
U.S. businesses are concerned about any change in Washington’s recognition of Hong Kong, where major companies enjoy access to China and Southeast Asia, and where bilateral trade flourishes across various parts of the economy, from wine to financial services.
Trump will have the discretion to scrap all of Hong Kong’s privileges, some of them or none of them.
""We are going to do this in a smart way,” Stilwell said. He declined to elaborate.
Among the ideas that have surfaced is that Trump could set a deadline, months or perhaps a year from now, for China to improve the political situation in Hong Kong or else face loss of its special status. But it was unclear if this notion has gained any traction.

It remains to be seen whether Trump, who has previously shown limited interest in human rights in Hong Kong or other countries, will now take a decisive stand on the issue.
 
"
1551,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 27, 2020 08:18PM ET</span>",U.S. Move on Hong Kong Leaves Trump With Tough-or-Gentle Options,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. finding that China has effectively stripped Hong Kong of its political autonomy leaves President Donald Trump with a difficult choice about how harshly to penalize Beijing.
He could take a lighter touch with modest sanctions aimed at putting China on notice. Or he could unleash a far harsher approach that would curtail the former U.K. colony’s special trading status with the U.S., potentially imperiling its position as a global financial hub.
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo’s announcement on Wednesday that Hong Kong no longer warrants its special treatment under American law has no impact beyond the symbolic. He said “no reasonable person can assert today” that it “maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground.”
Now it’s up to Trump to take the next step, and to decide how quickly he wants to do it while he’s also threatening consequences for the Beijing government over its handling of the coronavirus. His most powerful option -- revoking Hong Kong’s special trading status with the U.S. -- would probably reorient global trade, plunge U.S.-China relations even deeper into crisis and scuttle any hope for a new trade agreement.
Hurting China also would carry risks for the U.S. economy, reeling under the pandemic -- and to Trump’s odds of winning a second term as president. It could result in the implosion of the U.S.-China trade deal that Trump once considered one of his biggest economic achievements and that would have seen Beijing increase purchases of American goods and services by $250 billion.
China promised to retaliate for Pompeo’s finding.
“As for foreign meddling in Hong Kong affairs, we will take necessary countermeasures in response,” the Chinese embassy in Washington said in a statement.
Stripping Hong Kong of its special status would imperil “all of the financial connectivity that China has to the free market,” said Robert Spalding, a senior fellow at the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Institute in Washington who focuses on U.S.-China relations. “Once that goes away, stocks, bonds, financial transactions, SWIFT, all of that is imperiled.”
While Hong Kong remains a major trading hub and a key gateway from China to the rest of the world, it matters far less to the country’s fortunes than it once did. In 2019, 12% of China’s exports went to or through Hong Kong, down from 45% in 1992. China is also far less reliant on inflows of foreign capital and expertise, and has made a much lower priority of making the yuan an international currency.
What’s Next
So far, U.S. officials have given mixed signals about what might happen next, and when. In recent days, they have mulled imposing travel bans and asset freezes on Chinese Communist Party leaders who have played a role in the erosion of Hong Kong’s freedoms, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing internal deliberations.
One of those people said before Pompeo’s announcement that it would trigger a monthlong deliberative process. But Chinese moves to assert greater control in Hong Kong may have accelerated that timeline.
The immediate cause of Pompeo’s declaration was the Chinese leadership’s announcement that the National People’s Congress, a rubber-stamp parliament holding its annual session in Beijing, would pass a new national security law that could cut back civil liberties in the former British colony.
China’s new law targets “a very narrow category of acts that seriously jeopardize national security and has no impact on Hong Kong’s high degree of autonomy,” the Chinese embassy said in its statement.
Yet analysts said China has been eroding Hong Kong’s freedoms for years despite promises to grant it self-rule under the “One Country, Two Systems” agreement put into place after taking it back from the U.K. in 1997.
“The U.S. is aligning its policy with facts on the ground that have been a reality for 23 years,” said Kamran Bokhari, director of analytical development at the Center for Global Policy in Washington.
‘Business-Transparent’
Whatever Trump does, the move is certain to escalate tensions between the world’s two largest economies even further. Those strains had grown in recent weeks as Trump, Pompeo and other senior officials accused China of hiding the peril of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
It will also send a jolt through the international business community. Companies were already growing concerned about how long Hong Kong would hang on to the relatively free judicial system and regulatory environment it’s enjoyed for decades. On Wednesday, a senior U.S. official warned Hong Kong had already lost that status.
China has suggested it would “respect the economic freedom in Hong Kong without feeling obligated to respect political freedom,” Assistant Secretary of State David Stilwell told reporters. “You can’t have one without the other.”
“Businesses and others would notice these facts as well and make choices as far as whether the environment in a year from now is going to be conducive to fair, business-transparent operations,” he said.
Trump-Xi Relations
Any response will be shaped by Trump’s attitude toward Chinese President Xi Jinping. Before the administration’s shift in tone, Trump had repeatedly praised the Chinese leader, both for his handling of the coronavirus crisis and for signing the first phase of a trade deal with the U.S.
Now, the American president is blaming China for the virus even as his own handling of the pandemic as it spread in the U.S. has become an election-year issue.
In another point of conflict between the U.S. and China, Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies Co.’s chief financial officer, failed Wednesday to persuade a Canadian judge to end extradition proceedings, keeping her under house arrest in Vancouver as the fight against U.S. efforts to prosecute her moves forward.
Yet Trump has voiced little concern about China’s performance on human rights, from the crackdown on protests in Hong Kong to the internment of more than 1 million Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in China’s Xinjiang region.
On Wednesday, the U.S. House voted to authorize sanctions against Chinese officials for human rights abuses against Muslim minorities, sending the measure to Trump.
Democrats say that Trump’s lack of attention to rights abuses has given Chinese leaders a green light to assert even more control over Hong Kong.
“Secretary Pompeo appears to finally be making official what has long been clear to everyone but President Trump: that the United States must take a stand against China’s crackdown in Hong Kong,” Tony Blinken, an adviser to Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said in a statement. “We’ve come to this point in part because President Trump has enabled Xi Jinping’s sense of impunity when it comes to stifling freedom.”
‘Thread the Needle’
The Trump administration will probably focus on financial sanctions and visa restrictions on Chinese officials while holding back on tariffs, export controls and investment restrictions until there’s more clarity on the new Chinese law, according to David Loevinger, a former China specialist at the U.S. Treasury who’s now an analyst at TCW Group Inc. in Los Angeles.
“They have to thread the needle of coming down on Mainland and Hong Kong officials who support this while not being seen as attacking the Hong Kong people,” he said.
Under the U.S.-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, Washington agreed to treat Hong Kong as fully autonomous for trade and economic matters even after China took control. That meant Hong Kong was exempt from Trump’s punitive tariffs on China, can import certain sensitive technologies and enjoys U.S. support for its participation in international bodies like the World Trade Organization.
But a finding on Hong Kong’s autonomy was compelled by last year’s Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act. The law signed by Trump requires such a certification each year. It also gives the administration broad authority to impose sanctions or other punishments, including revoking Hong Kong’s special status if it chooses.
“Having decertified Hong Kong’s autonomy, they have choices to make about how to modify all the multitudes of ways in which the U.S. government treats it differently,” said Susan Shirk, chair of the 21st Century China Center at University of California. San Diego. “One reasonable thing to do is decertify Hong Kong but try to limit the damage to the people of Hong Kong and the Hong Kong economy.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Wednesday charged a former Venezuelan lawmaker with taking part with President Nicolas Maduro in a scheme linked to South American and Middle Eastern militant groups to traffic cocaine and military grade weapons.
Federal prosecutors in New York also charged Adel al Zabayar, a 56-year-old former member of Venezuela's National Assembly, with helping to recruit Hezbollah and Hamas operatives to plan attacks against U.S. targets.
They said in court papers filed in Manhattan that he worked with the Venezuelan criminal organization the Cártel de Los Soles, or ""Cartel of the Suns"" in English, and Colombian militant group Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, better known by the acronym FARC.
""El Zabayar was part of the unholy alliance of government, military, and FARC members using violence and corruption to further their narco-terrorist aims,"" Geoffrey Berman, U.S. Attorney for Manhattan, said in a statement. ""The Cártel de Los Soles sought to recruit terrorists from Hezbollah and Hamas to assist in planning and carrying out attacks on the U.S., and ... El Zabayar was instrumental as a go-between.""
U.S. prosecutors indicted Maduro and over a dozen current and former Venezuelan officials on charges of narco-terrorism and drug smuggling in March. Maduro has dismissed the charges as a politically motivated fabrication by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

The Andean country is starting to reopen its economy, but President Ivan Duque has warned that public transport via highways will remain off-limits, even as other sectors return to work. 
Some 38,000 buses ferry passengers across the country's highways, accounting for over 50,000 jobs, according to Colombia's Transport Ministry. 
Protesters waved red cloths, which have come to represent cries for help during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 23,000 people and killed at least 776 people in Colombia.
""It's a national protest for inter-city transport,"" Edgar Gonzalez, a spokesperson for transport country Omega, told Reuters at a protest near a bus station in Bogota, the capital. ""We've gone two months without income, which has affected drivers' salaries and the sustainability of businesses."" 
Gonzalez called on the government to reopen bus routes with the implementation of bio-security measures including obligatory use of face masks for drivers and passengers and the frequent disinfecting of vehicles.
Similar protests took place in cities including Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga and Tunja.
Gonzales warned the government must allow buses to travel with a 70% capacity to cover operating costs and avoid raising ticket prices.
Driver Alexander Barajas, 48, who ferries passengers on routes from Bogota to Cali and Cali to Medellin, called on the government to open up the inter-city routes.
""We depend on these buses, on these businesses that are on the verge of bankruptcy,"" Barajas said.

Transport Minister Angela Maria Orozco held a virtual meeting with inter-city transport representatives to form a plan that will let drivers get back to work.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Widespread and systematic killings, beheadings, rape and other barbaric acts by militia mostly from the ethnic Lendu community in northeastern Congo may constitute crimes against humanity and war crimes, the United Nations said on Wednesday.
In the six months to April 2020, at least 296 people were killed, 151 wounded and 38 raped, including women and children, mostly by fighters linked to the CODECO rebel group, said a report by the United Nations Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Human Rights Office (UNJHRO).
CODECO's fighters are drawn from the Lendu ethnic group.
Rich in natural resources including gold, diamonds, oil and coltan, the Ituri province in northeast Congo was the site of some of the country's worst fighting between 1999 and 2007, after a power struggle between rebel groups descended into ethnic violence, mostly between the Hema and Lendu communities.
After years of relative calm, tit-for-tat fighting erupted again in Dec. 2017, reviving longstanding tensions over land.
The recent attacks against civilians not only targeted the Hema and Alur communities, but included communities previously spared, UNJRHO report said. The raids intensified from March this year, particularly around artisanal mining sites.
""The persistence of this violence is likely to push members of the communities targeted by the attacks, who have so far shown restraint, to form self-defence militias,"" UNJRHO said. 
""This could increase the likelihood of large-scale inter-communal violence in the region.""
Since June 2018, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced, bringing the number of displaced people in Ituri province to more than 1.2 million, UNJRHO said. On March 25 CODECO's leader Justin Ngudjolo was killed in an army ambush, leading to a power struggle and split within the group.

""There is a high risk that leaders with more radical positions will emerge and plunge the area into a more serious cycle of violence, with even more attacks against (the army) and civilians,"" UNJRHO said in the report.

Moscow backs the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar in its conflict against the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations and backed by Turkey. Libya is subject to a U.N. arms embargo. 
LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari denied that new jets had arrived, calling it ""media rumours and lies"". Last week he said the LNA had repaired four old Libyan jets for use and announced the start of a major new air campaign. 
A Russian member of parliament earlier on Wednesday said Russia had not sent any military personnel to Libya and the upper house of parliament had received no request to approve such a dispatch. 
On Tuesday, the U.S. military's Africa Command said it assessed that Russia had flown fighter jets to Libya via Syria to support Russian mercenaries fighting alongside the LNA.
It said the jets were repainted in Syria to remove Russian Federation Air Force markings. 
In a series of Tweets on Wednesday the U.S. military added that the jets had been flown by Russian military personnel and were escorted to Libya by Russian fighter planes, indicating a higher level of involvement by Moscow. 
They first landed in Tobruk, in eastern Libya, and then flew to Jufra in central Libya, an LNA stronghold, the Tweets said. They added that 14 newly unmarked Russian fighter planes had been delivered to Jufra. 
Haftar has suffered a series of military setbacks recently in his offensive to capture the capital Tripoli and Russian mercenaries who had left frontlines in the city's suburbs were evacuated from a town further south on Saturday, its mayor said.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves le Drian said on Wednesday the situation in Libya was very worrying, warning the Syria scenario was being replicated in the country.

Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed former U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller in 2017, will testify on June 3 as part of a Senate Judiciary Committee examination of an FBI probe of Trump campaign officials code-named ""Crossfire Hurricane,"" which led to the Mueller investigation.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM) said Rosenstein would offer ""new revelations"" about federal surveillance practices. 
Trump and his Republican allies claim the probe was intended to undermine his candidacy and presidency. In December, a Justice Department watchdog found evidence of numerous errors but no political bias when the FBI opened the probe. 
""Even the best law enforcement officers make mistakes and ... some engage in willful misconduct,"" Rosenstein said in a statement on Wednesday. 
""We can only hope to maintain public confidence if we correct mistakes, hold wrongdoers accountable and adopt policies to prevent problems from recurring,"" he added.
The Rosenstein hearing is set a day before the Senate Judiciary Committee will vote whether to subpoena Rosenstein, former FBI Director James Comey and other former top officials from the Obama administration, as part of its probe. 
The panel's top Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein, has sharply criticized the committee investigation as an effort to attack Trump political rival Joe Biden, the presumptive 2020 Democratic presidential nominee. 

The Mueller probe found that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election to boost Trump's candidacy and that the Trump campaign had numerous contacts with Russians.

WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he had certified on Wednesday that Hong Kong no longer warrants special treatment under U.S. law as it did when it was under British rule, a potentially big blow to its status as a major financial hub.
Pompeo's certification to the U.S. Congress follows China's announcement of a plan to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong which has triggered fresh unrest in the territory, with police firing tear gas and water cannon.
It now falls to President Donald Trump to decide to end some, all, or none of the U.S. economic privileges which the territory enjoys now.
Pompeo made no recommendations for follow-up action in his statement. But people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday the Trump administration was considering suspending Hong Kong's preferential tariff rates for exports to the United States as part of its response to China's plan.
Trump could also opt for targeted sanctions against Chinese officials, government entities and businesses involved in enforcing the new legislation, according one of the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Trump, already at odds with Beijing over trade and the coronavirus pandemic, had said on Tuesday Washington was working on a strong response to the national security legislation that would be announced before the end of the week. 
Pompeo said China's plan to impose the new legislation was ""only the latest in a series of actions that fundamentally undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedoms.
""No reasonable person can assert today that Hong Kong maintains a high degree of autonomy from China, given facts on the ground,"" he said. 
He said he certified that Hong Kong no longer warrants treatment under U.S. laws ""in the same manner as U.S. laws were applied to Hong Kong before July 1997"", when Britain ended its administration of the territory and returned it to China. 
""It is now clear that China is modeling Hong Kong after itself,"" Pompeo said.
The ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"" approved by the U.S. Congress and Trump last year requires the State Department to certify at least annually that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify the favorable U.S. trading terms that have helped it remain a world financial center. 
Under the act, officials responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong could be subject to sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes.
China's security proposal, unveiled in Beijing last week, triggered the first large street protests in Hong Kong for months. 
The United States, European Union, Britain and others have expressed concern about the legislation, widely seen as a possible turning point for China's freest city.
Specifics of the security bill remain unclear and will not be enacted until later. It is meant to tackle secession, subversion and terrorism after major unrest last year and could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong.
MORE PROTESTS AND ARRESTS
Chinese authorities and the Beijing-backed government in Hong Kong say there is no threat to the city's high degree of autonomy and the new security law will be tightly focused.
Beijing has said it will take necessary countermeasures to any foreign interference.
""It's for the long-term stability of Hong Kong and China, it won’t affect the freedom of assembly and speech and it won’t affect the city's status as a financial centre,"" Hong Kong Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung told reporters.
Police in Hong Kong fired pepper pellets and made 360 arrests on Wednesday as thousands of people took to the streets in anger over the legislation.
Late into the evening, protesters were still cramming sidewalks, chanting for full democracy and for Hong Kong to seek independence from China, saying this is now ""the only way out"".

A heavy police presence around the Legislative Council had earlier deterred protesters from disrupting a debate of a bill that would criminalise disrespect of the Chinese national anthem. That is expected to be passed into law next month.

MONTREAL/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Wednesday vowed to help provincial authorities revamp the country's senior care system after soldiers helping in nursing homes in Ontario and Quebec reported serious shortfalls this week.
Nursing homes account for around 80% of all deaths attributed to the new coronavirus in Canada. The situation is dire in Ontario, the most populous province, and in neighboring Quebec. Some 1,400 military personnel are pitching in to help.
""Everything is on the table,"" Trudeau said in his daily press conference when asked what the federal government would do to help fix the current system. 
A military report on Quebec's long-term care facilities released on Wednesday described a shortage of workers with medical training, said the use of personal protective equipment had to be improved, and added there must be better separation of infected residents from non-infected ones.
A separate armed forces report from Tuesday about five of the worst-affected Ontario homes was more alarming. It described residents left in soiled diapers, and patient rooms filled with ""significant fecal contamination,"" cockroaches, and ants.
Canada's coronavirus deaths on Wednesday rose to 6,671, a 1.6% increase from a day earlier, according to official data.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the province was taking over management of five homes as it has already done with two others.
Following Wednesday's report, Quebec Premier Francois Legault said the province is launching a three-month training program for orderlies as it faces a shortage of 10,000 workers in its long term care facilities.
Recruits that complete the paid program will start with a full-time job paying C$26 an hour, he said.
""We still need more people,"" Legault told reporters in Quebec City. 
Quebec accounts for more than half of Canada's deaths and cases from coronavirus, and most have been in nursing homes.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A team of Pakistani and French investigators on Wednesday sifted through the wreckage of a Pakistani airliner that crashed in the southern city of Karachi last Friday, searching for clues around what caused the worst airline disaster in the country in years.
Investigators were also hunting for the Airbus A320 jet's cockpit voice recorder, said a spokesman for Pakistan International Airlines (PIA). 
""The flight data recorder has been found; the cockpit voice recorder is still being traced,"" PIA's spokesman told Reuters.
Earlier, the spokesman told media the black box had been found and it contained both the data and voice recorder.
Parts of the wreckage of the A320 were removed from the site on Wednesday after extracting them from building rubble in the densely populated area where the PIA jet crashed, residents and eyewitnesses said.
PIA flight PK 8303, flying from the eastern city of Lahore crashed roughly a kilometre short of the airport runway, killing 97 of the 99 people on board. 
Under international aviation rules, French investigators from the BEA - the French air safety investigation authority for civil aviation - have joined the Pakistan-led probe because the 15-year-old Airbus jet was designed in France.
Their arrival was initially hampered by widespread travel bans in force to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The French team and technical representatives of Airbus and engine maker  Safran  (PA:SAF) had to be flown in on an Airbus A330-900 test plane.
The French team is now helping Pakistani authorities search for the cockpit voice recorder and examining the fuselage, which ploughed between buildings and was partly buried under rubble. 
There have been no reported deaths on the ground.
Particular focus will be on the plane's CFM56 engines, one of which plunged into the side of a building, according to a person close to the investigation. 
The engines were made by CFM International, a joint-venture of France's Safran and  General Electric  (NYSE:GE), and are among the most widely used and reliable in the airline industry.
The pilot reported both engines had failed shortly after the plane bounced and scraped along the runway in a failed initial landing attempt.
He made no reference to a landing gear problem as the aircraft followed what appeared to be a steeper-than-usual descent, according to people close to the probe. Video showed the wheels extended on the second, fatal attempt to land.

Safety experts stress it is too early to say what caused the crash.

Fourteen-year-old Romina Ashrafi fled with a 29-year-old man in mid-May from her home in the town of Talesh, approximately 200 miles (321 km) northwest of the capital Tehran, according to the official IRNA news agency.
The couple were subsequently detained and Ashrafi was turned over to the custody of her family after her father appeared forgiving, IRNA reported, citing a local judicial official in Gilan province where Talesh is located.
On May 21, Ashrafi's father attacked her as she slept and beheaded her with a sickle, a local news site called Gilkhabar reported. He is currently in police custody, IRNA reported.
A handful of Iranian newspapers featured headlines about Ashrafi's murder on their front page on Wednesday.
""Without a doubt our heavy duty is the judicial follow-up of the issue and harsh punishment for the perpetrator of this crime,"" Deputy Justice Minister Mahmoud Abbasi said on Wednesday, according to IRNA. 
""But this issue isn't the end of the road. It's the beginning of a large and terrible road that requires us to take a step for the preventing of the sacrifice of Rominas in society.""
Massoumeh Ebtekar, the vice president for women and family affairs, called for a bill focused on establishing security for women to be prioritized and expedited during a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, according to IRNA.
Rouhani expressed regret over the killing, according to the official presidency website, and called for bills preventing violence to be attended to quickly. Many Iranians took to social media to express their fury at Ashrafi's murder.
""Curse all of the brain damaged culture and tradition that leads to the death of Rominas,"" a Twitter user name Azadehkt posted.

1562,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. preparing criminal indictment against wife of Venezuela's Maduro - sources,"By Angus Berwick and Matt Spetalnick
CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is preparing to charge the wife of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in coming months with crimes that could include drug trafficking and corruption, four people familiar with the case told Reuters.
If Washington goes ahead with an indictment of first lady Cilia Flores, these people said, the charges are expected to stem, at least in part, from a thwarted cocaine transaction that has already landed two of her nephews in a Florida penitentiary.
Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment on any investigation or pending charges against Flores. Flores and her office at the National Assembly didn't respond to questions for this article. 
Venezuela's information minister, Jorge Rodriguez, told Reuters that its questions about the possible U.S. indictment of Flores were ""nauseating, slanderous and offensive."" He declined to elaborate.
In late March, U.S. prosecutors indicted Maduro and over a dozen current and former Venezuelan officials on charges of narco-terrorism and drug smuggling. Maduro, now in his eighth year as Venezuela's president, for years sought to flood the U.S. with cocaine, prosecutors alleged, seeking to weaken American society and bolster his position and wealth.
In a televised speech after the indictments, he dismissed the charges against him and his colleagues as a politically motivated fabrication by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. ""You are a miserable person, Donald Trump,"" he said. Maduro's office didn't respond to requests for comment on this report.
The March indictments and the expected charges against Flores come amid a fresh campaign by Washington to increase pressure on Maduro. The Socialist leader, Flores and other members of the Maduro ""inner circle"" were sanctioned starting in 2017 by the U.S. Treasury Department. Flores is a longtime legislator and power broker in the ruling Socialist party.
The United States and its allies last year recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president, deeming Maduro's 2018 re-election a sham. But Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran - a growing source of frustration for Trump, according to some U.S. officials.
In interviews with Reuters, a jailed former bodyguard of Flores, Yazenky Lamas, said Flores was aware of crimes by family members, including the coke-trafficking racket for which her nephews were convicted by a U.S. court. The Reuters interviews, the first he's granted since his arrest, mark the first time Lamas has aired his accusations in public. 
Lamas, who was extradited to the United States on drug charges in 2017, agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors, according to a confidential Justice Department document reviewed by Reuters. He admitted to charges of drug trafficking and became a cooperating witness. The agreement hasn't been previously reported. 
Flores' jailed nephews, Efrain Campo and Franqui Flores, were close to the first lady. She helped raise them, people who know the family told Reuters, and both men sometimes referred to her as ""mom."" Their November 2015 arrest, in a sting in Haiti by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, made international headlines. 
The bust stemmed from a plan to sell $20 million worth of cocaine in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty, were convicted in 2017 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The two nephews couldn't be reached for comment. 
Among evidence investigators obtained, according to two people familiar with the case, are text messages between the nephews and Flores in which the trio allegedly discuss the cocaine shipment. Reuters hasn't seen the messages. 
The proceeds from the coke deal were meant to finance a Flores campaign for the National Assembly in 2015, according to the U.S. indictment against Maduro. Flores had briefly left the assembly when she became attorney general, and in 2015 she was reelected.

Fighters from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) group, which was driven out of Uganda in the late 1990s, attacked Samboko village around 100 km (60 miles) southwest of the city of Bunia, early on Tuesday, said Omar Kavota from rights group CEPADHO.
They killed at least 40 people with machetes and looted food and valuables, Kavota added, a day after killing at least 17 in the nearby village of Makutano.
More than 400 people have been killed in attacks attributed to the ADF since the army began an offensive to oust the group from its bases last year, according to the Kivu Security Tracker (KST), a research initiative that maps unrest in the region.
Following two months of relative quiet, the area has seen a rise in deadly attacks in the last three weeks, KST said.
Rachel Tarwayo, a government administrator, said she was aware of the Samboko incursion but could not provide any further details.
""On the ground some people have fled and others have given themselves the courage to stay for the moment,"" said Gili Gotabo, a rights activist in the region.
While the insurgents have pledged allegiance to Islamic State and the group has endorsed some attacks by the ADF, researchers say there is no evidence of close collaboration.
Some 200,000 people have fled their homes in Ituri province, where the two villages are located, in the past two months due to an uptick of more widespread violence by a variety of armed groups that is hampering efforts to stamp out an Ebola epidemic.
Researchers and rights groups say some Congolese soldiers have also participated in massacres since 2014 for a variety of motives often related to competition for power in lawless zones dominated by dozens of militia groups.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday that there are still many health-related questions to be answered before he can say whether he will attend a face-to-face G7 meeting that President Donald Trump has said he wants to host.
""There are significant health preoccupations that we have around holding an in-person meeting,"" Trudeau said in his daily news conference. ""Would we then as leaders have to self-isolate when we return, which is right now the rule in Canada?"" 
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Sunday that if there were to be an in-person meeting, it would be at the end of June.
Trump in March canceled the Group of Seven leaders meeting scheduled for June 10 as the coronavirus outbreak was spreading around the world and international travel was curtailed. But last week Trump said he may seek to revive the idea of a face-to-face meeting because he said it would send a message that the world is getting back to normal.
Trudeau did not rule out going, saying he would consult public health experts and that talks with the Trump administration ""are happening in an ongoing and very constructive way.""
The border between Canada and the United States, which was shut down to non-essential travel in March, will be closed at least until June 21.
""There's no question that an in-person meetings in an ideal situation are much more effective than virtual meetings. However there are many questions to answer before we can commit to showing up in person,"" Trudeau said.

French President Emmanuel Macron is open to traveling to the United States for an in-person G7 meeting if the coronavirus pandemic situation allows, an Elysee official said last week.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's federal police searched the homes and offices of allies of President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday in an investigation into alleged fake news attacks on social media against the country's Supreme Court.
A police statement said the searches in six cities were authorized by the Supreme Court.
Criticism of the top court on social media last year led Chief Justice Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli to authorize the probe into an alleged fake news network. There have also been threats against Supreme Court justices.
Supporters of Bolsonaro have held demonstrations outside the Supreme Court calling for the closure of the court, which they see as blocking their far-right leader's agenda. His critics say the president has encouraged the protests that threaten the constitutional separation of powers.
The police did not name the targets of the searches, but two sources with knowledge of the operation said they included Sao Paulo state legislature member Douglas Garcia of the right-wing PSL party, former congressman Roberto Jefferson and entrepreneur Luciano Hang, owner of the Havan retail chain. 
Garcia, 26, a militant supporter of Bolsonaro, confirmed in a video posted on Twitter that police had been to his office in the state legislature and he was being investigated for criticism of Supreme Court justices.
""I am a lawmaker. I was elected to speak out, it is my constitutional right: I can criticize whoever I like,"" said Garcia, who has joined protests outside the Supreme Court for blocking Bolsonaro's bid to end social distancing and reopen an economy paralyzed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Hang said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) his cellular phone and his laptop had been seized by police when they searched his home and office.

The WHO Foundation is being created as an independent grant-making entity that will support the organization's efforts to address the most pressing global health challenges by raising new funding from ""non-traditional sources"".
The United States suspended funding to the WHO this year after President Donald Trump complained about its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and accused it of being ""China-centric"". 
Trump also threatened this month to halt funding from the body's top donor altogether if it does not commit to reforms within 30 days. 
But Tedros said the creation of the WHO Foundation had nothing to do with ""recent funding issues.""
He said this month that the body's annual budget of around $2.3 billion was ""very, very small"" for a global agency, around that of a medium-sized hospital in the developed world.

1569,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions advisory raises hurdles for global maritime industry,"By Jonathan Saul, Humeyra Pamuk and Timothy Gardner
LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ship owners and insurers say it may be impossible for the maritime industry to fully comply with the Trump administration’s new guidelines on how to avoid sanctions penalties related to Iran, North Korea and Syria, raising the risk of disruptions in a sector already struggling with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak.
The advisory issued this month marked the first U.S. sanctions guidance for the global maritime sector, and will test Washington’s ability to clamp down on violations without disrupting an industry that handles 90% of the world’s trade.
The final version of the U.S. guidance, written after feedback from maritime professionals, asks for enhanced data-sharing between the shipping industry and U.S. authorities, constant location tracking of vessels, and industry-led investigations into suspicious activity.
A U.S. State Department official told Reuters the advisory contained ""recommended best practices,"" not hard requirements. 
A second State Department official said the administration hopes the guidance improves the industry’s self-monitoring to help the industry avoid violating sanctions.
""There are parts in there that we can’t do,” said Mike Salthouse, chairman of the sanctions sub-committee with the International Group association, which represents companies that insure about 90 percent of the world's commercial shipping.
He said that, while the industry welcomed the opportunity to consult on the guidance, the advisory’s data-sharing suggestions, for example, will bump up against European privacy laws: “We can’t share information about members we have ceased to insure on the basis of a suspicion of breaking sanctions because that contravenes competition law.”
“We are also constrained in relation to sharing personal data by the GDPR,"" Salthouse added, referring to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.
U.S. guidelines seeking constant location monitoring of ships, and investigations by insurers of gaps in that tracking, may also prove difficult, industry officials said. The advisory notes that weather often interferes with AIS transponders, and ship captains should have the discretion to go dark to avoid pirates or militants on the high seas.
""Importantly, a signal not received is not the same as a signal not sent,"" said Neil Roberts, head of marine underwriting at the Lloyd’s Market Association, which represents the interests of all underwriting businesses in London’s Lloyd’s insurance market. 
He added that it was “not commercially practical for insurers to track ships 24/7.”
Michele White, general counsel with oil tanker association INTERTANKO, said the U.S. advisory’s recommendations would be used as the new expected standard.
“This is asking private marine sector entitles effectively to do the enforcers’ job, whilst at the same time opening itself up to potential sanctions breach,” she said. 
Since the election of President Donald Trump, the United States has ratcheted up its pressure on adversaries like OPEC-members Iran and Venezuela by imposing tighter U.S. sanctions meant to choke off their economic lifelines, and it has promised stricter enforcement.
In one example of increasing U.S. attempts to micro-manage the sanctions, Brian Hook, the State Department’s top official on Iran, last year sent emails to the captain of an Iranian tanker that was suspected to be en route to Syria, asking him to steer the tanker to a country that would impound it on behalf of Washington.

The uncertainty around the maritime guidance heaps pressure on shipping companies that are already dealing with global restrictions due to the coronavirus. Some crews have been stuck at sea for weeks and companies are facing financial trouble, as demand to transport non-essential items has slowed.

1570,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>",Special Report: U.S. takes aim at the power behind Venezuela's Maduro - his first lady,"By Angus Berwick and Matt Spetalnick
CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four years ago, a bit player in the Venezuelan leadership was arrested in Colombia and extradited to the United States to face drug charges. He proved to be an important catch.
The man, Yazenky Lamas, worked as a bodyguard for the person widely considered the power behind President Nicolas Maduro's throne: first lady Cilia Flores. 
Now, with help from Lamas' testimony, the United States is preparing to charge Flores in coming months with crimes that could include drug trafficking and corruption, four people familiar with the investigation of the first lady told Reuters.
If Washington goes ahead with an indictment, these people said, the charges are likely to stem, at least in part, from a thwarted cocaine transaction that has already landed two of Flores' nephews in a Florida penitentiary.
Nicole Navas, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment on any possible charges against Flores. Flores and her office at the National Assembly didn't respond to questions for this article. 
Jorge Rodriguez, Venezuela's information minister, told Reuters in a text message that its questions about the possible U.S. indictment of Flores were ""nauseating, slanderous and offensive."" He didn't elaborate.
In a series of interviews with Reuters, the first Lamas has given since his arrest, the former bodyguard said Flores was aware of the coke-trafficking racket for which her two nephews were convicted by a U.S. court. Flores also used her privileged position, he said, to reward family members with prominent and well-paid positions in government, a claim of nepotism backed by others interviewed for this article. 
Speaking behind reinforced glass at the prison in Washington, D.C., where he is detained, Lamas told Reuters he is speaking out against Flores because he feels abandoned by the Maduro administration, still ensconced in power even though many of its central figures, including the president, have also been accused of crimes. ""I feel betrayed by them,"" he told Reuters. 
In late March, U.S. prosecutors indicted Maduro and over a dozen current and former Venezuelan officials on charges of narco-terrorism and drug smuggling. Maduro, now in his eighth year as Venezuela's president, for years sought to flood the U.S. with cocaine, prosecutors alleged, seeking to weaken American society and bolster his position and wealth.
Maduro's office didn't respond to requests for comment. In a televised speech after the indictments, he dismissed the charges against him and his colleagues as a politically motivated fabrication by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. ""You are a miserable person, Donald Trump,"" he said. 
The March indictments and the possible charges against Flores come amid a fresh campaign by Washington to increase pressure on Maduro. His enduring grip on power, some U.S. officials say, is a source of frustration for Trump.
Starting in 2017, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Socialist leader along with his wife and other members of the Maduro ""inner circle."" The swipe at Flores enraged Maduro. ""If you want to attack me, attack me,"" he said in a televised speech at the time. ""But don't mess with Cilia, don't mess with the family.""
Leveraging the economic fallout from the coronavirus crisis in Venezuela, the White House now hopes it can topple a leader who has weathered years of tightening economic sanctions, civil unrest and international isolation.
Washington has accused Maduro and his circle of looting Venezuela of billions of dollars. But it's unclear how much personal wealth he and Flores possess. Neither the president nor the first lady disclose income statements, tax returns or other documents pertaining to their personal finances. 
After U.S. prosecutors charged Maduro, the Justice Department said it had seized more than $1 billion in assets belonging to dozens of defendants connected to the case. The charges didn't detail those assets or specify who holds them. 
Flores is a longtime strategist and kingmaker in the ruling Socialist party. She first gained prominence as a lawmaker and confidante of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro's predecessor and mentor. She doesn't hold an official role in Maduro's cabinet.
Still, the probe against her underscores the vast influence she wields, particularly in helping Maduro outmaneuver rivals inside and outside Venezuela. 
In addition to Lamas, Reuters interviewed more than 20 people close to and familiar with Flores. They portray her as a shrewd and stealthy politician who now brandishes much of the power of her husband's office, demanding important briefings even before the president and personally negotiating with foreign emissaries, rival lawmakers and others.
When the opposition-led National Assembly tried to oust Maduro last year, Flores ordered security officials to deliver intelligence on the matter directly to her, according to Manuel Cristopher Figuera, the head of the country's intelligence agency then. 
Figuera was one of a handful of senior Venezuelan officials who at the time considered trying to negotiate an exit from power by Maduro with the United States. Figuera fled Venezuela when the effort failed. 
""Flores has always been behind the curtain, pulling the strings,"" Figuera told Reuters.
Flores has sought personal concessions in recent years in negotiations with the United States. 
According to five people familiar with the discussions, Flores instructed intermediaries to ask U.S. envoys for liberty for her jailed nephews. In exchange, these intermediaries said Venezuela would release six imprisoned executives of Citgo Petroleum Corp [PDVSAC.UL], the U.S. refining unit of Venezuela's state-run oil company. 
The executives, arrested by Venezuela in 2017 and charged with embezzlement, are widely considered by human rights activists and many in the business community to be political prisoners. 
That overture, reported here for the first time, failed.
But Washington knows Flores' clout. ""She is probably the most influential figure other than Maduro,"" Fernando Cutz, a senior White House adviser on Latin America during Trump's first year in office, told Reuters.
Earlier this year, according to people with knowledge of her efforts, Flores personally pressed crucial opposition lawmakers to support a Maduro ally to head the National Assembly, until then considered the last independent government institution in the country.
As Reuters reported in March, people familiar with lobbying of the lawmakers say ruling party operatives paid bribes to rivals who switched sides. Reuters couldn't determine whether Flores played any role in such payments.
Little is known about the first lady outside Venezuela, particularly the extent of her role in Maduro's government and her dealings that help it survive.
In their first interrogation of Lamas after his arrest in Colombia, U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents had one request, he recalled: ""Tell us about Cilia Flores,"" they said.
Michael D. Miller, a DEA spokesman, referred questions regarding the case to the Justice Department. 
Lamas, now 40, spent over a decade guarding Flores – first when she was a lawmaker and headed the National Assembly, later when she became first lady. After his extradition in 2017, Lamas agreed to a plea deal with U.S. prosecutors, according to a confidential Justice Department document reviewed by Reuters.
The agreement hasn't been previously reported.
In the plea deal, Lamas admitted to charges of drug trafficking and agreed to cooperate as a witness in investigations related to his case. The Colombian court order that approved his extradition, also reviewed by Reuters, said Lamas conspired to ship cocaine from Venezuela on U.S.-registered aircraft. 
Neither the Colombian court order nor the Justice Department document mention Flores, Maduro or others in the family. 
Because of the terms of the plea agreement – he said he is still awaiting sentencing and continues to testify in related investigations – Lamas declined to discuss specifics about the case against him. His lawyer in Washington, Carmen Hernandez, also declined to comment. 
The information he is providing investigators, including details on Flores' alleged role in the drug-trafficking plan by her nephews, is deemed credible by U.S. authorities, according to people familiar with the probes. Mike Vigil, a former DEA chief of international operations, told Reuters the DEA gives ""high significance"" to Lamas' testimony. 
""REVOLUTIONARY CALLING""
Flores was born October 15, 1956, in Tinaquillo, a small city in northwestern Venezuela. The youngest of six siblings, she lived in a mud-brick shack with a dirt floor, locals recall. Her father was a salesman, traveling to nearby towns to hawk sundry goods. While still a child, she and her family moved to Caracas, Venezuela's capital. 
A good pupil, Flores enrolled in a private university and studied criminal law. There, she met Maikel Moreno, a lifelong friend and a lawyer she would eventually help become Venezuela's chief justice. Moreno, a Maduro ally and a controversial figure in his own right, was one of those indicted by Washington last March. 
Moreno didn't respond to requests for comment; in a tweet, he denounced Washington for trying to ""hijack Venezuelan justice.""
As a student, Flores showed little interest in politics, according to people who knew her. She worked part-time at a police station, transcribing statements from witnesses, and married a longtime boyfriend, a police detective, with whom she had three boys. Upon earning her law degree, she worked for most of the next decade as a defense attorney for a private firm. 
In 1989, a fuel hike sparked riots that shook Caracas and awakened in Flores what she later described to state television as a ""revolutionary calling."" Hundreds of protesters, angry with corruption and widening inequality in the oil-producing country, died in clashes with security forces.
The event, known as the Caracazo – roughly, the big Caracas awakening – also inspired Chavez. As inflation, food shortages and other hardships worsened, Chavez, an Army lieutenant colonel, in 1992 staged a failed coup. He was arrested and jailed at a military barracks. 
Flores discovered a hero. She took to spraypainting Chavez's name around Caracas. ""I saw him in that moment as I would in the 20 years I spent near him,"" she later told state television. ""Authentic.""
She sent Chavez a letter offering to aid his defense. He accepted. Soon she was counseling Chavez and helping him answer letters from thousands of supporters. 
On one early visit, she met a Caracas union leader who was also advising Chavez: Maduro. In a televised speech years later, Maduro said he was drawn to her ""fiery character."" He began to wink at her, he said. 
As it happened, both were divorcing their spouses. They began dating and eventually became a couple. ""We shared the same dreams,"" Flores later told state television.
In 1994, Chavez received a presidential pardon. Flores and other advisors suggested he reinvent himself as a civilian and rally support with promises to empower the poor. By 1997, Flores was part of the campaign committee that would secure Chavez's election the next year as president. Maduro was elected as a legislator.
Not much of a gladhander herself, Flores nonetheless won a seat in the National Assembly in 2000. ""She's not a leader to hold a political rally,"" said Juan Barreto, a former Caracas mayor and media director for Chavez. ""But don't think she doesn't have a voice behind closed doors."" 
In the legislature, Flores earned a combative reputation.
When fellow Chavistas elected her leader of the National Assembly in 2007, she publicly referred to opposition lawmakers as ""sinners,"" suggesting the government had the moral high ground over its rivals. She switched off their microphones when she felt they grew longwinded. 
She also began using her position to help family members. 
Flores replaced about 50 support staff employed by the National Assembly with relatives and associates, the legislature's union said. Four siblings, two cousins and her ex-husband were among the hires, according to a list created by the union at the time of the shakeup and recently reviewed by Reuters. 
She named her brother, a policeman, head of assembly security. A nephew – a cousin of her two nephews now jailed in the United States – was appointed as the legislature's administrative director.
Reuters was unable to reach Flores' siblings, her ex-husband, or other relatives mentioned in this story, including her children and her nephews. 
It's unclear whether Flores was responsible for all the job changes the union complained about. But she has defiantly defended the appointments. ""I feel proud that they are my family,"" she told reporters at the time. ""I will defend them as workers in the assembly.""
When union leaders complained about nepotism, Flores summoned them to her office, recalls Jose Rivero, who attended some of those meetings and is now the union boss. ""Leave this issue alone,"" he says she told them. The union complied.
In 2012, Chavez named Flores attorney general. She held the post until March 2013, when Chavez died. Voters elected Maduro, by then vice president, to succeed him. Maduro and Flores, not officially married, tied the knot that July.
As first lady, Flores initially made her presence known in small ways. She ordered new furniture, curtains and a repainting of the Miraflores Palace, former aides said. Soon, she began playing a far more substantial role. 
In 2014, oil prices plunged, pulling Venezuela into depression. As discontent grew, Flores began to see threats within the government. In October, Maduro fired Miguel Rodriguez, his interior minister, and replaced him with a Flores ally.
Three people familiar with the decision said that Flores believed Rodriguez, a charismatic general popular with troops, was eclipsing Maduro. People close to Rodriguez said he had indeed aspired to higher office. 
After his ouster, Rodriguez formed a rival political party and publicly denounced Maduro. Intelligence agents later arrested Rodriguez on conspiracy charges, which he denied. He remains imprisoned. Juan Luis Sosa, an attorney for Rodriguez, declined to comment. 
""Cilia likes or hates you,"" one former Maduro aide says. ""She's not a dealmaker, she's a hardliner."" 
""CILIA KNEW EVERYTHING""
Lamas, the bodyguard, began working for Flores in her days as a legislator. From a post in the National Guard, he had been assigned to Chavez's security detail and later transferred to guard Flores, he said. A photo on Lamas' Twitter feed shows him, in a revolutionary red baseball cap, with Flores at a Socialist party event in 2010. 
With the job came proximity to the Flores family. 
The first lady entrusted him with driving her aging mother for medical checkups, Lamas said. He became close to Flores' sons – Walter, Yoswal and Yosser. ""I considered them my brothers,"" he said, recalling trips to shoot rifles and to opulent family properties on the Caribbean coast.
The brothers – known as ""Los Chamos,"" or ""the boys"" – have attracted media attention in Venezuela for their flashy lifestyles. 
Lamas said he saw them use government jets to travel abroad for fun. He also said he saw them several times late at night load military jeeps with boxes of U.S. dollars and transport the cash from their homes in Caracas to other locations for storage. 
Reuters couldn't independently verify that claim. 
Flores' sons haven't been indicted on any charges in the United States. They are on the U.S. Treasury's list of Venezuelans sanctioned for alleged corruption. The sanctions are meant to punish central figures in Maduro's government and block any assets they may have in the United States or within its jurisdiction. 
The family's reach by this point was manifest at Petroleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA [PDVSA.UL], the national oil company and the government's cash cow. In 2014, PDVSA appointed a new finance director: Carlos Malpica, the third nephew of Flores, who previously managed the support staff at the National Assembly. 
Malpica couldn't be reached for comment.
People close to Flores said Malpica had become the first lady's most trusted relative, especially when it came to financial matters. Documents compiled by U.S. investigators for their case against the other two Flores nephews provide insight into Malpica's influence. 
In August 2015, according to text messages gathered by the investigators and transcribed in documents used at the trial, Efrain Campo, one of the two nephews, received a text from an acquaintance. The message asked for Campo's help in recouping money allegedly owed by PDVSA to the acquaintance. The origins of the debt are unclear. 
Campo told the acquaintance to call Malpica. At PDVSA, Campo wrote, Malpica was the ""maximum authority there, since he's a Flores."" ""He will not do it for free,"" Campo added. 
PDVSA officials didn't respond to a request for comment. 
Malpica left his PDVSA post in 2016, giving no explanation for his departure, and has since kept a low profile. The U.S. Treasury Department would later include him on its list of Venezuelans sanctioned for alleged corruption. 
The jailed nephews, Campo and Franqui Flores, were close to the first lady. She helped raise both of them, two people who know the family told Reuters, and both men sometimes referred to her as ""mom."" 
Their November 2015 arrest, in a DEA sting in Haiti, made international headlines. In Venezuela, it earned the pair the nickname of the ""narcosobrinos,"" or ""narconephews."" 
The bust stemmed from a plan to sell $20 million worth of cocaine in the United States. The men, who pleaded not guilty, were convicted and sentenced to 18 years in prison. At the time, Flores told reporters that her nephews had been victims of a DEA ""kidnapping."" She has since said little publicly about the case. 
Among evidence investigators obtained, according to two people familiar with the case, are text messages between the nephews and Flores in which the trio allegedly discuss the cocaine shipment. 
The messages, which haven't been seen by Reuters, are among documentation compiled by prosecutors from the U.S. investigation of the nephews. The people familiar with the messages said they make clear that Flores helped coordinate logistics of the cocaine shipment with them.
The proceeds from the coke deal were meant to finance a Flores campaign for the National Assembly in 2015, according to the U.S. indictment against Maduro. The people familiar with the text messages said the nephews told Flores in the texts that the cocaine money would be for her campaign. 
Flores had briefly left the assembly when she became attorney general, and in 2015 she was reelected.
A recording made by a DEA informant captured the two nephews discussing the planned deal, according to a transcript submitted as evidence in their trial. 
In the recording, Campo says his ""mom"" is planning to run again for the assembly. People familiar with the probe believe ""mom,"" given the context of the discussion, meant Flores. 
Because of the burgeoning economic crisis and growing discontent at the time, Campo told the informant, ""there is a risk we could lose, so she's getting in there again."" 
""We need the money,"" Campo added, in a remark investigators interpreted as an allusion to the impact of economic sanctions on Socialist coffers. ""The Americans are hitting us hard, and the opposition is getting a lot of help.""
Before the two nephews were arrested, Lamas said he saw the two men on several occasions send cocaine shipments on planes from the presidential hangar outside Caracas. Reuters couldn't verify whether Flores knew of the alleged shipments.
At times, Lamas said, Flores would hear relatives discuss illicit activities, including her nephews talking about the drug transaction for which they were convicted. She would shake her head, he added, but not voice disapproval. 
""Cilia knew everything,"" Lamas says.
A GRAND BARGAIN
In Caracas, where political intrigue abounds, Flores has covered Maduro's flanks. Early last year, Juan Guaidó, head of the National Assembly, declared Maduro's 2018 re-election a fraud and said he was the rightful president of Venezuela. He urged the military to oust Maduro.
Flores quickly sought out signs of disloyalty within government ranks. Figuera, the former intelligence chief, told Reuters she ordered all documentation his agents collected about any additional dissent, including transcripts of phone taps of opposition politicians, sent directly to her. He complied.
In March 2019, a nationwide electricity blackout darkened Venezuela. As senior officials convened to discuss the problem, one minister showed Twitter posts by Luis Carlos Diaz, a prominent journalist, blaming the government. 
Flores said Diaz ""should be jailed,"" Figuera told Reuters. Maduro afterwards ordered him to arrest the journalist, Figuera added. 
As Diaz bicycled home on March 11, Figuera's agents arrested him, raided his home and seized computers and phones. After an uproar, Figuera said, Maduro called him the following day to order Diaz's release. Diaz, who was let out, remains free and is working as a journalist. He declined to comment. 
By April of last year, as most Western democracies backed Guaidó, Figuera and a handful of other senior officials began considering a negotiated exit for Maduro. They weighed the possibility of arranging safe passage for Maduro to Cuba or another allied country, Figuera said, in exchange for the easing of U.S. sanctions or other compromises by Washington. 
Among the officials who discussed the idea was Moreno, the chief justice and longtime Flores friend, according to Figuera and two other people familiar with the talks. As the group prepared to discuss the possibility with U.S. envoys, Moreno told Figuera they should press for further concessions, including the release of Flores' two nephews. 
The suggestion of seeking the nephews' freedom as part of a grand bargain with Washington followed attempts months earlier by Flores intermediaries to secure their release. 
According to the people familiar with those earlier discussions, Flores had intermediaries tell Washington early last year that Caracas, in exchange for the nephews, would free the six Citgo executives. Venezuela had charged the executives, who remain in prison awaiting trial, with embezzlement related to renegotiation of Citgo's debt with various lenders. 
Attorneys for the executives told Reuters the charges are baseless and that they were unaware of any effort to include their clients in any prisoner swap. Jesus Loreto, a Caracas lawyer representing Tomeu Vadell, one of the six, said such an offer ""would be yet more evidence of the arbitrary nature"" of the arrests. 
A senior Trump administration official told Reuters the swap offer was a ""non-starter."" 
""This isn't like a spy exchange with Russia,"" said another American familiar with the discussions. ""The nephews are convicted criminals.""
Reuters couldn't determine whether Flores was aware of Moreno's attempts to broker a departure for Maduro. Moreno ultimately backed out of the talks, according to Figuera and the two other people. The effort fizzled and Figuera defected. He now lives in Miami. Moreno remains chief justice of Venezuela.
Late last year, Flores spearheaded the effort to swing opposition legislators toward a Maduro ally as assembly head. On December 7, Flores and several Maduro aides met with a group of opposition lawmakers at the Fuerte Tiuna military base in Caracas, people with knowledge of the meeting said. There, Flores urged the lawmakers to back the Maduro candidate. 
Several lawmakers, including at least one who attended that meeting, later accepted payments of up to $150,000 to vote for Maduro's candidate, these people said. Reuters couldn't determine if Flores or Maduro were aware of the payments or whether they were discussed at the military base.
In January, Luis Parra, the government candidate, won the election for assembly chief. Now, Guaidó and Parra both claim to be running the assembly. Parra's office didn't respond to a request for comment. 
From his cell in Washington, Lamas reads about politics back home. He is studying English and working as a prison cook. He showed Reuters a certificate from the prison commending his ""outstanding contribution to the culinary department.""
Lamas now seethes against the family he once worked to protect. He is particularly aggrieved by a raid on his house in the days after his arrest, and a long interrogation of his wife, with whom he has two small children. A neighbor confirmed seeing the raid take place. 

""I was loyal to them,"" Lamas says. ""But they weren't loyal to me.""

1571,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>",French restaurants set empty tables in appeal for lockdown help,"By Geert De Clercq
PARIS (Reuters) - Restaurants, bars and hotels across France set empty tables and draped chef's aprons outside on Wednesday to protest against continuing lockdown restrictions and demand more state aid.
France ordered the shutdown of its hospitality industry on March 14 - three days before a nationwide coronavirus lockdown - and all establishments remain closed even after the government began relaxing some restrictions on May 11.
""It's sad not to have restaurants and bars open, they're part of our life and culture,"" Aurore Begue, co-owner of three restaurants, said at a protest meeting by the Alexandre III bridge over the Seine.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe will unveil measures to ease the lockdown on Thursday, though it is not known whether that will include reopening restaurants and cafes, particularly in 'red zone' virus hot spots like Paris. The government declined to comment ahead of his statement.
Restaurateurs acknowledged state aid had helped keep them afloat, notably a furlough scheme for some 1 million workers in their industry. But they say more is needed.
In a joint statement, 11 industry associations urged the government to drop social charges for 2020 and to extend furlough contributions for as long as social distancing rules prevent restaurants operating at full capacity. 
They also called on telecoms companies and utilities to reduce charges and want municipalities to provide more space in public areas to compensate for social distancing rules indoors.
""The Paris mayor has said restaurants would get more space on sidewalks, but this has not been put in practice yet,"" said Didier Desert, owner of the Ambassade d'Auvergne restaurant.
Operators also want landlords to drop rent charges for the lockdown period and to make rents proportionate with their turnover while lockdown restrictions last. 

""A closed restaurant has no expenses, but no income either,"" said Stephane Malchow, who runs the Art Deco Mollard brasserie near the capital's Saint Lazare train station. Opened in the late 19th century, it had never closed before, not even during World War Two.

1572,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 11:26AM ET</span>",Iran changes tack in Iraqi politics after mastermind's assassination,"By John Davison and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Two diplomats are quietly leading Iran's push to influence politics in Iraq, in a departure from the more blunt enforcement employed by Qassem Soleimani, a top commander slain in a U.S. air strike.
The consensual tactics in a country where Iran has wrestled with Washington for influence for nearly two decades was designed to break a political deadlock in Baghdad and hasten the departure of nearly 5,000 U.S. troops from Iraq, according to three senior Iranian officials involved in the process.
""Sometimes you need to step back, observe and plan based on realities on the ground,"" said a senior Iranian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
""We want the Americans to leave the region. If there is chaos in Iraq ... Americans will use it as an excuse to extend their stay.""
A U.S. State Department spokesman said Washington did not interfere in Iraqi politics.
Washington and Tehran came close to war earlier this year after rocket attacks on Iraqi bases hosting U.S. forces and U.S. air strikes against militia groups, including the one that killed Soleimani in January in Baghdad.
The powerful commander of the elite Quds force of Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) had steered political allies in Iraq, fought proxy wars across the Middle East and sought to impose his will on politics in Baghdad.
Since his death, Iranian officials have held substantive talks with Iraqi President Barham Salih for the first time in years aimed at building trust and pushed Iran's Shi'ite allies to compromise to end an impasse that prevented the formation of a stable government.
Some Iraqi sources cautioned, however, that the officials that come to Iraq still have links to the IRGC, years of experience of dealing with Iraqi matters and considerable sway over many political and paramilitary groups.
Iran's foreign ministry and its embassy in Baghdad were not available to comment on the contacts between its officials and Iraqi government and militia figures. Salih's office was not immediately available for comment on Iran's role in Iraq.
NEW PRIME MINISTER
The most tangible outcome of Iran's new approach was the appointment by parliament this month of new prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief viewed suspiciously by some groups allied to Iran for his friendly ties with the United States.
Kadhimi's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment for this article.
Iraq had suffered deep political turmoil after former Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, whom Iran supported, resigned in November in the face of mass protests against economic hardship and an allegedly corrupt ruling elite.
President Salih opposed the Iran-allied parties' preferred candidates to replace Abdul Mahdi as too divisive for Iraq's Sunni and Kurdish groups, a senior Iraqi official said.
In March, Ali Shamkhani, secretary of Iran's national security council, made an official visit, dining with Salih at the presidential palace.
""After Shamkhani's visit, things went more smoothly,"" another official said. ""Iran showed it was willing to work with some respect for Iraqi sovereignty, and to let Iraq choose its cabinet.""
Shamkhani's office and the spokesman for Iran's national security council were not available for comment. 
Kadhimi emerged as the frontrunner for premier, even though some Iran-backed militias continued to oppose him.
One militia publicly suggested he was involved in Soleimani's killing in Baghdad in his role as head of Iraq's intelligence service, which was set up by the Americans after the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq to topple Saddam Hussein.
The service said in a statement that the charge was ""baseless"".
At the Baghdad home of a Shi'ite leader, hours before a parliamentary vote on Kadhimi's cabinet, Iranian Foreign Ministry official Hassan Danaifar and current Iraq envoy Iraj Masjedi convinced party and paramilitary chiefs to support Kadhimi.
""The message from the Iranian delegation was clear - Kadhimi is the only choice left to maintain some stability in Iraq and save face,"" said a militia official close to Iraq's influential Badr Organisation who was briefed on the meeting.
Reuters was unable to reach Danaifar and Masjedi for comment.
RISKS REMAIN
A lawmaker from the Dawa party that dominated Iraq's government until 2018 said some of the groups in Iraq allied to Iran distrusted Kadhimi for his perceived closeness to Tehran's arch-enemy, Washington.
So even though Danaifar and Masjedi did enough to win the votes needed to install Kadhimi, some militia say they still feel suspicion and bitterness.
The Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group, which levelled the accusation over Soleimani, said there had been ""great pressure"" from Tehran to approve Kadhimi.
An official in Iran-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq, Jawad al-Tulaibawi, likened Kadhimi's accession to ""being forced to ... eat a carcass"".
Some Iraqi officials attribute Iran's more flexible stance to pressure from U.S. sanctions, the devastating spread of the coronavirus at home and the death of Soleimani.
When Kadhimi became prime minister, the United States granted Iraq a four-month extension to a sanctions waiver that allows Baghdad to import Iranian energy – an economic lifeline for Iran.
Washington has said that the concession was aimed at supporting the new government.

A Western diplomat said further that Tehran appeared to want to lower military tension with the United States ""for now"", but its expansionism across the wider region, where it has allies in Lebanon, Syria and Yemen, did not indicate an overall cooling of tensions.

MARACAY, Venezuela (Reuters) - The fourth cargo of a group of Iranian tankers reached the Caribbean Sea (NYSE:SE) on Wednesday as the receiving nation, Venezuela, began preparations to distribute the imported gasoline among desperate citizens, according to Refinitiv Eikon and a government official.
Iran is providing the South American country with up to 1.53 million barrels of gasoline and components to help it ease an acute scarcity that has forced Venezuelans to wait for hours in lines in front of stations.
Formally, Venezuela has the world's cheapest gasoline after over two decades of frozen prices at pump as part of a heavy fuel subsidy, but insufficient distribution has created a black market where a liter is offered at least $2.
While applauded by the Venezuelan government, the Iranian supply has been criticized by U.S. authorities as both OPEC-member countries are under sanctions. But the vessels have so far navigated undisturbed to their destinations.
As tanker Faxon was entering the Caribbean, the third vessel of the flotilla, the Petunia, was heading to El Palito refinery, where the first vessel, the Fortune, is docked since Monday. The second cargo, on vessel Forest, is discharging at the Cardon refinery since Tuesday, according to the Eikon data.
Diosdado Cabello, president of Venezuela's Constituent National Assembly, a parallel legislative body formed by President Nicolas Maduro's allies, distributed a message among governors late on Tuesday asking them for support for a new fuel supply system.
""We will increase distribution,"" he said to explain a plan drafted earlier by Maduro to secure and supervise supply to stations. People will also pay for gasoline in a new way, he suggested, without elaborating on details.
Iran's ambassador in Venezuela, Hojjatollah Soltani, denied in a TV interview on Tuesday that Venezuela will pay for the fuel with gold, as U.S. officials have said.
""There is no need for such a thing because there are other ways, such as bartering food, including coffee and cocoa,"" he told Iran's Arabic-Language al Alam TV.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 11:02AM ET</span>",UK tells EU: break the Brexit 'impasse' so we can do trade deal,"By Guy Faulconbridge, Kate Holton and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain told the European Union on Wednesday it needed to break a fundamental impasse to clinch a Brexit trade deal by the end of the year and said an agreement on fisheries might not be ready by July. 
The United Kingdom left the EU on Jan. 31 but the main terms of its membership remain in place during a transition period until the end of this year, allowing it time to negotiate a new free trade deal with the bloc.
Failure to reach a deal would convulse global trade just as the world aims to exit the coronavirus lockdown. But so far the talks have not gone well - and that was the only thing on which both sides agreed at the end of the last round.
Asked whether it was possible to reach a trade agreement in the short time remaining, British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said: ""My judgment is that it's perfectly possible to do so."" 
""The principal difficulty is not a difficulty of technical detail - the technical detail on both sides is well understood - it's a difference of political position, and I hope that we can break that impasse,"" Gove told the British parliament's committee on the future relationship with the EU.
The pound was last down 0.5% at $1.2271 GBP=D3 and shed 0.7% versus the euro to 89.68 pence (EURGBP=D3), a five-day low. UK chief Brexit negotiator David Frost said the current EU mandate was - in key areas - ""not a mandate that is likely to produce an agreement.""
""So if you are asking, do we think the EU needs to evolve its position to reach an agreement, yes we do,"" Frost said.
Asked about EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Frost said: ""It is the job of a good negotiator - and he is one - to assess reality and the genuine positions of the other side and genuine ability to move and if you don't possess reality in a cold way then you don't get agreement."" 
FISH 
Questioned about the impact of COVID-19 on negotiations, Frost said the outbreak had briefly paused talks and while they had since picked up the talks were behind by a week or two.
""The main difficulty we've had is... just the difficulty of mimicking by video what happens in a real meeting,"" Frost said, reflecting on the value of direct contact with the other side.
Frost said it was also proving difficult to reach a deal with the EU on fishing rules by July, as the sides aspired to do in a joint political declaration. 
""I'm beginning to think we might not make it by June 30, though we'll keep trying,"" he said. 
Frost was asked about how central Prime Minister Boris Johnson's senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, was for the talks. Cummings, a key figure in the 2016 referendum campaign to leave the EU, is now under pressure to resign over a 400 km (250 mile) road trip he made during the coronavirus lockdown.

""The Brexit policy is set by the prime minister,"" Frost said. ""I've never had an instruction on these negotiations from Mr Cummings.""

Ireland partially eased stay-at-home restrictions last week, in the first of five stages that constitute one of Europe's most conservative plans for rolling back a lockdown imposed in late March.
Restaurants are set to open in late June, with hairdressers and hotels to follow in July and pubs in August. But Varadkar's caretaker government is coming under pressure from business and some politicians to accelerate the timetable.
The government has said it is open to allowing parts of the economy to restart ahead of schedule if the virus remains under control but Varadkar said it would not be clear until next week if the first phase has proceeded smoothly.
""If we see that the numbers are still going very much in the right direction in the first week of June... then we can have some confidence in bringing forward some of the things in the later phases,"" he told parliament.
The number of new COVID-19 cases, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has stayed below 100 for 10 of the last 11 days, while Ireland reported no daily coronavirus-related deaths on Monday for the first time since March.
Health Minister Simon Harris also said the number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals fell to 218 from 278 on Tuesday.
Pubs, hotels and hairdressers have all pushed to be allowed to open sooner. Michael O'Leary, the boss of airline Ryanair, added his weight on Wednesday.

""It's ridiculously restrictive,"" he told the Newstalk radio station. ""There is no reason for Ireland being the most locked down country in the western world when we've been one of the best performers in dealing with COVID.""

1576,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",EU keeps defence fund alive with 8 billion euro proposal,"By Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission proposed on Wednesday spending 8 billion euros ($8.81 billion) of its next budget on a new European Union defence fund, keeping alive a Franco-German plan to deepen military cooperation despite the economic impact of COVID-19.
Unveiled as part of the EU executive's proposals for the bloc's seven-year budget from 2021, the fund would allow EU states' militaries to develop weapons, deploy together and streamline military systems in Europe.
Though the amount is much less than the 13 billion euros the Commission had initially proposed, the defence fund, if agreed by EU governments, could generate investment worth much more by enticing defence contractors to help finance deals through it. 
The fund would mark the biggest step forward in EU defence integration since the late 1990s, when Britain and France helped launch closer military cooperation in the bloc.
Following Britain's 2016 vote to quit the EU, France and Germany seized on European defence as a way to promote integration. They agreed a new pact with other EU governments.
While the United States, the world's biggest military power, has 30 weapons systems, the EU has 178. The bloc has 17 types of battle tank, compared to just one in the United States.
Military cooperation could also help advances in technology for pandemics, officials say, including in chemical and biological research such as hi-tech, resistant clothing.
The Commission proposed just 1.5 billion euros - much less than previously - for modernising Europe's disjointed transport systems to move troops east in the case of conflict with Russia.
The U.S.-led NATO alliance sees the ability to move quickly across Europe as vital to overcome border delays and rebuild bridges too weak for tanks.

During a search of several locations in northwestern Bosnia, police seized mobile phones, laptops and other items that could serve as evidence in criminal proceedings, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) said.
It gave no further details on the fate of the 45 migrants.
The detainees are suspected of transporting, hiding and smuggling migrants mostly from Turkey via Bosnia into EU member Croatia and onwards to Italy, Bosnia's state prosecutor's office said, calling the arrests the region's most comprehensive operation this year. 
The so-called Balkan route for migrants trying to reach the EU via Turkey, Greece and former Yugoslav countries was shut down in 2016 when Turkey agreed to stop the flow in return for European aid and a promise of visa-free travel for its citizens.
But Bosnia, which has a 1,000 km (620 miles) border with Croatia, has become an alternative migrant route starting from Turkey via Greece and Albania through Montenegro, as well as for those stuck in Serbia.

Kabuga has been indicted by U.N. prosecutors for genocide and incitement to commit genocide, among other charges. He is accused of bankrolling and arming the ethnic Hutu militias which killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus over 100 days in 1994.
Asked if he understood the charges, Kabuga told the court through an interpreter: ""All of this is lies. I have not killed any Tutsis. I was working with them.""
Kabuga was arrested in a Paris suburb on May 16. His lawyers told the court he should be released under court supervision because of his age and ill-health, and that the results of a DNA test used to identify him should be annulled as he had not given consent. 
The court's three judges, who are due to decide whether to transfer Kabuga to the international tribunal based in The Hague and Arusha, Tanzania.
Kabuga was too elderly and sick to be transferred and should be tried in France, his lawyers said.
""This court is just saying 'go and get judged elsewhere but not here'. It wants to hand him over him without consideration for his age and health, which could have irreversible consequences,"" defence lawyer Laurent Bayon told the court.

Raphaël Yanyi was dead when he arrived at hospital in the early hours of Wednesday, said Sylvano Kasongo, Kinshasa police chief.
""It wasn't a death by assassination, he had policemen protecting him,"" Kasongo told Reuters, adding that the judge had suffered a heart attack at home.
A member of Yanyi's family said he had complained of discomfort on Tuesday evening, but was not ill.
On Monday, Yanyi presided over the second day of a trial of Vital Kamerhe, once a close strategic ally of President Felix Tshisekedi, who has become the most powerful politician to face graft charges in Congo. He adjourned the trial until June 3.
Kamerhe has denied all wrongdoing in relation to the alleged embezzlement of more than $50 million of public funds. If convicted, he could face up to 20 years in prison.
Kamerhe's supporters say the charges are politically motivated, aimed at blocking his chances of challenging Tshisekedi at the next elections in 2023.

Germany has stepped up efforts to counter far-right groups in recent months, especially after a gunman in the city of Halle killed two people outside a synagogue in October.
""The biggest threat in our country comes from the right. This is a reality...We must remain alert and tackle it,"" said Seehofer, a Bavarian conservative.
Authorities registered 2,032 crimes with an anti-Semitic background, up 13% from 2018, and Seehofer said more than 90% of those were perpetrated by right-wing radicals, said Seehofer. 
Germany's Jewish community expressed shock.
""The attack in Halle last year was a signal,"" said Josef Schuster, President of the Central Council of Jews, urging politicians and society do more to fight anti-Semitism which, he said, had become commonplace in Germany.
""Especially on the Internet, unrestrained hatred hits us. But also on the streets and in schools the rejection of Jews is a massive problem,"" he said.
Earlier this month, a Jewish leader warned that many young people in the land responsible for the Holocaust had failed to learn the lessons of history. 
Overall, the number of politically motivated crimes rose by 14% last year to 41,177, more than half of which were committed by far-right radicals. Crimes, mostly vandalism, committed by left-wing militants jumped by 23%, said Seehofer. 
There have been several high profile attacks in the last year. In February a racist gunman killed nine migrants near Frankfurt before killing his mother and himself. In June 2019, pro-migrant politician Walter Luebcke was found shot dead at close range at his home in Hesse state. A far-right radical confessed to the crime, though later retracted his statement.
Police have also warned that thousands of protesters at rallies opposing lockdown measures against the coronavirus are in large part driven by far-right sympathisers.

ABUJA (Reuters) - The Nigerian military are unlawfully detaining boys and men at a rehabilitation centre for alleged members of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, Amnesty International said in a report released on Wednesday.
In the latest allegations of rights abuses since Boko Haram began its insurgency in Nigeria's northeast, Amnesty criticised Operation Safe Corridor, a programme that receives financial and technical support from the European Union, Britain, the United States and the U.N. International Organization for Migration. 
Nigeria's military did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing in response to such accusations during a decade of conflict. 
""For almost everyone held (at Safe Corridor) to date, it amounts to unlawful detention,"" Amnesty said of the programme which is based in Gombe state and aims at reintegrating former militants into their communities.
""Many people there are not former fighters who committed crimes, much less were charged or convicted of any crime,"" it said in a report that also listed alleged rights abuses by Boko Haram and criticised conditions at other military detention centres. 
Amnesty said Safe Corridor ""includes positive elements"", including adult education and psychosocial counselling described favourably by people formerly held there.
But at least seven men, including two who were boys when in Boko Haram territory, have died in military custody at Safe Corridor between July 2017 and July 2019, Amnesty said. 
It said the rehabilitation, meant to last six months, can go on for over three times longer.
Amnesty said conditions at Safe Corridor were ""significantly better than at other military-run detention facilities,"" where the report said security forces beat and torture children and adults they suspect of being Boko Haram members.
The report said Boko Haram continues to abduct children to become fighters and child brides, and that some are raped.

Lombardy, Italy's richest and most populous region and the motor of its economy, is one of the worst affected areas of the world by the coronavirus, accounting for around half of the country's more than 32,000 dead.
The regional government, controlled by opposition leader Matteo Salvini's anti-immigrant League party, has seen approval ratings plunge amid angry attacks on its response and on health sector reforms by previous League governments that many say left the region badly prepared to face the epidemic.
Regional governor Attilio Fontana, a close Salvini ally, gave no details of the security escort but said the decision to assign one had not been at his request but had been decided by the ""relevant authorities"".
""I'm sorry for the sake of my family who have been a bit worried,"" he said in a statement. ""Over recent days, there's been too much venom.""
""Unfortunately, it's the result of lies told by certain political forces which have poisoned the atmosphere and stirred up this dangerous climate of hatred.""
The decision to assign the escort, as Italy has begun to ease lockdown restrictions imposed almost three months ago, highlighted widespread public anger at the handling of both the health crisis and the lockdown measures.
Authorities said Education Minister Lucia Azzolina and Deputy Health Minister Pierpaolo Sileri, had also been assigned security details in recent days.
""We've been collecting dozens and dozens of threats on social media. There are so many of them and they're part of this climate of hatred,"" Fontana's lawyer Jacopo Pensa was quoted as saying by business daily Il Sole 24 Ore.

As people have begun to emerge from lockdown, authorities have expressed exasperation at widespread flouting of social distancing rules in major centres including Milan, the main city of Lombardy.

""We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute,"" Trump said in a Twitter post.
The standoff was triggered by India’s construction of roads and air strips in the region as it competes with China's spreading Belt and Road initiative, involving infrastructure development and investment in dozens of countries, Indian observers said on Tuesday.
Both were digging defences and Chinese trucks have been moving equipment into the area, the officials said, raising concerns about an extended standoff.
The Republican president in January offered to ""help"" in another Himalayan trouble spot, the disputed region of Kashmir that is at the center of a decades-long quarrel between India and Pakistan.
This was after a similar offer was rejected in 2019 by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said last July he never asked Trump to help mediate over Kashmir.
Trump had told reporters at the time that Modi had asked him to be a mediator on Kashmir. He made the comment just before holding talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who welcomed the U.S. effort to intercede.

But the U.S. offer triggered a political storm in India, which has long bristled at any suggestion of third-party involvement in tackling Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region that it considers an integral part of the country.

NAIROBI(Reuters) - Kenya's government is facing growing criticism over quarantine centres it set up to curb the spread of the coronavirus, with witnesses saying some are squalid and expose residents to the risk of catching COVID-19.
Since mid-March, the government has enforced a mandatory 14-day quarantine period for anyone who flies into the country or has direct contact with someone infected and lives in an area where self-isolation is not allowed.
Those who can pay spend the quarantine in an upmarket hotel. Others are placed in government-run facilities established in buildings such as schools or universities.
Demonstrations have broken out in some centres, break-outs have been reported, and the government faces two lawsuits over alleged mistreatment which it has yet to respond to.
Reuters interviewed 12 people who have spent time in quarantine in the government-run centres. Two said conditions were satisfactory. The other 10, who asked not to be identified to avoid stigma, described filthy conditions with bedbugs, overflowing toilets and bad food.
Reuters sought comment from the facilities where these people were housed, but phone and text messages sent over several weeks received no responses. Health Ministry spokeswoman Judy Sirima declined comment. 
One woman told Reuters she was quarantined at Nairobi's Kenya Medical Training Center for two weeks and tested negative for the coronavirus.
Then others at the facility, where people were crowded together at mealtimes, tested positive. She was kept another week, and then tested positive too. 
""I got it from the quarantine,"" she said. ""We were sharing washrooms; we were sharing everything.""
Reuters could not verify where she contracted the virus.
A woman in quarantine at the Karen Cooperative Retreat and Conference Center said she and others received no protective gear.
""We are not given masks; no gloves, no sanitizer,"" she said. 
Neither facility responded to requests for comment.
PUBLIC TESTING
Kenya has reported 1,348 cases and 52 deaths from COVID-19, but large-scale public testing began in the country of 47 million only this month because of shortages of materials. 
On Sunday, Kenya's Health Ministry tweeted that many people being tested were giving false contact information. 
Robert Alai, a popular blogger, quickly offered an explanation for their reluctance.
""Because you treat those who test positive like pigs,"" he tweeted.
Alai has been sharing pictures of grim quarantine conditions which he says he received from people in government-run facilities. Reuters reached three by telephone and they confirmed the conditions.
Dr Mark Nanyingi, an infectious disease epidemiologist with the University of Nairobi, said the threat of having family quarantined could deter sick people from coming forward.
""Public health messaging shouldn’t be threatening,"" he said. ""If we militarise this, we won’t have as much success."" 
Facing criticism over the quarantine centres, Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said on May 6 they would be free. 
""Testing, quarantine and isolation is free. Come out and be tested,"" the ministry tweeted on Tuesday. 
Until this month, the minimum rate for quarantine was 2,000 Kenyan shillings ($20) per night. Some centres had refused to release people who did not pay their bills.
Kagwe has also said people who break a dawn-to-dusk curfew will no longer be put in quarantine.
A Senate report last month said hundreds of curfew breakers had been quarantined alongside people who had been exposed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease the coronavirus can cause.

One woman, Caroline Akumu, told Reuters she was held in a quarantine centre where she and her two-month-old son slept on a concrete floor after she was accused of breaking curfew and refused to pay 20,000 shillings to be released. She was freed only after a public uproar.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Some private jet companies have seen a rise in demand from wealthy Russians who want to spend time in the West during the coronavirus crisis but who were unable to take commercial flights amid tight restrictions by airlines and governments.
Passengers are heading for countries such as Britain and Cyprus where they own property, have residency rights, sometimes thanks to holding dual nationality, or have close relatives, according to industry sources.
They are paying from 16,000-25,000 euros per flight, a fee that can cover up to 13 passengers, the sources added.
""People are tired of lockdown living ... they are looking for ways to get out,"" said Aleksandr Osit, owner of the JETVIP broker company which says it has registered a surge in one-way Europe-bound flights in the last two months.
The use of private aircraft when most airlines stopped flying is not illegal and not unique to Russia, with reports of Chinese flying home from the United States and Americans landing in elite domestic vacation spots.
In March, there were 250 private jet round flights between Moscow and Europe, flight tracking data from 80 planes registered with Russian and European charter firms show, though the data did not specify how many people were on board each.
Flights continued in April, albeit falling to 61 round trips that month despite Russia suspending regular and commercial charter flights to and from Russia with some exceptions and locking down Moscow, the epidemic's epicentre.
The frequency of such flights rose to 107 between May 1-26.
Three aviation sources said the number of Russians flying into the country in March outweighed those leaving at a time when Russia had a relatively low coronavirus count and European countries were reporting far greater numbers.
That trend reversed over time, the three sources added, and more people are leaving Russia, which now has the third highest number of coronavirus cases in the world, though with a relatively low official mortality rate.
Jet Partners, which offers private jet flights, said it was experiencing an increase in requests for destinations in France, Spain, Cyprus, Britain and other European countries.
""People believe that it is safer for them to be at their private residences abroad,"" said Margarita Lomakina, the company's commercial director.
Stanislav Kruglov, an account manager with Vip Group Aero, said he had received dozens of requests from mid-April for flights to Vienna, Larnaca and Riga from individuals and families with children.
The Sirius Aero private jet airline said prices for flights were 20-30 percent lower in April and May compared to the same period last year.

Rosaviatsia, Russia's federal aviation industry, declined to comment on the patterns in private jet use.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya is rolling out voluntary public testing for the novel coronavirus in its biggest slum, where some residents say being declared virus-free boosts their chances of getting a job. 
""Nowadays when you look for work, they first ask to see your results first,"" Shadrack Jumba, a resident of Kibera, located in Nairobi's southwest, told Reuters as health workers took samples from people on Tuesday.
""They ask you to go back and get tested. If your results come back negative, you are fine, but with no test results, it’s a bit difficult to get employed."" 
Kibera is one of Africa's biggest urban slums, home to an estimated half million people, who mostly live in tin-roofed shacks tightly packed together, conditions health authorities say make it hard to slow the spread of infection.
The effort to roll out mass testing there shows how African countries, so far spared the worst of the coronavirus crisis, are trying to head off an epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people on other continents. 
Many Kibera residents are casual labourers, cleaners, market sellers and motorbike taxi drivers, who have lost work due to the COVID-19-linked restrictions in Kenya. Some are reluctant to be tested, fearing neighbours will shun them.
""People are fearful of ...the stigma of being found positive and you are labelled by the rest of the community,"" said Ahmed Kalebi, consultant pathologist and chief executive officer of Lancet Group of Laboratories, a pathology laboratory active in 11 other African countries.
Kenya has so far recorded 1,348 cases of COVID-19 and 52 deaths, far fewer than in comparably-sized countries in Europe, Asia or the Americas. In recent days, there has been an increase in cases in Kibera, and the Kenyan government has weighed plans to lock down the area, Kenyan daily The Standard reported.

Kalebi said Kenya's low case load so far ""suggests to me we have actually kind of dodged a bullet."" But health authorities have said they expect the number of cases to peak in September.

Tourism accounts for about 20% of the Greek economy and the government sees the sector as a major engine of its recovery from a lockdown that has brought business to a virtual standstill.
""There will be some 20-25 countries whose nationals will be allowed to come,"" a government source said, adding that the list would include Cyprus, Israel and countries in central Europe and the Balkans. The full list would be announced this week.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has said Germans will be allowed to visit Greece from June 15. He has also said that international flights to the northern city of Thessaloniki would resume on June 15, sooner than an initial planned date of July 1.
Greece currently allows citizens from all EU countries except Italy, Spain and the Netherlands to fly into Athens but they are then subject to a 14-day confinement. Visitors from Britain and other non-EU countries are also currently barred from entering Greece.
Italy, Spain and Britain have all seen high rates of infection from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus. Greece has weathered the coronavirus crisis relatively well, with just 2,892 confirmed cases and 173 deaths.
Another government source said health experts were discussing whether travellers would need to have been tested for COVID-19 before visiting Greece and whether insurance coverage for such infections should be recommended.
The government has said it plans to restore international flights to Greece's islands from July 1 but will refuse entry to citizens from countries with high infection rates until July 15.

WASHINGTON/MUMBAI (Reuters) - U.S. troop strength in Afghanistan is down to nearly 8,600, well ahead of a schedule agreed with Taliban militants in late February, in part because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus, U.S. and NATO officials said. 
A key provision of the Feb. 29 agreement between the Taliban and the United States, to which the Afghan government was not a party, involved a U.S. commitment to reduce its military footprint in Afghanistan from about 13,000 to 8,600 by mid-July and, conditions permitting, to zero by May 2021.
Two senior sources in Kabul said the 8,600 target was likely to be achieved by early June. 
Two U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that the United States was close to 8,600 troops and could reach that number in coming days.
""Due to COVID-19 concerns, we are moving towards that planned drawdown faster than anticipated,"" one of the officials said.
The other U.S. official said the United States had focused on quickly removing non-essential personnel and those considered to be at high risk from the virus.
All four sources asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
U.S. forces are in Afghanistan to conduct counter-insurgency operations. A few thousand U.S. soldiers work with troops from 37 NATO partner countries to train, advise and assist Afghan forces.
NATO's mission in the country totalled 16,551 troops in February, according official data available on its website.
On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump there were ""7,000-some-odd"" U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan but officials clarified that number was slightly over 8,600 troops. 
Trump renewed his desire for a full military withdrawal from Afghanistan but added that he had not set a target date, amid speculation he might make ending America's longest war part of his re-election campaign.
NATO DILEMMA
The Taliban, who ruled Afghanistan with an iron fist from 1996 before being ousted by U.S.-led troops in 2001, have sought to topple the Western-backed government in Kabul and reimpose Islamic rule. They dismiss the Kabul government as a puppet of the United States.
The faster-than-expected withdrawal has put NATO in a dilemma as to whether it should consider swiftly sending back some non-U.S. troops from Afghanistan as well, two NATO sources said.
""The drawdown by the U.S. was expected to be done in 135 days but it's clear that they have almost completed the process in just about 90 days,"" said a senior Western official in Kabul on condition of anonymity.
The official said that some other NATO soldiers would be withdrawn before schedule.
""All allies have to maintain a fine balance on troop withdrawal as we cannot forget the fact that the war in Afghanistan is far from over,"" he said.
The Taliban have recently increased attacks in a number of provinces, despite the Afghan government releasing prisoners as per the U.S.-Taliban agreement signed in Doha.
According to data from Afghan and Western sources seen by Reuters, the Taliban have mounted more than 4,500 attacks since signing the deal.
In a statement, the Pentagon said it expected to be at 8,600 troops within 135 days of signing the agreement, but declined to say how many troops were currently in Afghanistan. 
""We are not providing updates on current troop levels primarily due to operational security concerns associated with the drawdown,"" Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Campbell said.

Officials are now looking at the pace of the drawdown beyond 8,600.

He drained it after the global pandemic closed borders, bringing West Africa's tourism industry to a standstill in mid-March.
The Sine-Saloum region has escaped the worst of the epidemic that has so far infected more than 3,100 across the country. But stringent travel restrictions have hurt those who live off what they earn through hospitality, selling handicrafts, or ferrying visitors through the delta's bird-rich mangrove forests.
""It makes you want to cry a little bit,"" Lopez said, surveying the deserted complex of the hotel he runs, Les Cordons Bleus.
He is able to keep paying his 15 employees a reduced wage thanks to an emergency loan from the government to prop up an industry that accounted for around 4% of GDP in 2017. But others are not so lucky. 
Across the silent lagoon, on Mar Lodj island, women who once earned up to $17 per day selling woven baskets and carved souvenirs are struggling to support their families.
""This is all we had,"" said Amy Diouf, 50, dusting the unsold wares in the courtyard of her reed-thatched home.
Even if international visitors are allowed to return soon, the two-month hiatus means tourist numbers this year will be far below the 1.7 million who holidayed in Senegal in 2019.
Some locals, like 32-year-old guide Pierre Diouf, hope they can make up the shortfall by attracting more domestic visitors whenever a ban on travel between regions is lifted.
He used to organise camping and bird-watching trips through the UNESCO-listed waterways, but now earns a quarter of what he did, catching fish from his painted boat ""The Saloum Adventurers"".

ROME (Reuters) - Steve Bannon, the former adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, has won a battle with Italy's culture ministry to set up a right-wing Catholic political academy in Italy.
A regional court ruled for the Dignitatis Humanae Institute think-tank, which Bannon backs, against a previous decision that blocked the school starting up in an 800-year-old monastery south of Rome.
""We stood by the monastery, the community and Italy during this pandemic when it would have been easy to walk way,"" Bannon said on Wednesday in a statement issued through the institute’s founder, Benjamin Harnwell, in response to the court's ruling on Tuesday.
Bannon, a Catholic, was helping to craft the curriculum for a leadership course aimed at right-wing Catholic activists at the Academy for the Judeo-Christian West in the town of Trisulti. 
Many residents opposed the school and last year, Italy’s Culture Ministry, which owns the mountaintop property, withdrew a 19-year lease, citing violations of contractual obligations.
The institute appealed, saying the move was politically motivated.
Harnwell said he hoped to resume restoration plans and that registration would begin for an on-line program taught from the United States.
But while they still enjoy support from Italian right-wing politicians such as former interior minister Matteo Salvini, Bannon and Harnwell have lost key supporters within the Church.
Last year, American Cardinal Raymond Burke, who for years strongly backed Bannon and was a honorary president of the institute, yanked his support after Bannon said he wanted to make a film from a book alleging widespread homosexuality in Vatican.
Burke's withdrawal was a major setback for Bannon because the cardinal, one of Pope Francis’s fiercest critics, is a point of reference for Catholic conservatives worldwide.

Cardinal Renato Martino, an Italian, also stepped down as honorary president last year.

LONDON (Reuters) - A British minister said on Wednesday that it was time to ""move on"" after Prime Minister Boris Johnson's senior adviser provoked outrage and widespread scorn by making a 400 km (250 mile) road trip during the coronavirus lockdown.
Dominic Cummings has refused to quit after it was revealed that he had driven from London to northern England in March with his 4-year-old son and his wife, who was sick at the time, to be close to relatives. Johnson has backed his adviser.
Opinion polls show that faith in Johnson has tumbled since the Cummings story broke on Friday in The Mirror and The Guardian newspapers, with some people openly lampooning both Johnson and Cummings on social media.
Opposition parties and some Conservative lawmakers have also demanded that Cummings, the man behind the successful 2016 Brexit campaign and Johnson's landslide 2019 election victory, should resign. He has refused to apologise.
""Now I think is the time for us all to move on,"" Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick told the BBC, adding that the people wanted the government to be speaking about issues other than Cummings. 
""That's not to say this isn't an important issue or that people don't care a great deal about it but I think there is a lot more that we need to focus on now, like the virus and the economy.""
As nearly 70 million British citizens endured the most stringent lockdown in peacetime history, the news that the second most powerful man in the British government had taken such a long road journey was greeted with dismay by many.
The Daily Star newspaper, a tabloid which delights in reporting scandal and the sexual antics of celebrities, even offered reader a cut out Cummings mask.
""FREE Do whatever the hell you want and sod everybody else mask,"" the Star said on its front page. ""Wear this handy Dom face covering and you'll get away with murder.""
YouGov found 71% of people believed Cummings had broken lockdown rules and 59% thought he should resign.
LOCKDOWN OVER? 
Just a few days before Cummings' journey, Johnson imposed a lockdown in the United Kingdom and asked people to stay at home. He said on March 23 that people ""should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home"".
Cummings said he had acted reasonably and not broken the lockdown rules - a position supported by Johnson and senior ministers who have in recent days contorted themselves trying to explain if the lockdown is still is in force and, if so, whom it applies to. He has refused to apologise. 
There was confusion about the fines - of a minimum of 60 pounds ($74) - imposed by police on thousands of ordinary people for breaking lockdown rules. 
Jenrick said there would be no official review of fines imposed on ordinary people and that it was for the police to decide.

""There isn't going to be a formal review, this is a matter for the police, the police follow the law and the guidelines,"" he said. ($1 = 0.8133 pounds)

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Wednesday pledged to draw up a plan to give humanitarian relief to people involved in pro-democracy protests in Taiwan's most concrete intervention since a renewal of unrest in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.
China's proposed new security legislation for the former British colony has prompted protests in Hong Kong and condemnation from Western governments over perceived threats to freedoms.
Hong Kong's demonstrators have won widespread sympathy in democratic Taiwan, which China considers as its territory to be taken by force, if necessary. Taiwan said it's already an independent country and has shown no interest in being ruled by China.
""We will propose an action plan of humanitarian relief for friends from Hong Kong,"" Tsai told reporters in Taipei. ""We will continue to support Hong Kong people's determination to strive for democracy and freedom.""
She did not give full details or timing, but said Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council, responsible for Taiwan's ties with China, will lead the initiative, while a government task force will coordinate the budget needed and resources, including accommodation and employment.
Earlier this week, Tsai said Taiwan may revoke the special status it extends to Hong Kong in a warning to Beijing.
Beijing has yet to respond to the comments from Tsai, whom the Chinese government suspects of pushing for Taiwan's formal independence. 
Addressing concerns that the revocation could make it harder for Hong Kongers to visit and invest in Taiwan, Tsai said her government will give ""necessary help for them to stay, live and work in Taiwan"". 
Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to protesters seeking asylum, but its laws promise to help Hong Kongers whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.

Tsai said the number of immigrants from Hong Kong had jumped in the last year and her government expects the trend to continue.

1600,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 04:40AM ET</span>","Stranded overseas, Chinese vent anger on aviation regulator","BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese citizens, stranded abroad after the coronavirus pandemic caused thousands of flight cancellations, are taking their anger out on China's aviation regulator.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has been flooded with tens of thousands of social media comments criticising it and the Chinese government for the small number of flight options to bring home the people stranded overseas.
Since March, the CAAC has drastically reduced the number of international flights due to concerns about infections brought in by arriving passengers. Many foreign airlines are currently barred from flying China routes and mainland carriers can fly just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any country. 
Besides leaving those abroad with fewer options if they want to return, the scarcity has created a frenzied market for scalpers who are charging exorbitant rates for tickets. While Beijing has already arranged many repatriation charter flights, it has fuelled complaints that they are far from enough. 
An estimated 1.42 million Chinese students were overseas as of early April, the foreign ministry has said. 
""I brought a Chinese national flag with me when I left the country, thinking the motherland would always have my back,"" said Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) user Yangrouchuanchuan, describing herself as a Chinese student in New York, on the social media platform. She tagged the account of caacnews.com.cn, a CAAC affiliated website.
""But now I cannot even get a ticket home. Children from ordinary families cannot afford charter fights, cannot afford a flight ticket,"" she said. 
Cui Yongyuan, a celebrity blogger and former state television host, said in a video posted on YouTube: ""Have a think, CAAC. What have you been doing everyday? Just freeloading?"" 
CAAC did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment. Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China has arranged charter flights to repatriate Chinese citizens, and will continue to work with Chinese embassies to protect and help its people abroad. 
State media quoted the vice head of CAAC as saying it may consider increasing international flights as long as coronavirus risks are under control. [nB9N2CW04B]
The CAAC also did not respond to the comments left on its social media accounts but stopped allowing people to post comments on one of them. 
Duan Meifang, 61, told Reuters she arrived in Edinburgh in October to visit her daughter but has not been able to return to China. She said she bought tickets seven times, only for the flights to be cancelled, and has yet to receive refunds worth a total of 138,000 yuan ($19,275).

""The road back home is nowhere in sight,"" Duan said.

The assault took place after the expiry of a one-month ceasefire announced on April 24 by the Saudi-led coalition that is battling the Iran-aligned movement and which was prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.
There was no immediate claim from the Houthis, who despite the truce have continued their advance on Marib city, leading the coalition to launch air strikes in response.
The sources said Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Sagheer bin Aziz survived Tuesday's attack. One of his sons and a nephew, both officers, were killed along with five others, the sources said. Another of his sons confirmed this on Twitter.
The United Nations has been trying to hold virtual talks between the warring parties to forge a permanent ceasefire, agree a coordinated coronavirus response and restart peace talks stalled since late 2018.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Friday that the novel coronavirus is spreading throughout the country, which has limited testing capabilities and whose malnourished population has among the world's lowest immunity levels to disease.
Yemen has been divided between the Saudi-backed government in the south and the Houthi movement based in the north since the group ousted the government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene a few months later.
The government has reported 249 infections with 48 deaths from the virus while the Houthis, who hold most large population centres, announced four cases with one death, all in Sanaa. 
OCHA has said actual numbers are much higher and that Yemen's war-ravaged health system has in effect collapsed.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian police have dropped their investigation of a News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) journalist over the disclosure of a national security document in 2018, citing a lack of evidence.
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) last June raided the home of a News Corp editor, Annika Smethurst, and a day later raided the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC), both over allegations they had published classified material.
The raids sparked an outcry about the need for media freedom to scrutinise national security and defence issues.
AFP Deputy Commissioner Ian McCartney said police had ""reviewed all available material and determined there is insufficient evidence to progress the investigation in relation to the unauthorised disclosure of the classified document"" by Smethurst.
Smethurst's suspected source for the information would not be prosecuted either, McCartney said.
""No one will be prosecuted in relation to this unauthorised disclosure,"" McCartney told reporters.
Police were criticised over the raid, which included officers digging through Smethurst's clothes drawers, according to media reports. 
The raid came after a Sunday Telegraph article in 2018 that said intelligence agencies wanted to carry out surveillance by getting access to people's emails, bank accounts and text messages.
Australia's highest court in April ruled, based on a technicality, that the AFP warrant to search Smethurst's home was invalid, but did not order police to destroy the seized material.
News Corp said it was unacceptable that a High Court decision was needed for Smethurst's ordeal of living with the threat of jail to be ended.
""Common sense has prevailed, but at a price,"" New Corp Australasia chairman Michael Miller said in a statement.
The journalists' trade union welcomed the police decision but warned that laws remained in place that could lead to any Australian journalist facing the same treatment.
Police were still investigating the ABC, McCartney said.

Jessica O’Connor and Dion Reynolds, both 23, hiked into Kahurangi National Park in the northwest of New Zealand's South Island on May 9, and were expected to return in five days. They were reported missing by a friend on May 18.
A search helicopter located the pair soon after noon on Wednesday, and the were taken to be medically assessed at a hospital, police said. 
""This is a fantastic outcome and one that we were all hoping for, although we were becoming increasingly concerned as the days progressed,"" said Nelson Bays Area Commander Paul Borrell.
Police said initial indications were that the pair became lost in fog during the first few days of their hike. They decided to stay put and had run out of food by the time they were found.
At 452,002 hectares, Kahurangi National Park is New Zealand's second largest national park. It was also one of the locations for the filming of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

1606,By Reuters,"<span>May 27, 2020 12:33AM ET</span>",Four Minneapolis policemen fired after death of unarmed black man,"By Eric Miller
MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - Four Minneapolis police officers were fired on Tuesday over the death of an unarmed black man seen in a video lying face down in the street, gasping for air and groaning, ""I can't breathe,"" while a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes.
Hours after the officers' dismissals were announced, thousands of protesters filled the streets around the scene of Monday evening's deadly incident in a boisterous but peaceful rally. Many in the crowd wore facial coverings to protect against spread of the coronavirus.
But the gathering took an unruly turn around dusk as police in riot gear fired tear gas and non-lethal bean-bag rounds into the crowds while protesters hurled water bottles and other projectiles, the Minneapolis Star-Tribune reported.
Local news footage showed some demonstrators vandalizing the outside of a police precinct station and a squad car. The unrest appeared to have dissipated after dark as rain fell.
The day began with Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo telling reporters that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had opened an inquiry at his request into the fatal arrest caught on video the night before.
Mayor Jacob Frey said at the same news briefing that regardless of the investigation's outcome, it was clear the death of the man in custody, later identified as George Floyd, was unjustified, and that race was a factor.
""Being black in America should not be a death sentence,"" the mayor said. ""For five minutes we watched as a white police officer pressed his knee into the neck of a black man. For five minutes. When you hear someone calling for help, you are supposed to help.""
The mayor later announced the termination of four officers on Twitter, saying, ""This is the right call.""
'I CAN'T BREATHE'
The case was eerily reminiscent of the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City, who died after being put in a police chokehold and telling the officers, ""I can't breathe.""
The officers involved in Monday's encounter were responding to a report of a forgery in progress, and found a man fitting the suspect's description, Floyd, aged in his 40s, in a car, according to a police department account.
After Floyd got out of the car, the department said, there was a physical altercation between the officers and Floyd. Floyd was handcuffed, and he appeared to be in medical distress, according to police. 
Cell phone footage taken by an onlooker does not show what precipitated the confrontation. It opens with Floyd lying beside the rear wheel of a vehicle, with a white officer pinning him to the street by pressing a knee into Floyd's neck.
Floyd can be heard repeatedly moaning and gasping while he pleads, ""Please, I can't breathe, please, man,"" as bystanders gather around, growing increasingly agitated and shouting at police to let him up. After several minutes, Floyd gradually grows quiet and ceases to move.
An ambulance took the suspect to the hospital, where he died a short time later, police said. No weapons were involved, and no officers were hurt in the incident, according to police. 
In the case of Garner, he was placed in a banned chokehold by a white police officer trying to arrest him for illegally selling loose cigarettes on the street. 
Garner's dying words, ""I can't breathe,"" became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement calling attention to a wave of African-Americans and other minorities who died at the hands of police using unjustified lethal force.

Attorney Benjamin Crump, retained by Floyd's family, said in a statement that officers' ""abusive, excessive and inhumane use of force cost the life of a man who was being detained by the police for questioning about a non-violent charge.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man suspected of killing 36 people and injuring dozens in an arson attack at an animation studio last July was arrested on Wednesday after spending 10 months in hospital for treatment.
Police had issued an arrest warrant for Shinji Aoba at the time of the fire but had been unable to question him after he suffered serious burns in the blaze at Kyoto Animation. 
Aoba, 42, was arrested at a Kyoto hospital and transferred to police headquarters for further questioning, police said in a statement. Aoba's injuries had left him unable to walk on his own, a police official said.
The fire - one of Japan's deadliest in decades - killed mostly young artists at the studio, shocking animation fans globally and prompting tributes from leaders such as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s chief executive, Tim Cook.
Police said in a statement that Aoba allegedly went to the studio, poured gasoline inside the building and set it ablaze, killing 22 women and 14 men inside. He was also suspected of the attempted murder of another 34 people.
Media reports at the time said Aoba told police he had taken the action because the studio had plagiarized his novel.
In a statement, Kyoto Animation said it expected the suspect to be prosecuted ""to the maximum extent"" under the law.
""We have no further words for the suspect... Our fallen colleagues will never return, and our wounds will never heal,"" it said.

Kyoto Animation is well known in Japan and abroad for its series and movies, including ""Violet Evergarden"", which has been on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).

The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries.
Ardern said she spoke to Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday and there was enthusiasm for travel to resume on both sides.
""We are working to move on this as quickly as we can. We are both very keen on it ... across both sides of the ditch,"" Ardern said at a news conference.
""It won't be too long before we are ready,"" she said.
Over the past two weeks, experts from both countries, including government and airport officials, airlines and health specialists have been working on the plan to re-open their borders with each other.
""Our aim is to put forward a detailed set of recommendations that safely manage any health risks, while also allowing Kiwis and Australians to travel to each country without the need for a 14-day quarantine,” Scott Tasker, co-chair of the Trans-Tasman Safe Border Group, which is developing the plans, said in a statement.
New Zealand is the most popular outbound travel destination for Australians, with 1.5 million of them arriving from across the Tasman Sea (NYSE:SE) in 2019. 
Likewise, Australia is the most popular outbound travel destination for New Zealanders. 
Ardern has been criticised in recent days for being too cautious. Her deputy, Winston Peters, said New Zealanders should be allowed to travel to Australia now.

Ardern brushed off the criticism as a difference of opinion and said her coalition government had a consensus on all its decisions.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's legislature is moving forward on a controversial bill that would criminalise abuse of China's national anthem. 
A second reading of the bill is being held in the legislature on Wednesday. Protests outside the legislature are expected.
WHAT IS IT?
Hong Kong’s National Anthem (NYSE:ANTM) Bill if passed into law by the legislature will govern the use and playing of the Chinese national anthem.
This includes provisions that threaten to punish those who insult the anthem with up to three years jail and/or fines of up to HK$50,000 ($6,450). The bill states that ""all individuals and organisations"" should respect and dignify the national anthem and play it and sing it on ""appropriate occasions"". It also orders that primary and secondary school students be taught to sing it, along with its history and etiquette.
WHY IS IT CONTROVERSIAL?
Anti-government protests last year were primarily aimed at resisting further integration with mainland China. The Chinese national anthem has been booed at several events, including football matches.
Protesters and pro-democracy politicians say the bill represents the latest sign of what they see as accelerating interference from Beijing in the freewheeling former British colony.
Britain handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule in 1997 with guarantees that the city's core freedoms and way of life would be protected under a ""one country, two systems"" formula, which Beijing says it respects.
The freedoms of speech, press, association and demonstration are explicitly written into the Basic Law, the mini-constitution that guides Hong Kong’s relationship with its Chinese sovereign – freedoms that opponents of the bill now say are under threat.
More technically, some senior lawyers fear the bill is highly unusual in that it, in part, reflects the ideological aspirations of China's Communist Party that might prove difficult to enforce. 
""It is the first Hong Kong law I've seen that looks like it was written in Beijing,"" one senior judge told Reuters recently, speaking privately. ""It will be a nightmare to rule on.""
The Hong Kong Bar Association acknowledged the need for such laws but said parts of the bill ""deviate from the good traditions"" of Hong Kong’s common law system. 
It said there was a fundamental difference between that system and the ""socialist legal system of mainland China which would include political ideology and conceptual guidance"".
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?
For years, Chinese officials and their pro-Beijing allies in Hong Kong have wanted to instill a greater sense of patriotic pride across its freest - and most restive - city.
Hong Kong's government says its bill reflects the city's own legal system and situation.
""The main spirit of the … bill is 'respect', which bears absolutely no relations to 'restricting freedom of speech' as claimed by certain members of the community and definitely not a so-called 'evil law',"" a spokesman said earlier this year.
WHAT'S NEXT?
Further protests and intense legislative infighting over the bill are widely expected.
The government, under pressure from Beijing, says the bill is now a priority to be passed into law before the end of this four-year legislative session in July.
Having been mired in a log-jam of legislative procedural battles, the bill could face a third reading after Wednesday's proceedings and possibly a vote early next month.
If it misses the deadline, the government would then have to decide whether to re-introduce the bill in the next session or force it into law by promulgation, seen as a highly unusual and potentially explosive option. Deeper public consultation and a re-draft would be the alternative.
Longer term, if the bill becomes law and is enforced, constitutional challenges can be expected in courts - both into the bill's content, and the procedural battles through which it passed.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States was working on a strong response to China's planned national security legislation for Hong Kong and it would be announced before the end of the week
China's parliament is expected to approve a proposed security law that would reduce Hong Kong's separate legal status on Thursday, calling into question the special economic status the territory currently enjoys under U.S. law.
At a White House news briefing, Trump was asked if he planned sanctions against China over Hong Kong and if he intended to put restrictions on visas for students and researchers from China. 
""We're doing something now. I think you'll find it very interesting ... I'll be talking about it over the next couple of days,"" he replied.
Pressed if this would include sanctions, he said: ""No it's something you're going to be hearing about ... before the end of the week, very powerfully I think.""
Trump did not elaborate, but earlier White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said he was displeased by the proposed security law and found it ""hard to see how Hong Kong can remain a financial hub if China takes over.""
Asked if this might mean an end to special economic treatment Washington affords to Hong Kong that has enabled it to maintain its position as a global financial center, McEnany said she had nothing to announce as to the precise response.
Trump's economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, earlier called Beijing's actions ""very disturbing.""
""China is making a big mistake, frankly,"" he said.
Kudlow said Washington would welcome back any American companies from Hong Kong or China's mainland. ""We will do what we can for full expensing and pay the cost of moving if they return their supply chains and their production to the United States,"" he said.
Trump administration officials and lawmakers have been exploring ways to encourage U.S. firms to move supply chains for critical products back to the United States from China amid steadily worsening ties and bitter recriminations over the coronavirus pandemic, which began in China.
Proposals discussed so far include tax breaks, subsidies including a potential $25 billion ""reshoring fund"" and new local content rules.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is due to release a congressionally mandated assessment on whether Hong Kong enjoys sufficient autonomy to justify continued special economic treatment, said last week the legislation would be the ""death knell"" for the territory's autonomy.
If the State Department decertifies the territory, it would fall to Trump whether to decide to end some, all or none of the privileges Hong Kong currently enjoys.
Trump has previously warned of a strong reaction and national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the legislation could lead to U.S. sanctions and threaten Hong Kong's status as a financial hub.
Separately, the U.S. House of Representatives is expected on Wednesday to approve legislation to toughen Washington’s response to China's crackdown on its Uighur Muslim minority, sending it to Trump’s desk, congressional sources said. 
Asked if he would sign the bill, which calls for sanctions against senior Chinese officials, Trump said he would hear more about the issue later on Tuesday and would “take a look at it very strongly,” but did not say how he would respond.
Kudlow also said that while Trump's Phase 1 trade deal with China reached in January was intact for now, the president was so ""miffed"" with Beijing over the novel coronavirus and other matters it was not as important to him as it once was. 

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby urged Beijing to de-escalate the situation, saying it would be ""a serious mistake"" to jeopardize Hong Kong's special status.

At around 5 a.m. local time the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), who claim a loose affiliation with the Islamic State group, attacked the village of Makutano in Ituri province, around 100 km southwest of the city of Bunia, said Gili Gotabo, a civil society leader in Irumu territory.
""They fired several shots in the air. When the population was fleeing, they captured some people and cut them up with machetes,"" he said.
Kivu Security Tracker (KST), a research initiative that maps unrest in the region, confirmed the attack and put the death toll at 17, although Gotabo said many more were killed.
Local authorities declined to comment.
The ADF have killed hundreds of people since late October last year when the army began an operation to oust them from their bases near the Ugandan border. The fighting has hampered efforts to end an Ebola epidemic.
While the insurgents, who are originally from Uganda, have pledged allegiance to Islamic State and the group has endorsed some attacks by the ADF, researchers say there is no evidence of close collaboration.
Following two months of relative quiet, the area has seen a rise in violent ADF attacks in the last three weeks, KST said in a statement to Reuters. 
""It's not entirely clear yet why this surge is taking place. It is very clear, however, that the ADF hasn't been dismantled at any point,"" it said.
The redeployment of army units further north as well as moral and financial fatigue may have given the ADF more space to operate, it added.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Marco Castillo and his boyfriend, Rodrigo Campos, waited just a few hours to take advantage of a new law in Costa Rica that made the country the first in Central America to allow same-sex marriage.
A judge, two witnesses, relatives and hundreds of online viewers joined activist lawyer Castillo and Campos at the Tuesday morning ceremony, which went ahead despite difficulties caused by social distancing restrictions in the coronavirus pandemic.
The couple kissed for the cameras outside the registry office - through face masks.
""It's a stepping stone towards equality that makes us keep up the fight for respect that those of us with a different sexual orientation deserve,"" Castillo told media after signing the certificate and exchanging rings at the registry office in the capital San Jose.
The wedding might not have happened had there been a different outcome to Costa Rica's 2018 presidential election, where the early favorite was a conservative Christian singer staunchly opposed to same-sex marriage.
In the end, he lost to young center-left candidate Carlos Alvarado. Costa Rica's Supreme Court later determined that same-sex couples must have the right to marry.
The run-up to the law taking effect was preceded by a special three-hour broadcast on public television.
Dressed in white, Daritza Araya and Alexandra Quiros were the first couple to tie the knot. Watched by nearly 20,000 people on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) broadcast, a notary wearing a face mask and observing physical distancing guidelines married the two women eight minutes after midnight.
""Long live Costa Rica!"" one of the few attendees shouted.
Other couples were scheduled to follow suit later in the day, including two men who married in New York in 2016 and six couples planning to wed at a collective afternoon ceremony in Quepos, a beach town on the Pacific coast.
Some 55 couples are on a waiting list, most of whom had already married abroad.
The law change followed a January 2018 ruling by the Costa Rica-based Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the top rights body of the Americas, instructing signatory nations to grant equality to same-sex couples, including the right to marry. 
Alvarado said the new law would transform society, even as some conservatives continue to oppose it.

""This country recognizes the rights they've always deserved and gives them back a bit of the freedom that was often limited for them,"" Alvarado said in message on social media.

1615,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 04:50PM ET</span>",Brazilian media boycott Bolsonaro residence due to harassment,"BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's four largest news media outlets said they have withdrawn their reporters from coverage of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's official residence due to the lack of security to protect them from heckling and abuse by his supporters.
Organizações Globo, owner of the country's largest network, TV Globo, as well as O Globo and Valor Economico newspapers, joined TV Bandeirantes and the large-circulation dailies Folha de S.Paulo and Estado de S.Paulo and decided on Monday night to suspend coverage for now at the Alvorada Palace.
Bolsonaro has made a habit of stopping at the residence's entrance to speak to cheering supporters, take selfies with them and make comments to the journalists.
But in recent days his supporters at the gates have turned on the reporters with angry verbal attacks. On Monday, about 60 supporters heckled the reporters loudly, with shouts of ""liars,"" ""scum"" and ""communists.""
The attacks on journalists have intensified as Bolsonaro's political situation has deteriorated under criticism of mishandling the coronavirus crisis that has killed more than 20,000 Brazilians and paralyzed the economy. He is also under investigation for allegedly interfering in law enforcement and his supporters see the media as part of a plot to oust him.
On May 3, angry demonstrators at a pro-Bolsonaro rally in Brasilia knocked a photographer off his ladder and kicked and punched him on the ground.
Folha said it would resume coverage only when there were guarantees given to ensure the security of the journalists.
Globo said in a statement sent to Bolsonaro's national security adviser, Augusto Heleno, that the ""aggressions"" have been increasing and its reporters would no longer go to the residence because it was not safe.
Heleno's office said in a statement that it regularly studies the situation and has taken ""sufficient measures to guarantee adequate security.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Denouncing ""racism of any kind,"" a global investment firm has fired a white woman after a viral video showed her calling police to say she felt threatened by an African-American man who asked her politely to leash her dog in New York's Central Park.
The video drew outrage on social media where it was viewed more than 30 million times, and the backlash prompted Franklin Templeton, on Tuesday to fire the woman, Amy Cooper.
""Following our internal review of the incident in Central Park yesterday, we have made the decision to terminate the employee involved, effective immediately. We do not tolerate racism of any kind,"" the company said on Twitter.
When hours earlier the company put her on administrative leave, Cooper told WNBC she wanted to ""sincerely and humbly apologize"" to the man, Christian Cooper, who is no relation. 
She turned over the dog to Abandoned Angels Cocker Spaniel Rescue Inc.
It was the latest racially tense confrontation to go viral. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating as a hate crime a black jogger's fatal shooting by white men in Georgia and captured on video.
Melody Cooper, Christian's sister who posted the latest video, called the dog owner a Karen, slang used to describe a middle-aged white woman perceived to be entitled. 
""Oh, when Karens take a walk with their dogs off leash in the famous Bramble in NY's Central Park, where it is clearly posted on signs that dogs MUST be leashed at all times, and someone like my brother (an avid birder) politely asks her to put her dog on the leash,"" Melody Cooper wrote. 
""I'm going to call the cops,"" Amy Cooper tells Christian Cooper on the video, apparently shot on Monday with a cellphone camera. ""I'm going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.""
""Please tell them whatever you like,"" Christian Cooper responds on the video.

TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian soldiers helping manage the coronavirus outbreak in nursing homes saw staff leaving people in soiled diapers, ignoring calls for help and reusing unsterilized equipment, an official report said on Tuesday.
Nursing homes account for around 80% of all deaths attributed to the new coronavirus in Canada. The situation is dire in Ontario and Quebec, the two most populous provinces, where around 1,400 soldiers are working.
A report by the armed forces on five of the worst-affected Ontario homes revealed residents left in soiled diapers as well as ""significant fecal contamination,"" cockroaches and ants in patient rooms.
At one point ""patients (were) observed crying for help with staff not responding for 30 mins to over two hours,"" it said.
""It was the most heart-wrenching report I have read in my entire life,"" said Ontario Premier Doug Ford, at one point on the verge of tears.
Ford - who promised a full-scale probe - said the system of long-term care was ""broken"" and had suffered from neglect for decades before the coronavirus outbreak tipped it over the edge.
""I'm going to fix this system, no matter what it takes,"" he said, calling on the federal government for funding. Canada's 10 provinces have jurisdiction over healthcare.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was shocked and angry about the scenes, reiterating that Canada needed to do a much better job of taking care of its elderly population.
Both Quebec and Ontario have asked that the soldiers stay on longer than initially planned, and the federal government is likely to agree, Trudeau said.
Earlier this month Trudeau referred to ""heartbreaking tragedies"" in long-term care facilities, mentioning overworked employees and understaffed homes.

Official public health data showed the total coronavirus Canadian death toll had edged up by just under 2% to 6,566 from Monday.

GUAYAQUIL/QUITO, Ecuador (Reuters) - Dolores Centeno has scoured the morgues and cemeteries of Guayaquil, Ecuador's largest city, for two months searching for her father's body. 
Now, in a desperate last attempt to find him, she hopes to catch a glimpse of a scar on his chest that would set him apart from the dozens of other decomposing corpses in a newly-filled shipping container.
Like other families looking for their loved ones in the coastal city ravaged by the coronavirus, Centeno is praying the body of her 63-year-old father is among the more than 130 bodies that authorities say they are holding in such containers, awaiting identification.
Guayaquil in March and April faced a brutal outbreak of the virus that left bodies piling up in overwhelmed hospitals and corpses sitting for days in houses before authorities came to retrieve them, as morgues overflowed.
The government established a task force to collect cadavers and deployed the containers to store the mounting bodies. 
But the chaos gave way to disorganization. Bodies were lost or misidentified, resulting in families looking for loved ones in morgues, hospitals and now, shipping containers, across the city. 
Experts have so far identified 64 corpses through fingerprint recognition. They are also relying on family identification and more time-intensive genetic testing, according to Mario Corrales, the head of Ecuador's Forensic Sciences Criminalistics Laboratory (NYSE:LH). 
Centeno's father passed away in late March, hours after being admitted to one of the city's public hospitals with respiratory problems. There was no paper trail to identify what happened to him after he was admitted, said Centeno.
Forensic experts asked Centeno if her father had any identifying scars, Centeno said. ""He had two, the largest from an open heart operation and the other from hernia surgery."" 
Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo told reporters on Monday that the government was working with a team of forensic doctors and scientists to identify the bodies ""and to be able to give an answer to every last family that went through this unfortunate situation.""
""Every day progress is made on this issue, little by little,"" she said.
Ecuador has officially reported over 37,000 coronavirus cases and more than 3,000 deaths, but authorities acknowledge both figures are likely significant underestimates due to a lack of testing. 
Jorge Wated, the head of the task force responsible for collecting the deceased, said on Twitter on May 2 there were over 8,200 more deaths than would normally be projected in the province of Guayas, where Guayaquil is located, during April alone.
Wated did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno dissolved the task force in early May as the death toll stabilized.
INVESTIGATION
The country's attorney general has since launched an investigation into three public hospitals in Guayaquil over allegations that they did not follow protocol for identifying bodies, while the government has set up a website where people can search for deceased family members. 
If a patient was registered by authorities, the location of their remains is recorded on the site. But many Ecuadorians still have no answers. 
""I looked for her in a container and I did not find her; I looked for her in the cemetery, I did not find her there either, she is not on any list,"" said Victor Hugo Orellana, who is looking for the body of his 72-year-old mother, whose body he said he released to the government in March to be buried. 
Her remains have since gone missing. 
The Health Ministry and hospitals under investigation did not respond to request for comment. 
The Ombudsman's Office asked a local judge to award reparations to the families of the deceased and to speed up the identification process. Those already identified will be transferred to city cemeteries for burial.

""If they told me that they already found him and cremated him, how am I going to know that it is really him?"" said Luis Alvarado, who has been searching for his younger brother's body since late March.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - By night, nurse Rachel Hartley is on the front line of the war against the coronavirus. By day, she rests on the sailboat that brought her from Virginia, wondering how she will explain it all to her children someday.
Hartley, 26, was among the many thousands of medical professionals from around the country who dropped what they were doing and came to New York as a surge in COVID-19 cases was threatening to overwhelm city hospitals.
""It's been incredible just to see that unity from across our nation of people coming to fight this disease,"" she said.
But unlike most of the city's out-of-state medical allies, Hartley and her husband, photographer Taylor Hartley, brought their own living quarters: their 50-foot (15 m) sailboat, Turning Points.
Her current sea-land routine is a far cry from the life the Columbus, Ohio, native had two months ago in landlocked Lynchburg, where she worked as an anesthesia prepping nurse. 
The virus canceled many of the elective surgeries at Hartley's hospital, leaving her with little to do.
She and her husband weighed their options, considered their health and prayed. Next, Hartley quit her job and the two made the 250-mile (402 km) sail in mid-April that brought them to New York 35 hours later, where a Brooklyn marina gave them a free docking slot.
""And I'm seeing New York City just being ransacked by the virus,"" said Hartley, who had previously worked as an intensive care nurse. 
At work on her overnight shifts at NYU Langone Hospital, Hartley said she encountered sickness like she had never seen. With morgue trucks parked outside, Hartley sometimes held the hands of patients as they died.
""That's something that I - I never want to do that again, and I never thought I would as a nurse,"" she said. 
Back on Turning Points, Hartley rests, reflects and keeps a journal she hopes to share one day with her children.

""It's been really special to be able to be in the center of everything and serve on the front lines,"" she said.

The former anti-money-laundering executive at private bank Coutts & Co Ltd denies any wrongdoing. Reuters is not naming the defendant due to Swiss laws on privacy in court proceedings.
Swiss markets watchdog FINMA in 2017 ordered Coutts to pay 6.5 million Swiss francs ($6.7 million) for breaching money-laundering regulations in its business linked to 1MDB, but dropped its own proceedings against the executive.
FINMA's investigation found that between 2009 and 2015 assets worth $2.4 billion moved through accounts at Coutts, which was founded in the 18th century and is best known as banker to Britain's Queen Elizabeth. 
The Swiss prosecutors' indictment details warnings from Coutts colleagues about transactions by Low Taek Jho, or Jho Low, the Malaysian businessman tied to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) fund, which was set up in 2009 by the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.
Najib is on trial in Malaysia on corruption charges, which he denied in March and said were politically motivated. Low has also denied any wrongdoing, saying in January that he acted only as an intermediary for deals involving 1MDB. 
U.S. justice officials estimate $4.5 billion was siphoned out of Malaysia by high-level fund officials and associates between 2009 and 2014, and laundered through countries including the United States, Switzerland, Singapore and Luxembourg.
Prosecutors say Low had three accounts at Coutts, including one for a Seychelles-based company called Good Star that deposited an initial $700 million payment in September 2009, ostensibly for managing investments for 1MDB.
A lawyer from the bank's legal department warned in October 2009 the explanation of the source of money was ""anything other than plausible"", the indictment seen by Reuters says. 

Royal Bank of Scotland (L:RBS) sold most of Coutts' international assets to Union Bancaire Privee in March 2015 after splitting up the bank.

In addition, Hungarians can travel to the Czech Republic by crossing Slovakia but cannot cross Slovakia on their way back; they will have to detour through Austria, Szijjarto said. The same applies to Czechs returning home from Hungary. Hungary had also opened its southern border for Serbs from Monday morning.

Hungary escaped the first wave of the pandemic with a total of 3,771 cases and 499 deaths as of Tuesday, fairly low numbers due to an early and strict lockdown, which the government has been easing since early May.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says people should make up their own minds about the decision of his senior aide Dominic Cummings to drive 250 miles (400 km) from London during lockdown. The early evidence is that they have.
In a poll conducted after a news conference on Monday where Cummings sought to explain his actions, YouGov found 59% think he should resign and 71% believe he broke lockdown rules. 
And people echoed that sentiment on the streets of north-west London. 
""It feels vindictive to say that he should go, but I do think that you need to feel you've got a government you can trust and that has integrity,"" said Catherine Andrews, a corporate trainer from London. 
Cummings sought to defuse the row over his trip to stay on his family's farm, saying his actions were reasonable in the circumstances as he was worried he would not have had childcare options if he and his wife were seriously ill.
He also said he had driven to a beauty spot a further 30 miles away to test his eyesight before driving back to London. Johnson says he is satisfied with his explanation of events.
""It's not reasonable, not at all, it's very unreasonable. I mean what an excuse, who can believe that, you travelled 200 and whatever miles and then you travelled another 30 miles to check your eyesight,"" Pauline Heward-Mills, who is retired, said. 
Not everyone was so fussed by the trip made by Cummings.
""I think it's up to himself what he does so let him carry on and does what he likes,"" another local resident Thomas Gill said. ""It's nothing to do with us."" 
Londoners backed the opposition Labour party last year and a majority in the city also voted against Brexit. Cummings, who ran the Leave campaign with Johnson in 2016, prides himself on being more in touch with the electorate than most observers. 
""You guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?"" he told journalists who asked if he would consider his position on Saturday.
But outrage about his actions is widespread, suggesting he might have misjudged the national mood on this occasion.
Scottish junior minister Douglas Ross resigned on Tuesday, saying he could not tell constituents who had avoided leaving home to abide by the lockdown that ""they were all wrong and one senior adviser to the government was right.""
Poll data reflects how damaging the episode could be to the government. 

Boris Johnson's approval rating is at -1%, having been +19% four days ago, Savanta Comres' daily tracker shows, and overall government approval is -2%, having dropped 16 points in a day.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.N. officials said they will meet on Thursday with over a dozen world leaders to discuss shoring up financial support for emerging economies, hit hard by the pandemic's economic fallout.
The online meeting comes amid surging coronavirus infections in developing countries and warnings it will cost more than the initially forecast $2.5 trillion for them to weather the crisis. It was convened by Canada, Jamaica and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
U.N. Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said many developing countries, including middle-income nations, lacked sufficient funds to fight the pandemic and invest in recovery.
""Work is going on. But it is not urgent enough,"" she told reporters in an online briefing.
Mohammed said an offer by the Group of 20 major economies and Paris Club creditors to suspend payments on official bilateral debt for the poorest countries through the end of 2020 was a critical start, but further efforts would be needed.
Of 77 eligible countries, only 22 have formally requested forbearance so far. Others have expressed concern it could harm their longer-term ability to borrow money.
Thursday's meeting will include participants from the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, African Union, Institute of International Finance and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCED). The goal is to deliver concrete proposals in eight weeks, Mohammed said.
A draft concept paper for the meeting seen by Reuters called for the IMF to boost global liquidity by issuing a new allocation of its Special Drawing Rights currency, a move that has been opposed by Washington.

It also backs an across-the-board debt standstill for all developing countries that request forbearance - not just the ones covered by the G20 debt suspension - and calls for proactive solutions by private-sector creditors to avoid the even higher cost of a ""disorderly wave of defaults.""

Japhet Chataba, 39, and Steven Sambo, 31, were among nearly 3,000 inmates pardoned by President Edgar Lungu last Friday to commemorate Africa Freedom Day, according to the government gazette.
A Lusaka High Court judge had sentenced them to 15 years in prison under laws that forbid sex between couples ""against the order of nature"".
The case drew criticism from then U.S. ambassador Daniel Foote, who said the sentence was too harsh and could damage Zambia's reputation. Washington later withdrew Foote following the row with Zambian authorities over the issue.
Over the past decade, several African countries have come into conflict over LGBT rights with Western countries, many of who are major aid donors. 
The previous Obama administration cut aid to Uganda and Malawi over their anti-homosexual laws and policies, although Western condemnation sometimes provokes African leaders into taking more hardline positions.
Uganda announced plans in October last year for a bill that would impose the death penalty for gay sex, but later backtracked after major aid donors said they were monitoring the situation.

Weary but happy, the returnees queued or dozed in bus stations and at Manila's airport, awaiting transport to home provinces. Many have lost jobs abroad as the coronavirus batters economies worldwide.
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has told his government to do everything possible to process within a week the thousands of returnees, some of whom tested negative for the coronavirus and completed the mandatory 14-day quarantine long ago.
The authorities blame testing bottlenecks for the quarantine delays, including those experienced by thousands of Filipino crew of more than two dozen cruise ships moored for weeks in Manila Bay.
Among those hit by the crisis was English teacher Anna Marie Del Carmen, who has been stuck in the capital for two months since her repatriation from Thailand.
""It feels really good. It's like finally being free from jail, but I learned a lot while being under lockdown, and I met and became friends with a lot of people,"" she said.
""So it was both a sad and a happy experience now that we are all going our separate ways.""
Overseas Filipino workers, better known locally as OFWs, are breadwinners and a key support base of Duterte.
Their more than $30 billion of annual remittances is an important driver of the Philippine economy, sustaining millions of family members.
More than 30,000 overseas Filipinos have returned home and 515 of 27,000 tested for coronavirus were positive as of a week ago, authorities said.

Roughly 10 million Filipinos work or have settled overseas, with large communities in North America, the Middle East and Europe.

""Russian military aircraft are likely to provide close air support and offensive fire,"" the United States Africa command said in a statement it posted on its website and on Twitter. 
Libya's civil war has drawn in regional and global powers with what the United Nations has called a huge influx of weapons and fighters in violation of an arms embargo. 
Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt support the eastern-based Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army, which launched an offensive last year to seize the capital Tripoli. 
However, in recent weeks the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) has with extensive Turkish backing pushed Haftar back from his foothold in southern Tripoli and from some other parts of the northwest.
The United States has played a less prominent role in the Libyan war than it did at an earlier stage, when NATO helped rebels overthrow the country's autocratic ruler Muammar Gaddafi. 
The statement said the aircraft had arrived from an airbase in Russia after transiting via Syria, where they were repainted to conceal their Russian origin. There was no immediate response from the Russian Defence Ministry to a request for comment.
On Saturday, Russian fighters in Libya were flown out of a town south of Tripoli by their Libyan allies after retreating from frontlines in Tripoli, the town's mayor said.
The LNA has denied any foreigners are fighting with it, but the United Nations said this month that Russian private military contractor Wagner Group had up to 1,200 people in Libya. 
""Russia has employed state-sponsored Wagner in Libya to conceal its direct role and to afford Moscow plausible deniability of its malign actions,"" the U.S. statement said. 
It quoted U.S. Air Force General Jeff Harrigian as warning that if Russia seized bases on Libya's coast, it would ""create very real security concerns on Europe's southern flank"".
The statement said neither the LNA nor mercenaries would be able to ""arm, operate and sustain these fighters"" -- meaning fighter aircraft -- without the support they had from Russia.Last week the LNA announced it would be launching a major new air campaign against the GNA and said it had refurbished four war jets.

NEW DELHI/SRINAGAR (Reuters) - A Himalayan border standoff between old foes India and China was triggered by India’s construction of roads and air strips in the region as it competes with China's spreading Belt and Road initiative, Indian observers said on Tuesday.
Soldiers from both sides have been camped out in the Galwan Valley in the high-altitude Ladakh region, accusing each other of trespassing over the disputed border, the trigger of a brief but bloody war in 1962.
About 80 to 100 tents have sprung up on the Chinese side and about 60 on the Indian side where soldiers are billeted, Indian officials briefed on the matter in New Delhi and in Ladakh's capital, Leh, said.
Both were digging defences and Chinese trucks have been moving equipment into the area, the officials said, raising concerns of a long faceoff.
""China is committed to safeguarding the security of its national territorial sovereignty, as well as safeguarding peace and stability in the China-India border areas,"" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson's office said in a statement.
""At present, the overall situation in the border areas is stable and controllable. There are sound mechanisms and channels of communication for border-related affairs, and the two sides are capable of properly resolving relevant issues through dialogue and consultation.”
There was no immediate Indian foreign ministry comment. It said last week Chinese troops had hindered regular Indian patrols along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).
But interviews with former Indian military officials and diplomats suggest the trigger for the flare-up is India’s construction of roads and air strips.
""Today, with our infrastructure reach slowly extending into areas along the LAC, the Chinese threat perception is raised,"" said former Indian foreign secretary Nirupama Rao.
""Xi Jinping’s China is the proponent of a hard line on all matters of territory, sovereignty. India is no less when it comes to these matters either,"" she said.
After years of neglect Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has pushed for improving connectivity and by 2022, 66 key roads along the Chinese border will have been built.
One of these roads is near the Galwan valley that connects to Daulat Beg Oldi air base, which was inaugurated last October.
""The road is very important because it runs parallel to the LAC and is linked at various points with the major supply bases inland,"" said Shyam Saran, another former Indian foreign secretary.
""It remains within our side of the LAC. It is construction along this new alignment which appears to have been challenged by the Chinese.""

China's Belt and Road is a string of ports, railways, roads and bridges connecting China to Europe via central and southern Asia and involving Pakistan, China's close ally and India's long-time foe.

GRAN CANARIA (Reuters) - About 80 African migrants packed aboard two fishing boats landed on the Spanish island of Gran Canaria on Tuesday, adding to the hundreds of new arrivals now stuck there while the coronavirus lockdown prevents transfers to the mainland.
The first boat docked at the port of Arguineguin with about 50 people aboard, 23 of whom are believed to be children. 
""They arrived in good health, although a little dehydrated,"" said Gerardo Santana, head of the Red Cross on Gran Canaria. 
A 16-year-old was taken to hospital with vomiting and nausea. 
A second vessel carrying 30 men, a woman and four children, landed on the rocky coast of San Bartolome de Tirajana, where medics took temperatures and handed out blankets and masks.
Both groups will be tested for coronavirus and will undergo a two-week quarantine, a government spokeswoman said.
State news agency EFE reported that three recently-arrived migrants had tested positive for the virus and were being held in isolation.
Illegal migration to the islands, in the Atlantic Ocean west of Morocco, has risen nearly seven-fold so far this year to 2,113 people as of May 15, despite a 29% drop in overall seaborne arrivals to Spain, according to Interior Ministry data.
Heightened security across the Mediterranean is likely to be driving more migrants to risk the perilous Atlantic crossing, said Helena Malena, head of the Caminando Fronteras non-governmental organization, which monitors migratory flows.
""The migrants are still there...they have to get out somehow, so the mafias open up more dangerous routes."" 
Red Cross centres on the islands are overloaded and the humanitarian organization has resorted to putting up migrants in empty sports halls.

More than 500 police trainees in Manila posed as rail passengers in an exercise to manage hundreds of thousands of people once public transportation eventually resumes, having being closed for nearly 11 weeks. 
Cadets in jeans, white T-shirts and face visors marched up the stairs of a light rail transit (LRT) station before joining orderly queues to platforms and filing slowly into spacious train carriages.
""From early morning up to late at night there is always a line of passengers waiting to ride a train. We are doing this simulation to better prepare for the smooth operations of the LRT,"" said Metropolitan Manila police chief Debold Sinas.
On a normal day, millions are on the move in and around Manila, pushing transport networks to their limits. 
Commuters typically use several different modes of transport to get to work, joining long, snaking queues and before packing tightly into buses, passenger jeeps and trains.
Manila has been under community quarantine since March 16 in one of the world's longest coronavirus lockdowns. That was modified 10 days ago to ease some restrictions and the government will meet on Wednesday to decide whether to relax them further. 
The Philippines has reported 14,669 cases of the coronavirus and 886 deaths.
LRT spokesman Hernando Cabrera said social distancing meant each train will carry only 10% of its maximum passenger load, making it difficult to managing the flow of people at stations.

""Only 160 passengers will be allowed. It's a very big challenge for us to maintain and control the crowd once operations begin,"" he said.

The election was originally scheduled for May 10, but that date was missed after the opposition-controlled upper parliamentary house took the full thirty days it was allowed to review a draft law to authorise the vote as a postal-only ballot due to the coronavirus.
The nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party is keen to get incumbent president and frontrunner Andrzej Duda - an ally of the party - re-elected before the economic fallout from the pandemic weighs on his popularity, and the government has drafted a second bill to hold a mixed postal and polling-booth vote.
Opposition parties - whose main presidential candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, is gaining in the polls - accuse the PiS of putting political gain ahead of public health by planning an election during a pandemic, saying an exclusively postal ballot would be neither free nor fair.
On Tuesday Senate speaker Tomasz Grodzki - like Trzaskowski a member of the main opposition party, centre-right Civic Platform (PO) - said he would call a sitting of the Senate for Monday to Wednesday of next week to debate the new bill, state-run news agency PAP reported.
Deputy speaker Marek Pek of PiS, which controls the lower parliamentary house through which both bills passed, accused him of using delaying tactics.
""What new political and legal circumstances have appeared that mean once again for a whole week we are postponing the work of the Senate?"" PAP quoted Pek as saying.
The government now aims to hold the presidential election in late June or early July.

By Tuesday morning, Poland had reported 21,867 cases of COVID-19 with 1,013 deaths.

1634,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","English shoppers face queues, limited browsing when stores reopen","LONDON (Reuters) - Shoppers face more queuing and limited ability to try products when England's high street retailers, department stores and shopping centres reopen next month after the coronavirus lockdown.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that outdoor markets and car showrooms in England can reopen from June 1 followed by all other non-essential retail from June 15 if the government's tests are met.
But the stores will look very different from how they were when the country went into lockdown on March 23 as they will have to observe health and safety and social distancing regulations.
Complying with the government's guidance will bring complexity to the trading process and higher operating and capital costs, analysts said.
The guidance for stores, laid out in a 33-page document, requires more cleaning regimes, queuing systems with one-way flows and increased signage, and fewer customers in a store at a time, with shopping with children discouraged.
The reopening only applies to England as retailers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have to wait for guidance from their devolved administrations.
As at supermarkets, which have traded through the lockdown, check-out areas in English stores will have increased screening, while store staff will wear protective equipment such as face masks and gloves. Regular hand sanitisation will be encouraged for both staff and shoppers.
Customers will also be encouraged to avoid handling products whilst browsing - a particular problem for clothing retailers.
Fitting rooms should be closed wherever possible, while goods that have been tried-on or returned by customers should be stored in a container or separate room for 72 hours, or cleaned, before being re-displayed on the shop floor.
""Queues outside stores, restricted numbers inside, no ability to browse with friends, nor to try on (or possibly even touch) clothes before the purchasing decision will all severely detract from the shopping experience,"" said David Beadle of Moody’s Investors Service. 
""As such, prospects of lower revenue and additional costs will see some retailers keep shops closed initially at least.""

Clothing retailer Next said on Monday it would re-open just 25 stores on June 15.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A new wave of locust attacks has alarmed India's farmers and experts warn of extensive crop losses if authorities fail to curb fast-spreading swarms by June when monsoon rains spur rice, cane, corn, cotton and soybean sowing.
Desert locusts have engulfed around 35,000 hectares in India's seven heartland states, threatening some vegetable and pulse crops, government officials and farm experts said.
Despite large-scale infestations, the government and agricultural experts do not foresee major crop damage for now as it is the lean season - the gap between the previous harvest and the next planting season.
But experts warn that the federal and state governments will have to stop locusts in their tracks in the next couple of weeks to ensure that swarms do not end up devouring summer crops.
""Despite the unprecedented scale of the locust attack, we haven't seen any major crop loss, but we've got a very short window to tackle the problem. Otherwise, we won't be able to save our summer crops,"" said Bhagirath Choudhary, director of the South Asia Biotech Centre, a non-profit scientific society.
India is battling its worst desert locust outbreak in decades with infestations radiating through much of the western states of Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra, central state of Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, and Haryana and Uttar Pradesh in the north. 
Higher than normal temperatures have helped locusts spread more rapidly, Choudhary said.
Earlier this year, farmers salvaged their wheat and oilseed crops from a previous locust scourge.
India is determined to tackle the problem by bolstering the state-run Locust Warning Organization (LWO), said Kailash Choudhary, a junior minister for agriculture. The government has beefed up the LWO workforce and bought new equipment and vehicles to survey and spray insecticides, he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - China must respect Hong Kong's autonomy, the European Union said on Tuesday, amid controversy over Chinese plans to adopt a national security law for the city.
""We attach great importance to the preservation of Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy in line with the Basic Law and international commitments,"" European Council President Charles Michel, who represents European governments, said.
Speaking after a video conference with Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he said Europe and Japan ""share the same ideas"" on China. ""We are not naive about Chinese behaviour,"" Michel said.
He said Europe supported the ""one country, two systems"" principle that governs Hong Kong's autonomy.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang has proposed a security law that would reduce Hong Kong's separate legal status and is expected to be discussed by China's National People's Congress and approved on Thursday.

EU foreign ministers are expected to discuss the issue at a regular meeting on Friday. A spokeswoman for the EU's executive Commission said it was too early to say if the bloc would consider sanctions against Beijing. Josep Borrell, the EU's foreign policy chief, said on Monday that the EU needs a ""more robust strategy"" for Beijing.

1637,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",Portugal talking to Britain to secure 'air bridge' for tourism: sources,"By Sergio Goncalves
LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal and Britain are in talks to try and secure an air corridor for tourists that would allow British visitors to avoid a COVID-19 quarantine upon returning home, two Portuguese sources familiar with the situation said.
Portugal's tourism-dependent economy has been hard hit by the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns at home and abroad, and authorities are trying to save at least part of the crucial summer season.
Britain, the main source of tourism for Portugal, will introduce a quarantine for travellers arriving from abroad from June 8, including returning Britons. Travellers will have to self-isolate for 14 days. 
In 2019, more than 16 million foreign tourists visited Portugal, almost 20% of them from Britain. 
One source said the talks were still in an initial phase.
Another said the government sought the air corridor both for Portuguese tourists visiting Britain and vice versa, and was hoping that Portugal's relatively low coronavirus tally compared to countries like Spain or Britain would benefit tourism. 
Portugal's death toll of 1,330 and total cases at 30,788 are just a fraction of neighboring Spain's nearly 27,000 dead and over 235,000 infected.
Approached for a comment, the foreign ministry told Reuters that Portugal had requested additional information after the British quarantine decision. Although it would not confirm nor deny any specific talks on a corridor, said it was optimistic about finding an acceptable solution.
""Given the relevant reciprocal interests, the foreign ministry is confident that it will be possible to agree a solution that meets these interests, especially concerning the coming summer season,"" it said. 
The tourism sector accounts for nearly 15% of Portugal's gross domestic product and was one of the main drivers of its recovery from the 2010-14 economic and debt crisis. 
The AHP hotel association has said over 90% of Portuguese hotels remain closed after a lockdown imposed in March, expecting revenue losses of up to 1.4 billion euros between March and June.

Amid lingering pandemic concerns, Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity is capping access at 50 people at a time and requires that they be free of fever and wear protective masks.
Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional site of Jesus' crucifixion, death and resurrection, also reopened its doors, but worshippers will be required to coordinate their visit in advance.
Both churches were closed in March, in a blow to the local tourism industry. 
""The birth of our Lord Jesus Christ gave hope to people more than 2,000 years ago, and opening the church today will, I think, give hope to the whole world that hopefully this pandemic will end - not only in Palestine but in the whole world,"" Palestinian Tourism Minister Rula Ma'ayah told Reuters in Bethlehem.
The town, just south of Jerusalem, is among areas where Palestinians exercise limited self-rule in the West Bank, under Israeli occupation since the 1967 Middle East war.
There have been 423 recorded coronavirus cases and two deaths in the West Bank.
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is in the walled Old City of Jerusalem, also captured by Israel in 1967. Its doors were closed throughout the Easter season because of the coronavirus, with only a handful of clerics able to worship inside.
On Monday, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said mosques, churches and businesses would reopen on Tuesday in an easing of curbs, given the slow pace of infections. 
The reopening of houses of worship, shops and factories coincides with the last day of the Eid El-Fitr holiday marking the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.

Muslim prayers at Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque compound are also expected to resume later this week after nearly a two-month pause, according to a statement published last week by Palestinian religious officials.

""We have to work with our European partners to define the common rules that will allow us retake freedom of movement on European territory,"" Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez said on Cadena Ser radio station. 
Even though EU countries have set different dates for reopening borders, there must be common principles and rules throughout the Schengen Area to open internal borders and set up rules for external borders, she said. 
In a discussion paper submitted by Spain to a Future of Europe consultation process between EU member states, Madrid also called for the monitoring of tourists' health via individual checks as part of a common EU-wide procedure.
""It would be appropriate to consider, in coordination with UNWTO and WHO, options for health checks, either upon the purchase of tickets or at the airport itself, should the results of those checks be available within a reasonable timeframe,"" read the document, seen by Reuters.
""The definition of a safe and operational passenger transit system is key to restoring the normality of tourist flows in a sustainable manner,"" it said.
A diplomatic source told Reuters that one of the options being considered was to test passengers before boarding.

Spain on Monday urged foreign holidaymakers to return from July as it eases one of Europe's strictest lockdowns.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Four days after the Congolese government shut down Kinshasa's pulsating nightlife, her husband knocked out some of her teeth and went to live with his mistress, leaving her bleeding and naked on the floor. Their three children saw it all.
A policy aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus meant that case K1B1 - whose name Reuters is withholding for her safety - had been locked down with her abuser.
""When Marie came to visit me I was still vomiting blood from the beatings,"" she told Reuters, referring to Marie Lukasa, who set up Congo's first domestic abuse hotline a year ago.
During the coronavirus crisis, it's a service in increasing demand in a country ill-equipped to deal with such abuse.
Lacking funds for a call centre or refuge, Lukasa and a small group of volunteers use their mobile phones as informal hotlines to help families get medical, legal or psychological help. 
It's difficult to gauge how many families in Congo are suffering increased abuse because of the knock-on effects of the outbreak, which has infected 2,297 people and killed 67 in the country.
But the volume of calls to Lukasa's Forum of Women Citizens and Activists for Governance, Democracy and Development, has exploded more than ten-fold. They used to get five calls a week. Now it's ten a day, she said.
Many women have low social status in Congo and domestic abuse is often seen as acceptable, even by women, according to Pierre Ferry, head of child protection at the UN children's fund UNICEF.
Ferry said that with only 2,082 social workers for 84 million people, Congolese authorities are poorly equipped to help survivors like case K1B1.
Movement restrictions, loss of income, isolation, overcrowding and high levels of stress and anxiety are increasing the likelihood that children experience and witness physical, psychological and sexual abuse at home, a group of UN agencies, aid and rights organisations said last month.

""We also want holistic treatment,"" Lukasa said, ""because we don't want victims of today to become the rapist of tomorrow.""

1642,By Reuters,"<span>May 26, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","Even as Canada reopens, children in foster care endure long separations","By Allison Martell
TORONTO (Reuters) - Children in Canada's foster care homes have gone weeks without being able to see their parents in person and plans for safe reunions are still uncertain, according to child protection lawyers, even as stores, hair salons and some day care centers begin to reopen.
Provincial governments, which suspended most visits in late March and early April to fight the spread of the coronavirus, say they have been allowed in exceptional circumstances.
But in practice, lawyers from across the country told Reuters there have been few exceptions to the social distancing measure, which has hit the country's indigenous population especially hard.
One mother who usually sees her 4- and 8-year-old children twice a week has been unable to do so since British Columbia halted foster home visits on March 26. The kids were heartbroken, she said. 
The province's 24-page restart plan mentions museums, massage therapy and the film industry, but not visits for children in care.
""I don't know how I can be deemed an essential worker, but I'm not an essential parent,"" said a British Columbia father of two who works in the trades. ""I can go back to work, but I can't see my kids?""
Reuters is not naming the parents to protect their children's identities.
Changes to the visiting policy are ""under review"" and more than 150 exemptions to allow visits for specific families have been approved in the meantime, said a provincial spokesman. There were 5,805 children in foster care in British Columbia alone as of Dec. 31.
""In these unprecedented times, we need to support those crucial connections in the safest way possible,"" said the province in a statement. ""Right now, that means supporting virtual visits with family members through Skype and by telephone wherever possible.""
Canada is not alone in suspending contact - several U.S. states took similar steps. But moves to resume visits are lagging other reopenings across Canada.
In Alberta, day care centers were allowed to reopen on May 14, but the children's services ministry is still working on a plan to allow visits.
In Newfoundland, which has only three active coronavirus cases, visits are allowed in ""exceptional cases"" and officials are working on a plan to resume more contact, said a spokeswoman. A recent newsletter from the local foster parents' association included tips on interacting with infants and toddlers over video chat.
TIGHT CUSTODY DEADLINES
Children in foster care usually return home gradually, progressing from supervised visits to overnights. Halting visits derails that, and in parts of Canada, parents face tight deadlines to win back custody of young children. After 12 to 18 months, agencies must seek extended custody and children can be adopted.
Tammy Law, president of the Ontario Association of Child Protection Lawyers, fears long separations will be used in court to argue that parents are not bonded with their children.
""It's another strike against the parent,"" she said. ""I don't know how that is going to play out, and every case is going to be different.""
Long separations have had a disproportionate impact on indigenous children, since they are overrepresented in the foster care system. In Manitoba, which has the largest proportion of children in care, nearly 90% are indigenous, according to a 2018 report.
On April 6, Manitoba suspended all face-to-face visits unless ""absolutely essential,"" according to an online bulletin. Outdoor visits are now allowed in some cases, but there is no data on how many have taken place.
Cora Morgan, First Nations Family Advocate with the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, said some families were weeks away from reunification, but now those plans are on pause.
""They're ready to bring their children home,"" she said.
The Assembly wrote to the provincial leader on April 21, decrying the ""double standard"" that has kept kids in care away from their parents while other court ordered visits continue.
""It appears that parental bonding is prioritized for some families, but not for First Nations children in care,"" reads the letter, obtained by Reuters.
Visits with children in care are different from shared custody, the ministry said in a statement. One home may host children from multiple families, so several households could be affected.
""We're concerned about the safety of children and their families, also staff and caregivers,"" said Jeffrey Schiffer, executive director of Toronto's Native Child and Family Services, one agency that continued many visits through the epidemic.

""Those safety concerns need to be balanced against the rights that indigenous children have to see their families and be connected to their community and culture.""

Salvini refused to allow a ship carrying over 100 migrants rescued at sea to land in Italy in August last year, while serving in the previous coalition government.
An Italian prosecutor eventually ordered the seizure and evacuation of the ship, operated by Spanish aid group Open Arms.
The committee rejected by 13 votes to 7 a court request to proceed with an investigation on charges of alleged kidnapping of migrants. A full upper house vote could still reverse the committee decision.
Under Italian law, former ministers cannot be tried for actions while in office without parliamentary authorisation.
""As interior minister, it was my duty to curb illegal immigration and fight human smuggling and slavery,"" Salvini commented on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the committee's decision.
The ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and centre-left Democratic Party voted to lift Salvini's immunity, while independents and senators from the right supported him.
Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's small Italia Viva coalition, which supports the government, did not vote, while one 5-Star senator voted against an investigation.
In 14 months as interior minister, Salvini curbed migrant arrivals and threatened fines for rescue ships operated by independent aid groups, while pressing other European states to take in more migrants.
The Senate has already authorised magistrates to press charges over a separate but almost identical case, concerning migrants blocked aboard a coastguard ship last July.

Salvini's anti-immigrant League is still Italy's strongest party with around 27% support, recent polls suggest, but that approval rating has dipped during the coronavirus crisis.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Beijing's planned national security legislation for Hong Kong is set to block its foreign judges from handling national security trials, people familiar with the matter said, which would exacerbate concerns about the city's judicial independence.
Having lost patience with Hong Kong's failure to adopt national security legislation on its own, China announced on Thursday that it would directly enact laws to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference in the city.
The legislation, which the sources said remains subject to change, would also see both central and city government security agencies set up in Hong Kong, they said.
The people familiar with the issue declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.
The Hong Kong government has said the legislation would not affect its judicial independence. 
The Legislative Affairs Commission of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress could not immediately be reached for comment. China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Beijing's push for the legislation follows months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, fuelled by fears among many in the city of the erosion by Beijing of its autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" system set up when it was handed from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
China blames the protests on anti-China “troublemakers”, aided at times by unspecified foreign and external forces. 
It has not said when the legislation would be completed but sources and delegates to China's parliament said it was likely to be enacted before Hong Kong legislative elections in September.
Hong Kong's foreign judges stem from an arrangement established at its 1997 handover to help maintain its credibility as an international financial hub.
Its highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, has 23 judges, of whom 15 are foreign, from places like Britain, Canada and Australia. All serve as non-permanent members of the court, which means they are called on periodically to sit on cases.
While under the new law they would no longer be able to handle national security cases, they will not be excluded from civil, financial or other cases, the sources said.
However, any move to limit the role of foreign judges is likely to alarm some Hong Kong lawyers and judges, who already fear the city's vaunted judicial independence is under threat from Beijing's Communist Party leadership.
The Hong Kong Bar Association said China's plan to impose the law without public consultation or local legislative scrutiny had caused ""deep unease in the local and international community"". 
JUDICIAL TRADITION
Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, enshrines the independence of the judiciary and states that judges may come from other common law jurisdictions.
Andy Tsang, a delegate to China's parliament, the National People's Congress (NPC), said he was not aware of details in the yet-to-be-drafted legislation that could bar foreign judges from national security cases, but cited a similar set-up in nearby Macau.
Macau, a semi-autonomous former Portuguese colony, barred foreign judges from hearing national security cases in 2018.
""In Macau ... only judges of Chinese nationality can hear cases relating to national security, and I believe that will be a very good reference,"" Tsang, a former Hong Kong police commissioner, told Reuters in an interview on Monday.
Another Hong Kong delegate to the largely rubber-stamp NPC, Maggie Chan, proposed a National Security Court where cases could only be heard by Chinese judges, Hong Kong media cited her as saying on the sidelines of the NPC.
INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES
The new legislation is also expected to enable Beijing to establish intelligence agencies in Hong Kong. Mainland security and intelligence services now have no enforcement powers in the city.
The law could also clear the way for a domestic intelligence agency in Hong Kong similar to the colonial-era Special Branch, to deal with national security threats, the territory's previous leader, Leung Chun-ying, told Reuters in an interview on Saturday.
Tsang, now an officer with China's Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and deputy director of the National Narcotics Control Commission, said that either the MPS or the Ministry of State Security, China's main intelligence agency, or both, could be involved in a new security unit in Hong Kong.
""The bill actually says that, the city itself, and the country, will set up dedicated unit, to uphold national security,"" he said.
""I would expect the national security agencies will work with the local police in order for the national security of the country (to) be protected.""
Hong Kong has a 700-officer Security Wing that serving and retired police say has been increasingly involved in monitoring some activists and counter-terrorism operations.
Senior Security Wing officials liaise with mainland security services but Tsang said he expected the new agency to have the powers to investigate, arrest and detain.

""We need this, because we need to act according to the law. And so we would expect the new law to be passed will contain these elements,"" he said.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday its work in Yemen was near a ""potential breaking point"" as coronavirus spreads in the war-damaged country, with rising numbers of families resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children.
Around 80 percent of Yemen's malnourished population relies on humanitarian assistance, making it the world's biggest humanitarian crisis even before coronavirus. 
Last week, the United Nations said its health care system ""has in effect collapsed"", with the virus thought to be spreading throughout the country, and appealed for urgent funding.
""We are reaching a potential breaking point in our programmes where if we don't receive further funding soon, many of our programmes and particularly our cash assistance programmes to internally displaced Yemenis may have to stop,"" said Charlie Yaxley, UNHCR spokesman, at a virtual briefing.
""We are seeing a growing number of families resorting to harmful coping mechanisms such as begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive,"" he added.
UNHCR provides cash assistance programmes to some 1 million people who are internally displaced and rely on the money for food, medicines and shelter, he said.
The country, whose population has among the world's lowest immunity levels to disease, is divided between the Saudi-backed government based in Aden and its foe, the Iran-aligned Houthi group, in the north.
Saudi Arabia, leader of a military coalition fighting the Houthis, and the United Nations are due to co-host a virtual pledging conference on June 2. 
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said on Tuesday it had received around 15 percent of the funding required for the $3.38 billion 2020 Humanitarian Response Plan for Yemen with the United States the top donor.
""The humanitarian situation in Yemen could spin out of control as COVID-19 threatens a population already weakened by years of conflict,"" World Food Programme (WFP) spokeswoman Elizabeth Byrs said at the same briefing, saying the pandemic was threatening food imports.
""WFP expects coronavirus to push many more children in Yemen into acute malnutrition,"" she added, saying over 2 million children were already suffering from it.

BALATONFURED, Hungary (Reuters) - Released from lockdown three weeks ago, Hungarians are making day trips to the blue waters of Lake Balaton, raising hopes that tourism may recover sooner than expected from the damage caused by the coronavirus pandemic. 
As an antidote to cabin fever that also allows for social distancing, many groups and families are chartering sailing boats. Since lockdown ended, the number of bookings for sailing yachts has surged, operators at the lake say.
""Demand (for renting a vessel) is now surely at least as strong as it was at the same time last year,"" said Botond Elod, 35, whose company VizenJo manages a fleet of high-class charter sailing boats.
Travel abroad still limited as part of restrictions to curb the spread of the new coronavirus and Hungarians are making the most of beauty spots and holiday destinations at home.
Valeria Giber, manager of Hajosprogramok, another sailing boat operator, said she also expected demand to match that of last year and that the summer season was already fully booked.
""There is a kind of explosion on our market now... From one day to the next after the announcement (of lockdown ending), inboxes filled up with booking requests."" 
She hopes this surge will offset the revenue lost during lockdown in April and May. Gaps created by foreign tourists postponing or cancelling their reservations are being filled by domestic demand, Giber said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Both North and South Korea violated the armistice agreement that governs their shared border when their troops exchanged gunfire on May 3, the U.S.-led United Nations Command (UNC) said on Tuesday.
A multinational UNC special investigation team concluded that troops from both sides had violated the agreement, which has been in place since the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.
The UNC, which is commanded by an American general, oversees affairs in the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which remain technically at war.
North Korean troops in a guard post committed a violation when they fired four rounds of 14.5mm ammunition at a UNC guard post on the southern side of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) that divides the DMZ, the UNC said in a statement.
South Korean and U.S. officials have said they believe the gunshots were an accident, but the UNC said ""the investigation was unable to definitively determine if the four rounds were fired intentionally or by mistake.""
North Korean military officials acknowledged the receipt of questions from the investigators, but have not provided an official response, the UNC statement said.
North Korea has not commented publicly on the incident.
South Korean troops also violated the armistice agreement when they fired two volleys of gunfire back toward North Korea half an hour later, the UNC concluded.
South Korea's Defence Ministry said it regretted the UNC findings, and they lacked substantive investigation into North Korea's role.
The South Korean military followed proper procedures in responding to the shooting, a ministry statement said.

Prosecutors in the state of Victoria said 19 journalists and 21 publications aided and abetted contempt of court by overseas media and breached suppression orders imposed by the trial judge.
Pell was found guilty in December 2018 of sexually assaulting two choirboys, but reporting on the case was gagged so as not to prejudice another trial on separate charges. 
After the verdict some Australian media said an unnamed high-profile person had been convicted of a serious crime that could not be reported, while some overseas media named Pell and the charges.
The second case was later dropped, and the suppression order was lifted in February 2019. Pell's conviction was overturned by Australia's High Court in April.
Supreme Court of Victoria Justice John Dixon on Tuesday proposed beginning the trial on Nov. 9, although the prosecution and defence have yet to agree on all the issues at stake and whether to go through a single trial or several.
The prosecution is seeking one trial, which would be held before a judge, but the lawyer representing the charged media organisations and reporters said there appeared to be 13 separate controversies.
""The respondents are very anxious for these matters to be resolved, finally, that have been hanging over their heads for far too long, but we do think it's a question of proceeding with some caution,"" Matthew Collins, the lawyer for the media organisations, told the court.
Those facing contempt charges include journalists from Nine Entertainment Co's (AX:NEC) newspapers The Age and the Australian Financial Review and several News Corp (O:NWSA) publications.
Breaches of suppression orders can be punished with jail for up to five years and fines of nearly A$100,000 ($66,000) for individuals and nearly A$500,000 for companies.

The next hearing in the case is set for July.

The flamboyant tycoon, who loved to dance but advised his nearest and dearest to shun gambling, headed one of the world's most lucrative gaming businesses through his flagship firm, SJM Holdings Ltd (HK:0880), valued at about $6 billion.
Shares of the companies in the family empire surged after the news. SJM rose as much as 8.5%, passenger transport firm Shun Tak Holdings Ltd (HK:0242) jumped 17.6% and casino operator Melco climbed 4.9%, outpacing a 2% gain for the benchmark index (HSI).
Born in Hong Kong, Ho had four wives and 17 known children, and was forced to restructure his business after a legal battle erupted within the family in 2012 over his fortune.
Analysts do not expect his death to have a big impact on day-to-day operations. 
His privately held company, Sociedade de Turismo e Diversões de Macau, or STDM, has stakes in everything from luxury hotels to helicopters and horse racing.
Ho spearheaded what is known in Macau as the junket VIP system, whereby middlemen act on behalf of casinos by extending credit to gamblers and taking responsibility for collecting debts.

Some of Ho's children have become successful gaming operators in their own right. Daughter Pansy is the co-chairperson of MGM Resorts' (N:MGM) Macau unit (HK:2282) while son Lawrence runs Melco Resorts & Entertainment (O:MLCO).

TOKYO (Reuters) - Children under the age of two shouldn't wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted a state of emergency for Tokyo and four remaining areas on Monday after the number of infections fell across Japan, but warned that it could be reimposed if the virus started spreading again.
To prevent the virus spread, health experts worldwide are recommending people wear masks when it is difficult to maintain social distancing as countries loosen restrictions following coronavirus shutdowns.
But the Japan Pediatric Association has warned parents that masks are too risky for infants.
""Masks can make breathing difficult because infants have narrow air passages,"" which increases the burden on their hearts, the association said, adding that masks also raise the risk of heat stroke for them.
""Let's stop the use of masks for children under 2-years-old,"" the association said in a notice on its website.
It said that so far there were very few serious coronavirus cases among children and that most kids became infected from family members, with almost no outbreaks at schools or day care facilities.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American Academy of Pediatrics also say children under the age of two should not wear cloth face coverings.

A White House statement amended the timing of the start of the restrictions to 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday, May 26 (0359 GMT on Wednesday, May 27) instead of May 28 as in the original announcement on Sunday.
Two days earlier, Brazil overtook Russia as the world's No. 2 coronavirus hotspot after the United States. Washington's ban applies to foreigners traveling to the United States if they had been in Brazil in the last two weeks. 
Brazil's coronavirus deaths reported in the last 24 hours were higher than fatalities in the United States for the first time on Monday, according to the health ministry. Brazil registered 807 deaths and 620 died in the United States.
Brazil has 374,898 cases, behind the U.S. with 1.637 million. Total deaths in the U.S. has reached 97,988, according to Reuters tally, compared with Brazil at 23,473.
The White House did not give a reason for bringing the travel restriction forward. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration issues, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The travel ban was a blow to right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has followed the example of U.S. President Donald Trump in addressing the pandemic, fighting calls for social distancing and touting unproven drugs.
""It undermines Bolsonaro's claim to have built a relationship with Trump and Brazil is now seen as a privileged ally of the United States,"" said Creomar de Souza, at Brasilia-based consultancy Dharma Political Risk And Strategy. 
Bolsonaro has played down the gravity of the pandemic from the start calling the novel coronavirus a ""little cold."" In the early stages, Trump said he believed the virus would soon go away.
The White House said the travel ban on Brazil would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the United States, but would not apply to the flow of commerce.

Trump's national security adviser Robert O'Brien said he hoped the ban would be temporary.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Early one October morning in 1969, Singapore police officers found the body of a man dumped in a storm drain. He had been stabbed to death, police said, in what became one of the country's most notorious gang killings.
After more than 50 years on the run, one of the men wanted for the murder, Tan Tong Meng, died of a heart attack in Denmark last month, according to former police detectives, online tributes and media reports.
The death of one of Singapore's most high-profile gangsters, and memories of the brazen 1969 mob hit, have revived interest in the city-state's history as a wellspring for organised crime - and surprised younger residents with no knowledge of that past in what is now regarded as one of the world's safest cities.
Tan's demise has also polarised opinion between those who applauded his global ambition and others who loathe criminals in a country where drug traffickers face the death sentence. 
Tan was 72, and also known as Roland Tan, or by his aliases - ""Mr. Big"" and ""The Hainanese Kid"". He was once one of Singapore's most storied fugitives and went on to run a powerful European drug trafficking syndicate out of Amsterdam, according to two former Singapore police detectives and media reports.
Tan's family members did not respond to requests for comment and Singapore police did not immediately have comment. Dutch and Danish police declined to comment.
'SINGAPORE EVER GOT GANGSTERS?'
Whether revered or reviled, Tan has garnered new attention in his home city.
""Wow such great talent from number 1 ... Singapore!"" James Chan commented on a May 10 article about Tan's death in Singapore's main Straits Times newspaper posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""This kind of reputation, no thanks. Nothing to be proud of,"" said Elliot Koh in one of hundreds of other comments on social media sites and blogs. 
Many readers didn't seem to know organised crime had existed in the city-state: ""Singapore ever got gangsters meh?"" read one Facebook post.
But some of those old enough to remember when mob culture thrived in Singapore in the years before and after the island gained independence from Britain in 1965 cautioned against romanticising the past.
""When I was young, I have witnessed a guy going round every hawker stall collecting money. We should never take our safe and mafia free country for granted,"" said commenter Wilfred Lee. 
THE STORY OF MR BIG
Tan's funeral in Copenhagen on April 24 was attended by members of the Hell's Angels, pictures show. It was streamed on a private Facebook page that is followed by hundreds of family members and well-wishers - many from Singapore - who would not have been able to travel to Denmark due to coronavirus lockdowns.
Photograph montages, including shots of an older Tan's slight figure in bright patterned shirts, a cigarette in hand, circulated on instant messenger services. A video of a lavish birthday party, where Tan stood over a three-tier cake as guests snapped pictures on smartphones, was widely shared.
Tan, who escaped Singapore in the aftermath of Lam's death, was one of the country's most wanted murder suspects in the 1970s with the police offering S$2,000 for information leading to his arrest, a large sum at the time.
He fled to Amsterdam via Malaysia and later moved to Denmark where he married a Danish woman, according to media reports, retired Singapore police detective Lionel de Souza, who investigated Tan, and a second former police source who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
Tan ran a restaurant in Copenhagen but moved to Cambodia after being shot by his Vietnamese bodyguard in 2009, according to the second police source and local media reports. He returned to Copenhagen last year, the reports said. 
'SECRET SOCIETIES' 
Singapore's gang culture was derived from ""secret societies"" formed by Chinese settlers in Southeast Asia in the 1800s, said Jean Abshire, a U.S.-based academic who authored 'The History of Singapore'. 
Gangs involved in human trafficking, prostitution and drug smuggling still existed in Singapore after British rule ended but police crackdowns in the 1990s all but eradicated organised crime.
Some young offenders still revere more powerful cartels of the past, according to a 2015 academic study based on interviews with miscreants.
Lionel de Souza, the retired police officer who investigated Tan and other secret society members, said that gangsters shouldn't be glorified.
""It's good riddance to bad rubbish,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans paid a low-key tribute to those who died serving in the U.S. Armed Forces on Monday, with many Memorial Day events canceled because of the coronavirus epidemic that has killed nearly 100,000 people in the United States alone.
In some places, scaled-down ceremonies were broadcast over the internet, as shutdowns to curb the spread of the virus put a damper on what is usually a day of flag-waving parades and crowds celebrating the unofficial start of the U.S. summer.
Spots that would be bustling on a normal Memorial holiday had noticeably thinner crowds. 
Perhaps half of those gathered at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington wore face coverings, recommended as one way to fight infection. Only about one in 10 did so on the boardwalk by the beach in Ocean City, New Jersey.
With casinos closed, nearby Atlantic City was quiet.
Richard Burke, who bought a balloon-popping amusement stand on the boardwalk only a few weeks before the shutdown, was asking customers to use the hand sanitizer he had provided.
""As long as we protect ourselves I think we are OK,"" Burke said.
All 50 states have relaxed coronavirus restrictions to some degree.
Health authorities in California, which has one of the most restrictive coronavirus containment rules in the country, announced on Monday that retail with in-store shopping and places of worship may now open.
In Fort Walton Beach, Florida, a small group of veterans in uniform gathered in Beal Memorial Cemetery to recite the names of the dead and weave flowers into a wreath in a ceremony that was streamed online. Some of the attendees shook hands with each other and few, if any, wore masks.
""Instead of parades or large memorial events, we can remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in a more private way,"" Colonel John Sannes, the commander of the U.S. Army's 7th Special Forces Group, told the gathering.
Inside the rotunda of the Nebraska State Capitol in Lincoln, a candle was lit and veterans took turns, two at a time, to silently stand sentry on either side of a wreath over the course of a 12-hour livestreamed ceremony.
In New York City, organizers of a usually large parade on Staten Island instead arranged to have a smaller convoy of vehicles drive the route. Governor Andrew Cuomo took part in a brief ceremony at the Intrepid Sea (NYSE:SE), Air and Space Museum aboard an aircraft carrier in New York City's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River.
Republican President Donald Trump, who has been criticized for initially playing down the threat posed by the coronavirus, participated in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. He was joined by Vice President Mike Pence, their wives, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, among others.
Trump, who is eager to have the pandemic-stricken economy in at least somewhat better shape to bolster his chances of winning re-election in the Nov. 3 vote, did not wear a mask during his visit to the cemetery in Virginia.
Joe Biden, the prospective Democratic presidential nominee, made his first public appearance outside his Delaware home since quarantining himself 10 weeks ago. He and his wife Jill, both wearing black masks, laid a wreath of white roses at a nearby veterans memorial.
U.S. economic activity in April ground to a virtual standstill and more than 20 million Americans lost their jobs due to the lockdowns imposed in March.

Total cases in the United States of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, have reached more than 1.66 million, the highest in the world, and 97,971 people have died, according to a Reuters tally.

The country, which has emerged from a decade-long financial crisis in the last couple of years, is relying on tourism to help it recover from a nationwide lockdown that brought its economy to a near standstill.
With tables set far apart and waitresses wearing masks, restaurants served the many Greeks keen to get out and enjoy food and a cup of coffee again after roughly two months of confinement.
""We have missed this, this is psychological therapy for us, so of course it's important, very, very important,"" said Katerina Stravaridi from a cafe in Athens.

A hunched figure wearing a face mask drags behind it an entangled mass of stricken faces and lanky limbs. A butterfly flutters out of the mouth of a body laid to rest.
Welcome to ""Ciudad Corona"" (Corona Town), a collection of murals by Cuban artist Yulier Rodriguez in the backyard of a friend's home in southern Havana.
Rodriguez is one of several urban artists who have taken to Cuba's walls to express anguish but also hope regarding the coronavirus pandemic - some in public spaces, others, like his, in private for fear of running into trouble with Communist authorities.
Cuba has reported 1,947 coronavirus cases and 82 deaths so far. Official data shows the Caribbean island registered fewer than 20 new cases per day over the last week compared to the 50 to 60 that were occurring daily in mid-April. 
""I felt compelled to express the energy of the moment, the way this illness drags along everyone in its path, be they rich or poor, military or civil,"" Rodriguez told Reuters.
Graffiti started gaining traction in Cuba in the mid-2010s due partly to the increasing influence of international culture as the country slowly opened, allowing greater internet access and the opportunity to travel.
For some artists, Cuba's many abandoned or dilapidated buildings made for the perfect canvas. The flipside is that public spaces are tightly controlled, so artists have to be careful with either their message or their identity.
In a more upbeat mural in central Havana, ""Courage"" is emblazoned in capital letters above a multi-storey black-and-white mural of a child wearing a face mask on a dilapidated building.
""In Cuba, you need to live with courage all the time,"" the author ""Mr Myl"" said, declining to disclose his real name and covering his face with a floppy hat and face mask.
In Cojimar, a fishing village east of Havana that inspired Ernest Hemingway's novel, ""The Old Man and the Sea (NYSE:SE),"" a group of youngsters have painted colorful murals on ruins by the sea. One depicting a child holding a rainbow-colored pinwheel against a flowery background is dedicated to healthcare workers fighting the virus.

Hip hop musician Sekou Sarrias, who led the project, said the aim was not only to express gratitude but also to provide joy to those living among these ruins.

PARAMARIBO (Reuters) - Surinamese President Desi Bouterse, a former military ruler who has dominated the country's politics in recent decades, was seeking a third term in an election on Monday, about six months after a local court found him guilty of murder in absentia.
The court in November sentenced the 74-year-old president to 20 years in prison for ordering the execution of 15 adversaries in the former Dutch colony who had spoken out against his seizure of power in a February 1980 coup.
Bouterse, who has avoided prison due to his presidential immunity, has appealed the conviction, and the court is due to reconvene next month. Additionally, in 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him to 11 years in prison for drug smuggling. Bouterse never served the sentence but can still be arrested in countries that have extradition treaties with the Netherlands.
Suriname's economy has collapsed under Bouterse, and his government has faced multiple corruption scandals. But he hopes to benefit from the recent discovery of vast oil reserves off the coast of the South American country, with a population of 575,000.
To win the presidency, Bourtese's National Democratic Party must win at least a plurality in the 51-member assembly. According to an opinion poll this month, his party is expected to win 14 to 17 seats, considerably less than in 2015. 
His main opponent is former police commissioner Chan Santokhi of the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Reform Party.
Due to a coronavirus lockdown, there have been no large-scale election rallies, and parties appealed to voters using road shows with decorated cars and political songs. 
Bouterse led Suriname through the 1980s as head of a military government, then assumed office again in 2010 and in 2015 secured re-election to another five-year term.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski denied on Monday any wrongdoing as he reacted to accusations of inadequate supervision over procurement of equipment to help combat the coronavirus pandemic.
The allegations against Szumowski, a popular politician in the nationalist government, have hit the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party before a presidential election expected at the end of June or early July, according to political scientists.
Poland has a lower coronavirus death rate than many other European countries. According the latest tally on the health ministry's Twitter account, Poland had reported 1,007 deaths and 21,631 cases of the coronavirus as of Monday afternoon.
But Polish media have accused Szumowski's ministry of inadequate supervision of the procurement of items such as protective masks. Gazeta Wyborcza daily reported that the ministry bought masks with fake certificates from a skiing instructor who is a family fiend of Szumowski.
""Neither I, nor my brother, nor my wife, have done anything wrong. There is not a single fact that would indicate any irregularities,"" Szumowski told private broadcaster Polsat News.
""It is evidently a game resulting from the election calendar and I have become a bit of a target to hit,"" Szumowski said.
President Andrzej Duda, an ally of PiS, remains the favourite in the election but opinion polls show support for Duda is falling as he and PiS struggle with image problems.
A government spokesman apologised on Monday on behalf of Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki who was photographed sitting in a restaurant with officials, even though he is only allowed to do so with his family.
Szumowski told weekly newspaper Sieci that Poland, which has been gradually easing its coronavirus lockdown, was well equipped to avoid a return to it after successfully halting the spread of an outbreak in Silesia.

""My first point for Africa, my first concern, is that a lack of testing is leading to a silent epidemic in Africa. So we must continue to push leaders to prioritize testing,"" special envoy Samba Sow told a news conference.
The WHO's director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said Africa was the region with the fewest diagnosed coronavirus cases, accounting for less than 1.5% of the global total and just 0.1% of deaths.
The WHO regional director for Africa, Matshidiso Moeti, said some countries had taken measures to curb the disease at a high economic cost. Those measures meant the pandemic was having a milder impact so far than some models had predicted, Moeti said. 
Tedros credited the continent's experience dealing with other epidemics as helping it scale up its response to the coronavirus and be spared the impact seen elsewhere so far.

All African countries had preparedness plans in place, he said, although there were still ""gaps and vulnerabilities"".

That brings to more than 1,000 the number of people who have attempted the crossing this month despite the closure of Libya's international borders because of the coronavirus. 
The pandemic and a surge in fighting around Libya's capital Tripoli have added to the problems for the thousands of migrants trying to pass through the country en route to Europe.
The International Organisation for Migration said 317 migrants were returned to Libya on Sunday night. More than 70 others were stopped and returned earlier on Sunday. 
The United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, said two people on the boats stopped on Sunday night had drowned.

The blast targeted a security point at the entrance to Taraghin, 780 km (590 miles) south of Tripoli, but did not cause any casualties, a resident said.
A local military commander, Abdesselam Shanqala, said the explosives were concealed in a vehicle belonging to the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) and there were no casualties. 
An LNA military source said Islamic State was growing more active in the south after the arrest of one of its commanders. 
The last attack in Libya that Islamic State said it was responsible for took place in May last year on a pipeline in the south. 
The group became active in Libya after the turmoil that followed the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, and it took control of the coastal city of Sirte in 2015 but lost it in late 2016 to local forces backed by U.S. airstrikes.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian prosecutors asked a court on Monday to sentence former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, who is on trial accused of spying for the United States, to 18 years in a maximum security prison, his lawyer said.
Whelan, a U.S. national who also holds British, Canadian and Irish passports, has been in custody since he was detained in a Moscow hotel room in December 2018. He says he was set up in a sting and has pleaded not guilty to the charge.
""The prosecution has made a very harsh demand, it's absolutely unjustified and groundless. To be honest, we're in shock,"" Whelan's lawyer Vladimir Zherebenkov told reporters after Monday's hearing.
The court will announce its verdict on June 15, he said. 
The trial, which began on March 23, has been closed to the public as its content broaches classified information. Many of the case's details have emerged through his lawyer. 
U.S. Ambassador in Moscow John Sullivan said the proceedings amounted to a ""secret trial"" and a ""mockery of justice"". 
""There is no legitimacy to a procedure that is hidden behind closed doors. It is not transparent, it is not fair, and it is not impartial,"" he said. 
The prosecution accuses Whelan of being at least a ranking U.S. military intelligence colonel and that he was caught red-handed trying to obtain secrets, his lawyer said. 
The defence said Whelan had only believed he was receiving photographs of a trip that he and an acquaintance had been on, not classified material, and that he had been tricked, Zherebenkov said. 
""This was a game by Russia's Federal Security Service...,"" he said.
U.S. authorities have called the charges against Whelan spurious and have called on Russia to release him, describing the case as a ""significant obstacle"" to improving bilateral ties.

Whelan, 50, has used his appearances at hearings to allege he has been ill-treated by prison guards and been denied medical attention. Russian authorities have accused him of faking health problems to draw attention to his case.

LIMA (Reuters) - Homesick Peruvians around the world in coronavirus lockdowns have been logging online in rising numbers to learn Quechua, the Andean language spoken by the Inca people.
Qorichaska Quispe, whose first name means ""Golden Bird"" in Quechua, told Reuters there had been a sixfold increase in hits on her ""Vive el Quechua"" Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page this April compared to last year, with students logging on from Peru but also Europe, Asia and elsewhere in South America.
One class in which the shyly smiling Quispe taught her followers to say ""I love you"" and ""I miss you"" drew 6,000 viewers. Others celebrating folkloric heroes, ancestral food, and native species attracted up to 14,000. 
""During quarantine, we can all feel sad or lonely at times, some people are far from their families, and we offer them a reminder of their identity,"" Quispe told Reuters.
Quechua spread across southern Latin America with the Incan Empire five centuries ago and is at present spoken by some 10 million people, 3.7 million of them in Peru, where it is one of three official languages.
Speakers largely live in remote areas, however, and it has ceased to be passed down through generations, with most Peruvians opting for Spanish instead.
Now there are the green shoots of a cultural renaissance, with Quechua redeployed for a state television news broadcast, a box office hit film and in rap songs garnering cult status on YouTube. 
One of Quispe's students told Reuters he had previously tried to learn but stopped for lack of time. 
Another, Paloma Abregú, who was born in the Peruvian highlands but now lives in the capital Lima, said she wanted to understand her background better.
""A language carries quite a different culture and world view, which can only be understood when you speak it,"" she said.

Italy is gradually relaxing a nationwide lockdown imposed in early March, permitting travel between regions and meetings between friends, and allowing bars to serve drinks as long as a two-metre security distance is respected.
However, hundreds of new cases of the virus and deaths are being recorded every day and local administrators are worried contagions may surge again if citizens do not respect the rules.
TV images over the first post-lockdown weekend showed traffic jams in Naples and crowds in Milan, while the Veneto region published a video with images of patients in intensive care to convince people to comply with security measures.
""Those who fuel night life are betraying the sacrifices of millions of Italians,"" Regional Affairs Minister Francesco Boccia told daily newspaper ""La Stampa"" on Monday.
Boccia said the government would recruit volunteers, called civic assistants, to help with checking crowds and for community services, such as taking groceries to people who need them.
He added they would be recruited from volunteers and from beneficiaries of the government's basic income support scheme.
Early in May, when Italy began to soften lockdown measures, large groups of people gathered in parks and in the canal area of Milan, one of the cities worst-hit by the coronavirus, provoking the ire of Mayor Giuseppe Sala.

Sala said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday he was frustrated by some citizens' failure to follow the rules, adding it was ""unthinkable"" to repeat what happened last weekend.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel will not miss a ""historic opportunity"" to extend its sovereignty to parts of the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Monday, calling the move one of his new government's top tasks.
Palestinians consider such a step as illegal annexation of occupied land they seek for a future state. Last week, they declared an end to security cooperation with Israel and its ally, the United States, in protest at the territorial plan.
Netanyahu has pledged to put Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank under Israeli sovereignty. He has set July 1 as a starting date for cabinet discussions on the issue, which has also raised alarm within the European Union.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the matter complex and said it required coordination with Washington. Netanyahu's new political partner, centrist Benny Gantz, has been equivocal about de facto annexation.
At a meeting of legislators of his right-wing Likud party on Monday, Netanyahu set land moves in the West Bank as ""perhaps the first in importance in many respects"" of the tasks to be undertaken by the government he and Gantz formed on May 17.
""We have a historic opportunity, which hasn't existed since 1948, to apply sovereignty judiciously as a diplomatic...step in Judea and Samaria,"" he said, referring to the year of Israel's birth and using the biblical names for the West Bank.
""It is a big opportunity and we will not let it pass by,"" he said a day after the start of his corruption trial. He denies charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
Netanyahu has cited U.S President Donald Trump's plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace as underpinning de facto annexation. The Palestinians have rejected the proposal, announced in January, under which most Jewish settlements would be incorporated into ""contiguous Israeli territory"".

Palestinians and most countries view the settlements on land Israel took in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal. Israel disputes this. Israeli critics of annexation have voiced concern it could increase anti-Israeli violence.

CHERNYAKHIV, Ukraine (Reuters) - Coronavirus or no, Vadym Diachenko needed no persuading when an employment agency offered to fly him back to Poland from his native Ukraine to work at a meatpacking plant.
Diachenko, 26, is among the first seasonal workers to return to Poland on specially chartered flights as lockdown measures in both countries against the coronavirus pandemic begin to ease.
The COVID-19 crisis has disrupted the flow of migrants including in Poland, where 1-2 million Ukrainians help plug labour shortages in industries such as construction and farming.
""People are sitting here and don't know what money to live on and how to survive,"" Diachenko told Reuters before his flight back to Poland, where he will return to a meatpacking plant where had previously worked last year.
""For me personally, when I was offered to go abroad, I did not have to think and I did not hesitate, I was ready to accept all their conditions and go for work.""
Workers have their temperatures taken at Kiev's Boryspil airport before departure, and are issued masks. On arrival, they are put in quarantine for two weeks in hostels or rented apartments provided by the employment agency that recruited them, Gremi Personal. 
""We currently work with over 120 companies, every day we have several new requests from companies that need workers,"" the agency's boss, Yevhen Kyrychenko, said.
For Ukraine, such workers have been a valuable source of foreign exchange. Ukrainians earned $12.9 billion in remittances last year, or 7.8% of economic output. But that source of income dried up in March, when tens of thousands of workers streamed home before both countries shut their borders. 

Lockdown measures in Ukraine are expected to push the country into a sharp recession, with many businesses either shut or operating with restrictions.

The Czech Republic has reopened its hard-hit economy in stages since April 20 as new cases stay low and more people recover. Of almost 9,000 cases reported, two thirds have recovered, while 315 deaths have been recorded.
However, the country has seen two hot spots emerge in recent weeks, including at a coal mine in the east where 221 employees have been infected.
While that has pushed up overall numbers, health officials say the outbreak is under control and reopening can continue.
From Monday, face masks are required only on public transport or in enclosed spaces. Many people have said they will still wear the coverings.
""It is not over, I think that one can be never too cautious. (But) it is more pleasant without the mask,"" said Zuzana Kirajova as her 18-month-old son ran across Prague's medieval Charles Bridge, now almost empty without tourists.
Hotels and other accommodation have now reopened, while some services like tattoo parlours have also resumed work. Children have begun returning to elementary schools on a voluntary basis.
Limits on public gatherings will be relaxed next month, with 500 people permitted from June 8 and 1,000 two weeks later.
That will let soccer matches be played in front of at least some supporters.

With a total of 2,376 cases and dozens of new infections each day, Ivory Coast has yet to contain the virus. But authorities are confident pupils can study together in safety after the introduction of extra hygiene measures.
In Abidjan's Adjame neighbourhood, children in backpacks queued to wash their hands under a teacher's watchful eye before entering their school, where they sat just one to a desk with bottles of sanitising gel within reach. 
""At first we were a little scared. When we saw that the protective measures were being respected, the fear went away,"" said 14-year-old Samira Cisse.
Nearby countries are likely to follow closely whether the Ivory Coast's decision to reopen schools causes a spike in infection. With millions of children still at home, aid agency Save the Children says many could face serious setbacks due to limited options for distance learning in parts of Sub-Saharan Africa.
The Ivorian education ministry told Reuters it appreciated the seriousness of its decision. 
""We also have an imperative duty to ensure that the children entrusted to us can complete their education,"" said ministry official Assoumou Kabran.
Reopening classrooms also means thousands of pupils and their teachers must be ferried back to boarding schools outside Abidjan, epicentre of the epidemic.
French teacher Patrick Yobouet, 38, waited with hundreds of others in a sun-baked stadium to board buses out of the city. 
""We're a bit worried as we leave, because we don't know if we have the coronavirus or not or if the children are contaminated or not,"" he said.

LISBON (Reuters) - The number of Portuguese young people requesting jobless benefits spiked 52% last month from a year earlier, way above the increase for other age groups, amid the coronavirus lockdown, data showed on Monday
Overall, nearly 200,000 people received unemployment benefits last month, a 17% jump from the same period last year and a near 14% increase from the previous month, social security service numbers showed.
There was also an almost 33% increase among those aged 25-34 and a 20.4% rise among people aged between 35 and 44.
""For now I'm financially comfortable with the compensation given,"" said Mariana, 28, who lost her job in a Lisbon-based startup last month, when it dismissed 100 employees due to pandemic. 
""For me it is more the frustration and stress of not knowing when I will find a job because of the current crisis,"" she said.
Last week official data showed just over 48,500 people in Portugal registered as newly unemployed in April, bringing the total of those without jobs to around 392,000.
Portugal declared a state of emergency on March 18, shutting most non-essential services, which are now slowly reopening as part of a sector-by-sector lockdown exit plan in place from May 4.
Finance Minister Mario Centeno said the unemployment rate, which had been falling as Portugal slowly recovered from the debt crisis, could hit around 10% by the end of the year, compared with 6.7% reported during the first quarter of 2020.

The coronavirus outbreak so far numbering 30,788 confirmed cases and 1,330 deaths - much lower than neighbouring Spain - is still set to hammer Portugal's economy. The International Monetary Fund expects gross domestic product to fall 8% this year.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain urged foreign holidaymakers on Monday to return from July as one of Europe's strictest lockdowns eased, though tourism businesses were sceptical about salvaging the summer season. 
The world's second-most visited nation closed its doors and beaches in March to handle the COVID-19 pandemic, imposing a two-week quarantine on overseas visitors. But that requirement will be lifted from July 1, a government statement said. 
""The worst is behind us,"" Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya tweeted with emojis of a bikini, sunglasses and a suitcase.
""In July we will gradually open Spain to international tourists, lift the quarantine, ensure the highest standards of health safety. We look forward 2 welcoming you!""
Spain normally draws 80 million people a year with tourism accounting for over 12% of gross domestic product and an even bigger share of jobs, so the summer season is crucial to possibilities of mitigating a looming recession.
Bars and restaurants in Madrid and Barcelona were allowed to open outside spaces at half capacity from Monday, but many stayed closed as owners weighed the value of catering to just a few. 
Some of those who did open, after gloved and masked staff cleaned terraces and placed tables far apart, were pessimistic.
""It's complicated, we are not going to be able to save the tourist season, unless (enough) foreigners come,"" said Alfonso Gomez, a restaurant owner in Barcelona. 
On the streets, passersby enjoying new-found freedoms were more upbeat. ""It's nice just to feel a bit of normality again after so long,"" said Rosie, a writer and Barcelona resident.
PARK PLEASURE
Madrilenos were delighted to be allowed back into the main Retiro park. 
""This is great, I was really looking forward to it. And so was my dog!"" said interior designer Anna Pardo, walking her pet in the sunshine. Others jogged and chatted in the Retiro's shaded alleys or stopped for a moment to enjoy its lake, still devoid of the usual rowing boats. 
While most pupils in Spain still need to study online, some schools reopened in the northern Basque region. Students' temperature was taken as they entered wearing masks. 
Spain has recorded 28,752 coronavirus deaths and 235,772 cases, but has seen daily fatalities drop to fewer than 100 for the last week. 
The prospect of foreign tourism from July lifted shares of tourism-related stocks, including hotel operator Melia Hotels which rose 14% in early trading.
The tourism and leisure sector tops areas getting most support from state-backed credit lines meant to help businesses. It has received 6.4 billion out of the 38 billion euros ($41 billion) granted over past weeks, according to data from state credit agency ICO.
Jose Carlos Ramon, head of Madrid's restaurants association AMER, said only one in four bars and restaurants in the capital has a terrace and reopening is costly. In Spain as a whole, only about 15% have reopened, he said.
The government was due to discuss on Tuesday how to move on with the gradual phasing out of the lockdown, amid growing tensions between regions and the central government. 
The current system might be loosened to allow a more tailored approach for each area. Cabinet was also due to announce 10 days of mourning to honour those dead from the pandemic.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced mutiny in his party and fury across Britain on Monday for refusing to sack his closest aide Dominic Cummings, accused of flouting the coronavirus lockdown by driving 250 miles from London.
Defending one of Britain's most powerful men, Johnson said at the weekend Cummings acted ""responsibly and legally and with integrity"" when he travelled in March from London to Durham in northern England with his son and his wife, who was ill with COVID-19 symptoms.
Many believe that was hypocritical given the government's mantra at the time that everyone should stay at home. Those in a household where anyone has symptoms are supposed to self-isolate at home for 14 days.
""What planet are they on?"" asked a front page headline in the Daily Mail, an influential right-wing paper usually supportive of Johnson.
Cummings was due to make a public statement and to answer questions later on Monday,  ITV  (LON:ITV) and Sky News reported. A Downing Street spokeswoman declined to comment.
With a death toll around 43,000, Britain is the worst-hit country in Europe and the government was already under pressure over its handling of the pandemic.
Scientists and lawmakers said the Cummings furore would make it harder to ensure the public kept complying with official social distancing guidance.
""Boris Johnson has trashed all the advice we have given on how to build trust and secure adherence to the measures necessary to control COVID-19,"" said behavioural scientist Stephen Reicher, one of a panel that advises the government. 
About 20 Conservative lawmakers defied Johnson by calling publicly for Cummings to quit or be sacked. They and others reported being inundated with mail from constituents who had followed the guidance and now felt there was one rule for people close to Johnson and another for everyone else.
""The government should recognise what families have gone through and what people are thinking and saying. It is thus important that Dominic Cummings should now stand down,"" said lawmaker Peter Aldous on Twitter.
""RISIBLE DEFENCE""
The acting Durham police commissioner, Steve White, said he had asked the area's chief constable to ""establish the facts concerning any potential breach of the law"" and said the case was ""a major issue of public interest and trust"".
In an unusual outpouring, more than a dozen Church of England bishops publicly condemned Johnson and Cummings.
""The PM's risible defence of Cummings is an insult to all those who have made such sacrifices to ensure the safety of others,"" said Johne Inge, the bishop of Worcester, on Twitter.
The decision by Johnson to keep Cummings contrasts with the cases of Scotland's chief medical officer and a senior epidemiologist who advised the government, both of whom resigned after admitting they had broken lockdown rules. 
The architect of the successful 2016 referendum campaign to leave the EU, Cummings, 48, has long been a polarising figure. But, ominously for him and for Johnson, many of the lawmakers and newspaper columnists calling for him to be sacked were Brexit supporters, not his usual critics.
Johnson's office said Cummings made the journey to his parents' property in County Durham to ensure his four-year-old son could be properly cared for by relatives if he fell ill along with his wife.
But that failed to appease people who had stayed away from dying loved ones or from funerals because of the lockdown rules.
John Wilson, a man who lost his wife Pauline to COVID-19 in March and was unable to be with her in hospital, spoke of his ""rage"" at Johnson in a letter to his local lawmaker which he posted on Twitter.
""I would like to know what, if anything, you intend to do about this,"" Wilson said in the letter.
A small number of Conservative lawmakers voiced support for Cummings, describing his predicament as a trial-by-media.

""I have lots of questions to be answered before I pass judgment or comment,"" said lawmaker Lee Anderson. ""I suspect there will be a few more twists to this story over the next few days.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's central and regional governments were at odds on Monday over when and how far to ease contact distancing rules, with allies of Chancellor Angela Merkel warning that scrapping them risks unleashing a new wave of coronavirus infections.
The row erupted after Bodo Ramelow, premier of the eastern state of Thuringia, said on Saturday he would scrap rules on mask-wearing and distancing, relying instead on local measures. The states set most rules affecting day-to-day life in Germany. 
Though his proposal echoes federal government policy, which envisages gradually reopening the economy while responding fast to outbreaks with local lockdowns and contact-tracing, officials fear muddying the message could undermine public discipline.
""Under no circumstances should the impression be given that the pandemic is over,"" Health Minister Jens Spahn told Bild newspaper, saying a clear message on social distancing, hygiene and mask-wearing would make it harder for the virus to spread.
Numbers of new virus infections have fallen sharply over the past month. Shops, bars, restaurants, museums and churches have reopened, though many Germans continue to work from home and public transport is still less busy than usual.
Germany has also seen protests calling for a more rapid lifting of coronavirus lockdown restrictions.
State-owned railway operator Deutsche Bahn said on Monday it would start increasing long-distance travel again, alerting passengers when their train was more than half full and letting them rebook onto a lower occupancy service.
A draft document by Helge Braun, head of Merkel's office, recommends that from June 6 private gatherings of up to 20 people could be held, wherever possible in the open air. Gatherings are currently limited to two households.
But authorities know they have to tread a fine line between reopening society and keeping Germans safe. In the central state of Hesse, a single church service on May 10 caused at least 107 new cases, they said.

The Danish police said couples would need to show shared text messages, private photos or personal information about their partner.
""They can bring along a photo or a love letter,"" deputy chief Allan Dalager Clausen told Danish broadcaster DR.
""I realize these are very intimate things, but the decision to let in the partner ultimately rests on the judgment of the individual police officer,"" he said.
While good news for separated couples, the move highlights some of the issues lawmakers and authorities around the world face as they gradually reopen their countries' borders.
Denmark closed its borders for non-citizens on March 14 to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, meaning only people with a clear purpose could enter the country.
Since then, elderly couples have been seen on the Danish-German border drinking coffee on each side of border and holding hands over the barriers to stay in touch with each other.
Some lawmakers took to social media to express their displeasure with the new guidelines, saying it was a violation of the right of privacy.
""I've never heard of a country where entry requires the showing of intimate texts or photos from a partner. We finally allowed couples to visit each other, but did not abolish the right of privacy,"" Kristian Hegaard of the Social-Liberal Party said on Twitter. 
Summer cabin owners and grandparents of Danish citizens will now also be seen as having a creditable purpose to visit Denmark, while the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have issued a new set of guidelines for business travel in and out of Denmark.

LISBON (Reuters) - Leaning over the golden-plated counter of the ""Fantastic World of Sardines"" in Portugal's capital, cashier Andre Moureira waited for just a single customer to break the boredom of the morning.
""It's definitely very quiet,"" he rued at the tourist-oriented shop where only three or four people have been trickling in a day to see the glitzy cans and even a fish-themed carousel.
Down the road, Rosa Amelia leaned into the window display of her shop Discoteca Amalia selling CDs of the melancholic Portuguese fado music, picking up each and carefully dusting them down. ""I've had four customers since I opened on May 4,"" she said. ""It's horrible.""
For two-and-a-half months during the coronavirus crisis, Portuguese businesses have struggled through a near-total collapse in custom with little to no state aid. 
Since the start of the pandemic, a total of 83,000 companies received an average of just 432 euros ($471) per worker in government funds to prop up salaries, Ministry of Labour data showed. 
Rent, mortgages and bank loan repayments were suspended on a temporary basis, but debts will need to be repaid. 
Some 6.2 billion euros totalling 3% of GDP were allocated in credit lines for companies - but that was far less than similar schemes in other European nations where, for example, the figure was 8% in neighbouring Spain and 40% in Italy. 
As Portugal's restrictions ease, shops and restaurants are slowly rolling up blinds and unlocking doors, faced with losing access to support for layoffs altogether if they do not open within eight days of being allowed to do so.
But the days are slow, to say the least, and with rising debts, no liquidity and barely any revenue on the horizon, the atmosphere has turned gloomy just when it had been picking up from years of austerity.
""Businesses were just getting the confidence to make investments and long-term plans again. But without liquidity to get through this, we'll end up right back where we started,"" said Ana Jacinto of restaurant and hotel association AHRESP. 
'DRIBS AND DRABS OF AID'
Portugal's economy is dominated by small businesses. 
A mere 5% of firms employ more than 10 people, according to the National Institute of Statistics, and just under one in five of its workforce is self-employed.
Before the coronavirus, things were finally looking up as exports and tourism created more jobs and boosted revenues.
Finance Minister Mario Centeno had just achieved his long-time goal: converting a deficit measuring 4.5% of GDP when the Socialists took office in 2015 to a surplus of 0.2% at the end of 2019.
But with one of the smallest household savings rates in the European Union and the lowest minimum wage in Western Europe, personal finances were nowhere near robust enough to withstand a sudden drop in income.
As the weeks have rolled by, the government has expanded support programmes bit-by-bit. Each group added to the list would be eligible for payments from the next month onwards, if they could prove a drop in income of 40% over 30 days.
""Support measures are coming in dribs and drabs,"" said Susana Peralta, economist at Nova University. 
""But the slowness of our social security system is known, and we just don't have enough information on what is going on. Who is getting help, are there delays, and why?""
Of the 6.2 billion euros allocated in credit, just 1.1 billion has reached applicants' bank accounts so far - a delay Prime Minister Antonio Costa blamed on banks taking a long time to assess whether applicants were credit-worthy.

1686,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 07:46AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Ukraine's anti-graft bureau probes state tender for medical suits,"By Natalia Zinets
KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian anti-corruption officials are investigating a tender for 71,000 hospital protective suits during the coronavirus pandemic after the government for the first time bypassed its own procurement rules in the health sector.
Ukraine, long dogged by rampant corruption, has won rare praise from international donors for its efforts to overhaul procurement processes and tackle graft in its health system. The donors' aid, which hinges on Kiev's success in tackling graft, is sorely needed as a deep recession looms.
Asked about the tender, Ukraine's anti-corruption bureau (NABU) told Reuters it was working on a pretrial investigation into possible abuse of office after an unnamed lawmaker raised concerns on the issue. NABU gave no further details, saying that divulging information could harm its investigation.
The head of Medical Procurement of Ukraine (MPU), a state body set up in 2018 to combat corruption in the awarding of health sector contracts, accused the government of violating its own rules by overruling his agency's choice for the tender and awarding the contract to a company that delivered the suits very late and at an inflated price.
""This practice is counterproductive and illegal,"" Arsen Zhumadilov told Reuters in an interview.
The MPU handles procurement of medicines and medical equipment on behalf of the health ministry.
The health ministry denies any wrongdoing in the medical suits case and said it was forced to act due to Zhumadilov's own mismanagement of the situation. 
URGENT NEED 
The row comes at a testing time for Ukraine, which has so far reported 21,245 cases of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the new coronavirus, with 623 deaths. Medics accounted for about a fifth of Ukraine's cases, highlighting the urgent need for more protective suits.
Last month MPU conducted a tender and awarded the contract to Textil-Kontakt, which had already supplied suits to hospitals. But the government voided the deal, saying Textil's gear offered no better protection than a painter's overalls and lacked the proper certification. 
""(Doctors) need personal protective equipment. If, instead of a biological protection suit, a house painter's overall is bought … well, I'm sorry,"" Health Minister Maksym Stepanov told Reuters.
Textil and Zhumadilov said Textil's suits fulfilled health ministry criteria. It had already made around 23,500 suits when the contract was cancelled, said Textil founder Oleksandr Sokolovsky. 
The government then awarded the contract to a firm called Meddiv, which charged 489 hryvnias ($18) per suit, compared to Textil's 245 hryvnias.
Meddiv did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.
Meddiv imported the suits from China, causing weeks of delay, and as of May 19 only around 29,000 had arrived in Ukraine, according to customs documents published by an opposition lawmaker.
Meddiv's lack of experience in handling larger contracts or overseas shipments should have excluded it from the bidding process, Zhumadilov said.
""Our anti-corruption officer said that according to our procedures this company could not have qualified for our tender,"" he added.

Putin signed a decree, published on Saturday, that would allow remote and online voting to be introduced at the federal level, with sponsors of the bill saying the coronavirus outbreak had made the changes necessary. 
In March, Putin postponed a vote on constitutional amendments, already approved by parliament and Russia's Constitutional Court, that would reset his presidential term tally to zero, permitting him to serve two more back-to-back, six-year terms until 2036.
In an interview published by Rossiskaya Gazeta late on Sunday, elections chief Ella Pamfilova said initial trials and testing would be needed before electronic balloting. ""Remote voting will not be carried out on a national scale. We are talking about no more than three or four regions.""
Originally scheduled for April 22, the vote was postponed indefinitely in late March, with Putin citing the coronavirus epidemic as the reason for the move. 
Pamfilova said in the interview with Rossiskaya Gazeta that the election commission was working off the assumption that Putin would name the date for the new vote one month in advance. 
She said benefits of electronic voting include raising turnout, increasing the speed and accuracy of processing votes and lowering the cost of holding elections. 
She added that introducing the new system would be gradual and require a strong network and computing infrastructure in place to ensure it can handle the demands of millions of citizens and potential hacking attacks.

MANILA (Reuters) - One by one, Michelle Asinto's six children take the plate of rice doused in soy sauce and eat their share before passing it on.
This is what a meal can look like in the slums around the Philippine capital Manila. Under lockdown since March 16, many families have lost regular incomes and forced to survive on government aid that can be sporadic and often not enough. 
""Every day we just wait for our ration but it only comes once or twice a week,"" said Asinto, 42, whose plywood and tin house sits precariously on top of another, reachable only by ladder.
They share a common area with dozens of other people, making social distancing almost impossible. Face masks, though mandatory, are an expense few can afford. 
Because her family lives illegally along the trash-filled estuary, Estero de Magdalena, it did not qualify for two cash payments of 5,000-8,000 pesos ($99-$158) in aid the government handed out in April and May.
At Aimelyn Robeno's home, three generations are crammed into a tiny, sweltering space, including siblings and 10-month-old baby. 
""I actually think I'll get sick inside this house because of the intense heat,"" said Robeno, 29.
""We may be saved from the virus but it doesn't matter if we're going to die of hunger anyway.""
Some quarantine restrictions in place in Manila were eased 10 days ago, but many remain. Transport curbs means no work for rickshaw driver Loreto Vergara who lives in Manila's Tondo area and spends entire days at his 10 square meter (108 sq ft) home, with his six children, son-in-law and grandchild. 
""We're already the most vulnerable, and yet we're still the ones given the least,"" said Vergara, 47, preparing for a meal of sweet potatoes donated by a neighbor.
""It's really hard to stay indoors in a place like this. It's too hot. It's as if you're under a fire."" 
Maribel Ballena, 28, has four mouths to feed. She earns some money selling garlic at the market. 
""Most days we just eat two meals, one of sardines, and instant noodles,"" she said.
The Philippines has 14,319 confirmed coronavirus cases overall, among those 873 deaths.

1689,By Reuters,"<span>May 25, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>","Hong Kong and Beijing officials defend security laws, citing threat of terrorism","By James Pomfret and Twinnie Siu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry office in Hong Kong and the city's security chief on Monday defended proposed national security laws by describing some acts in mass pro-democracy protests last year as terrorism. 
Several government departments issued statements in defence of the proposal after the biggest protest in the city since the coronavirus lockdown on Sunday.
The security legislation, some details of which were announced last week, aims to tackle secession, subversion and terrorist activities and could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in semi-autonomous Hong Kong, one of the world's leading financial hubs.
Pro-democracy activists and politicians say the legislation could erode Hong Kong's freedoms, guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement under which former colonial power Britain returned the territory to China in 1997.
At a briefing for diplomats, foreign business chambers and correspondents, China's Foreign Commissioner in Hong Kong, Xie Feng, said the laws would only target a minority of ""troublemakers"" who had posed ""imminent danger"" to China's national security.
""The legislation will alleviate the grave concerns among local and foreign business communities about the violent and terrorist forces,"" Xie said. 
He declined to clarify specifics of the proposed laws that have stoked concerns, including when the full legislation would be enacted, what specific acts would be outlawed, and whether it would have retroactive effect.
Asked whether the security agencies to be set up in Hong Kong would have law enforcement powers, Xie said: ""Concerning the details, they are still being deliberated so I'm not in a position to tell you right now."" 
Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials have come out in recent days seeking to reassure investors their interests would not be harmed and criticisng protesters.
Police Commissioner Chris Tang cited 14 cases involving explosives which he said were commonly used in terrorist attacks overseas, and five seizures of firearms and ammunition since protests began.
Secretary for Security John Lee said ""terrorism is growing"" and harmful activities such as calling for Hong Kong's independence were becoming more rampant.
In scenes evoking memories of last year's protests, crowds thronged city streets on Sunday, many chanting ""Hong Kong independence, the only way out.""
Police said they arrested more than 180 people, firing tear gas and water cannon for the first time in months. 
Calls for independence are anathema to Beijing, which considers Hong Kong an inalienable part of the country. The proposed framework stresses Beijing’s intent to crack down on such acts.
Protests are expected to flare again on Wednesday, with the city's legislature set to debate a bill to criminalise abuse of China's national anthem. 
Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote on his blog that the national security law itself does not affect investor confidence, only the ""misunderstanding"" of it does.
STATUS CONCERNS
The United States, Australia, Britain, Canada and others have expressed concerns about the legislation, widely seen as a potential turning point for China's freest city.
Washington is considering whether to maintain Hong Kong's special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a global financial centre.
Several foreign businessmen and diplomats expressed direct concerns towards the proposed law during Xie's briefing. 
In Bejing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian accused the United States of ""flagrantly interfering"" in China's national security legislation. 
Taiwan is also considering revoking the special status it extends to Hong Kong due to China's planned legislation, a move that could make it harder for Hong Kongers to visit and is likely to anger Beijing.
Business figures said the legislation could lead to money and talent leaving the city.
The Hong Kong Bar Association on Monday questioned the legality of a mechanism Beijing is expected to use to introduce the legislation, which annexes it to the city's mini-constitution, bypassing public consultation and the legislature.
It also raised doubts about the legality of any new mainland agencies in the city as well as whether the independence of the judicial system will be preserved.

A Hong Kong government spokesperson said most residents and overseas investors ""have nothing to fear"" from the new security legislation.

The watchdog said Biedronka, part of Portuguese retail group Jeronimo Martins, had labeled the imported vegetables as Polish at a time when many Poles were making ""patriotic"" shopping choices.
Biedronka was not immediately available to comment. Jeronimo Martins had no immediate comment.
The government has encouraged Poles to buy Polish products to support the local economy during the cororonavirus crisis.
Tomasz Chrostny, who heads the anti-monopoly watchdog UOKiK, said consumers had complained that labels in the Biedronka chain stores were misleading as to the country of origin of fruit and vegetables. 
""Consumers are increasingly guided by economic patriotism in their choices and are happy to reach for domestic products,"" the head of the watchdog said. ""False information in Biedronka stores may have distorted their purchasing decisions.""
The watchdog can impose fines of up to 10% of a company's annual turnover if its charges are confirmed.
Jeronimo Martin's Polish business is also under investigation by the watchdog for unfair dealings with suppliers and for the way it presented prices to clients.
Since coming to power in 2015, Poland's nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) has taken various steps to protect domestic businesses. These have included a Sunday trading ban and attempts to impose a retail tax.

Britain, Europe's worst-hit country with some 43,000 deaths from COVID-19, is in the process of gradually easing social distancing measures and scientists are closely monitoring data on new infections.
Weston General Hospital, in the popular seaside town of Weston-super-Mare, said the suspension of admissions was a precautionary measure to maintain patient and staff safety.
""We currently have a high number of patients with COVID-19,"" said William Oldfield, medical director of the local health body that runs the hospital, in a statement on its website. 
""This is a clinically-led decision.""
Oldfield said the vast majority of the COVID-19 patients likely had the virus before admission, as opposed to being infected inside the hospital. He did not give numbers or say anything about what might have caused the surge in cases.
Authorities have, in some parts, reprimanded Britons for heading to open spaces including beaches during sunny spring weather in numbers that endanger social distancing rules.

The government closed sports facilities in March as part of measures to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, leaving athletes like Ochieng, who was looking forward to representing Kenya at the World Taekwondo Championships in China in October, with nowhere to train.
""We are planning to represent the country in October ... in China Taekwondo World Cup, but unfortunately this COVID-19 is with us and we don’t know when it’s going to end. We just hope it ends before the tournament time,"" Ochieng told Reuters as he trained with other sportsmen and women.
Ochieng, a six-times national champion who trains with his daughter, has represented Kenya in tournaments in South Korea, Rwanda, Ethiopia and Sudan.
Working out alongside him is Evelyne Akinyi, a welterweight boxer and national team member who started the sport five years ago and has competed in Morocco and Senegal.
""Two days after our return from Senegal we got news that coronavirus had hit Senegal,"" Akinyi said after doing sit-ups and practising punches with her coach.

There are only around 150 snow leopards left in Kazakhstan, out of a global population of less than 10,000 across Central and South Asia. Classified as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the big cats are rarely seen in the wild, let alone within city limits.
However, in the past few weeks at least three animals - a lone male and a female with a cub - were caught on film by a motion sensor-equipped camera trap installed near the Big Almaty Lake by an NGO set up to protect the species.
Zoologist Alexey Grachyov, who works with the Snow Leopard Foundation, said that in the mountains near Almaty there are only around 20 of the animals left, making the sighting extremely rare. 
The snow leopard has gray or white fur with black spots and a bushy tail, and its population is distributed across a wide area including mountainous regions of Russia, Mongolia, China, Nepal, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
A common misconception is that snow leopards live only at high altitudes, when in reality they live closer to humans than most people realize, Grachyov said.
""This is a unique population that has adapted to human presence. Every snow leopard probably sees humans, cars, sees the city every day, sees it encroach on its habitat.""

The foundation's long-term plan is to rebuild the snow leopard population by breeding and releasing them into the wild.

The country of 11.5 million people effectively closed down in mid-March, with only shops selling food and pharmacies operating, although other activities have steadily resumed in May, including the reopening of non-food stores.
""The first lockdown has taken care of the situation in which we have ended up. These were exceptional circumstances, but we never had Italian or Spanish conditions,"" Pieter De Crem told VTM broadcaster on Sunday.
He said the tough lockdown measures meant that Belgian hospitals did not have to deny people medical care.
""If there was a second wave, then I think we will find ourselves in a different situation, namely with testing and tracing. But I think we can rule out that we will have to go back to the tough measures,"" De Crem said.
Belgium, home to EU and NATO headquarters, has been among the worst affected countries in Europe with 57,092 COVID-19 cases and 9,280 deaths, although the number of cases, hospital admissions and fatalities has declined since peaking in early April.

Belgium's government will hold a meeting with regional leaders and economic and medical experts on June 3 to discuss a further easing of restrictions, which could extend to restaurants and leisure activities.
