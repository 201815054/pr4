Zhao Lijian told journalists that China was acting to protect its national interest, but did not spell out what form the sanctions would take.
The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion, the Pentagon said last week.
Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary.
""To safeguard our national interests, China decided to take necessary measures and levy sanctions on U.S. companies such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing Defence, and Raytheon, and those individuals and companies who behaved badly in the process of the arms sales,"" Zhao said.
China has imposed sanctions on Lockheed Martin and other U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form the penalties have taken.
The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but Washington is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions in relations between Beijing and Washington, already strained by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade. 
A spokesman for Boeing said in an emailed statement that the company's partnership with China's aviation community had long-term benefits and that Boeing remained committed to it.
Lockheed Martin said in an emailed statement that all of its international military sales are strictly regulated by the U.S. government, and that its presence in China is limited. 

Raytheon did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.

1,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 06:35AM ET</span>","On the EU's eastern border, seeking refuge is harder for some","By Alan Charlish and Marcin Goclowski
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland has made it easier for Belarusians fleeing political persecution to enter, but for Seda Yunusova, a Chechen who was refused the opportunity to apply for asylum 16 times in 2016 and 2017, this is little comfort. 
""With all this that is going on I am fearful again,"" Yunusova told Reuters by telephone from the village of Dymna, near the Belarusian border city of Brest, where she has settled with her eight children.
Like other places in Belarus, Brest has seen violent anti-government protests, and Yunusova says signs of conflict are present in her village.
""God forbid we would have to seek refuge again.""
Yunusova says she and her family fled Chechnya after her husband refused to serve in the Russian army in Ukraine in 2014, having already been deployed there the previous year. She says his military service meant the family was ""blacklisted"" by Polish border guards. He now works as a driver in Russia and visits on holidays.
Poland's nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government has cited security concerns as a reason for not accepting refugees, although it is keen to attract skilled workers from culturally similar Belarus.
However, for PiS's critics, the presence of Yunusova and other Tajik and Chechen refugees on the European Union's eastern border is a reminder of what they say is Poland's refusal to meet its obligations under international law at a time when migration policy is straining relations in the bloc.
According to Kirill Kofanov, a lawyer at the Human Constanta NGO in Brest, there are 30 to 40 asylum seekers in the city.
Data from Poland's Foreigners Office shows that the number of asylum applications processed in 2019 was around a third of the 2016 figure. While Poland has made it easier for Belarusians to get work and study visas, NGOs say it has been denying many other asylum seekers the right to submit applications.
The U.N. Refugee Agency has urged Poland to help people fleeing war and persecution after Europe's human rights court ruled Warsaw had broken an international convention by denying asylum procedures to refugees.
MUSLIM COUNTRY
Gulbarg Sayfova, whose husband is a political prisoner in Tajikistan, spent two months in Brest before she crossed the border in 2016. 
""They said to me why did you come here? You can go to Muslim countries ... why did you come to Poland?,"" she told Reuters.
One Chechen asylum seeker who did not wish to give her name said she succeeded in making an asylum application and crossing the border on her 55th attempt. ""Go to China, to Turkey ... for all 54 attempts they said the same thing.""
The Polish Border Guard told Reuters by email that there were no refugee blacklists and officers did not discriminate on religious grounds. They declined to comment on individual cases.
""Border Guard officers are bound by rules of professional ethics concerning, among other things, the obligation to respect human dignity and to respect and protect human rights,"" they said.
Poland's interior ministry referred Reuters to answers given by the Border Guard.
For Yunusova, her priority is her children's education as she tries to build a life in Belarus, helped by Polish charities.
""My oldest daughter would like to study in Poland. Perhaps one day.""

The rebel source said Russian strikes targeted the Failaq al-Sham faction in their base close to the border with Turkey, killing 20. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights put the death toll at 34, with dozens wounded.
Syrian government forces, backed by Russian air power, have driven rebels back to a pocket of territory adjoining Turkey after more than nine years of conflict triggered by protests against President Bashar al-Assad in 2011.
Ankara sent thousands of troops into the region this year to stall the Syrian government advances and prevent an influx of refugees from the Idlib border region into Turkey.
Monday's air strikes targeted the camp near Kafr Takharim, about 10 km (6 miles) from the Turkish border in Syria's Idlib province, the rebel fighter said.

In a statement, the Kurdistan regional government's top security agency said the attack was planned by people linked to the PKK Kurdish separatist group that has waged a decades-long insurgency in neighbouring Turkey.
It said the attackers aimed to kill diplomats, but it did not say from which country.
""The group was observed and then intercepted by the security forces in an operation lasting four months,"" it added.
The PKK faces one of Turkey's fiercest military assaults for years against its bases in Iraqi territory.
It is also the target of a security and reconstruction agreement between Erbil and Baghdad that aims to eject all PKK affiliates from the town of Sinjar on the Syrian border.
A gunman shot a Turkish diplomat dead in an Erbil restaurant in July last year, just weeks after Turkey launched another incursion into Iraq against the PKK. 
Kurdish officials privately blamed that killing on the PKK, which they say seeks to carry out similar attacks in the Kurdistan region.
The Kurdish government in Erbil, dominated by the Kurdish Democratic Party, sees the PKK as its adversary and relies on Turkish pipelines to export oil.

4,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 26, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Analysis: U.S. Supreme Court nominee Barrett often rules for police in excessive force cases,"By Andrew Chung and Lawrence Hurley
(Reuters) - In her three years as a federal appeals court judge, U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett has consistently sided with police or prison guards accused of using excessive force, a Reuters review of cases she was involved in shows. 
Barrett, Republican President Donald Trump's third nominee to the high court, has written opinions or been a part of three-judge panels that have ruled in favor of defendants in 11 of 12 cases in which law enforcement was accused of using excessive force in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
The Republican-controlled Senate is expected to vote to confirm Barrett, a judge on the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the lifetime position on Monday, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority.
While her Senate confirmation hearings https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2771B6 focused attention on how she might rule on cases related to abortion, Obamacare and elections, the Reuters review illustrates Barrett's record on police use of force at a time of reckoning in the United States.
There has been a wave of protests nationwide - and abroad - since May 25 when a Black man George Floyd died at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer, just one in a long string of killings that civil rights advocates say are evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system.
""Her record also makes clear she is predisposed to side with law enforcement in the context of excessive force cases,"" said Kristen Clarke, president of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, which opposes Barrett's confirmation.
Other groups that advocate for reform of the criminal justice system say she has written some encouraging rulings, with an overall record that is mixed. Barrett could not be reached for comment.
SUPPORT FOR QUALIFIED IMMUNITY
In five cases, the panel on which Barrett took part considered a request by police or corrections officers to be shielded from the lawsuits alleging excessive force through a controversial legal defense known as qualified immunity. The court granted those requests in four of the five cases. 
A Reuters investigation published two weeks before Floyd’s death found that the immunity defense, created by the Supreme Court 50 years ago, has been making it easier for cops to kill or injure civilians with impunity. The report showed that federal appellate courts have been granting police immunity at increasing rates in recent years. Read the Reuters reporting here: https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-police-immunity-variations
Barrett, who was appointed to the appeals court by Trump in 2017, wrote a ruling in July that said Green Bay, Wisconsin officers who shot and killed a suicidal man who had threatened them with a knife did not use excessive force in violation of the Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which prohibits illegal searches and seizures.
She was also part of rulings that overturned lower court decisions against Indianapolis police officers. In one, a federal judge had denied qualified immunity to officers in the case of shoplifting suspect Terrell Day, who died while handcuffed after telling officers he was having trouble breathing.
Barrett dissented from a 7th Circuit panel decision in 2019 to revive a lawsuit against prison guards at an Illinois prison for firing warning shots over a dining hall to help break up a fight, injuring several inmates.
She has also handled requests for qualified immunity outside of the excessive force context.
Barrett last year threw out a lawsuit by three Black men who sued Chicago cops for pulling them over while investigating a drive-by shooting near a school. The men, who had nothing to do with the shooting, said they were targeted because of their race, citing the ""racialized nature of the mockery and threats"" made by one of the officers. The driver, Marcus Torry, told the cops that he was complying because he feared police brutality. 
Barrett granted the officers qualified immunity because it was not ""clearly established"" that the officers' actions were unreasonable, noting that the plaintiffs matched the description of the suspects ""in number, race and car color.""
In other cases, she has shown a willingness to side with plaintiffs. 
In 2019, she wrote a ruling rejecting immunity for a police officer who used false statements in making the case against a murder suspect. She also joined a ruling denying immunity for officers who were accused of falsifying evidence that caused a man to be jailed for two years. 

""I don't think we can draw definite conclusions about how Judge Barrett would approach qualified immunity once she's on the Supreme Court,"" said Jay Schweikert, a policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, which is campaigning against qualified immunity. ""Her decisions all look like reasonable applications of existing precedent.""

""Effective leadership must plan and prepare well,"" he told a rally in northern Tanzania last week, reeling off figures on how government revenues had nearly doubled, helping fund the railway and dam. 
Magufuli is standing for a second term in the elections, which will also vote in a new parliament. He promises voters his projects will turbocharge growth in East Africa's third largest economy, even as the private sector complains it is being made to pay too high a bill.
The 60-year-old president's nickname – ""The Bulldozer"" – is testimony both to his fondness for massive public works and his reputation for pushing through policies despite opposition. 
Both make him popular with many Tanzanians, despite international wariness over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic - he had some colourful criticism of testing then unilaterally declared COVID-19 over. Independent media and political opponents also say they are facing an escalating crackdown. The government denies there is such a crackdown.
Magufuli's investments and his refusal to shut down Tanzania's economy this year have buoyed his already strong chances of winning a second five-year term. 
His two main challengers, veteran opposition leader Tundu Lissu and former foreign minister Bernard Membe, could split the opposition vote with 12 other candidates. The election commission disqualified dozens of opposition parliamentary candidates.
Some iteration of the ruling party has held power since independence in 1961.
State-led projects have fueled average growth of just below 7% over the past five years, official figures say, propelling Tanzania to lower middle income status this year. Under Magufuli, construction has become the main driver. 
The government projects economic growth this year will be 5.5% despite COVID-19 battering tourism in places like Zanzibar. The World Bank predicts only 2.5%. 
Jens Reinke, the International Monetary Fund's representative in Tanzania, told Reuters he ""is cautiously optimistic"" the mega-projects will contribute to sustainable growth, but risks remain. 
Some voters in the nation of 58 million are less skeptical. Gardener Jackson Mwase, 35, praised Magufuli for improving Dar es Salaam's infrastructure.
""However, some colleagues don't have money because there are no jobs,"" he told Reuters. ""The upcoming government should increase salaries.""
Magufuli has promised to raise wages if he is elected.
PRIVATE SECTOR WOES
As public construction booms, Magufuli's effort to wring more revenue from the private sector has alienated investors. 
Mining reforms passed in 2017 stipulating a 16% government stake in projects make it hard for companies to secure financing. The government had a long fight with Acacia Mining over alleged under-reporting of revenues. Barrick Gold (NYSE:GOLD), which took over Acacia last year, ended up paying $300 million to settle the dispute.
""It is extremely difficult for us to get ... investment,"" a mining executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity to avoid antagonising officials. ""There is quite a large percentage that the government is demanding.""
Last year Tanzania displaced Venezuela as the world's least attractive mining jurisdiction, according to the Fraser Institute's 2019 investment attractiveness index. 
Between 2015 and 2018 foreign direct investment dropped by a third, from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion, the World Bank said. 
""Moody's (NYSE:MCO) expects policy unpredictability and a generally adverse business environment to hamper investment,"" ratings agency Moody's said in August. ""This will hinder Tanzania's capacity to sustain high GDP growth.""
Aidan Eyakuze, executive director of civil-society body Twaweza East Africa, described Magufuli's economic policies as highly centralised ""muscular nationalism"". 

""I just wonder whether foreign investors will be a bit shy about the prospect of such assertive management of their assets,"" he said on Thursday during an online panel about the elections.

Thirteen Australians were among the women on the flight run by state-owned Qatar Airways who were forced to undergo a medical examination in an ambulance after the newborn was found in an airport bathroom, television network Seven News said.
All adult women on the flight, regardless of age, were made to disembark for the examination, two of the women told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
On Monday, Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne confirmed the women had contacted the Australian government at the time of the incident, adding that it had taken up the matter with Qatar's ambassador. 
The ""extraordinary incident"" had also been reported to the Australian Federal Police, she said.
""This is a grossly disturbing, offensive, concerning set of events,"" Payne told media. ""It is not something I have ever heard of occurring in my life, in any context. We have made our views very clear to the Qatari authorities.""
In a statement, the Australian federal police said they were aware of the incident, and were engaging with the department of foreign affairs and trade.
In a statement, Hamad International Airport, which is part of the Qatar Airways Group, said the newborn found abandoned on Oct 2 had not been identified and was receiving medical care.
""Medical professionals expressed concern to officials about the health and welfare of a mother who had just given birth and requested she be located prior to departing (the airport),"" it said.
""Individuals who had access to the specific area of the airport where the newborn infant was found were asked to assist in the query.""
Australia expects a report this week from authorities in Qatar, Payne said.
There were significant concerns over the issue of securing consent for the medical examinations, she said, adding, ""These are very private and personal matters.""
In a statement, the Australian government said reports indicated treatment ""beyond circumstances in which the women could give free and informed consent"".
The women received medical and psychological support on arrival in Sydney, and began Australia's mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine required for COVID-19 border control, a spokesman for health authorities in New South Wales state told Reuters.

Lukashenko had defied an ultimatum to surrender power by midnight on Sunday, challenging his opponents to make good on their threat to paralyse the country with mass strikes and shutdowns.
His refusal to quit after 26 years in power will test whether the opposition has the mass support it needs to bring enterprises across the country of 9.5 million people to a halt.
It was not immediately clear how widespread the latest round of protest action was. Strikes have hit some major state-run factories in recent weeks but they have not been sustained. 
Eleven weeks after a disputed presidential election, the crisis in the former Soviet republic nevertheless entered a new phase with the expiry of the ""People's Ultimatum"" set by exiled opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.
Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Lithuania after the Aug. 9 election for the safety of her family, has urged Belarusians to block roads, shut down workplaces, stop using government shops and services and withdraw all money from their bank accounts.
Lukashenko has scoffed at the calls, asking ""Who will feed the kids?"" if workers at state-owned enterprises go on strike.
Tsikhanouskaya called on Sunday for the strike to go ahead after police forces loyal to Lukashenko fired stun grenades and detained scores of people in a clampdown on protests by tens of thousands in Minsk and elsewhere.
""The regime once again showed Belarusians that force is the only thing it is capable of,"" she said in a statement. ""That's why tomorrow, Oct. 26, a national strike will begin.""
The standoff is being closely watched by neighbouring Russia and by Western governments.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has no desire to see another leader toppled by protests in a former Soviet state, as happened in Ukraine in 2014 and Kyrgyzstan earlier this month. He too has faced street demonstrations at various times, including for the past three months in the far eastern city of Khabarovsk.
Since the crisis began, Moscow has backed Lukashenko with a $1.5 billion loan and increased security cooperation, including a series of joint military exercises and a visit last week by the head of Russia's foreign intelligence agency.
SECURITY CRACKDOWN
Lukashenko, 66, claimed victory in the Aug. 9 election with an official vote share of more than 80%, but the opposition accused him of vote-rigging on a massive scale.
He has responded to mass street protests by arresting around 15,000 people, though most have since been released, and jailing opposition leaders or forcing them to leave the country.
A U.N. human rights investigator said last month that thousands of people had been ""savagely beaten"" and there were more than 500 reports of torture, which the authorities deny.
The United States, European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed travel bans and asset freezes against a string of officials accused of election fraud and human rights abuses.
Tsikhanouskaya presented her ultimatum on Oct. 13 after the government said police would be authorised to use combat weapons against protesters if needed.
Three days later, a senior police official repeated the threat.

""We will of course humanely use weapons against them, including firearms, and we will remove the most dangerous ones from the streets,"" said Nikolai Karpenkov, head of the police unit in charge of fighting organised crime.

HANOI (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen sentenced last year to 12 years in a Vietnamese jail for ""attempting to overthrow the state"", has been released and returned to his home in California, a family spokesman told Reuters on Monday.
Michael Nguyen, who was born in Vietnam in 1964 and lived in the United States since childhood, was detained in July 2018 on suspicion of anti-government activities, including alleged incitement of protesters to attack government offices with Molotov cocktails and slingshots, state media reported at the time.
""He arrived home in California this past Thursday,"" family spokesman Mark Roberts said in an email. He was unable to provide further details.
The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi in a statement confirmed Nguyen left Vietnam on Oct. 21. ""We welcome his release on humanitarian grounds,"" spokeswoman Rachael Chen said.
Vietnam's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Nguyen lost his appeal last year and his family maintained he was innocent. 
Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch said Washington had regularly raised Nguyen's detention with the government.
""The message in Michael's release is public and private pressure on the Vietnam government works when it is consistently applied on cases of dissidents who should never have been arrested, much less imprisoned, in the first place,"" Robertson said.
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
Vietnam has previously freed imprisoned political activists before the end of their sentences, provided they permanently leave the country.
Nguyen's wife, Helen, attended U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech last year as a guest of Democratic Representative Katie Porter of Orange County, California, where the Nguyen family lives.
Nguyen's release was not reported in Vietnam's state media. It was not clear if two Vietnamese nationals detained at the same time were also released.

The storm is set to disrupt oil production and if it lashes southern U.S. states it could create fresh records for the number of hurricane landfalls that have taken place in the United States.
 BP  (NYSE:BP) (BP.L) on Sunday said it has begun to evacuate four offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil platforms and secure facilities after the Tropical storm Zeta sprang up in the Caribbean Sea.
In Mexico, there is a hurricane warning for the tourist resorts of Cozumel and Tulum, we all as their surrounding areas. 
Zeta is expected to cause a ""dangerous storm surge"" and raise water levels by as much as 1-3 feet above normal tide levels when it hits the Yucatan Peninsula, NHC warned.
As well as lashing Mexico, Zeta is expected to bring heavy rainfall across portions of central and western Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, southern Florida and the Keys, NHC said.
Forecasting that Zeta would be at or just below hurricane strength when it approaches the northern Gulf Coast on Wednesday, NHC said ""there is an increasing risk of storm surge, rainfall, and wind impacts from Louisiana to the Florida Panhandle"".
Zeta is about 275 miles (442.6 km) from the island of Cozumel in Mexico with maximum sustained winds of 50 miles (80.5 km) per hour, NHC added.

(Reuters) - The Waukegan, Illinois, police video of the shooting death of an unarmed Black teenaged motorist, who wanted to be a rapper, will be released to the public, the mayor said at a prayer vigil Sunday.
The video's release will add a measure of transparency to last week's shooting, said the 19-year-old victim's cousin Satrese Stallworth, one of the many speakers at the event in Waukegan on Sunday.
""But what we really want it justice, and we want it now,"" said Stallworth, spokeswoman for the family of Marcellis Stinnette, who died after being shot at the traffic stop just before midnight on Tuesday.
""We need this, as hard as it will be to look at, we need to know what really happened,"" Stallworth said.
Stinnette's 20-year-old girlfriend, Tafarra Williams (NYSE:WMB), was also shot and wounded in the incident.
The prayer vigil was the third peaceful public gathering for Stinnette. It follows a wave of nationwide protests, vigils and marches against racism and police brutality following the May 25 death of African-American George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, after an officer knelt on his neck. 
Stallworth and local Black Lives Matter leader Clyde McLemore said more than 200 people showed up for the vigil. Mayor Sam Cunningham promised the crowd the video would be released, but did provide a time frame, according to local media reports.
Neither Cunningham nor a police representative were immediately available for comment late Sunday.
The officer, whose name has not been released, was fired on Friday for unspecified violations of police policy and procedures.
McLemore said Black Lives Matter and Stinnette's family also demanded the immediate arrest of all the officers involved on homicide charges.
""We need to know their names and we need to see them in jail,"" McLemore said.
Stallworth said the world needs to know what happened.
""We want the world to know that he was full of love, full of life,"" she said, noting Stinnette wanted to be a music rapper. ""He wanted the world to know his name, but not in this way.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chileans poured into the country's main squares on Sunday night after voters gave a ringing endorsement to a plan to tear up the country's Pinochet-era constitution in favour of a new charter drafted by citizens. 
In Santiago's Plaza Italia, the focus of the massive and often violent social protests last year which sparked the demand for a new magna carta, fireworks rose above a crowd of tens of thousands of jubilant people singing in unison as the word ""rebirth"" was beamed onto a tower above. 
With more than three quarters of the votes counted, 78.12% of voters had opted for a new charter. Many have expressed hopes that a new text will temper an unabashedly capitalist ethos with guarantees of more equal rights to healthcare, pensions and education. 
""This triumph belongs to the people, it's thanks to everyone's efforts that we are at this moment of celebration,"" Daniel, 37, told Reuters in Santiago's Plaza Nunoa. ""What makes me happiest is the participation of the youth, young people wanting to make changes.""
Chile's President Sebastian Pinera said if the country had been divided by the protests and debate over whether to approve or reject plans for a new charter, from now on they should unite behind a new text that provided ""a home for everyone."" 
The centre-right leader, whose popularity ratings plummeted to record lows during the unrest and have remained in the doldrums, spoke to those who wanted to keep the present constitution credited with making Chile one of Latin America's economic success stories. 
Any new draft must incorporate ""the legacy of past generations, the will of present generations and the hopes of generations to come,"" he said. 
He gave a nod to fears that the high expectations placed in a new charter cannot be met, saying: ""This referendum is not the end, it is the start of a road we must walk towards a new constitution."" 
As votes were counted on live television around the country, spontaneous parties broke out on street corners and in squares around the country. Drivers honked car horns, some as revellers danced on their roofs, and others banged pots and pans. The flag of the country's indigenous Mapuche people, who will seek greater recognition in the new charter, was ubiquitous. 
Four fifths of voters said they wanted the new charter to be drafted by a specially-elected body of citizens - made up of half women and half men - over a mixed convention of lawmakers and citizens, highlighting general mistrust in Chile's political class. 
Members of a 155-seat constitutional convention will be voted in by April 2021 and have up to a year to agree a draft text, with proposals approved by a two-thirds majority. 
Among issues likely to be at the fore are recognition of Chile's Mapuche indigenous population, powers of collective bargaining, water and land rights and privatised systems providing healthcare, education and pensions. 
Chileans will then vote again on whether they accept the text or want to revert to the previous constitution. 

The National Mining Society (Sonami), which groups the companies in the sector into the world's largest copper producer, said it hoped for ""broad agreement on the principles and norms"" that determine the sector's coexistence with Chilean citizens and that the regulatory certainty that have allowed the sector to flourish would continue.

No deaths associated with influenza vaccination have been reported in Singapore to date, but the decision to halt the use of SKYCellflu Quadrivalent and VaxigripTetra was precautionary, the health ministry and the Health Sciences Authority (HAS) said in a statement late on Sunday.
The HSA is in touch with the South Korean authorities for further information as they investigate to determine if the deaths are related to influenza vaccinations. 
SKYCellflu Quadrivalent is manufactured by South Korea's SK Bioscience and locally distributed by AJ Biologics, while VaxigripTetra is manufactured by  Sanofi  (NASDAQ:SNY) and locally distributed by Sanofi Aventis. 
Two other influenza vaccines that have been brought into Singapore for the Northern Hemisphere 2020/21 influenza season may continue to be used, Singapore health authorities said.

BAKU/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Sunday said a new humanitarian ceasefire will take effect on Monday in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, even as fresh fighting erupted between the two sides. 
The latest ceasefire is due to take effect at 8 a.m. local time (12 a.m. EDT) on Oct. 26, the U.S. State Department and the governments of Azerbaijan and Armenia said in a joint statement. 
""Congratulations to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev, who just agreed to adhere to a cease fire effective at midnight. Many lives will be saved,"" U.S. President Donald Trump wrote on Twitter. 
The announcement came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo held separate meetings with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington on Friday. 
""Those meetings were joined by the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group, formed to mediate the conflict and led by France, Russia and the United States, which described them as ""intensive discussions"" on the ceasefire and the beginning of talks about core elements of a comprehensive solution. 
The Minsk Group said its co-chairs and the foreign ministers agreed to meet again in Geneva on Oct. 29.
A senior administration official expressed confidence that this ceasefire would hold. ""U.S. leadership with support from Russia and France brings additional hope that the ceasefire will lead to a lasting peace settlement,"" said the official.
But the eruption of new fighting on Sunday and the collapse of two previous ceasefires brokered by Russia raised questions about the prospects for this fresh push to end the clashes in Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. 
The fighting that broke out on Sept. 27 over the disputed territory has surged to its worst level since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed. 
Local officials in Nagorno-Karabakh on Sunday accused Azeri forces of firing artillery on settlements in the areas of Askeran and Martuni during the night. Azerbaijan said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks and howitzers.
Armenia accused Azeri forces of shelling civilian settlements. Baku denied killing civilians and said it was ready to implement a ceasefire, provided Armenian forces withdrew from the battlefield.
The defence ministry of the Nagorno-Karabakh region said on Sunday it had recorded another 11 casualties among its forces, pushing the military death toll to 974.
Earlier on Sunday during a meeting with defense officials, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev accused Armenia of bombarding civilian sites and launching two ballistic missiles on the city of Ganja.
Armenian President Armen Sarkissian accused Baku of being ""aggressively stubborn and destructive"".
World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict. 
Sarkissian, in comments reprinted by the Armenpress news agency, called on ""global players"" to step in immediately to bring about a ceasefire and said Russia was ""a trusted and pro-active mediator"" between the conflicting sides. 
Aliyev said it was ""very hazardous"" for Armenia to want Russian military support in the conflict and third parties should not get involved militarily. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he speaks to leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan several times a day by phone, and that he hopes the United States will help Moscow broker a solution to the conflict.

About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control.

In Saudi Arabia, the Arab world's largest economy, a hashtag calling for the boycott of French supermarket retailer  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) was the second most trending on Sunday.
France's foreign affairs ministry said there had been calls to boycott French products, notably food products, in several Middle Eastern countries as well as calls for demonstrations against France over the cartoons. 
Muslims see any depiction of the Prophet as blasphemous.
""These calls for boycott are baseless and should stop immediately, as well as all attacks against our country, which are being pushed by a radical minority,"" the ministry said.
The ministry also called on authorities to speak out against such boycott actions in order to help French companies and ensure the safety of French citizens. 
In Kuwait, the non-governmental Union of Consumer Co-operative Societies, which groups more than 70 establishments, issued the boycott directive in an Oct. 23 circular. Several co-ops visited by Reuters on Sunday had cleared the shelves of items such as hair and beauty products made by French companies.
Union head Fahd Al-Kishti told Reuters the products had been removed in response to ""repeated insults"" against the Prophet. 
The co-ops, some the size of hypermarkets, carry government-subsidised staples and account for a big part of retail in Kuwait. Kuwait's imports from France stood at 255 million dinars ($834.70 million) in 2019, according to Kuwait's Central Statistics bureau.
Kuwait's foreign minister, who met the French ambassador on Sunday, condemned the Oct. 16 killing as a horrendous crime but stressed the need to avoid insulting religion in official and political remarks that ""inflame hatred, enmity and racism"", the ministry tweeted.
Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan also said on Sunday President Emmanuel Macron had ""attacked Islam"" by encouraging the display of the cartoons.
Macron said on Twitter France respected all differences in a spirit of peace, but did not accept hate speech and defended reasonable debate. ""We will not give in, ever,"" Macron said. 
France recalled its ambassador to Turkey on Saturday after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Macron, who this month declared war on ""Islamist separatism"", needed mental help over his attitude towards Muslims.
The beheading, in which the assailant was shot dead, carried echoes of the Islamist attack in 2015 on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo after it republished the cartoons.
After a Danish paper first published the cartoons in 2005, protests and boycotts on Danish goods swept the Islamic world.

Protesters carrying the red-and-white flags of the Belarusian opposition movement scattered as loud bangs and flashes lit up the city's streets after nightfall, videos showed. 
The police action came hours before the expiration of an ultimatum set by the opposition: Lukashenko must resign by midnight or face a national strike.
Explosions and white smoke filled residential areas as people hid behind vehicles and ran from police, the videos, shared online by news organisations, showed. The videos could not be immediately verified by Reuters.
Law enforcement confirmed that riot control weapons had been used and detentions had taken place, the Russian news agencies TASS and RIA reported.
Human rights group Vesna-96 said 128 people had been detained so far on Sunday, and shared a list of their names online.
An interior ministry spokeswoman said it was too early to say how many people had been injured or detained. ""We will only know by the morning if there are any injured people,"" Olga Chemodanova was cited by RIA as saying. 
Earlier on Sunday, crowds streamed through the capital shouting ""strike"", waving flags and beating drums on the 11th straight weekend of mass protests since a disputed election plunged the country into turmoil.
Twelve metro stations were closed, helmeted riot police patrolled the streets and mobile internet services were disrupted in Minsk. Two journalists were detained ahead of the protest, a local journalists' association said.
Tens of people were detained and security forces used tear gas in the western town of Lida, the Russian news agency RIA quoted the regional branch of the interior ministry as saying.
Lukashenko has ruled Belarus for more than a quarter of a century and has shown little inclination to quit, buoyed by loans and the offer of military support from traditional ally Russia. 
The president's main opponents have been jailed or fled into exile following the Aug. 9 election, which Lukashenko's opponents accuse him of rigging to win a sixth straight term. He denies electoral fraud.
Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, his main electoral challenger, has led calls from exile for a national strike to begin on Monday if Lukashenko refuses to release all political prisoners and resign to make way for a new election. 
""Today at 23:59 the term of the People's Ultimatum will expire, and if the demands are not met, the Belarusians will start a national strike,"" she said in statement.
Lukashenko has signalled that he would ignore the ultimatum. 
The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions against a string of senior officials in Belarus accused of fraud and human rights abuses in the wake of the presidential election. 
Lukashenko has accused Western countries of meddling in the internal affairs of Belarus and trying to instigate a violent uprising against him. 

In a call with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday, he said Belarus and Russia were ready to respond jointly to external threats, Belarusian state television reported.

(Reuters) - Wilton Gregory, the first African American to be named as cardinal and known as a refined diplomat, made headlines when he blasted President Donald Trump’s photo opportunity hoisting a Bible at a Washington church after police used tear gas to clear demonstrators in June.
Gregory, who was among 13 new cardinals named by Pope Francis on Sunday, was installed as the first Black archbishop of Washington, D.C. in 2019. He turns 73 just days after the naming ceremony for new cardinals next month. 
Pope Francis on Sunday said Gregory was picked with others from Rwanda, the Philippines and elsewhere to wear the revered red cap.
An outspoken civil rights advocate, Gregory has addressed the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes in May. 
In June, he blasted Trump's visit to a Washington shrine honoring Pope John Paul II, a day after police and armed soldiers used tear gas and rubber bullets to clear protesters so Trump could be photographed in front of a historic Washington church holding up a Bible.
""I find it baffling and reprehensible that any Catholic facility would allow itself to be so egregiously misused and manipulated in a fashion that violates our religious principles, which call us to defend the rights of all people, even those with whom we might disagree,"" Gregory said in a statement before Trump and first lady Melania Trump arrived at the Saint John Paul II National Shrine.
Gregory also has been a leader in aggressively addressing the Roman Catholic Church's sexual abuse scandals and shoring up the church's zero-tolerance policy.
Leading Catholic organizations cheered the choice and noted Pope Francis was sending a clear message ""in the midst of our nation's reckoning in systemic racism, as millions assert that Black Lives Matter,"" said Johnny Zokovitch, executive director of Pax Christi USA, a national Catholic peace and justice organization based in Washington, D.C. 
""It's validation of the archbishop's opposition this past summer of President Trump using the St. John Paul II Shrine for a photo op when the president's policies are so radically contrary to our faith and the teachings of the church,"" Zokovitch said in a statement. 
The move was also praised by the head of the nation's largest Catholic community, Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles, who is president of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, a position once held by Gregory.

""Pope Francis is sending a powerful message of hope and inclusion to the Church in the United States. The naming of the first African American cardinal from the United States gives us an opportunity to pause and offer thanks for the many gifts African American Catholics have given the Church,"" Gomez said.

Khan's comments come days after Macron paid tribute to a French history teacher beheaded by an Islamist radical who wanted to avenge the use of cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a class on freedom of expression.
""Sadly, President Macron has chosen to deliberately provoke Muslims, incl his own citizens, through encouraging the display of blasphemous cartoons targeting Islam & our Prophet PBUH,"" Khan said on Twitter.
Muslims see any depiction of the Prophet Muhammad as blasphemous. Macron said the teacher was a hero and that Islamists were a threat to the country.
Khan said Macron could have shown a ""healing touch"" to deny space to extremists but had instead ""chosen to encourage Islamophobia by attacking Islam rather than the terrorists who carry out violence, be it Muslims, White Supremacists or Nazi ideologists"".
France has in recent years witnessed a series of violent attacks by Islamist militants, including the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings and bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theatre and sites around Paris that killed 130 people.
""By attacking Islam, clearly without having any understanding of it, President Macron has attacked & hurt the sentiments of millions of Muslims in Europe & across the world,"" Khan added.
Khan's comments follow a similar broadside fired by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan against Macron, following which France recalled its ambassador from Ankara.
The cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad, first published in 2005 by Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten, have stirred outrage and violent protests in Pakistan. 

There were more protests last month when the cartoons were re-published by the French satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo.

KUMBA, Cameroon (Reuters) - A 12-year-old girl died on Sunday from wounds sustained when gunmen stormed a school in the South West Region of Cameroon on Saturday and opened fire on the children, taking the death toll to seven with 12 injured. 
The attack on the school, in the region where separatist insurgents have been battling government forces since 2017, has drawn widespread condemnation and is likely to pile further pressure on the government to do more to end the conflict.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack in the town of Kumba, where the grieving father of the 12-year-old girl said he saw the gunmen drive by on motorcycles in the direction of the school, and then back after a barrage of gunfire. 
What began as protests by people in the English-speaking North West and South West regions of Cameroon over perceived marginalisation by the dominant French-speaking majority has escalated into violence with separatists demanding independence.
More than 3,000 people have died since 2017, with both sides regularly accused of committing atrocities.
""I blame the government for everything that is happening,"" said Claude Ngwane, whose 12-year old daughter Renny, died from her wounds early on Sunday. 
He added that if the Cameroon government would acknowledge that it cannot win a civil war, it would act differently to avoid the escalation of a conflict that has so far displaced over half a million people.
The Cameroon government organised a national dialogue in September 2019 aimed at addressing some of the issues raised by the two regions. But the talks were boycotted by separatists and moderate politicians, and they ended in acrimony. 
Since then, the bloodshed has festered unabated, leading to towns and villages in the regions emptying out, and schools closing.
Ngwane, a 36-year old carpenter, said he had sent his daughter to the capital, Yaounde, to complete her primary education due to the conflict. He brought her back to Kumba to start secondary school this year.
He said he was at his work shed near the school when he saw the gunmen, 12 of them on four motorbikes, one armed with a rocket launcher, drive by twice.
""I thought they were just passing. Suddenly we heard sustained gunshots. It lasted for around five minutes, then they drove by again,"" he said.

""I went out to see what had happened. I saw my wife and saw a man carrying my daughter. I was confused. I saw my child, blood all over her body. I collapsed,"" Ngwane said.

The coalition, in a statement carried by Saudi state media, said the attack was aimed at civilian targets but did not specify the sites or mention any damages.
In recent days the coalition had said it intercepted and destroyed several explosive-laden drones launched by the Houthis towards southern border areas.
The Western-backed coalition intervened in Yemen in March 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014.
The United Nations is trying to secure a nationwide ceasefire to pave the way for reviving political negotiations to end the conflict, which is widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

On Saturday, Erdogan said Macron had a problem with Muslims and needed mental checks - a rebuke that caused France to recall its ambassador from Ankara.
""The person in charge of France has lost his way. He goes on about Erdogan all day. Look at yourself first and where you are going. I said in Kayseri yesterday, he is a case and he really must be checked up,"" Erdogan said in a televised speech in the eastern province of Malatya. 
The French leader this month declared war on ""Islamist separatism"", which he believes is taking over some Muslim communities in France.
France has since been shaken by the beheading of a teacher by an Islamist militant, avenging the use of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression.
NATO members Turkey and France have been at loggerheads over issues including Syria and Libya, maritime jurisdiction in the eastern Mediterranean, and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Macron's office said on Saturday France had gathered its European partners, who share France's demand that Turkey puts a stop to its ""dangerous adventures"" in the Mediterranean and in the region.
It said Erdogan had two months to respond or face measures, noting the absence of a condolence message from Turkey's leader after the history teacher's death last week.

Erdogan is a pious Muslim and since his Islamist-rooted AK Party first came to power in 2002, he has sought to shift Islam into the mainstream of politics in Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim but constitutionally secular country.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Hundreds of people protested during mass at Polish churches on Sunday against a court ruling that amounts to a near-total ban on abortion, with some spraying slogans on the buildings and others stringing up lines of black laundry. 
It is first time protests have been held directly at churches, both inside and out, in the predominantly Catholic country where the Constitutional Court ruling has now triggered four days of demonstrations.
The ruling that abortions due to foetal defects were unconstitutional ends the most common of the few legal grounds left in Poland and sets the country further apart from the European mainstream. 
Several dozen of protesters interrupted a mass in Poznan, in western Poland, chanting ""we are sick of this"" and holding banners such as ""Catholic women also need their right to abortion"" in front of the altar, state news agency PAP reported.
In Krakow, protesters hung black underwear and other clothes on lines between the trees, while in Lodz, central Poland, some 2,000 people gathered in front of the cathedral, private Radio Zet said. They chanted: ""Separate the church from the state.""
Activists across the country carried posters depicting a crucified pregnant woman. In Warsaw protesters sprayed ""abortion without borders"" at one of churches, according to PAP. At another church ""you have blood on your hands"" was daubed on the wall.
Some people give priests cards with a bolt symbol symbolising their protest instead of the traditional donation during mass.
""I'm here today because it annoys me that in a secular country the church decides for me what rights I have, what I can do and what I'm not allowed to do,"" said media worker Julia Miotk, 26, protesting in front of a church in Warsaw.
The leaders of the protests say that Poland's conservative ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), used the court to change the policy to satisfy the influential Polish Roman Catholic Church. The party denies that.
Church authorities declined to comment. A spokesman for the government could not be reached immediately for comment.

The protests since Thursday night have taken place despite gatherings of more than five people being banned due to coronavirus restrictions.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces fired water cannon and tear gas at anti-government protesters on Sunday to prevent them crossing barricades on a bridge leading towards government buildings.
The skirmishes came as hundreds of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad and some southern cities to hold anti-government protests, marking a year since mass anti-government unrest that killed more than 500 people.
""We will not stop protesting to demand our stolen rights. We are the victims of corrupted governments,"" said Najim Abdullah, a protester standing near the Jumhuriya bridge in the capital.
Security forces had deployed in force to control protests that began in the morning, and to stop demonstrators crossing Jumhuriya bridge, which leads to the fortified Green Zone that houses government buildings and foreign missions.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
Sunday's protests were more subdued than demonstrations last year where thousands rallied in Baghdad and the south, facing off against security forces and militiamen in clashes that maimed and killed mostly young, jobless demonstrators.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May after his predecessor was driven out by last year's unrest, has painted himself as a leader who supports demonstrators.
In a televised address on Saturday he pledged to hold early and fair elections, a demand of many pro-democracy activists, and said security forces would this time around not harm any peaceful protesters.
""We want our freedom. We want our rights,"" one protester said after throwing stones at riot police above Jumhuriya bridge. He retreated when police responded with tear gas.
Security forces and unidentified gunmen carried out a fierce crackdown on anti-government disturbances that erupted in October 2019, killing hundreds of mostly unarmed protesters using live gunfire and tear gas.
The protesters had taken to the streets in mostly uncoordinated opposition to the political elite that has ruled since the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein.
They accuse those in power, especially Iranian-backed parties and militia groups, of fuelling endemic corruption that kept large swathes of the oil-rich Arab country in ruins even during times of relative peace.
Since the 2017 defeat of Islamic State militants, a moment many Iraqis hoped would signal a turning point for their country, millions have struggled to make a living and been deprived of reliable electricity, clean water and education.

Threats, killings and abductions of activists have continued since the protests lost steam earlier this year, out of a combination of protester fatigue and movement restrictions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis named 13 new Roman Catholic cardinals on Sunday, including nine who are eligible to enter a conclave to elect his successor after his death or resignation.
The new cardinal electors, whom the pope listed in a surprise announcement while addressing pilgrims from his window overlooking St. Peter's Square, include Archbishop Wilton Gregory of Washington D.C. He will become the first African-American to hold the rank.
The 13 new cardinals will be elevated to the high rank at a ceremony known as a consistory at the Vatican on Nov. 28, and the selection of more cardinal electors increases the possibility that the next pope will be someone who will continue Francis' policies.
Francis has now appointed about 57% of cardinal electors, whose number rises to about 128 with the naming of the new cardinals. The others were appointed by Francis' two more conservative predecessors, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope John Paul II.
Church rules usually limit the number of cardinal electors to 120 but popes have bent that limit by naming more. 
The nine new electors come from Italy, Africa, the United States, Rwanda, the Philippines, Chile and Brunei.
The four non-electors, who will not be allowed to enter a conclave because they are over the age of 80, are being elevated to the high rank because of their long service to the Church.

They include Archbishop Silvano Tomasi, an Italian who has worked around the world and is one of the Church's top experts on immigration.

Veteran Sunni politician Hariri was named premier for a fourth time on Thursday, a year after huge protests against the ruling elite pushed him to quit.
Hariri promised a cabinet of specialists to enact reforms set out in a French plan to unlock foreign aid. Political rifts, which plagued his last term, have delayed a deal on a new government for weeks. 
He faces major challenges to navigate Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing politics to agree a cabinet, which must then tackle a list of woes including a banking crisis and currency crash.
In his weekly sermon, Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai congratulated Hariri and urged him to rebuild the devastated capital Beirut after the huge port blast in August that killed nearly 200 people.
Rai had criticized leaders for delaying cabinet talks, blaming them for the unprecedented economic collapse which has doomed many Lebanese to poverty. Rai heads the Maronite church in Lebanon, the religious sect from which the head of state must be drawn.
""Overcome the conditions and counter-conditions of the political groups, avoid the quagmire of interests...Beware of secret bilateral deals and promises,"" he told Hariri on Sunday. 
At the same time, Rai said: ""Do not put the Christians behind your back.""
Hariri was not nominated for the PM job by Lebanon's two main Christian blocs: the Free Patriotic Movement, led by President Michel Aoun's son-in-law, and the Lebanese Forces led by Aoun's civil war rival. 
Rai also called on Hariri to work with Aoun to ensure the revival of a French plan to help Lebanon and the success of Lebanon's talks with Israel over their disputed maritime border.

The patriarch repeated his calls for the country to be ""neutral"" from regional conflicts - widely understood as references to Lebanon's Shi'ite Hezbollah movement that is backed by Iran.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuanians returned to the polls on Sunday for the second round of a parliamentary election where the centre-right opposition expects victory as unemployment and debt hurt the government.
Voting was scheduled to end at 1800 GMT, with results reported a few hours later.
The Baltic Sea state of less than 3 million people has fared relatively well in the coronavirus crisis, though cases have spiked of late as elsewhere around Europe. 
But Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis has faced criticism for failing to create more jobs and stop debt mounting.
The opposition Homeland Union, with roots in the 1980s anti-Soviet independence movement, led the proportional vote of the first round with 24.8%, versus 17.5% for the Farmers and Greens party (LVZS), an agrarian group leading Skvernelis' coalition.
Under Lithuania's hybrid system, the other half of the 141-member parliament is elected in run-off votes in constituencies on Sunday. 
Ingrida Simonyte, who would lead a Homeland Union government, told local media she was confident the party and its two likely coalition partners were on track towards a majority in the parliament.
She was finance minister in a previous Homeland Union government, which lost power in 2012 after one of Europe's harshest austerity programmes, which caused a collapse in GDP of about 15% in 2009.
The party failed to regain a footing in 2016, when LVZS, led by a wealthy businessman Ramunas Karbauskis, won over many Lithuanians worried about sluggish economic growth.
Karbauskis acknowledged his party might be heading out of government as none of his coalition partners reached the 5% of votes needed to secure seats in parliament in the first round.
Election officials asked voters to mark ballots with their own pens to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Lithuania has reported 9,578 coronavirus infections, including a record 474 new cases on Saturday, and 129 deaths.

Lithuania's economy shrank 4% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2020, the second best result in the European Union. The central bank attributed that to a prompt and short lockdown, generous state support and relatively unaffected trading partners.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - #KingKeepFighting was the hashtag used by the embattled Thai prime minister's operations centre at the weekend on a Twitter post with pictures of a walkabout by King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Faced by protesters' calls on Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to quit and the monarchy's biggest challenge in decades, the royalist establishment is showing signs of attempting to mobilise a counterattack.
The Palace has been silent through months of anti-government protests that have increasingly aimed at the monarchy. But the king on Thursday made a sign of support for former junta leader Prayuth and then on Saturday lauded a royalist demonstrator who had defied protesters.
His supporters took heart.
""Politicians, leaders of enemies of the King - are you ready to flee the Kingdom of Thailand? Your time is almost up,"" Rienthong Nanna, leader of an ultra-royalist vigilante group, threatened on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) at the weekend.
The protests at first targeted Prayuth before demanding curbs to the monarchy's powers too. Demonstrations only grew bigger after a week of tough emergency measures to end them.
With Prayuth still the main target for protesters, the king lit the fire at the cremation of the premier's father on Thursday, nine months after he died.
Then on Sunday, in a widely publicised moment, the monarch expressed encouragement for a man who had defied protesters, telling him: ""Very brave, very good, thank you.""
Thais read the signals.
""The king just left no doubt. He's in this fight and he's backing his royalist-nationalist supporters against the pro-democracy youth movement,"" said James Buchanan, a lecturer at Bangkok’s Mahidol University International College.
Nattabhorn Juengsanguansit, partner at Asia Group Advisors, a government affairs consultancy, said the king's ""actions signal a closer-knit and more aligned establishment.""
""There is heightened tension and a risk of clashes. If the situation worsens, the government could use it as a pretext for a heavier hand,"" she said.
The government says it seeks dialogue with protesters, but some of the most prominent are detained.
""It is now time to come together and consider how to move forward,"" said government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri.
Protests have so far been largely peaceful. When police used water cannon, it only inflamed anger.
CAMPUS SCUFFLE
But a danger sign flared last week when a few dozen yellow-shirted royalists scuffled with students at the Ramkhamhaeng University, claiming victory when the students backed off with one hurt.
Thais remember a decade of street clashes between royalist yellow shirts and red shirt followers of populist leader Thaksin Shinawatra - trouble Prayuth used to justify seizing power in 2014.
""If violent arch-royalist demonstrators clash against the peaceful, progressive protesters, there could be a palace-endorsed army coup,"" said Paul Chambers of Naresuan University.
Some royalist leaders have disavowed violence. For them, defending the monarchy is not political because the monarchy is above politics.
Rienthong, however, characterised the scuffle at the university as normal and said support was growing for tougher action.
""If there is more violation of the monarchy ... loyalists will not stand by and will not hesitate to escalate violence,"" he told reporters.
""SOME OF THEM REALLY HATE US""
Anti-government protesters, stressing a non-violent approach, are concerned.
""Some of them really hate us,"" said protest leader Jutatip Sirikhan.
Police, who intervened at the university, say they will treat everyone fairly and stop violence.
In withdrawing emergency measures last week, Prayuth said he hoped to de-escalate the situation so parliament could resolve the crisis. A special session starts on Monday, but protesters have little confidence.
Prayuth's supporters have a big parliamentary majority because his junta picked the entire upper house before an election last year opponents say was engineered to keep him in power. He says the vote was fair.
Protesters and opposition politicians suspect Prayuth is playing for time.
""We cannot assume that General Prayuth will give in so easily, especially now that the king is signalling his full support,"" said Termsak Chalermpalanupap, at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore.
The number of royalist events has been rising, with almost daily rallies now, from barely any a month ago.
So far, those in Bangkok have largely drawn at most a few hundred people compared to tens of thousands at the anti-government protests.
Outside Bangkok, there have been signs of greater mobilisation with thousands gathering in yellow shirts, although sometimes the crowds also include state employees.
Many Thais are worried what comes next.
A poll by the National Institute of Development Administration found nearly 60% of Thais feared violence between the rival groups or through the intervention of other parties.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of people protested in the centre of Thailand's capital Bangkok on Sunday in the first demonstration since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha ignored their Saturday night deadline to resign.
It was also the first major show of force since Prayuth lifted Oct. 15 emergency measures that had been meant to stop three months of protests against the government and monarchy, but which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets.
""If he doesn't resign, then we must come out to ask him to quit in a peaceful way,"" protest leader Jatupat ""Pai"" Boonpattararaksa said as people chanted ""Prayuth Out"".
The prime minister's office posted a note on Twitter to say he was not quitting. He has said the crisis should be discussed in parliament, which is due to hold a special session on Monday and Tuesday.
But his opponents have little faith in an assembly dominated by his supporters.
There was no sign of a major police presence around protesters at the Ratchaprasong Intersection, an emotive location for protesters as the scene of bloodshed in 2010 in a crackdown by security forces on anti-establishment protests. 
A government spokesman said there would be no use of force and called on people to remain peaceful and respect the law.
In the relaxed atmosphere, a group of drag queens gathered to put on a show. 
Protests since mid-July have put the greatest pressure in years on the establishment, particularly with taboo-breaking calls to limit the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy.
On Monday, protesters are planning to march to the German Embassy in a message to the king, who is currently in Thailand, but spends much of his time in Germany.
""Going to the German Embassy reflects the evident problem of the king's exercise of power is making many people uncomfortable and raises questions whether it violates the German law,"" said activist Piyarat ""Toto"" Chongthep.

Protesters seek the departure of Prayuth and a new constitution. He rejects their accusation that he engineered last year's election to keep power he first took in a 2014 coup. They have also demanded curbs on the monarchy, saying it has enabled decades of military domination.

BAKU (Reuters) - New fighting erupted between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces on Sunday over the mountainous enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh as both sides blamed each other for blocking a peaceful settlement to the conflict. 
Armenia accused Azeri forces of shelling civilian settlements. Baku denied killing civilians and said it was ready to implement a ceasefire, provided that Armenian forces withdrew from the battlefield. 
The weekend's clashes in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo hosted the foreign ministers of both countries in a new peace push on Friday.
The collapse of two Russia-brokered ceasefires had already dimmed the prospect of a quick end to fighting that broke out on Sept. 27 over Nagorno-Karabakh.
Local officials in Nagorno-Karabakh accused Azeri forces of firing artillery on settlements in the areas of Askeran and Martuni during the night. Azerbaijan said its positions had been attacked with small arms, mortars, tanks, mortars, and howitzers. 
""I am absolutely confident in the effectiveness of the peace negotiations but this also depends on the will of the Armenian side to take part in them,"" said Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev.
""Why can Azerbaijani and Armenian people live together in Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, and other countries but not in Nagorno Karabakh?"" he added in a Fox News interview that was reprinted by the state Azertag News Agency. 
Armenian President Armen Sarkissian accused Baku of being ""aggressively stubborn and destructive"".
World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict. 
Sarkissian, in comments reprinted by the Armenpress news agency, called on ""global players"" to step in immediately to bring about a ceasefire.
""In the context of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Russia is a trusted and pro-active mediator between the conflicting sides. Russia plays a crucial role here,"" he said. 
Aliyev said it was ""very hazardous"" for Armenia to want Russian military support in the conflict and third parties should not get involved militarily. 
Russian President Vladimir Putin has said he hoped that the United States would help Moscow broker a solution to the conflict.
The defence ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh said on Saturday the total number of Armenians killed in the fighting had risen by 36 to 963, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.
Azerbaijan says 65 Azeri civilians have been killed and 298 wounded, but has not disclosed its military casualties.

About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control.

Lopez’s party, Popular Will, did not say how he left Venezuela, but two people familiar with the matter said he travelled via Colombia. 
Lopez was jailed in 2014 after leading protests against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. He was released to house arrest in 2017.
From house arrest, he was a mentor to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who early last year invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency and began a campaign to unseat Maduro.
In April 2019, when Guaido tried to spur a military revolt against Maduro, Lopez appeared on the streets again alongside him. When the uprising fizzled, Lopez sought shelter first in the Chilean diplomatic residence and then at the home of the Spanish ambassador.

Lopez’s wife, Lilian Tintori, who had joined him at the Spanish ambassador's residence, left for Spain in May 2019, along with their daughter.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chileans will vote on Sunday on whether they want the country's Pinochet-era constitution torn up and replaced by a fresh charter drafted by citizens, a key demand in protests that erupted last year. 
The fiery anti-government protests over inequality and elitism in one of Latin America's most advanced economies broke out last fall and resumed with the easing of coronavirus lockdowns.
Voters have 12 hours beginning at 8 a.m. (1100 GMT) to cast their ballot.
Citizens can decide whether to approve or reject a new constitution and whether it should be drafted by a specially elected citizens' body, made up half of women and half of men, and indigenous representatives, or a mix of citizens and lawmakers. 
Opinion polls suggest a new charter will be approved by a significant margin. 
All eligible Chileans from the country's population of 18 million are automatically registered to vote, but voting is optional. 
People with COVID-19 have been told to stay away from voting stations on threat of arrest and prosecution. 
Control points have been set up at least 20 meters (22 yards) from polling place entrances where officials will conduct identity spot checks to ensure people are not on the quarantine list. 
""The right to vote of an infected subject puts at risk the right to health of thousands of people,"" Attorney General Jorge Abbott told regional staff in an email. 
Soldiers, ubiquitous on Chilean streets since the declaration of a state of emergency during the protests last year and again with the outbreak of COVID-19 in March, will oversee the process inside polling stations while police will guard outside. 

The current constitution was drafted by dictator Augusto Pinochet's close adviser Jaime Guzman in 1980, and has only been tweaked by successive governments to reduce military and executive power.

On Oct. 22, France relaunched its ""StopCovid"" tracing app and renamed it ""Tous Anti-Covid"" (all against Covid), which has since seen an additional 1.2 million downloads for a total number of about 4 million. 
""For the application to be efficient, about 20% of the population, or 15 to 20 million people, need to download it,"" Digital Affairs Minister Cedrid O said on franceinfo radio. 
He said similar apps were working well in Britain, Germany and Canada but gave no examples of successful contact tracing in France with the app. 
Many in France have been reluctant to download the app over privacy concerns, despite the government's reassurances that the data will not be used for any other purpose than stopping the pandemic.
O said the app would be a crucial tool in preventing the spread of infection once France ends a curfew imposed on two-thirds of the population in an effort to rein in contagion.
The app works with bluetooth and warns users if they have been within one metre (3.3 feet) of an infected person for at least 15 minutes.
""It does mean that you need to have your bluetooth on and that the other person is also using the app,"" O said. 
President Emmanuel Macron said in mid-October that the previously used app had not worked well and that users of the new one would be instructed to switch it on only when they are in close proximity with other people, like on the subway or at parties, and that it made no sense to leave it on all the time. 
Prime Minister Jean Castex said last month that he had not downloaded his government's coronavirus contact-tracing app because he does not take the metro.

On Saturday, France registered a new record of more than 45,000 coronavirus infections over a 24-hour period.

""I have no doubt that if they (Qatar) want it and are willing to pay, sooner or later they will get it,"" Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz, who sits in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet, told Ynet TV. 
""This is a supposition that we must take into account,"" he said, arguing that the U.S. administration ""ultimately looks out for American interests,"" especially in the face of rival stealth jets on offer from Russia and China.
Reuters reported on Oct. 7 that gas-rich Qatar had submitted a formal request to buy the F-35, a  Lockheed Martin  (N:LMT) plane that has so far been supplied only to Israel in the region. Israel, with which Washington consults on such sales, said it would be opposed.
U.S. officials have been open to selling the F-35 to the United Arab Emirates after it and Bahrain normalised relations with Israel on Sept. 15. But they have been tight-lipped on Qatar's bid to buy the jet. 
Successive U.S. administrations have sought to preserve Israeli military superiority in the region. Steinitz noted, however, that there had been past U.S. sales of advanced aircraft to Arab countries over Israeli objections.
Israel initially voiced misgivings about the UAE getting F-35s. The Netanyahu government dropped these on Friday after Defence Minister Benny Gantz returned from Washington with new U.S. security guarantees for Israel. 

There has been speculation in Israeli media that the Trump administration could hold out the F-35 as an inducement for Qatar to normalise ties with Israel. Qatar has ruled out such a diplomatic move without a resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

Ramkalawan, a former Anglican priest, defeated President Danny Faure after three decades of unsuccessful runs for the presidency of the East African nation, an Indian Ocean archipelago famed for its natural beauty and rare wildlife. 
Ramkalawan captured 54.9% of the vote while Faure got 43.5% in the vote held from Thursday through Saturday, the electoral commission announced.
Ramkalawan promised to continue working with Faure - an unusually good-natured transfer of power for the nearby African continent where many rulers are eliminating term limits and cracking down on political opposition. 
""Mr Faure and I are good friends. And an election does not mean the end of one's contribution to one's motherland,"" Ramkalawan said in his victory speech. ""In this election, there were no losers, there were no winners. Our country was given the opportunity as the ultimate winner.""
As he spoke, Faure sat close by, nodding his head. 
Back in 1977, power changed hands via a coup that led to 27 years of rule by Albert Rene, punctuated by several coup attempts including one in 1981 by South African-backed mercenaries masquerading as vacationing rugby players. 
Faure's United Seychelles party had been in power over the past 43 years but this was the first time he had faced voters himself. He was vice president when his predecessor resigned in 2016 after a constitutional amendment was passed limiting presidents to two terms.
Faure's chances may have been damaged by a severe economic downturn. Travel restrictions imposed due to the global COVID-19 pandemic mean the Seychelles economy is expected contract by 13.8% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.
It is a stunning reversal of fragile progress since the government defaulted on its debt in 2008 and sought an IMF bailout.
Both Ramkalawan, of the Linyon Demokratik Seselwa party, and another opposition candidate, Alain St Ange of the One Seychelles party, had promised voters they would raise the minimum wage.

This week's election was for both the presidency and parliament. Ramakalawan's party will have 20 directly elected parliament seats and five nominated ones, while Faure's party will have six directly elected members and four nominated.

The 12 were arrested on Aug. 23 for alleged illegal entry into mainland China after setting off from Hong Kong in a boat bound for democratic Taiwan, amid a crackdown by Beijing on pro-democracy activists in the former British colony.
Hong Kong's Security Bureau has said all 12 were suspected of committing crimes including manufacturing or possessing explosives, arson and rioting in Hong Kong.
Many demonstrators wore black shirts, with some holding signs demanding ""immediate release"" for the 12 and others waving yellow umbrellas, a symbol of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement. 
""We want the Chinese Communist Party to know the entire world is paying attention to the 12 people so that they can't act unjustly,"" said Roger, a frontline protester in Hong Kong's sometimes violent rallies who fled to Taiwan last year. He asked that his full name not be used. 
""The attention for Hong Kong is waning. We need to come out and support Hong Kongers,"" he told Reuters at the Taipei rally, part of a campaign for the 12 people in 35 cities around the world. An online rally is scheduled in Hong Kong on Sunday evening. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has said the 12 will have to face justice in the mainland and that her government will provide them with ""needed and feasible"" assistance. 
Ten of them were on bail and not allowed to leave Hong Kong, authorities have said. 
Taiwan shares with the Hong Kong protesters a deep antipathy for Beijing, which considers Taiwan its territory and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in May became the first government leader globally to pledge measures to help Hong Kong people who leave due to what they see as tightening Chinese controls.
The flight of protesters, however, has piled pressure on Taiwan government and strained its already poor ties with Beijing, which has ramped up military activities near Taiwan. 

At least a dozen more pro-democracy activists have reached Taiwan by boat, Reuters reported in September, citing several sources with knowledge of the matter.

Muhyiddin on Friday asked the king to impose emergency rule that would include suspending parliament, the sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, a move critics have decried as an attempt by the premier to stay in power amid a leadership challenge.
Muhyiddin has been in a precarious position since he took office in March with a two-seat majority. Uncertainties deepened after opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim said last month he had the parliamentary majority to form a new government. 
The prime minister's proposal comes as Malaysia faces a resurgence in COVID-19, a pandemic-battered economy and doubts over his ability to pass a budget for 2021.
King Al-Sultan Abdullah's meeting with other senior royals, called the Council of Rulers, began at around 0630 GMT at the national palace.
The constitution gives the king the right to decide if an emergency should be declared, based on threats to security, economy or public order. The Council of Rulers can deliberate on questions of national policy and has the power to withhold consent from any law.
An emergency would give extra powers to the prime minister, who can then introduce rules and approve expenditure without the usual parliamentary process. 
Several political leaders from the opposition and even the ruling coalition have come out against the proposed emergency, saying there was no justification for it except to prevent the collapse of the government. 
Some opposition lawmakers have also suggested a 'confidence and supply' arrangement under the Westminster system, which would mean opposition lawmakers vote in favour of the government on certain bills.
Media reports have said Muhyiddin's emergency proposal seeks to suspend political activities and would not affect other economic activity. 
""A state of emergency may provide some form of stability in the short term, especially concerning policy implementation,"" Affin Hwang Capital Asset Management said in a research note. 

""Though if left unchecked and prolonged, it is harmful to the country's democratic process and governance,"" it said, adding equity and bond markets could see a knee-jerk selloff if an emergency is imposed.

The NDP has been running a minority government since 2017, with support of the province's Green Party. NDP leader John Horgan called an election in early September saying he wanted to ensure stability for the province as it responds to challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The snap election call drew criticism from rival parties including the Greens, who said sending people to the polls in the middle of a pandemic was a major health risk.
NDP was leading in 54 out of the 87 seats in the BC legislative assembly, CBC News said, with 44 seats required to form the government. The centre-right Liberal Party was ahead in 30 seats.
The NDP and Liberals were tied at 41 seats each in the last assembly.
The pandemic resulted in more than a million of BC's 3.5 million registered voters casting their ballots in advance or by mail-in ballot before voting day.
Horgan entered the race with a 69% approval rating in August, the highest of any premier in Canada, according to Canadian pollster Angus Reid.
BC, Canada's third-most populous province, has had approximately five deaths per 100,000 residents - a lower rate than the provinces of Ontario or Quebec. 
While BC has been credited with largely managing to contain the pandemic in the first few months, it has seen cases spike in recent weeks along with the rest of Canada.

BC finances were hit by the economic downturn triggered by COVID-19, going from a projected surplus of C$227 million ($171 million) for financial year 2020-21 to a forecasted C$12.8 billion deficit.

NATO members Turkey and Greece are locked in a dispute over the extent of their continental shelves and conflicting claims to hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean. 
The row erupted in August when Turkey sent Oruc Reis into waters also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.
Along with two other ships, the Ataman and Cengiz Han, Oruc Reis will continue work in an area south of the Greek island of Rhodes until Nov. 4, a Turkish naval maritime notice said late on Saturday. 
A previous notice scheduled survey work in the area until Oct. 27.
Ankara withdrew Oruc Reis last month to allow for diplomacy before a European Union summit, where Cyprus sought sanctions against Turkey. It was sent back this month, prompting an angry response from Greece, France and Germany.

After the summit, the bloc said it would punish Turkey if it continued its operations in the region, in a move Ankara said further strained Turkey-EU ties. Turkey says its operations are within its continental shelf.

The head of the U.S. National Counter-Terrorism Center, Chris Miller, confirmed al-Masri's death in a statement, saying his ""removal .. from the battlefield is a major setback to a terrorist organization that is consistently experiencing strategic losses facilitated by the United States and its partners.""
Al Qaeda's loss of al-Masri, Miller continued, ""highlights the diminishing effectiveness of the terrorist organization.""
Al-Masri has been charged in the United States with having provided material support and resources to a foreign terrorist organisation, and conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals.
Al-Masri, believed to be al Qaeda's second-in-command, was killed during a special operation in Ghazni province, the NDS said. 
The FBI declined to comment. 
The al Qaeda operative, who also went by the name Husam Abd-al-Ra'uf, was an Egyptian national, according to the FBI.
Last month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said fewer than 200 al Qaeda operatives remain in Afghanistan.
This month marks 19 years since the United States invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban rulers, who had harboured al Qaeda militants who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.
The United States has been gradually drawing down its troops from Afghanistan after striking a landmark deal with the Taliban in February. 
That deal is set to see foreign forces leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power sharing formula with the Afghan government. 
The intra-Afghan peace process kicked off in Doha last month. Despite the talks, fighting between Taliban and Afghan government forces has raged in recent weeks.

Last week, U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said the Taliban had agreed to ""re-set"" their commitments under a troop withdrawal deal and reduce the number of casualties in the country.

Lopez Obrador has sought to bolster state-owned energy companies, especially oil giant Pemex, since assuming power on Dec. 2018. But industry figures say this has come at the expense of private companies and led to cancellation of contracts.
On Thursday, 43 lawmakers from both sides of Congress wrote to Trump saying Lopez Obrador's government is threatening U.S. energy companies' investments and market access, as well as undermining a regional trade deal.
Lopez Obrador, referring to the letter, said that in the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement there were two paragraphs that talk about Mexico's ""absolute, sovereign right"" to decide its energy policy.
""With much respect, in this matter, we have not signed any agreement with the government of the United States or Canada,"" Lopez Obrador said during a tour of northern Mexico.
Negotiated at the behest of Trump, the USMCA from July replaced the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Lopez Obrador's government has sought to roll back energy reforms put in place by his predecessor, Enrique Pena Nieto. 
The leftist leader argues that past governments fronted by corrupt politicians skewed the Mexican energy market in favor of private interests at the expense of the public.
But private companies say the government's approach has seen it renege on contracts, with projects having to be frozen or cancelled even when they are near completion.

Energy companies believe their contracts were covered by pre-existing agreements and are preparing litigation against Mexico, according to lawyers and industry sources.

Pizzaballa, 55, a Franciscan friar, has served as the acting Patriarch for four years and has steered the diocese through a financial crisis and the coronavirus pandemic, when the churches at the birthplace of Christianity were closed throughout its holiest season, Easter.
In ordinary years, the Holy Land would be preparing for an influx of pilgrims over Christmas - but the outbreak has dealt a heavy blow to tourism in Bethlehem, Jerusalem and Nazareth, home to some of its most famous churches.

KUMBA, Cameroon (Reuters) - Gunmen stormed a school in Cameroon on Saturday and opened fire indiscriminately, killing at least six children and wounding about eight more in a region where separatist insurgents operate, officials and parents said. 
Arriving on motorcycles and in civilian clothes, the attackers hit the school around midday in the city of Kumba in South West Region, according to the accounts, including from one parent outside the school at the time. 
Some children were injured jumping from second storey windows.
It was unclear if the attack was linked to an ongoing struggle between the army and groups seeking to form a breakaway state called Ambazonia in the English-speaking west. 
But it was a grim new low in a region that since 2017 has seen hundreds die and thousands displaced because of the conflict, with many children unable to attend school.
""They found the children in class and they opened fire on them,"" city sub-prefect Ali Anougou told Reuters. 
Isabel Dione ran into the school to search for her 12-year-old daughter when she heard about the shooting. She found her on the floor of a classroom, bleeding from the stomach. 
""She was helpless and she was shouting 'mum please help me', and I told her 'only your God can save you now',"" Dione told Reuters. The girl was rushed to hospital where she is undergoing treatment for a gunshot wound. 
SEPARATISTS DENOUNCE ATTACK
The United Nations' Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said eight children were killed, some by machete, and that 12 were wounded.
Videos circulating on social media filmed by local journalists showed adults rushing from the school with children in their arms, surrounded by wailing onlookers.
One photo verified by Reuters showed the inside of a classroom, where dried blood had pooled on the floor near some scattered flip-flops. 
Local education official Ahhim Abanaw Obase confirmed six deaths of children aged between 12 and 14, and added that another eight had been taken to hospital. 
Anougou and another official blamed the attack on the secessionists, but did not offer evidence.
Prominent separatist leader Ayuk Tabe described the attack as ""inhumane"" in a Twitter post and said ""anyone responsible for these atrocities must be brought to book.""
Still, many armed splinter groups have emerged from inside the separatist movement since 2017, and one voice rarely speaks for all. 
Anglophone secessionists have imposed curfews and closed schools as part of their protest against President Paul Biya's French-speaking government and its perceived marginalisation of the English-speaking minority. Rights groups have documented abuses on civilians from both sides. 

Last year, officials blamed separatists for kidnapping dozens of schoolchildren, which separatist leaders denied.

ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's police chief ordered the immediate mobilisation of all force resources on Saturday to try to control the worst street violence in two decades stemming from protests against police brutality.
The unrest, unprecedented since the 1999 return to civilian rule, is the most serious political crisis confronting President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler elected in 2015.
Violence, particularly in the commercial capital Lagos, escalated after demonstrators were shot on Tuesday night in the city's Lekki district during a round-the-clock curfew. 
Witnesses blamed soldiers. 
Rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police had killed at least 12 protesters in two districts, though the army and police denied any involvement.
Several states, mostly in southern Nigeria, have imposed curfews after two weeks of confrontations between protesters and members of the security services. 
As pockets of unrest flared again on Saturday in parts of the country, a spokesman for southern Cross River state said several buildings had been vandalised over the last two days including a shopping mall, a bank and electoral offices. 
A round-the-clock curfew was reimposed on parts of the central city of Jos, just a day after it was relaxed on Friday, following the looting of emergency food supplies stored there by the disasters ministry, authorities said.
""This looting has spread to other facilities and is gradually degenerating thereby threatening the peace and security of the state,"" the governor of Plateau state, Simon Lalong, said in a statement. 
The Nigeria Police Force said its inspector general Mohammed Adamu had ordered the immediate deployment of all assets and resources to end violence, looting and destruction of property by criminals masquerading as protesters.
""The IGP enjoins law-abiding citizens not to panic but rather join forces with the police and other members of the law enforcement community to protect their communities from the criminal elements,"" the force said in a statement.
On a call between Buhari and former Nigerian presidents, the head of state said 51 civilian fatalities and 37 injuries had been recorded as a result of ""hooliganism"" in recent weeks, according to a statement released on Saturday outlining his opening remarks. 
Unrest escalated in parts of Nigeria after the shooting of the protesters who had gathered in Lagos on Tuesday night in defiance of a curfew to demonstrate against police brutality. 
Olusegun Samuel, the guardian of one protester who was shot at that demonstration, said on Saturday that the 24-year-old may have his right leg amputated due to a severe wound.
""It is a very painful issue, very very painful issue. A young boy of his age,"" said Samuel, speaking at a Lagos hospital.

Lagos state eased curfew restrictions on Saturday to 6 p.m.-8 a.m. Workers took to streets to sweep away broken glass while cars again filled the roads.

(Reuters) - A police officer in Waukegan, Illinois, was fired after he shot and killed an unarmed Black teenager and wounded the young man's 20-year-old Black girlfriend during a traffic stop earlier this week. 
The unidentified officer was terminated from his job on Friday night for multiple policy and procedure violations, the Waukegan Police Department said in a statement, three days after the incident left 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette dead and his girlfriend Tafarra Williams (NYSE:WMB) wounded. 
Some 200 to 300 people were expected to hold a demonstration calling for justice on Saturday in the city of 85,000 people in Lake County about 45 miles (72 km) north of Chicago, according to Clyde McLemore, a local organizer.
Similar protests and marches against racism and police brutality have swept across the United States during the last six months following the May 25 killing of African-American George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis. 
Waukegan is 15 miles (25 km) south of Kenosha, Wisconsin, where sometimes violent protests erupted after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, a Black man, in the back several times on Aug. 23. 
According to Waukegan police, a Hispanic male officer was conducting a traffic stop on Tuesday night when he shot into the couple’s car because it went into reverse and he feared for his safety. No firearm was found in the vehicle, the police said. 
Stinnette, who was the passenger in the vehicle, died, while Williams was wounded in the abdomen and wrist, according to Satrese Stallworth, a relative of Stinnette and a spokeswoman for the family. 
Williams remains in the hospital, the Waukegan Police Department said. 
“We do not trust the police narrative in this case. We have seen over and over that the ‘official’ report when police kill Black people is far too often missing or misrepresenting details,” Williams' attorney, Ben Crump, said in a statement. 

The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to assist the Illinois State Police in its investigation.

The agreement, brokered with the help of the United States and announced on Friday, made Sudan the third Arab government to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months.
""An Israeli delegation will leave to Sudan in the coming days to complete the agreement,"" Netanyahu said at a news conference.
It was unclear, however, how long it will take for an accord to be completed. The military and civilian leaders of Sudan's transitional government have been divided over how fast and how far to go in establishing ties with Israel. 
The Sudanese premier wants approval from a yet-to-be formed parliament to proceed with a broader, formal normalisation, and that may not be a quick process given the sensitivities and civilian-military differences. It is unclear when the assembly will be created. 
U.S. President Donald Trump's decision this week to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism paved the way for the accord, marking a foreign policy achievement for the Republican president as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3, trailing in opinion polls behind Democratic rival Joe Biden.
Trump sealed the Israel-Sudan agreement in a phone call with Netanyahu and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, in which he said: ""Do you think 'Sleepy Joe' could have made this deal?"" 
Netanyahu, reliant on bipartisan support for Israel in Washington, responded haltingly: ""Well, Mr. President, one thing I can tell you, is ... we appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America.""

Asked at Saturday's news conference whether he was embarrassed by Trump's question, Netanyahu said: ""It is very difficult to embarrass me,"" and stressed he was grateful to Trump for his policy toward Israel. ""I hope this policy will continue. I don't want to make any prophecies about the election results.""

Lukashenko, who is holding on to power despite major protests in recent weeks calling for him to resign, is facing the prospect of a national strike that could begin on Monday following an ultimatum set by opposition leaders. 
Lukashenko has shown no sign he will heed the ultimatum and step down. Protests against his 26-year rule began following an Aug. 9 election victory his opponents say was rigged.
Lukashenko had sought to mend fences with the West in recent years and Pompeo had travelled to Belarus in February in a bid to ""normalise"" ties. But the crisis after the disputed election pushed Lukashenko back closer to traditional ally Russia. 
Washington has imposed sanctions on Belarus officials following violent crackdowns at demonstrations in Minsk and across the country. 
Protesters shouting slogans and waving red-and-white opposition flags marched through the streets of Minsk on Saturday, footage taken by local media showed. 
""Russia does not interfere in the internal affairs of Belarus. At the same time, the countries are ready to jointly respond to emerging external threats,"" Russia's Interfax news agency cited Belarus state television as saying, describing the call. 

""By mutual opinion, after Pompeo's February visit to Minsk, the situation has changed dramatically, new challenges have arisen and are emerging,"" Interfax cited Belarusian state television as saying.

Mario Delgado, a centrist leading Morena in the lower house of Congress, claimed victory over veteran political operator Porfirio Munoz Ledo, who has been critical of Lopez Obrador on certain issues.
Delgado won by taking 58.6% of the vote to 41.4% for Munoz Ledo, the El Universal newspaper said, citing Morena lawmakers. 
But in a sign of the underlying tensions that have spilt out in the open within Lopez Obrador's party, leftist Munoz Ledo, 87, disputed the result by saying it was ""illegal"".
""Today unity wins,"" Delgado, claiming victory, said on his Twitter account. ""We are going to keep working so that our movement continues to conquer new spaces and advances the (Morena) transformation project.""
The previous poll was declared a tie, with both candidates accusing each other of trying to gain control of the party illegitimately.
Their ugly fight has come to represent the tensions roiling Morena, a party created by Lopez Obrador in 2014. A wide range of politicians with sometimes clashing ideologies joined Morena as the party gained momentum on way to its dominant 2018 national elections triumph by Lopez Obrador.
The fissures in the party may pose a threat to Morena's electoral performance at the 2021 mid-term elections, where the party hopes to maintain its tight grip on Congress.
Delgado, 58, is seen to be close to both Mexico's president and Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard, who some see as a potential successor to Lopez Obrador when his six-year term finishes. Mexican leaders can only serve one term.

Munoz Ledo was aiming to become the leader of the third Mexican party, having headed the Institutional Revolutionary Party that ruled Mexico for seven decades as well as opposition Democratic Revolution Party.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Anti-government protesters in Thailand said on Saturday they would hold demonstrations on Sunday and Monday after Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha ignored their 10 p.m. (0300 GMT) deadline to resign.
Asked by journalists whether he would stand down, Prayuth simply said ""won't quit"" after Buddhist prayers that were held to call for national healing following months of protests that have also demanded reforms of the monarchy.
After the deadline expired, one group of protesters said they would protest on Sunday. Another group said they would go to the German embassy on Monday - making an indirect reference to the fact that the king spends much of his time in Germany.
""Prayuth is the problem. The first obstacle that we need to remove,"" said Jatupat “Pai” Boonpattararaksa, one of the leaders of the demonstration planned for Sunday. He was among dozens of protesters arrested this month and was freed on bail on Friday.
Since July, protesters have been demanding the departure of Prayuth and a new constitution. More recently they have also stepped up demands for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy.
Prayuth, who first took power in a 2014 coup, rejects the accusations of his critics that he engineered last year's election to keep power.
After the prayers he said: ""I urge everyone to conciliate and help solve problems together.""
He has called for an emergency session of parliament on Monday and Tuesday to try to resolve the crisis, but his opponents have little faith in the outcome given his supporters have a parliamentary majority.

The king has made no public comment on the protests but his praise on Friday for a man who held up a royal portrait at an anti-establishment rally stirred passions - with monarchists lauding the action and protesters pouring scorn.

KABUL (Reuters) - A suicide bombing at an education centre in Afghanistan's capital Kabul killed at least 18 people and wounded dozens more on Saturday, officials said. 
A Ministry of Interior spokesman, Tariq Arian, cited security guards as identifying a bomber who detonated explosives in the street outside the Kawsar-e Danish educational centre. 
Eighteen people were killed and 57 were injured in the attack, according to the interior ministry.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the bombing, the group said in a statement on Telegram, without providing evidence.
A Taliban spokesman on Twitter denied responsibility for the attack, which comes at a sensitive time as teams representing the insurgents and the government meet in Qatar to seek a peace deal.
The attack took place in an area of west Kabul that is home to many from the country's Shia community, a religious minority in Afghanistan targeted by groups such as Islamic State in the past. 
Dozens of students died in the same area of Kabul in an attack on another education centre in 2018, while in May gunmen attacked a maternity ward, killing 24, including mothers and babies. 
The latest attack comes on the back of heavy fighting in multiple provinces in recent weeks, which has displaced thousands of civilians in southern Helmand province.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - President Alpha Conde of Guinea won the Oct. 18 election with 59.5% of the vote, according to a full preliminary tally from the election commission on Saturday. 
The victory, which requires confirmation by the Constitutional Court, gives a third term in office to the 82-year-old Conde after a bitterly fought election in which the opposition said he had no right to participate. 
Conde says a constitutional referendum in March reset his two-term limit, but opponents say he is breaking the law by holding onto power. 
Results were announced in batches in recent days, and already showed Conde with an unassailable lead, sparking street protests in opposition strongholds in which at least 17 died.
The capital Conakry was largely calm on Saturday as Conde supporters in yellow T-shirts celebrated by driving around the city centre. Elsewhere, soldiers in red berets patrolled the streets in trucks, some fit with gun turrets, a Reuters witness said. 
Former prime minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, Conde's nearest rival with 33.5% of the vote, said he has evidence of fraud and plans to file a complaint with the constitutional court. Diallo, 68, also finished runner-up to Conde in the 2010 and 2015 elections. 
Under the law, complaints must be filed within eight days of the preliminary results. 
Conde's 2010 election after decades in opposition raised hopes for democratic progress in the bauxite-producing West African country. 
But his move to run again has many observers worried about a backslide towards authoritarianism in a region that had made strides towards multi-party democracy since the 1990s. 
Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara is also running for a third term in elections this month after using a change in the constitution as a reset, sparking violent street clashes in recent days.

""The pause will allow time for the Department and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to review program content,"" it said. 
Trump's Sept. 22 executive order forbid the teaching by federal agencies of ""divisive concepts"" including that the United States is ""fundamentally racist or sexist.""
The order followed a Sept. 4 memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget that told officials at federal agencies they could not use taxpayer dollars to fund ""un-American propaganda sessions"" that provided instruction about critical race theory, white privilege or ""taught that the United States is an inherently racist or evil"" country. 
The State Department did not respond to a request for comment on the cable. 
The move comes less than two weeks before the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which the debate about racial injustice in the United States has been fueled by police killings of Black Americans that sparked nationwide protests over the summer. 
During the first debate with his Democratic rival Joe Biden, Trump defended his executive order saying the training programs were teaching people ""very bad ideas."" 
""And really, they were teaching people to hate our country and I'm not going to do that,"" Trump said at the Sept. 29 debate. ""They were teaching people that our country is a horrible place."" 
Biden, who has accused Trump of racism, leads by 8 percentage points nationally, according to the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, with 51% of likely voters say they are backing the Democratic challenger while 43% are voting for the president. 
At the pair's second debate, on Thursday, Trump denied the accusations and said he was least racist person in the room. 
'APPROVED PROGRAMS' 
With its 76,000 employees globally and representing the face of America in the world, State Department has had a mixed track record on diversity, with racial and ethnic minorities still underrepresented, particularly in senior ranks, according to an independent federal watchdog report released earlier this year.
""Longstanding diversity issues persist,"" said the report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, concluding that while the overall proportion of racial or ethnic minorities at the agency has grown, proportions of African Americans and women have declined. 
The State Department cable said it was in regular contact with OMB to discuss the 'effective implementation' of the executive order and minimize the time needed for review to ensure 'approved programs' can resume in a timely fashion. 
It also said the Foreign Service Institute (FSI), which trains American diplomats, will collect the relevant training materials and submit them for review.

""As the senior Department official responsible for ensuring compliance with Executive Order 13950, I share the Department's strong commitment to building an inclusive and diverse workforce to effectively deliver on our national security and foreign policy mission goals,"" Brian Bulatao, undersecretary for management at the State Department, told employees in the cable.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai King Maha Vajiralongkorn's praise for a ""very brave"" man who held up a royal portrait at an anti-establishment rally has won acclaim from monarchists but scorn from demonstrators in a nation convulsed by three months of protests.
The king has made no public comment on the protests seeking the resignation of the prime minister and also increasingly targeting royal powers.
But on Friday, as he greeted thousands of people who had come to the Grand Palace to express devotion, he lauded a man introduced by Queen Suthida as the person who raised a picture of his late father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, at a protest last week.
""Very brave, very brave, very good, thank you,"" the king said in a video circulated widely on social media.
The man, Thitiwat Tanagaroon, told Reuters he had waited from 2 p.m. until 9 p.m. to see the king, which was the highlight of his life. 
""The king tapped his hand on my shoulder very hard when he said thank you ... I will put the shirt I wore in a frame,"" restaurant manager Thitiwat, 49, said by phone.
Support for the monarchy was not political because the institution was above the fray, he said. ""The king cares about all people, no matter how rich or poor.""
The incident drew a big response across Thailand.
'VERY TOUCHED'
Leader of the royalist Thai Pakdee (Loyal Thai) group, Warong Dechgitvigrom, said it demonstrated the monarchy's closeness to the people. ""We are very touched,"" he posted on social media. 
But demonstrators said the king's comment had clarified his opposition to them, with the #23OctEyesOpened hashtag tweeted over half a million times. 
""Very brave, very brave, very good for such a clear expression,"" commented sarcastically one protest leader Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree, who has put less emphasis than others on the need for royal reform.
""The king has not been above political problems but always sits at the heart of the problems,"" commented another protest leader, Piyarat Chongthep. 
The Royal Palace and government spokesman declined to comment.
Protesters seek the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader they accuse of engineering an election last year to keep power. He denies the accusation.
The protests also seek changes to the constitution and to reduce the powers of the monarchy, which they say has helped enable decades of military domination.
Under Thailand's constitution, the monarchy is ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"" but in principle it does not engage in politics - a point the king underlined during elections last year.

James Buchanan, a lecturer at Bangkok's Mahidol University International College, said the king's comments marked his clearest intervention so far in Thailand's crisis. ""I interpret it as signalling that the king acknowledges the challenge to his authority by the protests, but will not back down,"" he said.

Earlier this month, Macron pledged to fight ""Islamist separatism"", which he said was threatening to take control in some Muslim communities around France, drawing a sharp rebuke from Erdogan.
France has since been shaken by the beheading of a history teacher by an Islamist radical, who had wanted to avenge the teacher's use of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression.
""What is the problem of this person called Macron with Muslims and Islam? Macron needs treatment on a mental level,"" Erdogan said in a speech at a provincial congress of his AK Party in the central Turkish city of Kayseri.
""What else can be said to a head of state who does not understand freedom of belief and who behaves in this way to millions of people living in his country who are members of a different faith?"" Erdogan added.
Erdogan is a pious Muslim and since his Islamist-rooted AK Party first came to power in 2002 he has sought to shift Islam into the mainstream of politics in Turkey, an overwhelmingly Muslim but secular country.
The Turkish president said on Oct. 6 after Macron's initial comments on ""Islamist separatism"", that the remarks were ""a clear provocation"" and showed the French leader's ""impertinence"".
Turkey and France are NATO members but have been at odds over issues including policies in Syria and Libya, maritime jurisdiction in the eastern Mediterranean and the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Erdogan and Macron discussed their disagreements in a phone call last month and agreed to improve ties and keep communication channels open.

The ministry said five members of the girl's family in the eastern city of Besancon had been deported to Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, on Saturday morning.
""This expulsion from the national territory is the consequence of unacceptable behaviour on the part of the family in August, notably beatings and the shaving of an adolescent girl who was in love with a young Serbian man of another religion,"" the ministry said. 
It added that the girl, a minor, will be taken care of by social services and will obtain the right of residence in France when she reaches majority. 
French media reported in August that a 17-year old Bosnian Muslim woman in Besancon had been beaten by her family and her hair had been forcefully shaved off because she wanted to marry a 20-year old Serbian Christian.
Bosnian and Serb forces fought a war in the 1990s that resulted in thousands of civilian deaths.

Latest officials figures showed the coronavirus had killed 32,320 Iranians and infected 562,705, with 5,814 new cases and 335 fatalities in the previous 24 hours.
Taking a swipe at arch-foe the United States, Khamenei said Iran must enforce curbs better and end disputes between institutions over the pandemic.
""Some countries, such as the United States, have the worst kind of management ... Such behaviours and insults are the way of Americans who embarrass themselves in debates and press briefings in front of the world,"" he said.
""But we must try to do our best because it has to do with people's lives and health, their safety and economy.""
Khamenei, quoted by state TV and IRNA news agency at a coronavirus taskforce meeting, urged stricter controls of entry points, inter-city traffic and public spaces.
""Those who commit major violations of health regulations should be severely penalized,"" he said.

New restrictions in the capital Tehran, including having state employees work every other day, begin on Monday, while other curbs will also apply to 43 other towns and cities.

BAKU/MOSCOW (Reuters) - New clashes broke out between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces over Nagorno-Karabakh a day after talks in Washington to try to end the deadliest fighting in the enclave in more than a quarter of a century. 
Azerbaijan's defence ministry reported fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous part of Azerbaijan populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians. 
It said the areas of Lachin and Gubadli had come under rocket and artillery fire from inside Armenian terrritory. 
In Nagorno-Karabakh, local officials accused Azerbaijan's forces of firing Smerch missiles into residential buildings in Stepanakert, the largest city in the region, which Baku denied.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had met separately with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday in a new attempt to end nearly a month of bloodshed that Russian President Vladimir Putin said may have killed 5,000 people.
The collapse of two Russia-brokered ceasefires had already dimmed the prospect of a quick end to fighting that broke out on Sept. 27 over Nagorno-Karabakh.
The defence ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh said the total number of Armenians killed in the weeks of fighting had risen by 36 to 963, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.
Azerbaijan said a 13-year-old Russian boy died on Saturday after being wounded in a rocket attack on the city of Ganja on Oct 17. Azerbaijan says 65 Azeri civilians have been killed and 298 wounded, but has not disclosed its military casualties.
Azeri forces say they have made territorial gains, including full control over the border with Iran, which Armenia denies. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian administration says its forces have repulsed attacks.
ACCUSATIONS ON BOTH SIDES
President Ilham Aliyev told French newspaper Le Figaro that Azerbaijan was ready to sit down for negotiations but blamed Armenia's actions for the continued hostilities. 
""We are ready to stop even today,"" Aliyev was quoted as saying. ""But, unfortunately, Armenia grossly violated the ceasefire ...If they don't stop, we will go to the end with the aim of liberating all the occupied territories."" 
Armenia's foreign ministry said Azerbaijan's aggression posed an existential threat to the security of the region. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said ""good progress"" was being made on the issue but did not elaborate and declined to say if he had spoken with the leaders of either country. 
Asked how his talks with Pompeo went, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan told reporters ""very good"" as he exited the U.S. State Department, and added that work on a ceasefire would continue.
World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
Differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fuelling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has inflamed the conflict.
Pompeo had said ahead of Friday's talks that he hoped the ""right path forward"" could be found.
But Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he saw no diplomatic resolution of the conflict at this stage, and Aliyev has described the prospects of a peace settlement as ""very remote"". 

About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control.

As of Saturday, 10 of Spain's 17 regions, including Valencia, Asturias, Castilla-La Mancha and the Basque Country, had called on the government to decree a state of emergency, which would allow regions to limit people's movement. 
Regions expect the government to call an extraordinary Council of Ministers on Sunday to approve the measure, Spanish media including El Pais reported. 
""I would say with almost total certainty there will be one. But it has not officially been called yet,"" a source from the Spanish government told Reuters.
While many regions favour some form of curfew, the powerful Madrid region opposes it, which has so far prevented a nationwide decision.
Spain has recorded the highest number of COVID-19 infections in Western Europe. Total cases rose to 1,046,132 on Friday, while the death toll is nearing 38,000.
Catalonia said on Friday night it would impose a curfew across the region, which includes Barcelona, as soon as the central government acted. 
""We need a decentralised state of emergency in which the Catalan government maintains all management capacity,"" deputy Catalan leader Pere Aragones told a news conference. 
""The evolution is very worrying. Either we increase our efforts or COVID-19 increases,"" he said. 
Some regions are considering imposing curfews by alternative means, such as going through regional courts, if the central government does not act. 
""We cannot wait any longer and we have to take steps forward,"" Murcia's regional president Fernando Lopez Miras, told Spanish broadcaster TVE on Saturday. ""If the central government does nothing, we will approve a curfew.""

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government would likely have enough votes to pass the measure in parliament. It would have the votes of the Basque Nationalist Party and other regional parties who support the measure.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The number of South Koreans who have died after getting flu shots has risen to 48, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) said on Saturday, adding that the vaccines would continue to reduce the chance of having simultaneous epidemics. 
The health authorities said they found no direct link between the deaths and the shots. They plan to carry on with the state-run vaccination programme to try to avoid having to fight both the flu and the coronavirus over the coming winter. 
""After reviewing death cases so far, it is not the time to suspend a flu vaccination programme since vaccination is very crucial this year, considering ... the COVID-19 outbreaks,"" KDCA Director Jeong Eun-kyung told a briefing. 
Jeong said the review had shown no direct link between the flu shots and the 26 deaths that have been investigated. 
Some 20 initial autopsy results from the police and the National Forensic Service showed that 13 people died of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and other disorders not caused by the vaccination. 
The death toll among those who have been vaccinated rose by 12 cases from a day earlier to 48 on Saturday. 
The rising deaths have caused some doctors and politicians to call for a halt to the government campaign to vaccinate about 30 million of the country's 54 million people. 
While encouraging people to get flu vaccines, Jeong issued precautions to take before getting the shot, such as drinking enough water and telling healthcare workers about any underlying medical conditions. She also advised people to wait 15-30 minutes before leaving the clinic where they receive their vaccine. 
""If possible, try to get the flu shot when it's warm, since there are concerns that low temperatures could affect cardiovascular disease or cerebrovascular disease,"" she said. 
The KDCA said 9.4 million people had been inoculated as of Friday in the programme that began in September, with 1,154 cases of adverse reactions. 

South Korea reported 77 new coronavirus cases as of Friday midnight, bringing total infections to 25,775, with 457 deaths.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's King Al-Sultan Abdullah will consult with other rulers to discuss proposals by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, the palace said on Saturday, after sources told Reuters the premier had asked the king to declare a state of emergency. 
Muhyiddin met with the king on Friday to present the emergency proposal that includes a suspension of parliament, sources said - a move that opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim denounced as an attempt by the premier to retain control amid a power struggle.
The proposal comes as Malaysia faces a resurgence in coronavirus cases, a pandemic-battered economy and doubts over Muhyiddin's ability to command a majority in parliament and pass the budget for 2021.
The palace did not identify the recommendations made by Muhyiddin, and said the king will soon hold the consultation with other Malay rulers.
""Al-Sultan Abdullah greatly understands the need for the country's administration to continue to tackle the threat of COVID-19,"" the palace said in a statement.
The Council of Rulers, which groups the heads of Malaysia's nine royal houses, has the power to withhold consent from any law and deliberate on questions of national policy.
A source familiar with the matter said the rulers will meet on Sunday.
Muhyiddin's office has not commented on the emergency proposal. 
'NO JUSTIFICATION'
Opposition politicians say there is no valid reason for the government to impose an emergency and that it was meant to avoid a showdown in parliament over the support Muhyiddin commands. 
The government is scheduled to propose its 2021 budget on Nov. 6 when parliament reconvenes early next month. 
There have been questions over whether Muhyiddin can muster a majority in parliament to pass the budget since Anwar staked his claim to form a government. The premier has also come under fire from some of his coalition partners, who have threatened to withdraw support for him and back Anwar instead. 
Defeat on the budget would count as a vote of no-confidence in Muhyiddin and could trigger an election. Emergency rule might mean the budget would not be put to a vote.
Former premier and opposition lawmaker Mahathir Mohamad said there were no riots or a breakdown of law and order to justify an emergency, which would give additional powers to Muhyiddin.
""Faced with the possibility of being overthrown, the prime minister wants the powers under a state of emergency,"" Mahathir in a blog post. 

The Star daily reported the proposed emergency would only affect political activities, and there will be no curfews or any impact on economic activities.

""It is the exploitation of labour that we're against,"" said the head of the Confederation of Indonesian Trade Unions, Said Iqbal. ""We are ready for dialogue, even ready for a debate if necessary in an open, public hearing.""
The government says the legislation will boost employment by cutting red tape, easing restrictions of foreign investment and improving labour market competitiveness. Unions and rights groups say the measures favour business over workers and the environment.

The deal agreed on Friday marked the third Arab government after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months.
""Pay enough ransom, close your eyes to the crimes against Palestinians, then you'll be taken off the so-called ‘terrorism' blacklist,"" the ministry tweeted in English. ""Obviously, the list is as phoney as the U.S. fight against terrorism. Shameful.""
U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Monday he would take Sudan off the list once it had deposited $335 million it had pledged to pay in compensation. 
Khartoum has since placed the funds in a special escrow account for victims of al Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
Trump also said the Palestinians ""are wanting to do something"" but offered no proof. Palestinian leaders have condemned recent Arab overtures to Israel as a betrayal of their nationalist cause for statehood in Israeli-occupied territories. They have refused to engage with the Trump administration, seeing it as biased in favour of Israel.
In recent weeks the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain became the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to agree to formal relations with Israel, forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
The military and civilian leaders of Sudan's transitional government have been divided over how fast and how far to go in establishing ties with Israel. 
A sticking point in the negotiations was Sudan's insistence that any announcement of Khartoum's delisting from terrorism designation not be explicitly linked to relations with Israel.

Sudan’s 1993 designation as a state sponsor of terrorism dates to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir and has made it difficult for the transitional government in Khartoum to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's office made no mention of any person or any country in a statement on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), which is at the centre of a dispute over Nile water supplies.
But his comment came hours after U.S. President Donald Trump held a phone call with the Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok in which they called for an amicable solution between Ethiopia and Egypt.
In the call, held in front of reporters at the White House, Trump said he had also told Egypt the same thing, saying it was a dangerous situation and that Cairo could end up ""blowing up that dam.""
Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been locked in a bitter dispute over the filling and operation of the GERD, which remains unresolved although the reservoir behind the dam began filling in July.
""Occasional statements of belligerent threats to have Ethiopia succumb to unfair terms still abound,"" Abiy's office said. ""These threats and affronts to Ethiopian sovereignty are misguided, unproductive, and clear violations of international law.""
The first phase of filling the dam completed in August, Abiy's office said.
Egypt says it is dependent on the Nile for more than 90% of its scarce fresh water supplies, and fears the dam could have a devastating effect on its economy.
Trump said on Friday said he had brokered an agreement to resolve the issue but that Ethiopia had broken the pact, forcing him to cut funds.
Abiy's office said there was significant progress made in resolving the dispute since the African Union took over the negotiations.

""Ethiopia will not cave in to aggressions of any kind, nor do we give recognition to a right that is based on colonial treaties,"" it said.

A first round of voting will end on Sunday, with a second round on Nov. 7-8. Run-offs will take place in late November and early December.
The polls are being held under a new electoral law under which 50% of 568 contested seats will be allocated to pre-selected lists, a system critics say benefits Sisi's backers.
The remaining contested seats will be allocated to individual candidates, and Sisi can appoint up to 28 legislators directly.
Mostaqbal Watn (Nation's Future), which in August won nearly three-quarters of the contested seats in an election for Egypt's Senate, an advisory body, is the favourite to come out top. 
Sisi has overseen a sweeping crackdown on political dissent since leading the ouster in 2013 of the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi, who was freely elected in 2012 before mass protests engulfed his rule. 
Both Islamists and liberal opponents have been targeted. 
Supporters say the measures have been necessary to stabilise the country and carry out economic reforms that have won praise from many economists and international financial institutions.
As Sisi has consolidated control, interest in politics has dropped, with electoral turnout gradually declining.

Against the backdrop of the Black Lives Matter movement to protest racial injustice, calls have increased this year for a change to Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which bans any form political protest during the Games.
World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe said earlier this month he believes athletes should have the right to make gestures of political protest during the Games, contrary to official IOC policy.
""The Olympic Games are firstly about sport. The athletes personify the values of excellence, solidarity and peace,"" Bach wrote in The Guardian https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/24/the-olympics-are-about-diversity-and-unity-not-politics-and-profit-boycotts-dont-work-thomas-bach newspaper.
""They express this inclusiveness and mutual respect also by being politically neutral on the field of play and during the ceremonies. At times this focus on sport needs to be reconciled with the freedom of speech all athletes also enjoy at the Games.
""The unifying power of the Games can only unfold if everyone shows respect for and solidarity to one another. Otherwise, the Games will descend into a marketplace of demonstrations of all kinds, dividing and not uniting the world.""
Bach said he experienced the ""political impotence"" of sport when West Germany was among several countries to boycott the 1980 Moscow Games.
""As chair of the West German athletes' commission I strongly opposed this boycott because it punished us for something we had nothing to do with - the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet army,"" Bach, the winner of team fencing gold at Montreal 1976, wrote.
""It's no consolation that we were ultimately proven right that this boycott not only punished the wrong ones, but that it also had no political effect... the Soviet army stayed nine more years in Afghanistan.
""The Olympic Games are not about politics. The IOC, as a civil non-governmental organisation, is strictly politically neutral at all times.""

The COVID-19 pandemic forced the IOC to delay this year's Tokyo Games until 2021.

The letter, published on Saturday by The Australian newspaper, is dated four months after Queen Elizabeth's representative in Australia, John Kerr, took the unprecedented step to dismiss Whitlam without first warning the palace or the prime minister.
""Please don't lose heart,"" the heir to the British throne wrote in the hand-written letter to Kerr on Mar. 27. 
""What you did last year was right and the courageous thing to do — and most Australians seemed to endorse your decision when it came to the point.""
The letter was revealed in an extract of a book ""The Truth of the Palace Letters: Deceit, Ambush and Dismissal in 1975"" by Paul Kelly and Troy Bramston, due to be published next month.
Whitlam's firing remains one of the country's most polarising political events because it represented an unmatched level of intervention by the Commonwealth.
Historians say the country was never told the full story behind Whitlam's removal during a political deadlock over the Budget and in 2016, one historian sued Australia's National Archives for access to letters between Kerr and the Queen. 
In July, the 211 so-called ""palace letters"" were published, pulling the veil from one of the great mysteries of Australian politics, and re-igniting a conversation about whether the country should cut ties with Britain and become a republic.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's President-elect Luis Arce pledged on Friday to ""rebuild"" the Andean country after a tumultuous year of political turmoil and the pandemic, as the official vote count confirmed a landslide win for his socialist party. 
The final tally showed Arce won just over 55% of the vote, sweeping the socialists back into power just a year after the party's leftist leader Evo Morales was ousted amid protests.
The win draws the curtain on a painful period for Bolivia after an election late last year was dogged by disputed allegations of fraud, sparking violent protests, looting, and blockades, and eventually prompting Morales to resign.
""Now our great challenge is to rebuild our homeland in peace, to regain joy, stability and hope for a better tomorrow for all Bolivians,"" Arce said on social media in response to the final result, with a video of his support around the country.
""We won't let down the trust that people have placed in us.""
The count put Arce, a pragmatic economist who is credited with fostering Bolivia's boom years from the mid 2000s, more than 26 points ahead of centrist runner-up Carlos Mesa, who had just shy of 29% - a far larger gap than had been expected.
Arce, who was economy minister under Morales, was seen as a moderating voice in his government. He told Reuters this week Morales would have no role in his administration. 
Morales is living in exile in Argentina, but remains the president of Arce's party, the Movement Toward Socialism, and played a key role in picking Arce as the party's candidate.
With the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic slide, the vote was a body blow for Bolivia's centrist and conservative parties, which played only a bit-part role in Morales' near 14-year administration.
Caretaker President Jeanine Anez, who took over in the midst of a power vacuum last year, withdrew from the race in the election build-up, while Mesa led a muted campaign. Third place runner Luis Camacho was limited to a small conservative base.
Mesa, who also placed second in the since-voided 2019 vote, congratulated Arce on Twitter, though he already conceded defeat at the start of week when rapid counts showed a big Arce win.
""We will remain vigilant in the democratic opposition fulfilling the mandate of the people,"" Mesa said.
Governments and observers have widely heralded the election for being peaceful and transparent - in contrast to the 2019 vote which led to running street battles between party supporters and security forces and the deaths of over 30 people.
Salvador Romero, the head of Bolivia's electoral authority, said in a press conference late on Friday that Bolivia could celebrate ""the closing of the count,"" adding there had been huge voter turn-out despite the pandemic.
""With 88% participation, Bolivians set the second highest record in our history and one of the highest in Latin America in the 21st century,"" he told reporters.

""This affirms how people want to live in peace and with institutions that fulfill their mission, and rejected the ominous predictions of confrontation and violence.""

Only two bodies were ever recovered after the 2006 explosion at the Pasta de Conchos mine in the northern state of Coahuila. Sixty-five men were killed and Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to find the bodies of the other victims.
Initial excavations of the mine will begin by September 2021 after an analysis of the subsoil, said Manuel Bartlett, head of the CFE electricity commission that is leading the effort. 
""We're confident that the beginning of the direct search will be in the first quarter of 2022 and conclude in August 2024,"" Bartlett said at an event attended by widows of the miners.
Lopez Obrador, speaking at the same event, said he would urge the process to go as fast as possible while still staying safe for rescuers, and would provide reparations to the families of the victims. 

Grupo Mexico, which operated the mine, has maintained that the disaster was an unfortunate accident. It transferred the concession for the site to the government early this year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. national security adviser said on Friday the U.S Coast Guard was basing Enhanced Response Cutters in the western Pacific for maritime security missions, citing illegal fishing and harassment of vessels by China.
In a statement, Robert O'Brien also said the Coast Guard planned to evaluate next fiscal year the feasibility of basing Fast Response Cutters in American Samoa in the South Pacific.
The statement described the United States as a Pacific power and added that China's ""illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing, and harassment of vessels operating in the exclusive economic zones of other countries in the Indo-Pacific threatens our sovereignty, as well as the sovereignty of our Pacific neighbors and endangers regional stability.""
It said U.S. efforts, including by the Coast Guard, were ""critical to countering these destabilizing and malign actions.""
""To that end, the USCG is strategically homeporting significantly enhanced Fast Response Cutters ... in the western Pacific,"" the statement said, without detailing where the vessels would be based or how many were involved.
O'Brien said the new-generation Coast Guard vessels would conduct maritime security missions, such as fisheries patrols, and enhance maritime-domain awareness and enforcement efforts in collaboration with ""regional partners who have limited offshore surveillance and enforcement capacity.""
""Enhancing the presence of the USCG in the Indo-Pacific ensures the United States will remain the maritime partner of choice in the region,"" his statement said.
The Coast Guard did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the statement, which came just ahead of a planned visit to Asia by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
Pompeo led a meeting of foreign ministers from India, Japan and Australia this month in Tokyo, a grouping Washington hopes to develop as a bulwark against China's growing assertiveness and extensive maritime claims in the region, including to most of the strategic South China Sea. 
The U.S. Navy regularly angers China by conducting what it calls ""freedom of navigation"" operations close to some of the islands China occupies that are also claimed by other states.

O'Brien's announcement comes less than two weeks ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump's campaign has made a tough approach to China a major foreign policy theme.

“We are encouraged by the U.S. administration’s formal indication to Congress of its intention to remove Sudan from (the list),"" Carol Baker, the IMF's Sudan mission chief, said in a statement to Reuters. ""The removal of Sudan from the (list)eliminates one of the hurdles toward possible HIPC debt relief.”
The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiative was launched in 1996 by the IMF and the World Bank to ensure that no poor country faces a debt burden it cannot manage. But the process is long and will require significant reforms by Sudan.
U.S. President Donald Trump this week announced his decision to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism, paving the way for Friday's announcement that Israel and Sudan would take steps to normalize relations.
Sudan, saddled by $60 billion in external debt, urgently needs financial help to reorganize its economy. Inflation hit 167% in August and the currency has tumbled as the government prints money to subsidize bread, fuel and electricity.
The IMF last month endorsed plans to monitor a 12-month program of economic reforms being implemented by Sudan's new transitional government as it seeks to build international confidence and move toward eventual debt relief.
Sudan's high external debt and longstanding arrears continue to limit its access to external borrowing, including from the IMF, to which it owes $1.3 billion.

BAKU/YEREVAN/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces clashed in several parts of Nagorno-Karabakh on Friday, as the United States stepped up diplomatic efforts to try to end the deadliest fighting in the mountain enclave for over a quarter of a century.
In Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met separately with the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia in a new attempt to end nearly a month of bloodshed that Russian President Vladimir Putin said may have killed 5,000 people.
The collapse of two Russia-brokered ceasefires has dimmed hopes of a quick end to fighting that broke out on Sept. 27 over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway territory of Azerbaijan controlled by ethnic Armenians.
President Donald Trump said ""good progress"" was being made on the issue but did not elaborate and declined to say if he had spoken with the leaders of either country. ""We're working with Armenia. We have a very good relationship with Armenia ... We'll see what happens,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office.
A handful of protesters from both sides, holding Armenian and Azeri flags and banners, chanted outside the State Department on Friday.
Both ministers held separate meetings with Pompeo that lasted around 30 to 40 minutes. The State Department said Pompeo stressed to both sides the importance of entering negotiations.
Asked how his talks went, Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan told reporters ""very good"" as he exited the State Department, and added that work on a ceasefire would continue.
World powers want to prevent a wider war that draws in Turkey, which has voiced strong support for Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defense pact with Armenia.
Shortly before the Washington talks were due to start, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told reporters in Istanbul that he hoped Moscow and Ankara could work together on resolving the conflict.
Reiterating demands for a Turkish role in mediation which has long been led by the United States, Russia and France, Erdogan said: ""Turkey believes it has just as much right as Russia to be involved here for peace."" 
Washington, Paris and Moscow have ignored such calls, and differences over the conflict have further strained relations between Ankara and its NATO allies, with Pompeo accusing Turkey of fueling the conflict by arming the Azeri side. Ankara denies it has enflamed the conflict.
In the latest clashes, Azerbaijan's defense ministry reported fighting in areas including territories close to the line of contact that divides the sides. 
Armenia's defense ministry also reported fighting in several areas and said the town of Martuni in Nagorno-Karabakh was shelled during the night. Azerbaijan denied this.
Azerbaijan has expressed concern about the security of pipelines close to the fighting used to export Azeri oil and gas, though none has been damaged.
'RIGHT PATH FORWARD'
Pompeo said this week he hoped the ""right path forward"" could be found at the talks.
But Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he saw no diplomatic resolution of the conflict at this stage, and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev has described the prospects of a peace settlement as ""very remote"". 
The 15-member U.N. Security Council had been trying to agree on a statement on the conflict, but diplomats said negotiations stalled because some members wanted references to previous U.N. resolutions, while Russia, the United States and France did not.
Such statements have to be agreed by consensus. Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy confirmed the council was no longer working on a text.
About 30,000 people were killed in a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenians regard the enclave as part of their historic homeland; Azeris consider it illegally occupied land that must be returned to their control.

Azeri forces say they have made territorial gains, including full control over the border with Iran, which Armenia denies. Nagorno-Karabakh's ethnic Armenian administration says its forces have repulsed attacks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israel and Sudan agreed on Friday to take steps to normalize relations in a deal brokered with the help of the United States, making Khartoum the third Arab government to set aside hostilities with Israel in the last two months.
U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, sealed the agreement in a phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok and Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, senior U.S. officials said.
Trump's decision this week to remove Sudan from the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism paved the way for the accord with Israel, marking a foreign policy achievement for the Republican president as he seeks a second term trailing in opinion polls behind Democratic rival Joe Biden.
Netanyahu hailed it as a ""new era"" for the region, but the Palestinian leadership, watching as more of their Arab brethren appear to give their quest for statehood a lower priority, called it a ""new stab in the back.""
""The leaders agreed to the normalization of relations between Sudan and Israel and to end the state of belligerence between their nations,"" according to a joint statement issued by the three countries that also promised U.S. help for Khartoum to secure international debt relief.
Israel and Sudan plan to begin by opening economic and trade links, with an initial focus on agriculture, the joint statement said. A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said such issues as formal establishment of diplomatic ties would be resolved later.
Trump touted the deal to reporters in the Oval Office with the Israeli and Sudanese leaders on the line in a three-way phone call, saying at least five other countries wanted to follow suit and normalize relations with Israel.
""Do you think 'Sleepy Joe' could have made this deal?"" Trump asked Netanyahu, using the president's pejorative nickname for Biden a day after their final, rancorous debate of the 2020 presidential campaign. ""Somehow I don't think so.""
Netanyahu, reliant on bipartisan support for Israel in Washington, responded haltingly: """"Well, Mr. President, one thing I can tell you, is, um, uh, we appreciate the help for peace from anyone in America.""
Trump's aides view his pro-Israel policies as appealing to Christian evangelical voters, who are among his biggest supporters.
In recent weeks the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain became the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to agree to formal links with Israel, forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
Trump insisted the Palestinians also ""are wanting to do something"" but offered no proof. Palestinian leaders have condemned recent Arab overtures to Israel as a betrayal of their nationalist cause and have refused to engage with the Trump administration, seeing it as biased in favor of Israel.
""No one has the right to speak in the name of the Palestinian people and in the name of the Palestinian cause,"" Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in a statement.
DROPPING SUDAN FROM TERRORISM LIST
Trump announced on Monday he would take Sudan off the terrorism list once it had deposited $335 million it had pledged to pay in compensation. Khartoum has since placed the funds in a special escrow account for victims of al Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998. 
The White House called Trump's intention to remove Sudan from the terrorism list a ""pivotal turning point"" for Khartoum, which is seeking to emerge from decades of isolation.
The military and civilian leaders of Sudan's transitional government have been divided over how fast and how far to go in establishing ties with Israel. A sticking point in the negotiations was Sudan's insistence that any announcement of Khartoum's delisting from the terrorism designation not be explicitly linked to relations with Israel.
The Sudanese premier wants approval from a yet-to-be formed parliament to proceed with broader, formal normalization, and that may not be a quick process given sensitivities and civilian-military differences. It is still unclear when the assembly will be created.
""Agreement on normalization with Israel will be decided after completion of the constitutional institutions through the formation of the legislative council,” Sudanese Foreign Minister Omar Gamareldin said on state television shortly after Friday's announcement.
The new agreement was negotiated on the U.S. side by a team that included Trump son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, who called the normalization deals the start of a ""paradigm shift"" in the Middle East. 
He said Sudan's decision was symbolically significant because it was in Khartoum in 1967 that the Arab League decided not to recognize Israel's right to exist.
Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism dates to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir and has made it difficult for its transitional government to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing.
Many in Sudan say the designation, imposed in 1993 because Washington believed Bashir was supporting militant groups, has become outdated since he was removed last year.

U.S. congressional legislation is needed to shield Khartoum from future legal claims over past attacks to ensure the flow of payments to the embassy bombing victims and their families.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - The badly decomposed bodies of seven people who may have been stowaways were found on Friday inside a shipment of fertilizer that left Serbia three months ago, Paraguayan authorities said.
The container left Serbia on July 21 and arrived earlier this week via Argentina at a river port on the outskirts of the Paraguayan capital Asuncion, prosecutor Marcelo Saldivar said.
The bodies were discovered on Friday when the managers of the company that bought the product opened it, he added. 
Saldivar said the victims, who were all adults, appeared to have been stowaways. Two had identity documents indicating they were Moroccan, and a receipt for a Serbian taxi company was also found, suggesting they entered the container in Serbia. 
""We assume that they arrived there from their country of origin and had planned to travel to a nearer destination but they did not calculate the distance well and did not survive the trip,"" he told Reuters.
""The supplies they had - cookies, bottled water and tinned food - were enough to last 72 hours."" 
Police also found bags of clothing and an opening for ventilation in the area of the container where the bodies were found. ""All the bodies are decomposed. They are just hair and bones,"" he added.

The shipment's route would be checked, he said, along with cell phones found with the bodies, and the authorities in Morocco and Serbia would be contacted to try to determine the victims` identities.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A sigh of relief would go around the world if Democratic challenger Joe Biden wins the U.S. presidency but Berlin would still face many of the same policy problems with Washington, Germany's coordinator for transatlantic ties said on Friday.
Peter Beyer, a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats, said Biden would offer a more collaborative tone than U.S. President Donald Trump who has called Germany's trade and spending policies ""very bad"".
Trump trails Biden in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 vote.
""A big sigh of relief would go around the planet if Joe Biden wins,"" Beyer told Reuters. 
""Would it help? I don't think so because (from) what we've heard from Joe Biden ... we will see that many of the existing transatlantic topics will remain, such as Nord Stream 2, energy security, economic issues,"" he added.
Trump has attacked Berlin for supporting the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline spanning the Baltic Sea, accusing Germany of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to reliance on its energy.
""We would be well advised to expect a president Joe Biden to be much more collaborative, he would be much friendlier in tone, but many of the issues will remain on the table, some would be much easier to address, others would be tough,"" Beyer said.
""One of his top priorities would be healing the wounds of his own country. There's a lot to do.""
Trump has also accused Germany of taking advantage of the United States while not meeting financial obligations to NATO, the military organization he once called obsolete to the chagrin of shocked allies.
Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said Germany was looking forward to more clarity in U.S. foreign policy.
""We are not in favour of a disruptive political style,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer, another close ally of Merkel, said on Friday according to a pre-distributed text of her speech.

The U.S. military in July unveiled plans to withdraw about 12,000 troops from Germany.

Trump, who held the call in front of reporters at the White House, said he had also told Egypt the same thing, saying it was a dangerous situation and that Cairo could end up ""blowing up that dam.""
Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt have been at odds over the filling and operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), and Trump on Friday said he had brokered an agreement to resolve the issue but that Ethiopia had broken the pact, forcing him to cut funds.

JERUSALEM/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Israel said on Friday it will not oppose U.S. sales of ""specific weapons systems"" to the United Arab Emirates, in an apparent reference to the F-35 warplanes sought by Abu Dhabi. 
Under a principle of preserving Israel's ""qualitative military edge"", the United States consults with it on proposed sales of advanced arms to other countries in the region. 
Israel has reiterated a need to maintain its military superiority even since forging official ties with the UAE and its fellow Gulf Arab state Bahrain under deals brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump last month.
Washington agreed to consider allowing the UAE to buy F-35 stealth jets in a side deal to a normalisation agreement between Israel and the UAE. 
Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz reached agreements in Washington this week with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a joint statement, said would significantly upgrade Israel's military capabilities. 
""Since the U.S. is upgrading Israel’s military capability and is maintaining Israel's qualitative military edge, Israel will not oppose the sale of these systems to the UAE,"" they said. 
The statement from Israel - which uses the F-35 - did not mention the jet explicitly. 
Asked about potential F-35 sales to the UAE, Trump said the ""process is moving along"". 
""We've never had a dispute with UAE; they've always been on our side. And that process is moving along -- I think hopefully rapidly,"" Trump said. He was speaking in the White House Oval Office after announcing that Sudan would be the next country in the region to forge ties with Israel.
The removal of Israeli opposition clears one important hurdle to U.S. congressional approval of F-35 sales to the UAE.U.S. lawmakers have tried to rein in the Trump administration's plans for arms sales to the UAE and Saudi Arabia over concerns over their involvement in the war in Yemen.
Israel enjoys broad support in Congress and if it opposed the deals it would be nearly impossible for them to advance. 
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees, whose members have criticised the UAE's role in civilian deaths in Yemen, have the right to review and block weapons sales. 

Past measures to block arms sales passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support, but failed to get enough Republican backing to override Trump's vetoes.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Scholars excluded from Japan's top science advisory panel said the move was unconstitutional and a dangerous sign of how newly installed Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will wield power.
Suga broke precedent in rejecting membership to six scholars to the Science Council of Japan (SCJ), a body set up after World War Two to provide independent scientific input for policy-making.
The spurned academics had previously criticised government policy, including 2015 laws to allow Japanese troops to fight overseas.
Among the six were legal and constitutional scholars who said Suga's move was illegal and could prompt both parliamentary and criminal inquiries.
One of them, Ritsumeikan University law professor Takaaki Matsumiya told reporters on Friday that Suga was acting ""similar to a dictator.""
""He is reinterpreting Article 15 of the constitution in a way that he will be able to appoint or dismiss all public servants just as he likes,"" Matsumiya said. ""This is a very dangerous direction that he is moving in.""
Suga has said his decision had nothing to do with the scholars' positions on government-backed legislation, defending the decision as appropriate without disclosing reasons for their exclusion. Typically the SCJ's recommendations for membership have been approved by the serving prime minister.
Polls have shown that nearly half of respondents said they didn't find Suga's explanation convincing, helping to erode his support rating by seven points to 55% in the second survey since he took office last month following Shinzo Abe's resignation for health reasons.

Members of Suga's ruling Liberal Democratic Party met with former presidents of the SCJ on Thursday and voiced doubts about how the group recommends members and whether it should remain a state-affiliated body, the Jiji news agency reported on Thursday.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin met the king on Friday to ask him to declare a state of emergency, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said - a move that opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim denounced as an attempt to cling to power.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, did not give the reason for the request. 
The proposed emergency would include the suspension of parliament, which is due to reconvene in November, but spare the public additional restrictions beyond the coronavirus curbs currently in place, one of the sources said. The sources did not disclose the full range of measures that Muhyiddin would seek to implement. 
Muhyiddin, who came to power in March with only a two-seat majority, has been under pressure since Anwar's declaration last month that he had enough votes in parliament to oust the premier. A resurgence in coronavirus cases has also added to Muhyiddin's troubles. 
The government is scheduled to propose its 2021 budget on Nov. 6, and there have been questions over whether it can muster a majority in parliament for that. 
Defeat on the budget would count as a vote of no-confidence in Muhyiddin and could trigger an election. Emergency rule might mean the budget would not be put to a vote at that time.
""COVID CRISIS AN EXCUSE""
Responding to reports of Muhyiddin's move, Anwar said: ""We have a government which lacks legitimacy and which knows it would fail to demonstrate majority support in parliament, and is using the COVID-19 crisis as an excuse to justify its abuse of power.""
Under the constitution, the king can declare a state of emergency if he is satisfied there is a threat to national security, the economy or public order. Malaysia last declared a national emergency in 1969, after civil unrest and race riots. 
The executive would gain powers to make rules and approve the expenditure necessary to ensure public security. 
The state news agency Bernama said Muhyiddin had met with King Al-Sultan Abdullah on Friday afternoon.
Sivamurugan Pandian, a political analyst from Malaysian Science University, said the king could choose to consult with other royal houses before making a decision on the emergency.
The Council of Rulers, which groups the heads of Malaysia's nine royal houses, has the power to withhold consent from any law and deliberate on questions of national policy.

Muhyiddin's office and the palace did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the meeting. The prime minister's office said there would be no announcement on Friday.

KIGALI (Reuters) - A Rwandan court extended the detention of ""Hotel Rwanda"" hero Paul Rusesabagina on Friday pending trial on terrorism charges and denied him bail, the judge hearing the case said.
Rusesabagina, a political dissident who has lived in exile in Belgium and the United States, was arrested in August after returning to the country and subsequently charged with terrorism and other offences. 
""The fact that he is sick is not alone a ground to release him on bail,"" Theodosie Mukarugira said in a ruling via Skype.
She said the detention would be extended by 30 days starting from Friday so that the prosecution can do more investigations.
At his first court appearance in September, Rusesabagina declined to take a plea on all 13 charges facing him, saying he wanted to plead on a charge by charge basis.
In the past hearings, he admitted sponsoring FLN, a rebel group that wanted to oust Kagame, but denied any wrongdoing.
Early this month, Rwanda's top prosecutor said he would seek to merge the case of Paul Rusesabagina, with that of former rebels in state custody.

In a statement, the Financial Action Task Force urged Pakistan to complete an internationally agreed action plan by February 2021.
Last February, Pakistan secured an extra four months to complete the plan after missing 13 of the 27 targets that FATF had set for it in 2018 when it put Pakistan on its ""grey list"". The grace period was then extended again due to the new coronavirus pandemic.
The ""grey list"" comprises countries whose controls over terrorism financing are deemed inadequate.

Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said on Twitter that
ambassador Matthew Tueller ""has had a central role in coordinating terrorist acts in Iraq & beyond"" including the assassination of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, killed by a U.S. missile strike at Baghdad in January.
Iraq is one of the few countries that is allied to both the United States and Iran, which both provided military support in a 2014-2017 campaign against Islamic State. Iraqis worry that the two countries could use Iraqi territory for a proxy war.
Tehran's move, which allows the seizure of assets within Iran of sanctioned individuals, is symbolic and unlikely to have any impact on the U.S. diplomats. 

On Thursday, the United States blacklisted Iraj Masjedi, Iran's ambassador to Iraq, saying he has for years overseen the training and support of Iraqi militia groups responsible for attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq.

DAKAR (Reuters) - Malian troops have regained control of a village in the centre of the country where more than 2,000 residents have been besieged by Islamist militants for two weeks, the military said in a statement on Thursday. 
The air force dropped special forces troops into the village on Thursday, the military said. It said the operation was directed by Assimi Goïta, a special forces colonel who led a junta that overthrew the government two months ago and now holds the post of vice president.
The operation broke a siege of the village of Farabougou that began when militants kidnapped several residents, most of whom are of the farming Bambara ethnic group. Malian troops had been unable to reach the village by land because heavy rains made the roads impassable.
The air force had evacuated wounded civilians to Ségou, a nearby town, the military said in an update on Friday.
""(The army) are inside and control the village,"" said Dramane Symbara, mayor of Sokolo, a nearby town. ""But the access roads to Farabougou are still blocked, the jihadists are still around, in the forests or hidden on either side of the roads.""
Central Mali has emerged over the past few years as the epicentre of Islamist and inter-ethnic violence in the country, part of a wider deterioration of security across West Africa's semi-arid Sahel region.
The insecurity was one of the driving factors that led Goïta's junta to depose then-President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita on Aug. 18.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Gunfire rang out across Guinea's capital Conakry on Friday and security forces dispersed protestors after results showed President Alpha Conde winning re-election in a poll that the opposition says was unconstitutional. 
Conde won around twice as many votes as his nearest rival, opposition candidate Cellou Dalein Diallo, with 37 of 38 districts counted, preliminary results from the election commission showed on Thursday night.
The president's decision to run for a third term has sparked repeated protests over the past year, resulting in dozens of deaths, including at least 17 in skirmishes since Sunday's vote. 
Conde says a constitutional referendum in March reset his two-term limit, but his opponents say he is breaking the law by holding onto power. Diallo's camp said it has found evidence of fraud and will contest the result in the constitutional court. 
Gunfire was heard Friday in the Sonfonia neighborhood of Conakry, where Diallo supporters clashed with security forces, witnesses said. 
""There were warning shots. The police intervened to clear the barricades and disperse the demonstrators,"" Oumar Camara, a local resident, told Reuters.
Friday's violence follows a series of clashes on Thursday in which four were killed, security minister Damantang Albert Camara told Reuters. 
Internet and phone access were severely disrupted on Friday morning, digital rights groups and witnesses said. Authorities in Guinea, as in much of sub-Saharan Africa, have in the past cut internet access to sever communications during times of unrest. 
The government was not available to comment on internet access on Friday, but network data for Internet monitoring group NetBlocks showed that the internet was disrupted from 0730 GMT on Friday morning, including on leading cellular operator Orange. 
""The incident has nation-scale impact ... and is likely to significantly limit the domestic and international flow of information,"" NetBlocks said in a statement.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - About 300 militants from Mozambique attacked a village in southern Tanzania and killed an unknown number of people last week, Tanzania's top police officer said, describing an attack claimed earlier by the Islamic State.
Inspector General of Police Simon Sirro said militants attacked the village of Kitaya in Tanzania's rural Mtwara region bordering Mozambique. 
""Terrorists numbering 300, coming from Mozambique, attacked our station and the village of Kitaya, and committed crimes and they killed,"" Sirro said in an interview with Azam TV, a private Tanzanian chain, broadcast late Thursday.
He did not specify the number of people killed, nor give a date for the attack. 
He said police had arrested and were interrogating some of the militants while others were believed to have returned to Mozambique.
It was the first time authorities in Tanzania have acknowledged that an escalating Islamist insurgency in northern Mozambique with links to Islamic State is also active in Tanzania.
IS claimed the attack in a message on one of its Telegram channels on Oct. 15, which said its fighters had attacked an army barracks in the village a day earlier, killing a number of personnel and capturing weapons and ammunition.
Attacks in Tanzania have been far more sporadic and less deadly than those in Mozambique, where the militants have killed hundreds of people since their first attack in 2017. 
Analysts say the group has transformed since then into a formidable force that can seize and hold significant locations. 
The group pledged allegiance to IS in 2019 and Islamic State has claimed a spate of recent attacks in the impoverished Cabo Delgado province, boasting one of the biggest gas finds in a decade just off its coast. 
Multinational companies including  Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Total are developing the gas in projects worth some $60 billion.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - One of the most prominent leaders of more than three months of anti-government protests in Thailand was freed on bail on Friday and pledged to keep up the campaign to remove Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
Jatupat ""Pai"" Boonpattararaksa was arrested on Oct. 13, when a few hundred protesters scuffled with police a day before a major demonstration that also called for reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
""We will continue to drive out Prayuth in any way we can... I want the people to come out to join us in changing the country,"" Jatupat told Reuters after his release on bail. He faces multiple charges related to the protests.
His time in jail ""has just changed my hairstyle but not our spirit and our demands"", Jatupat said, referring to the regulation buzz cut he was given in detention.
Dozens of protesters have been arrested and several of the best-known leaders remain in detention.
Protesters have given Prayuth until Sunday to quit or face further action. They say Prayuth, a former military leader, engineered last year's election to hold onto power he first took in a 2014 coup. He says the election was fair.
A ban on protests on Oct. 15 backfired when it drew tens of thousands of people onto the streets in anger. The emergency decree was lifted on Thursday. Prayuth said he hoped it would ""de-escalate"" the situation.
The protests since July have been the biggest challenge to Thailand's establishment in years and have also prompted unprecedented criticism of the monarchy - outraging Thai royalists.
Hundreds of Thai royalists wearing shirts in yellow - the king's colour - waited outside the Grand Palace to receive him on a holiday marking the anniversary of the 1910 death of King Chulalongkorn, known as Rama V, who earned a reputation as a moderniser.

In a statement, government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said people were invited to join a Buddhist chanting ceremony on Saturday for the well-being of the country. More than 90 percent of Thais are Buddhists.

Sheikh Mohammed Adnan Afiouni, the Sunni Muslim Mufti of Damascus who was close to President Bashar al-Assad, died on Thursday when his car was targeted with an explosive device in the countryside near Damascus.
Afiouni played a large part in what the government describes as reconciliation efforts with armed groups who seized control of several Damascus suburbs during the country's nine-year-long civil war, but who were then driven back by government forces.
He was a leading conservative scholar who preached against Sunni radicalism and the Muslim Brotherhood, which took up arms against the current president's father, Hafez al-Assad. 
""He helped to consolidate (the Assad family) grip on power during the fight against the Muslim Brotherhood and later the Salafi trends,"" said Waeil Olwan, a political scientist and scholar in the Istanbul-based al Jusoor think tank that focuses on Syrian studies. 
The 66-year-old cleric described the Syrian uprising as one of ""destruction, chaos and terrorism,"" Alwan added. 
Syria's Minister of Endowments Mohammed Abdul Sattar al-Sayed was among hundreds of worshippers who gathered at the Syrian capital's ancient Ummayad Mosque for Afiouni's funeral. 
Pictures from the funeral showed the masked minister paying condolences to Sheikh Afiouni's son, alongside the son of another slain cleric Mohammed al-Buti, the government-appointed imam of the Ummayad mosque who died in a 2013 bombing.
Afiouni headed the Cham Islamic Centre to fight Terrorism and Extremism that trains hundreds of clerics and mosque imams before their employment by the state. 
He also led prayers which Assad attended in the town of Daraya after it was recaptured in 2016 from rebels after bombardment that killed hundreds and displaced thousands.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - More than seven decades ago, their families were divided by war and hatred - Koenraad Tinel, the son of a Nazi sympathiser, and Simon Gronowski, a Holocaust survivor who lost his mother and sister to Auschwitz.
Now the two men, both in their 80s, have forged a close friendship that has become a symbol of reconciliation in their native Belgium.
""Koen and I were two children crushed by a war we did not understand,"" Gronowski, a lawyer and jazz pianist, told Reuters.
""Each of us was on his side of the fence - me on the side of the victims, and he on the side of the executioners.""
Gronowski, 89, and Tinel, 86, met after they both published memoirs of their wartime experiences. They were introduced to each other by the Union des Progressistes Juifs de Belgique in 2012.
""They ask me: 'Would you agree to meet the son of a Nazi?'. Yes I agree. Weird, but I agree,"" Gronowski said. ""Little by little, we met and got to know each other better.""
Last month, the twin Free Universities of Brussels - the Dutch-speaking VUB and the French-speaking ULB - gave both men honorary doctorates to recognise the significance of their bond.
""Their unique friendship is a power symbol of hope, happiness and peace,"" the universities said a statement.
Gronowski, from Brussels, was 11 when the Nazis rounded him up with his mother and other Belgian Jews in a train wagon. ""Miraculously, I jumped off the train and escaped,"" he said.
Around the same time, Tinel was a living in Ghent. His brothers were Nazi soldiers and his artist father was sculpting busts of Adolf Hitler and SS officers.
""I can't be racist. I cannot be a Flemish nationalist. I cannot be a Belgian nationalist. I am a man of the world,"" he told Reuters.
Tinel, himself a sculptor, is holding an exhibition in Brussels up until Nov. 1. His works, inspired by the military parades of his youth, explore the theme of how fear drives people to commit atrocities.
""Koenraad is more than a friend, he's my brother,"" said Gronowski, sitting alongside Tinel in the Tour & Taxis exhibition hall.

""We do not bring you a message of sorrow but a message of hope and happiness. I tell everyone: life is beautiful, but it's a daily struggle.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's description of India as a filthy place with polluted air has unleashed calls on social media for urgent clean-up action, particularly over New Delhi, the world's most polluted capital.
Defending the clean air in the United States, Trump made the comment during his final debate on Thursday with Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election, saying ""Look at India. It's filthy. The air is filthy.""
On Friday, air pollution in New Delhi and surrounding cities was at its worst in eight months, with the air quality index surging above 300 on a scale of 500, indicating ""emergency conditions"".
Trump referred to India to defend his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, said one environmental expert.
""Trump's commentary on India's air in the backdrop of his justification from withdrawing from the Paris pact is unfortunate and juvenile,"" said Vimlendu Jha, the founder of an activist group, Swechha. 
""America is historically the largest emitter in the world and currently the second largest one,"" he added.
Trump was correct, said Kapil Mishra, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
""Trump is right,"" Mishra said on Twitter. ""Our air quality is actually filthy. In Delhi, we are breathing poison. Time for all of us to come together and deal with the real reasons.""
Modi's Hindu nationalist party is not in power in New Delhi, which is ruled by the liberal Aam Aadmi (Common Man) Party, officials of which have often sparred with BJP functionaries over blame for the poor quality of air in New Delhi.
In a 2017 interview with Reuters, Trump complained that China, India, Russia and other countries were paying too little to help poorer countries battle climate change under the Paris accord's Green Climate Fund.

""It’s not a fair situation because they are paying virtually nothing and we are paying massive amounts of money,"" he said at the time.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Gangs armed with knives and sticks blocked major roads in Lagos on Friday, with many angered by an appeal by Nigeria's president for an end to demonstrations against police brutality that turned violent when protesters were shot. 
A highway leading to the international airport was obstructed by blockades manned by groups of young men demanding cash from motorists. Buses whose drivers refused to pay were destroyed, a Reuters witness said.
To the east of the city, in the Ibeju area of Lekki, armed men chased away police and several police stations were burned to the ground. 
Violence in Africa's biggest city has escalated since Tuesday night, when a curfew was announced.
The unrest is the worst street violence since Nigeria's return to civilian rule in 1999 and is the most serious political crisis confronting President Muhammadu Buhari, a former military leader who came to power at the ballot box in 2015 and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
Amnesty International said soldiers and police killed at least 12 protesters in Lekki and Alausa, another Lagos district on Tuesday. On Thursday, Amnesty, Human Rights Watch and 40 other groups called for an ""immediate and thorough investigation"" into the incident.
The army has denied soldiers were at the site of the Lekki shooting, where people had gathered in defiance of the curfew.
Buhari, in a national address late on Thursday, urged youths to ""discontinue the street protests and constructively engage government in finding solutions"".
It was his first public address since the shootings began. Although he lamented the loss of innocent lives, he did not directly refer to the Lekki incident that sparked international condemnation. 
Many of those on the streets said Buhari's speech had angered them because of his failure to address the Lekki incident. 
Lagos authorities have struggled to enforce a round-the-clock curfew imposed as anger over the killings rose. One man on the road said military rule was better than what the country has now. 
Reuters witnesses saw two military vans pass the airport but they ignored the armed men who were stopping, and in some cases attacking, cars and buses.
Gunshots were audible in Ikoyi, an affluent island neighbourhood, a resident told Reuters. Occupants of an apartment block were told to avoid windows and balconies.
Rights group the Feminist Coalition, which had been crowdfunding to support the protesters and pay the medical and legal fees of those injured or arrested, said on Thursday that it would stop taking donations.
""Our priority is always the welfare and safety of the Nigerian youth,"" it said in a statement.

""Following the President's address, we hereby encourage all young Nigerians to stay safe, stay home, and observe the mandated curfew in your state.""

Xi did not directly refer to the present-day United States, with which relations have sunk to their lowest in decades over disputes ranging from trade and technology to human rights and the coronavirus. Taiwan has a become a growing point of contention and military tension.
""Let the world know that 'the people of China are now organised, and are not to be trifled with',"" Xi said at the Great Hall of the People, quoting Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China. 
Unilateralism, protectionism, and bullying would fail, Xi said on the anniversary of the deployment of Chinese troops to the Korean peninsula to help North Korea fight U.S.-led United Nations and South Korean forces during the 1950-53 conflict. 
Xi repeated his call to expedite the modernisation of the country's defence and armed forces. ""Without a strong army, there can be no strong motherland,"" he said.
Tensions have risen sharply in recent months over Taiwan, with Washington stepping up sales of military hardware to the democratically-ruled island and sending high-level officials to visit. This week, Washington approved the sale of weapons systems worth up to $1.8 billion, angering China.
China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province, has been applying increasing pressure to accept Beijing’s sovereignty, including flying fighter jets across the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, an unofficial buffer. 
North Korea went to war in 1950 with the South, which was backed by United Nations forces comprising mainly U.S. troops. In October 1950, Chinese troops crossed the Yalu River on the border with North Korea while the Soviets provided air cover. 
Over 2 million Chinese troops were deployed. 
""After arduous battles, Chinese and Korean troops, armed to their teeth, defeated their opponents, shattering the myth of the invincibility of the U.S. military, and forcing the invaders to sign the armistice agreement on July 27, 1953,"" Xi said.

PARIS (Reuters) - The coronavirus is spreading through France faster than at the peak of the first wave in spring, a government scientific advisor said on Friday, in one of the starkest alerts yet about the scale of the resurgence engulfing Europe.
France reported 41,622 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday, a new daily record, and will break through the 1,000,000 cumulative tally on Friday - a grim milestone for the government as it and other European capitals battle to keep their economies open.
The warning from epidemiologist Arnaud Fontanet came as the country's finance minister said the economy was likely to shrink again in the fourth quarter as a result of the nightly curfews and other restrictions imposed to tame the virus.
""The virus is circulating more quickly than in the spring,"" Fontanet, who sits on the Scientific Council advising the government on its COVID response, told BFM TV.
France's three-month-long lockdown had brought the virus under control, Fontanet said, but with it came a false sense of security during the summer. By late July, the caseload was trending higher again, though it was a cold snap that altered the disease's trajectory, he added.
""There was one cold week in September and all the indicators went the wrong way again all over Europe. The virus spreads better in the cold because we live more inside,"" he said.
France's healthcare system is again buckling under the pressure even though doctors say the average COVID patient's stay in ICU is twice as short as during the spring peak as medics learn how to better tackle the disease.
COVID patients occupy nearly half of all the country's 5,000 ICU beds.
""It is possible the second wave will be worse than the first,"" Martin Hirsch, head of public hospitals in Paris, warned on RTL radio. ""No one can say when the peak will come.""
""HOPE TO SEE YOU SOON""
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire's warning of a strong risk of contraction in the French economy, the euro zone's second biggest, in the fourth quarter underscored concerns a double-dip recession may loom ahead for the single currency bloc.
French business activity contracted more sharply than expected in October, IHS Markit data showed, with firms unlikely to commit to large-scale projects.
""With the European winter fast approaching, the prospect of a sharp drop in new positive cases and a full reopening of the economy seems unlikely,"" IHS Markit economist Eliot Kerr.
France will extend a curfew to 38 more administrative departments from midnight on Friday. In all, two thirds of the country's 67 million population will be confined indoors each night from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. until early December.
Le Maire said the curfews would cost the government 2 billion euros ($2.37 billion) in financial aid for companies.
The curfew is hurting the hospitality sector particularly hard. Many restaurateurs are shutting their doors rather than limp on with a reduced service.
""We hope to see you soon,"" Michelin-starred chef Michel Sarran wrote on a notice declaring his restaurant's indefinite closure.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chileans will go to the polls on Sunday to vote on whether they want to swap a constitution written during the Pinochet dictatorship in favor of a new document written by a specially elected citizens' body. 
A new constitution was a key demand of demonstrators engaged in unprecedented social protests that broke out in October last year over inequality and elitism. A cross-party referendum deal emerged from the protests in December. 
Those opposed to a new constitution argue it represents a ""leap into the void"" to change a document that has helped make Chile one of the region's most stable free market economies.
Those in favor say the current text privileges private interests, and segments access to health, education and pensions by income. 
Alejandro Werner, IMF Western Hemisphere director, said on Thursday the process could herald ""a new era in which the main elements that generated the Chilean success story... are maintained in terms of economic growth, but complemented by a social inclusion agenda.""
A downside risk, he added, was ""a multiplicity of social policies without macroeconomic support.""
Polls suggest the campaign to approve a new magna carta will win two thirds of the vote.
Cristobal Bellolio, a political commentator who favors a new text, said it would ensure the ""nation's fingerprints,"" rather than those of a small elite, were on its rulebook. 
The concern, he added, was that some might expect a new draft to turn Chile into a benevolent welfare state overnight. 
""I get the feeling there are many people thinking of the constitution as a government program,"" he said. 
Chileans famously voted to end the 17-year dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in a 1988 plebiscite. 
The current constitution was drafted by Pinochet's close adviser Jaime Guzman in 1980 and has only been tweaked by successive governments to reduce military and executive power. 
Among those to reform it was liberal former President Ricardo Lagos. He told Reuters last week that Guzman made his draft deliberately watertight, meaning aspects like a flawed pension system and ban on collective bargaining were impossible to change. nL1N2H70RU
Voters will approve or reject the drafting of a new constitution. Uniquely in Chilean history, they will also be asked if a fresh text - to be voted on in a second referendum - should be drafted by a constitutional convention of specially elected citizens or a mixed convention of lawmakers and citizens.
A recent spike in violent protests and nervousness about large public gatherings amid the coronavirus could dampen turnout. All Chileans are automatically registered to vote, but participation is voluntary.
Stringent security and sanitary measures have been rolled out in 2,715 polling stations across the nation of 18 million.
Surfaces have been sprayed with cleaning products containing nano-copper particles, a use of Chile's key export enthusiastically championed by the government after research suggested it was particularly inhospitable to the coronavirus. 
Soldiers will oversee voting while police will guard outside in case of further unrest. 

Mariano Machado, a Latin America analyst with risk analytics company Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft, said a result calling for a new constitution drafted by a constitutional convention would help ""contain"" but not eradicate Chile's underlying social unrest.

115,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 07:11AM ET</span>",Special Report: Why the Pennsylvania vote count might throw U.S. into political crisis,"By Jarrett Renshaw, Simon Lewis and Brad Heath
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Here in the birthplace of American democracy, election officials are scrambling to prepare for a presidential vote they fear could plunge the nation into a historic political crisis.
Philadelphia’s Board of Elections plans to move its counting operations to a 125,000-square foot space in the city’s convention center. Dozens of staffers, feeding expensive new machines to open envelopes and process mail-in ballots, will spend days tallying hundreds of thousands of votes - under intense scrutiny from partisan observers. The workers likely will discard thousands of ballots that are not properly completed or do not arrive in a special “secrecy envelope.” Outside, police officers redeployed from their neighborhood districts will conduct round-the-clock patrols to guard against violence among protesters, a police source told Reuters.
President Donald Trump last month called on supporters to monitor the city’s election apparatus because “bad things happen in Philadelphia” - one of his many unsubstantiated claims that Democrats are engineering a massive voter fraud.
Such comments prompted Philadelphia’s District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, to study the laws governing militias, in case gun-toting extremists show up at the polls to intimidate voters. If that happens, Krasner warned: “We’ve got a jail cell for you.”
In Pennsylvania and across America, retailers are reinforcing glass, hiring guards or retaining on-call teams that barricade and board up buildings. Citizens of all political stripes are snapping up guns and ammunition in record numbers. 
These preparations underscore the fragile state of the election system in a nation long known as the global standard-bearer for democracy.
Trump is the first U.S. president to make attacking the integrity of the nation’s elections a central campaign theme. Those attacks - along with sudden shifts in state voting rules to deal with the coronavirus pandemic - have ignited a partisan ground war in swing states over the election process. The fight pits Republican allegations of fraud - accompanied by a Republican effort to toss out votes - against Democratic counter-charges of voter suppression, coupled with a Democratic effort to ensure votes are counted. (For a graphic on all states mail-in ballot rules, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3dEUqhY) 
The conflicts are compounding the difficulty of conducting an election during a pandemic that has killed more than 220,000 Americans. The strains are acute in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, whose 20 Electoral College votes are key to victory for both Trump and his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joe Biden. (For a graphic explaining the U.S. Electoral College system, click https://tmsnrt.rs/3lUKcgv https://tmsnrt.rs/3lUKcgv).)
“It’s clear that the bullseye is scoping in on Philadelphia as the epicenter of the 2020 general election,” said Al Schmidt, a Republican election commissioner in the city. ""We have to be prepared.""
If neither candidate by election night secures the majority of the 538 Electoral College votes needed to win, the presidency could hinge on delayed results from Pennsylvania - a state Trump won in 2016 by less than 1% of the vote - or other battleground states that could take days to count mail ballots. (For a graphic on vote-counting processes, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2FRDxnT )
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh did not respond to detailed questions on the campaign’s plans for election-monitoring or handling disputed results. Two senior Trump campaign officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the campaign plans to field thousands of volunteers across Pennsylvania between now and Election Day on Nov. 3 to monitor ballot drop boxes, precincts and mobile voting centers. The unprecedented effort, they said, is necessitated by the sudden popularity of the new mail-in voting system and its potential to enable fraud.
The Biden campaign says it will deploy the party’s biggest-ever “voter protection” team to counter the Republican effort. This includes having voter-protection directors in 28 states, thousands of volunteers and 15 ""voter hotlines"" in key states.
Dana Remus, the Biden campaign’s general counsel, said it will field enough observers nationwide “to ensure that the work that we think needs to be done is done, and to make sure voters feel comfortable and protected.” 
All the fighting over voting and counting rules could end on Election Day if one candidate wins in a national landslide, which would make fighting over the precise results or fraud allegations in individual states irrelevant to the outcome. A clear victory is a possibility for Biden, who has led national polls for months, but state polls show a close contest in many of the battleground states that will decide the election.
An unclear or disputed tally in Pennsylvania or other battleground states, election experts say, could trigger chaotic scenarios in which the result is determined by some combination of state courts, the U.S. Supreme Court, Congress, and state legislatures or governors.
The Supreme Court, for instance, could be asked to step in to stop a state recount - as it did in Florida, causing Democrat Al Gore to concede the 2000 election to Republican George W. Bush. The high court could also weigh in on state lawsuits over voting policies.
It is Congress, however, that renders the final verdict of the presidential election under the U.S. Constitution. That has almost always been a formality - with members of the House of Representatives and the Senate meeting in a joint session to sign off on electors’ votes that reflect popular vote tallies in each state. But the scenarios for how Congress might decide a contested election are fraught with legal uncertainties that could ignite a crisis, election experts say.
Some academics have outlined a scenario in which Trump, using fraud as the justification, calls on Republican-held legislatures in battleground states to appoint their own electors to compete with the electors typically certified by governors. Normally, a state sends to Congress a slate of electors nominated by the party that wins the popular vote in that state. Pennsylvania and three other battleground states - Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina - all have Democratic governors and Republican-controlled legislatures, raising the possibility of ""dueling"" slates of electors being submitted to Congress.
In that case, both the House and the Senate would weigh in on which electors are valid. But it remains far from clear what happens if they disagree, election scholars say, because of a lack of clarity in the 1887 law that outlines the process.
“We would be in uncharted territory,” said Lawrence Douglas, an election scholar at Amherst College in Massachusetts. 
Dueling electors caused a crisis in the 1876 election, and Hawaii submitted two slates of electors in 1960. The Florida legislature was on the verge of submitting electors to support Bush before the high court shut down the state’s recount. 
The two senior Trump campaign officials said the campaign had discussed getting Republican state legislators to submit electors, but only in a last-resort scenario the official said could likely be avoided. They said the campaign would more likely dispute results in court, if needed. Republican leaders of the Pennsylvania legislature said state law gives them no role to play in the choosing electors.
In another scenario, the House alone would pick the president and the Senate would choose the vice president. That process kicks in when no candidate gets a majority of the electoral vote - as in the case of a 269-269 tie. It could also result from one or several states’ electoral votes being challenged and excluded by Congress, according to a Congressional Research Service analysis.
In that case, Trump could have an advantage. Although Democrats have more members, Republicans control more state delegations - and each delegation would get only one vote.
Trump needled Democrats over the prospect of a House vote at a Sept. 26 rally in Middletown, Pennsylvania. “We actually have the advantage,” he said. “Oh, they’re going to be thrilled to hear that.”
All the contested-election scenarios would play out under the pressure of immovable deadlines requiring states to submit electors to Congress on Dec. 14 and a new president to be seated on Jan. 20. 
Charles Wells, a retired Florida Supreme Court Justice who presided over the Bush-Gore recount case in 2000, wrote to friends in September warning that the 2020 election posed a grave risk to American democracy. In the email, seen by Reuters, he wrote: “A fundamental lesson I learned is that the law in respect to ‘contested’ elections is very confusing, outdated and fragile.”
NEW LAWS - AND LAWSUITS
November will mark the first election for president since Pennsylvania overhauled its voting laws in 2019. The changes allow any voter to request a mail-in ballot without having to provide an excuse, such as illness or travel. Officials are expecting to receive about three million mail-in ballots statewide - 10 times as many as 2016. About 325,000 are expected in Philadelphia.
The surging demand threatens to bury election offices. In the Philadelphia suburb of Montgomery County, officials were so inundated by mail-in ballots in the June presidential primary that counting them took more than two weeks. 
“Seventeen days to finish counting the ballots was just way too long,” said Ken Lawrence, a Democrat who chairs the county’s election board.
For the general election, the county spent $1 million on mail-opening machines and high-speed scanners and moved operations to a bigger space, where employees will work around the clock. Election officials in Philadelphia spent $5 million on new machines to open envelopes and process ballots.
Joyce Weber, an 81-year-old resident of Montgomery County, has already voted for Biden through a mail-in ballot. She trusts the state’s election system but believes Republicans will seek to intimidate voters at the polls. 
“This is not the America I grew up in,” Weber said.
Trump supporter Bob Howard, 70, is concerned enough about the election’s integrity that he signed up to monitor the polls for Republicans in Allegheny County. He spent a good part of his recent days in an election office outside Pittsburgh watching voters fill out and hand-in ballots. He believes there’s ample cause for concern because of the sudden surge in mail-in ballots, but said he hasn’t encountered fraud watching the polls so far.
“From what I could see, things are going smoothly, aside from some technical glitches and poor training,” said Howard, who requested a mail-in ballot to vote.
More than 1.3 million mail-in ballots had already been cast in Pennsylvania as of Thursday afternoon. But state law forbids from opening or counting them until Election Day, Nov. 3. Democratic and Republican state lawmakers have been unable to agree on a date to start earlier. The delay ramps up the pressure on what election experts say could be among slowest state vote counts - especially if it gets bogged down in partisan legal challenges.
In a victory for the Trump campaign, the state Supreme Court ruled on Sept. 17 that officials must invalidate any ballot that arrives without being packaged in two envelopes - an external one and an inner secrecy envelope. The ruling on the so-called “naked ballots” could result in tens of thousands of votes getting tossed, election officials say. That could have an outsized effect on Democrats, who have cast nearly three-quarters of the ballots mailed in as of Thursday.
Republicans have argued the procedure, laid out in state law, was essential to voter privacy and fraud prevention. Democrats counter that the rule is a vestige of the past that Republicans are using to disenfranchise voters. The envelopes are not needed to protect secrecy, they say, in an era when machines open ballots and workers can’t identify the voter.
The state’s high court also ruled that officials can count ballots that arrive up to three days after Election Day if they are postmarked by 8 p.m. on Nov. 3. The U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand on Monday, rejecting a Republican appeal that argued for invalidating such votes. But the court’s vote was four to four - with politically conservative judges siding with the Republican argument. The split decision raised concerns among Democrats that the expected Senate confirmation of Trump nominee Amy Coney Barrett as the ninth justice could mean that the high court will side with Republicans if it rules on post-election disputes.
GIRDING FOR BATTLE
In 2016, Trump carried Pennsylvania by 44,000 votes - far less than the number of mail-in ballots that election officials believe could be invalidated this year because they do not arrive with the proper “secrecy envelope.” Estimates of rejections reach 150,000 votes or more.
“There’s a very real possibility that you will have more naked ballots than the margin of victory,” said Nick Custodio, Philadelphia’s deputy election commissioner and a Democrat.
If the margin of victory is within half of one percent, Pennsylvania law requires a recount. State law also allows voters to contest the outcome of any election they consider “illegal” within 20 days. Bruce Marks, a Republican election lawyer in Pennsylvania, said he expects his party to file lawsuits in each of the state’s 67 counties if the results are close.
Trump plans to field legions of observers and attorneys to watch election workers count mail-in ballots - making sure those without two envelopes are tossed, according to the two senior campaign officials. But the campaign will need to negotiate access for an unprecedented number of observers with county election officials who oversee poll places in Pennsylvania.
It will also need to negotiate the process for challenging the validity of a vote. Typically, a paid county worker inspects each ballot and only asks partisan observers to weigh in upon seeing something amiss. The two sides try to agree on the voters’ intent, but either side can challenge the ballot’s legality, forcing a ruling by the county board of elections. The Trump campaign is arguing for an opportunity to weigh in on the validity of any ballot – not only those flagged by county workers, one of the campaign officials said.
Negotiations over processes between local party leaders and county election officials can sometimes reflect a county’s partisan bent, one of the Trump campaign officials said. As an example, the official pointed to differing ways the state’s two largest counties deal with poll observers. The campaign was denied access to election offices in solidly Democratic Philadelphia – a decision that triggered Trump’s “bad things” comment – but Allegheny County, which has more Republican constituents, has granted partisan observers access. The differing rules within one state could serve as fodder for post-election lawsuits, the official said.
At Philadelphia’s convention center, the Trump campaign wants to place an observer at each of the more than 20 tables where ballots are opened and certified, the two campaign officials said, and plans to staff them around the clock.
Philadelphia election officials did not respond to requests for comment on whether they will approve the Trump campaign’s vote-count monitoring plans.
Beyond the Trump campaign, conservative groups are training volunteers in many states to challenge votes. Among them is FreedomWorks, a nonprofit group that helped organize protests against coronavirus lockdown policies this spring. FreedomWorks has prioritized Pennsylvania and plans to field a “large group” of election monitors to help ensure the election’s legitimacy, said its president, Adam Brandon.
Brandon said he expects Trump to lead Pennsylvania in results posted on Election Day but for that advantage to shrink as mail-in votes are counted - a potentially explosive dynamic in a deeply divided nation.

“It’s a powder keg right now, and I worry that as you see those margins shrink, people are going to be losing their faith in the overall integrity of the system,” he said. “I hate to say this, but I predict a mess … and potentially even the Supreme Court weighing in.”

MADRID (Reuters) - Two Spanish regions, Castilla and Leon and Valencia, urged the central government on Friday to impose night-time curfews quickly to stem the coronavirus spread after authorities failed to reach a decision on such restrictions on Thursday.
The regions have a high degree of autonomy and are largely responsible for responding to the pandemic but restrictions on freedom of movement, like curfews, require the intervention of the national government.
With COVID-19 cases soaring this week to total over a million, the highest tally in Western Europe, the central government favours curfews. But it postponed a decision after the regions of Madrid and the Basque country opposed such a move on Thursday.
""We want this to happen today if possible, rather than tomorrow,"" said Alfonso Fernandez Manueco, the regional leader of Castilla and Leon.
""The virus doesn't understand administrative boundaries or different political stripes,"" he told a joint news conference with Health Minister Salvador Illa. 
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was due to make a televised address at around 1100 GMT to speak about the pandemic.
Valencian leader Ximo Puig told his administration to draft legislation to unilaterally enforce a night-time curfew until Dec. 9.
""We have to try to get ahead of the virus so that the Christmas holidays can go ahead,"" he said. 
In Madrid, where a city-wide two-week lockdown will expire on Saturday, regional authorities plan to move to more localised confinement in some neighbourhoods. Socialising between different households will be banned across the city between midnight and 6 am. Midnight is still quite early by Spanish nightlife standards.

Despite increasingly stringent measures, the country's daily infection rate keeps rising. A record 20,986 cases were added on Thursday, bringing the total to 1,026,281. The death toll stands at 34,521.

YANGON (Reuters) - After the first wave of coronavirus hit Myanmar in March, 36-year-old Ma Suu closed her salad stall and pawned her jewelry and gold to buy food to eat. 
During the second wave, when the government issued a stay-home order in September for Yangon, Ma Suu shut her stall again and sold her clothes, plates and pots.
With nothing left to sell, her husband, an out of work construction labourer, has resorted to hunting for food in the open drains by the slum where they live on the outskirts of Myanmar's largest city.
“People are eating rats and snakes,” Ma Suu said through tears. “Without an income, they need to eat like that to feed their children.”
They live in Hlaing Thar Yar, one of Yangon's poorest neighborhoods, where residents shine flashlights in the undergrowth behind their homes, looking for some night creature to stave off their hunger. 
While rats, reptiles and insects are often eaten by families in rural areas, people in some urban areas are now being reduced to getting nutrition however they can.
With more than 40,000 cases and 1,000 deaths, Myanmar is facing one of Southeast Asia’s worst coronavirus outbreaks, and the lockdown in Yangon has left hundreds of thousands of people, like Ma Suu, without work and precious little support.
Local administrator Nay Min Tun said in his part of Hlaing Thar Yar 40% of households had received aid but many workplaces were shut and people had become more desperate.
Myat Min Thu, the ruling party lawmaker for the area, said government aid and private donations was being distributed but acknowledged not everyone could be covered.
The crisis has cast a shadow over a general election planned for Nov. 8, though Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi is still expected to win by a comfortable margin.
NOTHING BUT THE MARKET
Even before the pandemic, a third of Myanmar’s 53 million people were considered ""highly vulnerable"" to falling into poverty, despite recent gains following the country’s emergence from decades of ruinous isolation under the military junta.
The financial squeeze now threatens to plunge many back into poverty or squash their chances of getting out.
Poverty in the developing East Asia and Pacific region is set to rise for the first time in 20 years due to COVID-19, the World Bank said in September, with about 38 million expected to remain in or be pushed back into poverty.
Myanmar’s government has offered poor households a one-off food package and three cash grants of $15 each as part of its relief plan, but families say it falls far short.
A survey by ONow Myanmar of more than 2,000 people across the country in April found 70% had stopped working and a quarter had taken out loans for food, medicine, and other essentials. 
Sectors driving industralisation in Myanmar - including garment work and tourism – have come to a halt while remittances have dried up, said Gerard Mccarthy, a postdoctoral fellow at the Asia Research Institute in Singapore.
""Households already in dire debt from paying for medical treatment, schooling, sustaining the elderly and everyday survival...many will need to pay off these loans before they can begin spending on anything discretionary,” he said.
Thant Myint-U, a Myanmar historian, rued the absence of a proper social safety net and the collapse of villages' traditional welfare systems.
“For tens of millions of Myanmar’s poor, there is nothing other than the market, which in the good times provides opportunities for informal work in the cities or migration abroad but during a downturn is leaving the poorest with little more than the shirt on their backs,” he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State of Mike Pompeo is flying to India next week to strengthen strategic ties with a nation that is locked in a military standoff with China, in Washington's latest effort to bolster allies against Beijing.
As part of an intensifying pushback against China's economic and military power in the region, Pompeo will also travel to Sri Lanka and the Maldives, two key Indian Ocean countries that are struggling with a mountain of Chinese debt incurred to finance big infrastructure projects. 
Pompeo will conclude his trip, which comes in the final week before the U.S. presidential election, in Indonesia which is also locked in territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.
""We're looking forward to strengthening critical relationships with our friends and partners, emphasizing our deep commitment to the Indo-Pacific and advancing our vision for long-term partnership and prosperity in the region,"" said Dean Thompson, principal deputy assistant secretary at the State Department's Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs.
Washington has been ramping up diplomatic pressure on China, and President Donald Trump has made being tough on Beijing a key part of his campaign to secure a second term. 
Pompeo led a meeting of foreign ministers from India, Japan and Australia earlier this month in Tokyo, a grouping that is seen as potentially a bulwark against China's growing assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. 
Next month, India will host Malabar, the biggest naval exercises in years, with the United States, Japan and Australia, which China has in the past opposed.
Beijing said this month that unprovovoked U.S. accusations against China showed a ""Cold War mentality.""
During the trip, in which Pompeo will be accompanied by Defense Secretary Mark Esper, India is expected to sign a military agreement that will give it access to sensitive U.S. satellite data to help improve targeting of missiles and drones, Indian officials said.
""There is great further potential in our defence cooperation,"" an Indian official said. 
In Sri Lanka, Pompeo will urge government leaders to scale back dependence on China, which has invested billions of dollars building ports and highways but which has left the island nation in debt, officials said.
'DIFFICULT BUT NECESSARY DECISIONS'
Pompeo, making a first visit by a U.S. Secretary of State in over a decade, will convey support for a ""strong, independent and democratic Sri Lanka,"" Thompson said.
""We urge Sri Lanka to make difficult but necessary decisions to secure its economic independence for long-term prosperity,"" he said. 
The island is a key part of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Belt and Road Initiative but the government in recent years has sought to improve ties with India, United States and Japan.
Similar efforts are underway to push back against Chinese influence in the Maldives, another set of tropical islands that lie on key shipping lanes.
""Expected discussions of the visit include the global battle against the COVID-19 pandemic as well as ongoing and future collaboration,"" the government in Male, the capital of the Maldives, said in a statement.
Pompeo's visit to Indonesia comes amid an escalating U.S.-China rivalry that is being vigorously contested in Southeast Asia, especially in the South China Sea, which China claims as almost entirely its own territory. The claim is opposed by many regional states, including Indonesia.
Earlier this week, the U.S. State Department approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion.
Taiwan, which China says is a renegade province, also claims large parts of the South China Sea.
Washington made high-level approaches to Indonesia in late July and early August to grant landing and refuelling rights to its P-8 surveillance planes that monitor Chinese military activity in the resource-rich waterway.
The offer, first reported by Reuters, was rebuffed by Jokowi, according to four senior officials. Indonesia has long followed a neutral foreign policy and has never allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for foreign military operations.

""There are commercial issues, security issues, and diplomatic issues where the United States has already improved the relationship between the countries,"" Pompeo said this week. ""But there's more that we can do.""

121,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>",Turning point in Thailand: Queen's brush with protest,"By Matthew Tostevin, Patpicha Tanakasempipat, Chayut Setboonsarng and Panu Wongcha-um
BANGKOK (Reuters) - A defining moment in Thailand's growing protest movement started with the unannounced arrival of a champagne-coloured Rolls Royce (LON:RR) stretch limousine on a Bangkok street.
When Queen Suthida's motorcade slowed as it encountered a few dozen protesters jeering outside Bangkok's Government House on Oct. 14, royalists denounced it as unforgivable harassment in a kingdom whose constitution demands reverence for the monarchy.
The government, led by a former army chief who was the initial target of months of protests, responded swiftly.
It banned protests and made dozens of arrests. But that spurred more demonstrations – and much greater criticism of a monarchy that protesters say has helped to enable decades of military domination.
At a time when King Maha Vajiralongkorn has faced unprecedented scrutiny, many Thais have questioned why the queen was on that road at that time, and have challenged the severity of the reaction - which also included three arrests on little-used charges that could carry the death penalty.
The opposition Move Forward party said on Thursday it planned a parliamentary motion ""to study the mistakes made over the motorcade"", complaining this had led to severe action being taken, specifically citing the use of Article 110 charges of violence or attempted violence against the queen.
""It shows a failure in the setting of the royal motorcade route,"" said party spokesman Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn.
Other people noted the route was not the shortest between the Dusit Palace, where the king and queen reside, and the temple where Suthida was going. 
They also asked why the motorcade had moved so slowly, even at points where there was no evident obstruction. Royal vehicles usually move much faster. 
(GRAPHIC: Turning point in Thailand - https://graphics.reuters.com/THAILAND-PROTESTS/MOTORCADE/qzjvqaawqvx/Thailand-Motorcade.jpg) 
Some Thais have raised questions whether the encounter was used to justify a crackdown. Reuters has no evidence to confirm this.
The Palace declined comment, as it has since the start of three months of protests that at first called for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former army chief, but then broke a decades-old taboo by demanding royal reform. 
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters that securing royal motorcade routes was the police's responsibility.
""The emergency declaration was necessary to prevent other incidents and conflicts,"" he said, rejecting protesters' accusations that it was a provocation to justify harsh measures. 
Police did not respond to repeated Reuters requests for comment. 
 
RECONSTRUCTION
Reuters has reviewed nine videos supplied by the people who shot them and taken from different angles in addition to other video on social media, well over 100 still pictures with accompanying metadata and interviewed eight eyewitnesses to reconstruct how events unfolded. 
There are gaps. Reuters was unable to establish the full route of the motorcade before and after the incident, why it was taken, why there had been no advance notice of the route or why the royal convoy travelled much more slowly than usual.
The incident started when Queen Suthida reached the protesters at around 5:22 pm on Oct. 14. 
Suthida was on a rare visit from Europe, where she and the king had spent nearly the entire year before arriving in Bangkok on Oct. 10.
Dressed in a light blue silk dress with a gold sash, she was travelling on royal duties with the king's 15-year-old son, and potential heir, Dipangkorn Rasmijoti, who wore his white dress uniform, replete with gold braid. 
The protesters were outside Prayuth's office at Government House. Prayuth seized power in a 2014 coup and protesters accuse him of engineering an election last year to keep his hold - an accusation he denies. 
Most of tens of thousands of protesters were behind police blockades nearly a kilometre away, but a few dozen had made it to the gates and were milling around, outnumbered by police, who were lined up 20 abreast on the road.
Usually, police close roads in advance for royal motorcades, but this time it was only the appearance of the lead car and motorcycle outriders that heralded what was coming - minutes before it did.
""There was no announcement,"" said Pravit Rojanaphruk, a reporter from Khaosod English, who was interviewing protesters at the time. Video footage supports the assertion the usual warning was not given.
Protesters scrambled as motorcycle outriders arrived. Recognising a royal car, arms shot up to give the three-finger pro-democracy salute taken from ""The Hunger Games."" Others raised phones to take pictures.
A chant developed of ""Our taxes,"" a reference to accusations of royal profligacy. Some chanted ""Nation, Religion, People"" - adapting the traditional pillars of Thai society: ""Nation, Religion, Monarchy."" 
The queen's limousine slowed to a stop as police pushed back protesters at both sides. It took nearly a minute, as some were dragged off. Pictures show them clinging to the legs of police officers as they tumble down near the Chamai Maru-chet bridge.
Protesters were held behind several lines of police. At some points, they appeared to get within metres of the car, though always behind police and none appeared to be trying to reach it.
The queen, who holds the rank of general and is a deputy commander of the Royal Security Command, can be seen smiling and waving to people.
""Some pictures made it look like we harassed them, when it was them that drove right into our gathering,"" said one protester who gave her name only as Vitita. 
A royalist group, the Center for the Protection of the Monarchy, said its members helped police keep control.
""We risked 20 lives to prevent the mob that surrounded the royal motorcade with all our strength and shouted 'Long live the King' to muffle the mob,"" the group said in a statement.
Some yellow-shirted royalists can be seen with police in the video, but Reuters could not confirm the group's claims.
About 280 metres on from the bridge, another group of protesters stood behind police and royalists.
Video shows someone throwing what appears to be a bottle from deep in the crowd. It is unclear if it hit the car as police jogged on either side. Moving at about 7 km (4 miles) an hour, the convoy passed the last protesters at around 5.27 p.m. 
That evening, the daily royal news programme showed the queen arriving at the Wat Ratcha Orasaram Ratchaworawihan temple at 5.51 p.m. presenting saffron robes to monks. Later, she was shown handing out awards to kneeling subjects.
But three sources, who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity, said the Palace was angered by the fracas - that was something unheard of in decades.
    
EMERGENCY MEASURES
Just after 4 a.m. the next day, state television announced emergency measures citing illegal public assemblies and said people had ""acted to affect the royal motorcade and committed severe actions that affected national security.""
All political meetings of five or more people were banned. So was news that could affect national security.
Within minutes of the announcement riot police rushed protesters outside the prime minister's office. At least 20 people were arrested - including lawyer Arnon Nampa, the first person to have openly called for royal reform on Aug. 3. Arnon could not be reached for comment as he remained in prison.
The response from protesters on social media was immediate. The top trending hashtag on Twitter in Thailand, used more than 1.1 million times, translates as #KingSlandersPeople - as people said they thought the incident was being used unfairly to justify harsh measures against protesters.
  
ARRESTS
At least 81 arrests have been made since the emergency decree, police said. Protests happened daily, some drawing tens of thousands of people, before emergency measures were lifted on Oct. 22.
On Oct. 16, two activists were arrested on charges of violence against the queen, which can carry a death sentence if the queen's life is thought to have been endangered.
Both Bunkueanun 'Francis' Paothong and Ekachai Hongkangwan can be seen in videos taken at the scene just before the queen's car arrived and among protesters pushed back by police. 
Now out on bail, Bunkueanun, 20, told Reuters: ""Everything went very quickly in a matter of minutes. Protesters started to push in to form a wall. Then the police moved at us to clear the road.""
He said when he realised a royal motorcade was coming, he used a small megaphone to tell people to stand clear. He said he flashed the salute, but then pulled back from the crowd as he suddenly felt unwell. ""I could not breathe properly and I almost fainted."" 
In a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) by Ekachai, 45, before his arrest, he can be heard saying: ""It's a royal motorcade. Show three fingers."" But the video did not show him attempt to get closer to the car. 
Sareewat Sriyoha, a lawyer for Ekachai, quoted the activist as saying that protesters had not seen the motorcade when large numbers of police pushed them back. They had thought police were trying to prevent their planned protest at Government House.
He said that once Ekachai realised what was going on, he had shouted to police: ""Oh, its a royal motorcade, why didn't you tell us so we wouldn't block it.""
Sareewat said Ekachai told him that he stood back once he knew it was a royal motorcade. Ekachai previously served two years in jail on a royal insult conviction for selling copies of a foreign documentary about the royal family.
Both Bunkueanun and Ekachai denied the charges under Article 110, which outlaws violence or attempted violence ""against the queen or her liberty"" and is even tougher than royal insult laws. 
A third activist, Suranat Paenprasert, was arrested on Oct. 21 on the same charges. He has so far been denied bail. His lawyer, Poonsuk Poonsukcharoen, said he was accused of persuading other protesters to block the motorcade, but that none of them had realised what was going on. 

""No one knew that there was a royal motorcade coming,"" she said. ""Those blocking the road were mainly the police officers.""

122,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 04:55AM ET</span>",Sri Lanka parliament strengthens presidential powers,"By Waruna Karunatilake
COLOMBO (Reuters) - Sri Lankan lawmakers approved amendments to the constitution that strengthened the powers of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and took away parliament's role in making key appointments such as judges and the police chief.
The new amendments were passed by parliament late on Thursday with a two-thirds majority after a raucous two-day debate.
Rajapaksa, a former defence chief who oversaw the military defeat of Tamil separatists a decade ago, swept to power last November and has since consolidated control.
In August, his party and its allies overwhelmingly won a parliamentary election on an election plank that included doing away with a previous constitutional amendment in 2015 that had put more power in the legislature's hands.
The government has argued that strengthening the president's powers was required for better governance. 
Under the new law, Sri Lanka's president will have the power to dissolve the 225-member legislature any time after it crosses the half-way mark of its five-year term.
Opposition groups have criticised the amendments, and some wore red arm-bands in protest in parliament during the debate.
Harsha de Silva, an opposition lawmaker from the capital city Colombo, said the Rajapaksa administration was pushing Sri Lanka in the direction of an autocracy. 
""I voted against (the bill) to protect democracy in Sri Lanka,"" Silva said in a tweet.
Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Colombo-based think-tank Centre for Policy Alternatives, said the amendments are meant to be temporary with a new constitution proposed within six months.
But till a new constitution or further amendments are enacted, power will remain concentrated with Rajapaksa with limited checks and balances, he said.
""It is extremely dangerous,"" Saravanamuttu said.
The influential Rajapaksa family has tightened its grip over Sri Lankan politics in recent years. After the August win, Gotabaya appointed his older brother Mahinda Rajapaksa - himself a former president - as prime minister.

There was no immediate comment from the Houthi movement on the report, which cited a coalition spokesman.
Yemen has been locked in conflict since 2014 when the Houthis seized Sanaa, the capital, and then much of the country's north. Fighting escalated in March 2015 when the Saudi-led coalition intervened to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

After brief scuffles, city security guards carried three protesters to a nearby police pickup truck, according to live streaming by local media and Reuters witnesses.
""We reject the Chinese military presence in Cambodia,"" shouted one protester, waving a Cambodian flag, as a police officer with a loud hailer gave the group five minutes to disperse.
The Cambodian government has repeatedly denied reports that China had reached a secret deal to let it place forces at the Ream Naval Base, saying that hosting foreign forces would be against Cambodia's constitution.
Phnom Penh police spokesman San Sok Seyha said those detained had been taken in for questioning since the rally had not been given a permit. 
""We need to protect the embassy and keep public order for all people,"" he said. 
Earlier, police officers at the scene had told some journalists to delete pictures and video of the altercation, according to Reuters witnesses. 
Friday's protest was part of a wider rally organised by the dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) to mark the 29th anniversary of the Paris Peace Agreement ending Cambodia's civil war, said CNRP's former vice president, Mu Sochua.
Cambodia, which is among Asia’s poorest nations, has been an important ally to China in recent years and has been accused of giving Beijing influence in return for economic support. Cambodia has insisted its foreign and security policy is independent.
The CNRP was dissolved at the request of Prime Minister Hun Sen's government, which accused the party of plotting to take power with the help of Washington. The CNRP and the U.S. embassy in Cambodia have denied the accusation. 
The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Police also removed 16 children from harm in an operation that saw arrests in almost all of the country's eight states and territories, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) said in a statement.
The ages of the accused ranged from 19 to 57, with occupations including construction, transport, law enforcement and hospitality, police said without identifying them or saying when they had been arrested. The 44 men face 350 charges between them.
The AFP said it began the investigation after receiving a report that thousands of people were using an unspecified cloud storage platform to spread child-abuse material. Cloud storage refers to remote storage of data, accessed via the internet. 
""Pixel by pixel, our investigators painstakingly look for clues and never give up, and the tools they use give Australian police access to world leading expertise,"" AFP Commissioner Reece Kershaw said.
The AFP said it had rescued 134 children from harm in the year to June, including 67 children overseas.

Victoria Police said in a statement that the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) had made them aware of ""transfer of monies from the Vatican over a period of time to Australia"", but said the financial crimes watchdog had not advised them of any suspicious activity related to the transactions.
""In the absence of any other evidence or intelligence Victoria Police has noted the advice from AUSTRAC. We are not at this time conducting any further investigation.""
Earlier this week, the head of AUSTRAC told a Senate committee the agency had probed the allegations that Vatican funds were transferred to Australia amid the prosecution of Pell for child sex abuse, and had given information to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and Victoria police.
The AFP said on Wednesday it was reviewing the information, and had referred some aspects of the matter to the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC), which investigates misconduct by state police.
On Friday, the AFP said there was no update to their earlier statement.
Police in Victoria in 2017 laid several charges against Pell involving historical child sexual offences, but only one case, involving two former choirboys, went to trial in 2018.
Italian media recently reported that Pell's Vatican nemesis, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, sent 700,000 euros ($828,000) to Australia to help Pell's ""enemies"" while Pell was facing the charges. Becciu's lawyer has denied the reports.
Pell was acquitted by Australia's High Court in April after serving 13 months in jail on charges he assaulted two choirboys. His lawyer said the Italian media reports on the alleged transfer of Vatican funds must be probed.

Pell's accuser in the sexual assault case has said through his lawyer that ""he has no knowledge of any payments allegedly made by the Vatican to Australia"".

DENVER (Reuters) - An explosive Colorado wildfire that has already forced the evacuation of several mountain communities and the closure of Rocky Mountain National Park blackened another 45,000 acres (18,200 hectares) on Thursday as it jumped the U.S. Continental Divide.
The East Troublesome Fire, which broke out on Oct. 14, has now burned 170,000 acres (68,800 hectares) and was only about 5% contained as of Thursday afternoon, incident commander Noel Livingston said at a news briefing.
The flames have spread into Rocky Mountain National Park, prompted the National Park Service to close the entire 415 square-mile (668-square-km) expanse and the blaze has become the second-largest on record in Colorado. 
The closure of the national park is in addition to more than one million acres of wilderness in Colorado that the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management and state authorities have deemed off limits to the public.
The National Weather Service was forecasting continued hot, dry, windy conditions in much of Colorado, but snow and much colder weather are expected this weekend. 
Grand County Sheriff Brett Schroetlin has ordered evacuations in the area, including the tiny lakeside community of Grand Lake, which has a population of about 470. 
The fire is among the latest in a brutal fire season following a long period of drought across Colorado. The cause remains under investigation.
Further north, the Cameron Peak Fire has been burning since mid-August, setting the state record for largest wildfire. It has burned more than 207,000 acres (83,770 hectares) overall and scorched swaths of Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests.
The two fires are just 18 km (11 miles) apart, but Livingston said it was unlikely they could merge into a massive conflagration.

On Tuesday, helicopters rescued 23 hikers and three dogs from San Juan National Forest where the small but dangerous Ice Fire had broken out on Monday in Colorado's southwestern corner near the small former mining town of Silverton.

133,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 23, 2020 12:01AM ET</span>",Australia to lift cap on citizens returning as thousands left stranded,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will slightly lift the cap on the number of citizens and permanent residents allowed to return each week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday, as local COVID-19 cases slow to single digits.
Australia has since July capped the number of locals allowed to return home each week in an attempt to reduce the threat of spreading COVID-19 once they enter a mandatory 14-day quarantine in hotels.
Morrison said the current cap will rise to 5,865 people in November, an increase of 290, after Western Australia and Queensland states said they would accommodate more locals.
The increase comes amid heightened pressure on Morrison's government to help some 26,000 Australians that registered their intention to come home.
""The most effective way to get Australians home is to increase these caps,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
Many, however, have struggled to secure a plane ticket and raise the several thousand dollars needed to pay for hotel quarantine when they arrive back in Australia.
Looking to offer more support, Morrison's government earlier this month struck a deal with the Northern Territory government to allow up to 500 people each fortnight to return. These are outside the weekly cap, with the first plane landing on Friday.
The increase in the number of Australians allowed to return home comes as the country's second most populous state - the epicentre of the country's COVID-19 outbreak - on Friday reported that active coronavirus cases have fallen to a four-month low.
Victoria state, which recorded just one new infection in the past 24 hours, said there are now 100 active cases - the lowest since June 19.
""This is a good number. This is a very clear sign that the strategy is working,"" Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.
The active infections are a relief to state authorities amid heightened fears of a fresh cluster after a case in a school in Melbourne's northern suburbs prompted authorities to order 800 people to self-isolate.

Australia has recorded just over 27,400 COVID-19 infections, far fewer than many other developed countries. Victoria accounts for more than 90% of the 905 deaths nationally.

134,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 09:50PM ET</span>","In rare move, U.S. federal court allows military sexual assault case to continue","WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal court on Thursday allowed a sexual assault case against the second-highest-ranking military official to proceed, a rare move that legal experts say could potentially chip away at such cases usually staying in the military justice system. 
Last year, General John Hyten, now the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was accused of sexually assaulting a female officer under his previous command.
Kathryn Spletstoser, a retired Army colonel, had accused Hyten of engaging in unwanted kissing and touching as well as rubbing up against her.
An official Air Force investigation did not substantiate the accusations against Hyten, who last year was confirmed by the Senate to his current position. 
A district court in the Central District of California on Thursday denied Hyten's motion to dismiss the case or to change the venue from California to Nebraska. 
A spokeswoman for Hyten said the Department of Justice was reviewing the ruling. 
""As is our practice in all on-going litigation, we are not going to comment on the details,"" Major Trisha Guillebeau said. 
Legal experts and advocates said military sexually assault cases usually are not heard in federal courts and the move was rare.
""I personally know of no other case where it's been ruled this way,"" Don Christensen, a retired chief prosecutor for the Air Force, said.
""It's chipping away at the barrier to being able to successfully sue your perpetrator in the military,"" Christensen, who leads the advocacy group Protect Our Defenders, added.
Steve Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, said that while individual district court rulings may not set precedents, it could provide a path for courts to narrow the Feres doctrine, which does not allow service members to recover damages from the government.
Sexual assault and harassment in the U.S. military is largely under-reported.

137,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 06:55PM ET</span>",Exclusive: 'Dumb mistake' exposed Iranian hand behind fake Proud Boys U.S. election emails - sources,"By Christopher Bing and Jack Stubbs
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Government analysts and private sector investigators were able to rapidly attribute to Iranian hackers a wave of thousands of threatening emails aimed at U.S. voters because of mistakes made in a video attached to some of the messages, according to four people familiar with the matter.
Those failures provided a rare opportunity for the U.S. government to identify and publicly announce blame for a malicious cyber operation in a matter of days, something that usually requires months of technical analysis and supporting intelligence.
""Either they made a dumb mistake or wanted to get caught,"" said a senior U.S. government official, who asked not to be identified. ""We are not concerned about this activity being some kind of false flag due to other supporting evidence. This was Iran.""
Attribution to Iranian hackers does not necessarily mean a group is working at the behest of the government there. Iranian officials denied the U.S. allegations.
""These accusations are nothing more than another scenario to undermine voter confidence in the security of the U.S. election, and are absurd,"" said Alireza Miryousefi, spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York.
On Wednesday, U.S. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said Russia and Iran have both tried to interfere in the campaign for the Nov. 3 election. U.S. intelligence agencies are still analyzing exactly who in Iran commanded the operation and its intent, three of the sources said.
Within hours of the video being circulated this week, which purported to come from a American far-right group known as The Proud Boys, intelligence officials and major email platform providers, such as Alphabet Inc's (O:GOOGL) Google and  Microsoft Corp  (O:MSFT), began closely analyzing computer code that appeared in the hackers' video.
While the emails, which demanded that voters change their party affiliation to the Republican Party and vote for President Donald Trump or ""we will come after you,"" appeared to come from an official-looking Proud Boys email address, the address was inauthentic, security analysts said. The Proud Boys denied they were behind the messages.
How security analysts used intelligence from the video to attribute the email scheme has not been previously reported.
A Microsoft spokesperson declined to comment on the company's collaboration with law enforcement. A Google statement on Wednesday night said the activity was ""linked to Iran."" A Google spokesperson said on Thursday the company was in contact with the FBI. 
ATTEMPTS TO BLUR
Despite attempts to blur aspects of the video to hide their identity, the hackers were unable to obfuscate all of the incriminating information, the sources said.
The video showed the hackers' computer screen as they typed in commands and pretended to hack a voter registration system. Investigators noticed snippets of revealing computer code, including file paths, file names and an internet protocol (IP) address.
Security analysts found that the IP address, hosted through an online service called Worldstream, traced back to previous Iranian hacking activity, the sources said.
Analysts then cross-referenced those clues left in the video with data from other intelligence streams, including communications interceptions, the government official said.
""This public disclosure of attribution to Iran by the government has been done with breakneck speed, compared to the usual process that takes months and often years,"" said Dmitri Alperovitch, a co-founder and former CTO of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.
Two cybersecurity experts, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press, independently said they had seen Iranian hackers use infrastructure from Dutch-based Worldstream to launch cyberattacks in recent months.
Worldstream's chief legal operations officer Wouter van Zwieten said in a statement that the account associated with the IP in question was suspended after Reuters got in touch and that the Dutch National Cyber Security Center was looking into the matter.
""They've just informed us that the particular IP address is now officially registered by them and ready for investigation under Dutch Law,"" van Zwieten said. The National Cyber Security Center confirmed that Worldstream had been in touch and that it had logged the case but declined further comment.
Van Zwieten said the server used by the hackers was only commissioned on Oct. 6 and had not drawn any complaints until now. The company said it had no access to the content on its servers.
In addition to sending thousands of emails to voters in states including Florida, the hackers also attempted to share links to the video via fake accounts on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter.
Social media analytics firm Graphika said two Twitter accounts began posting links to the video on Tuesday evening and attempted to get the attention of some media and political organizations.
One account described itself as ""Trump's Soldier"" and shared a link to the video with the comment ""It seems they hacked voting system.""
A Twitter spokeswoman said: ""We acted quickly to proactively and permanently suspend a small number of accounts and limit the sharing of media specific to this coordinated campaign.""
Facebook said: ""We disrupted an attempt by a single fake account to seed information related to what appears to be an influence operation primarily focused on spreading false claims via email.""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has a window for a snap election that could give him a majority government and free him of his dependence on opposition parties to govern - if only they would cooperate and withdraw their support.
On Wednesday Trudeau's Liberals, doing well in polls due to their handling of the coronavirus pandemic, sought to capitalize on that boost before an emerging second wave worsens and expensive financial aid programs begin to wind down.
The government called a surprise confidence vote which, if lost, would have triggered a snap election. But the left-leaning opposition New Democrats backed Trudeau, allowing the government to survive.
""I'm convinced that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was looking for a way to go to an election,"" New Democrats leader Jagmeet Singh told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp after the tense vote on Wednesday.
""We're not going to let them go to an election just because it suits them,"" Singh said.
Trudeau, who has been in power since 2015, lost the popular vote last year after struggling through an ethics scandal and the emergence of old pictures of him in blackface, leaving him with a minority government. That means Trudeau must negotiate all legislation to win opposition support. A majority government is independent.
But his handling of COVID-19 has put wind in the Liberals' sails, and there is no way to predict how long it will last.
""If we look at the 6-, 12-, 18-month horizon, there are an increasing number of uncertainties related to the state of the economy and what happens with the pandemic,"" said pollster Nik Nanos, founder of Nanos Research. 
""(Liberals) are starting to see a window that's open today and that they know will be open 60-90 days at the very least. Why try to extend the mandate when they can have a smash and grab majority?"" Nanos said.
The Liberals would win 38.5% of the vote today, according to Nanos Research, 6 points more than their main rivals, the Conservatives, which could be just enough to secure a majority.
Getting there needs the New Democrats to stop backing the government, including the pre-Christmas fiscal update, which Liberals have said will include major spending plans.
KINGMAKER
The New Democrats have said they want to use their kingmaker position to force the Liberals to incorporate more social safety-net measures into the spending package. The party is also wary of an expensive election campaign.
But this week, as it negotiated with the Liberals for its support to quash a Conservative motion that led to the confidence vote, it got no concessions. The Liberals abruptly cut off talks on Tuesday morning, an NDP source said. 
""It's hard to sit across the table and negotiate with somebody who wants to lose (the negotiation),"" the source said.
Trudeau has insisted he does not want an election. Instead, he wants to pass pandemic aid and the fiscal package to stimulate an economic recovery.
""We don't want an election. We didn't want one yesterday. I don't think Canadians want one,"" a government source said on Thursday.
Another government source said it is now up to the Liberals to illustrate they want to work with opposition parties, but if the parties want to ""derail (the government's work), then we need a new mandate.""
Three provincial governments have sought early votes to capitalize on a bump in their popularity during the pandemic. One incumbent won and two more are expected to win over the next few days. 
Frank Graves, president of polling company EKOS Research, sees risks of a snap election this fall during the worsening second wave of the pandemic.

""The dominant issue is the pandemic and we've reached a crisis stage. That factor could weigh heavily on how voters make their decisions,"" Graves said. ""If you do (an election) in the spring ... the worst is behind us, and I think Trudeau would be in a strong position to win.""

Kennedy Human Rights prize for her work defending the rights, ancestral lands and culture of indigenous people in Brazil.
The award was to be presented to her by the former U.S. senator's daughter, Kerry Kennedy, in a virtual ceremony from Washington at which former U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was to speak.
""This prize is not for me alone, it is for all of Brazil's indigenous peoples that are crying out for help,"" the 36-year-old said in a telephone interview.
The award draws attention to the struggle of her tribe to stop the building of hydroelectric dams on the Tapajos River, where the Munduruku live, and gain recognition for their reservation lands, she said. 
It comes at a time when the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has ""dismantled"" health and education services for indigenous people and turned a blind eye to illegal loggers and gold miners increasingly invading protected reservations and destroying forests, she said.
Bolsonaro defends his policies as integrating indigenous people into Brazilian society and lifting them out of poverty.
The president has turned the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai into a ""farmers organization"" run by appointees by the farm lobby who are seeking to expand commercial agriculture into tribal lands, she said.

""This prize has strengthened our cause. We will cry out louder,"" she said.

(Reuters) - A judge dismissed a lesser murder charge against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin but said he still had to face the most serious murder charge in George Floyd's death in May, according to a court ruling released on Thursday.
Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said prosecutors did not have probable cause to charge Chauvin with third-degree murder but said the evidence supported taking to trial a second-degree murder charge, which could lead to decades in prison.
Minnesota Governor Tim Walz announced that he had activated the Minnesota National Guard as a ""precautionary step"" following the ruling, which he said marked ""a positive step in the path toward justice for George Floyd.""
The fatal arrest of Floyd on May 25, captured on video by bystanders, sparked weeks of angry and sometimes violent protests in Minneapolis and elsewhere over police brutality and racism. Chauvin is white, while Floyd was a Black man.
Cahill described in detail how Chauvin used his knee to press Floyd's neck and face ""into the unforgiving concrete of Chicago Avenue"" in Minneapolis even after Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe and then became unresponsive.
Cahill upheld a manslaughter charge against Chauvin and all six charges against three other officers -- Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao -- for allegedly aiding and abetting Chauvin in the murder. Kueng and Lane helped hold Floyd down by restraining his back and legs, Cahill noted, while Thao kept a group of bystanders at bay.
Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison portrayed the ruling as a win for his office.
""The court's decision to dismiss just one of the lesser charges against just one of the defendants — while leaving intact all the charges against the other three defendants — is based on how appellate courts have interpreted the statute in question,"" Ellison said in a statement.
""We are considering our options in light of the court's strong order on the remaining charges.""
Lawyers for Floyd's family also welcomed the ruling.
""We are gratified that the court preserved eight of the nine charges against Derek Chauvin, including the more serious second-degree murder charge for which we expect a conviction,"" Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement. 
In his ruling, Cahill said a third-degree murder charge was appropriate in cases in which a defendant's actions were ""eminently dangerous to other persons"" and were not specifically targeted at the person who died.
""The evidence presented by the State does not indicate that Chauvin's actions were eminently dangerous to anyone other than Floyd,"" Cahill wrote.
Chauvin's lawyer, Eric Nelson, declined to comment.

Navalny, 44, fell ill on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20 and was airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Blood samples taken from him confirmed the presence of a Novichok nerve agent, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has said. 
Navalny, convalescing in Germany, has accused Putin of being behind his poisoning, an allegation the Kremlin has rejected as false and insulting. 
Addressing a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, Putin said he had asked Russia's General Prosecutor's office to authorise Navalny to leave the country after an appeal from the opposition politician's wife. 
""There were travel restrictions against him related to a judicial investigation and a criminal case (against Navalny),"" Putin said.
""But I nonetheless asked the General Prosecutor's office to allow it and he left.""
Putin said that if someone in Russia had wanted to poison Navalny Moscow would not have allowed him to be flown to Berlin for treatment. 
Putin and other officials never refer to Navalny by name. Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has recently been referring to Navalny as the ""Berlin patient.""
The European Union and Britain last week imposed sanctions on Russian officials close to Putin as punishment for Navalny's poisoning.
The Kremlin condemned those sanctions as an unfriendly and groundless step against Moscow and pledged to retaliate. 

Navalny was discharged from hospital last month and is recovering in Germany.

ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has told security forces to act lawfully, the national security adviser said on Thursday, as authorities in Lagos struggled to enforce a curfew imposed to contain anger over a crackdown on anti-police protesters.
Gunshots rang out and smoke rose from at least two fires in the commercial capital's affluent Ikoyi neighbourhood on Thursday, witnesses said. A fire broke out in the district's prison, the state government said. Video footage showed a blaze in a shopping mall in another part of Lagos.
Violence in Lagos, Africa's biggest city, has escalated since Wednesday as groups of young men and armed police clashed in some neighbourhoods following a shooting on Tuesday night in Lekki district.
Rights group Amnesty International said soldiers and police killed at least 12 protesters in Lekki and Alausa, another Lagos district. The army has denied soldiers were at the site of the shooting, where people had gathered in defiance of the curfew. 
Buhari will address the country in a broadcast on Thursday evening.
National Security Adviser Babagana Monguno, speaking to reporters in the capital Abuja after a meeting with Buhari, said the president had directed all security agencies to operate within ""the confines of legality"" and ""not to do anything that will aggravate the situation"".
""Mr. President is very concerned about this development and does not want a situation in which everything breaks down and results in anarchy, in lawlessness and people taking the law into their own hands,"" Monguno said. 
Monguno said Buhari was expected to ""come up with certain solutions"" in the coming hours. 
In addition to flashpoints in Lagos - where witnesses have reported seeing young men, some armed with machetes, walking in parts of Lagos - a number of southern states have imposed curfews to restore order. 
The unrest has become a political crisis for Buhari, a former military leader who came to power at the ballot box in 2015 and is commander-in-chief of the armed forces. 
Some protesters have said they feared a return to the dark days of military rule.
A Lagos state spokesman said the fire at Ikoyi prison was under control and armed officers were at the scene. He did not say how it started or comment on the reports of gunfire.

Video footage posted online and on local media showed a fire at the Circle shopping mall on the Lekki-Epe Expressway.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Hopes of ending nearly a month of bloodshed in the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh looked slim on Thursday as Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces fought new battles on the eve of talks in Washington.
Plans for U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to meet the foreign ministers of Azerbaijan and Armenia on Friday raised hopes this week that the two former Soviet republics would agree to end their deadliest fighting since the mid-1990s.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said he hoped that the United States would help Moscow broker a solution to the conflict.
""I very much hope that our American partners will act in unison with us and will help the settlement,"" Putin told a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club.
He added that he speaks to leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan several times a day by phone.
But those hopes have been dented by the continued heavy fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway territory that is inside Azerbaijan but controlled by ethnic Armenians, and by angry rhetoric from both sides.
Hundreds of people have been killed since fighting flared on Sept. 27, raising fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey and Russia and increasing concern about the security of pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry Azeri gas and oil to world markets.
Putin said on Thursday Moscow believed that nearly 5,000 people had been killed in fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces, with more than 2,000 dead on each side.
Nagorno-Karabakh said 874 of its military personnel had been killed since Sept. 27, in addition to 37 civilians. Azerbaijan says 63 Azeri civilians have been killed and 293 wounded, but has not disclosed its military casualties.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Wednesday he could see no diplomatic resolution of the long-running conflict at this stage.
In a transcript of comments to the Nikkei newspaper published on Thursday, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the prospects of reaching a peace settlement were ""very remote"".
Reiterating Azerbaijan's main condition for ending the fighting, Aliyev demanded promises that his country will be handed back control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which broke away as the Soviet Union collapsed. 
""So our main objective at these discussions will be to find out whether the Armenian leadership is ready to liberate our territories or not, and if ready, then when?"" he said.
Armenians regard Nagorno-Karabakh as part of their historic homeland and accuse Azerbaijan of making a land grab in the recent fighting.
Aliyev said he would not rule out ""cultural autonomy"" for ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh but not say what he meant by this.
MORE FIGHTING
Russia has brokered two ceasefires since Sept. 27 but neither has held. 
Azerbaijan reported fighting in several areas on Thursday, including territories near the line of contact that divides the sides. 
It also said Armenia had fired three ballistic missiles at three regions inside Azerbaijan but Armenia denied this.
Armenia reported fighting in several areas, and Nagorno-Karabakh officials said the town of Martuni and nearby villages in the enclave had been shelled.
Azeri forces, bolstered by weapons bought from Turkey, say they have made territorial gains in the latest fighting, including full control over the border with Iran, though Nagorno-Karabakh says its forces have repeatedly repulsed attacks.
Turkey has said it would send soldiers and provide military support for Azerbaijan if such a request were made by its ally. 
Putin said Russia disagreed with Turkey on Nagorno-Karabakh, but both countries needed to find a compromise. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan ""might seem tough, but is a flexible politician and reliable partner for Russia,"" he said.
Pompeo said on Wednesday he still hoped a diplomatic solution could be found as the United States, France and Russia press on with mediation efforts they have led for decades.

He said the ""right path forward is to cease the conflict, tell them to de-escalate, that every country should stay out"".

146,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 01:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Sudan premier ready for Israel ties if parliament approves - sources,"By Khaled Abdelaziz
KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is ready to proceed with normalizing relations with Israel once a yet-to-be-formed transitional parliament has approved the step, two Sudanese government sources told Reuters on Thursday.
The comments are the clearest sign that Hamdok, under pressure from the United States, is willing to contemplate Sudan establishing ties with former adversary Israel.
Such a move would not be imminent, because the parliament still needs to be established under a power-sharing deal between the military officers and civilians who have been running Sudan jointly since the overthrow of autocrat Omar al-Bashir in 2019.
It is unclear when the assembly will be formed.
There was no immediate response from the government to requests for comment.
Hamdok's technocratic government has so far rebuffed U.S. advances aimed at pushing Sudan to follow the lead of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both of which signed agreements to establish formal ties with Israel at the White House last month.
In contrast, military figures leading Sudan’s political transition have appeared open to normalising ties, although civilian groups including left-wing and Islamist politicians are more reluctant.
""The prime minister will proceed in the steps taken by Transitional Council Head Abdel Fattah al-Burhan to establish ties with Israel if the legislative council, after it is formed, approves the decision to normalise ties,"" a senior source said.
The subject is sensitive in Sudan, which used to be among the hardline Arab foes of Israel.
Khartoum’s caution reflects concerns that such a major foreign policy move at a time of deep economic crisis could upset the delicate balance between military and civilian factions, and even put the government at risk, two senior Sudanese government sources said.
But an agreement between Sudan and Israel may have edged closer on Monday when U.S. President Donald Trump signalled that Washington would remove Khartoum from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation which has hindered Sudan's ability to get debt relief.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a phone call with Hamdok on Thursday ""applauded his efforts to date to improve Sudan’s relationship with Israel and expressed hope that they would continue,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement.

The protesters will be demanding answers about why a police officer shot 19-year-old Marcellis Stinnette and his girlfriend Tafarra Williams (NYSE:WMB) during a traffic stop late on Tuesday night.
Clyde McLemore said he was expecting a few hundred people to gather at the site of the shooting around 12:00 p.m. CDT (1700 GMT) and march to the police station in Waukegan, a city in Lake County about 45 miles (72 km) north of Chicago.
""We are looking at least two to three hundred,"" McLemore, founder of the Lake County chapter of Black Lives Matter, told Reuters. ""We have people coming from everywhere.""
According to a Waukegan Police Department statement, a white male officer approached a car occupied by two people just before midnight on Tuesday and the car fled.
When a second officer approached the vehicle moments later, the car went into reverse, according to the statement, which identifies the second officer as a Hispanic male. 
No firearm was found in the vehicle, the statement says. 
""Officer #2 fired his semi-automatic pistol, in fear for his safety,"" the statement says, identifying the driver as a Black female in her 20s and the passenger as a Black male in his teens. ""The driver and passenger were both struck by gunfire.""
McLemore confirmed their names.
The Waukegan Police Department said it has asked the Illinois State Police to investigate the shooting. The state police declined to comment.
McLemore said he wants the police officers involved to be prosecuted and called on the Department of Justice to step in and investigate the shooting, rather than the state police.
""We are tired of the police investigating the police.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Some teachers in France say they censor themselves to avoid confrontation with pupils and parents over religion and free speech, a problem brutally exposed when a teacher was beheaded after showing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in class.
History teacher Samuel Paty had shown the images mocking the Prophet in a lesson on freedom of expression, pictures first published by the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2006 that led to a deadly Islamist attack on its offices.
Paty's murder earlier this week has caused outrage in a country where the separation of church and state is fiercely defended by many. It has also exposed divisions in a society where a vocal minority in the Muslim community feels its beliefs are not respected.
Those fault lines, if anything, have got stronger over the last 10-20 years, said Delphine Girard, who started teaching in 2004, the year France banned the wearing of Islamic headscarves in schools.
""It's as if the students are the mouthpiece for thinking that does not come from them ... but from people who want to impose a religious identity that keeps getting a little stronger.""
The self-censorship takes many forms: from primary school teachers who chose not to read their class the tale of Three Little Pigs for fear of a backlash from some Muslim parents, to history teachers who said they avoid religious satire.
State secularism, or ""laicité"" is central to France's national identity and demands the separation of religion and public life. 
Schools have historically instilled the Republic's values in its citizens - a task some teachers say becomes ever harder as a minority of French Muslims and adherents of other faiths seek to express their religious identity.
""I self-censored a lot on issues around laicité,"" said a teacher previously employed at a Paris high school who asked for anonymity for fear of repercussions. ""I felt a real hatred for French values.""
Her experiences meant that while Paty's killing was devastating, it was not entirely a surprise. 
Recalling the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, she said she had avoided discussing it the next day with her students. 
""We held a minute's silence and I moved on. I was cowardly.""
SACRED VALUES
Secularism was enshrined in French law in 1905 after anti-clerical struggles with the Catholic Church. In recent decades, the desire among some French Muslims to express their religious identity has dominated the debate around balancing religious and secular needs.
Some teachers said that in the banlieues - the deprived suburbs that ring French cities - the list of delicate topics on the curriculum was constantly expanding and blamed families and local communities for influencing youngsters.
The government said it knew there was a problem with self-censorship among teachers, spokesman Gabriel Attal told reporters this week. 
France's national curriculum sets out the framework and directs teachers towards websites that suggest teaching materials and lesson plans. For lessons on freedom of expression for 13-year-olds, the same class Paty had taught, the Charlie Hebdo cartoons are a common suggestion.
""Caricatures are not Mein Kampf,"" said history teacher Maxime Reppert, referring to Hitler's Nazi manifesto. ""They are not a call to incite hate."" 
In an emotional tribute to Paty on Wednesday, President Emmanuel Macron said France would defend its values and protect its teachers. Pressure, abuse and ignorance had no place in France, he said.
Many teachers want more concrete reassurances from Macron and his government when the October half-term holiday ends.
""Should I bring this up with my students when they return, with a caricature of the Prophet to hand,"" said an art teacher who withheld her name from publication. 
Silence, she continued, might be worse.
""Today I am afraid. But even more so of what could become of such horrors if we let this fear interfere in the debate.""

Britain, the United States and European Union organized the virtual conference along with the United Nations Refugee Agency, aiming to meet a target of $1 billion in funding for 2020, less than half of which had been raised.
The United States, the largest single donor, announced nearly $200 million in new funds while the EU pledged about about $113 million) and Britain about $60 million. A number of other countries also contributed.
""The international community has demonstrated its strong commitment to the humanitarian response with its announcement of funding today totalling $597 million,"" U.N High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said.
More than 730,000 Rohingya, members of a persecuted Muslim minority, fled Myanmar in 2017 for neighboring Bangladesh following a military crackdown the United Nations has said was carried out with genocidal intent. 
Myanmar denies the allegations, saying it was conducting legitimate security operations against insurgents who attacked police posts.
Close to a million Rohingya now live in crowded Bangladesh camps that comprise the world’s largest refugee settlement. 
Hundreds of thousands remain in Myanmar's Rakhine state, where they are widely regarded as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and are confined in camps and villages, mostly denied citizenship, free movement and access to healthcare.
Dozens have died this year while embarking on perilous journeys by boat to Malaysia seeking better lives.
UNHCR's Grandi said growing numbers undertaking sea voyages - 2,400 this year - showed the growing despair in the camps.
""We need...not to lose ground on the gains that we have achieved and to make further progress both for refugees and the host communities,"" he said.
Shahriar Alam, Bangladesh's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, said the country was tired of hosting so many refugees, saying the situation was ""untenable"".
""Bangladesh is not in a position to continue to take the burden anymore,"" he said, adding that Rohingya must return to Myanmar as soon as possible.
Bangladesh plans to move 100,000 refugees to Bhasan Char, a flood-prone island where it has built housing, he said.
Attempts to kickstart repatriation have ended in failure, amid refugee protests. Many Rohingya say they will not return without a guarantee of basic rights. OLUSWORLD Reuters US Online Report World News 20201022T161000+0000"

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Mexico's Sinaloa, Jalisco Nueva Generacion, Zetas and Beltran Leyva drug cartels are the top buyers and traffickers of cocaine produced by criminal groups in Colombia, including current and former leftist rebels, according to a high-ranking Colombian security official.
The country at the northern tip of South America is one of the world's top producers of cocaine, largely consumed by customers in the United States and Europe.
Production provides key income to armed groups and fuels Colombia's five-decade-long internal conflict, which has killed more than 260,000 people.
Rebel group the National Liberation Army (ELN), ex-members of the FARC guerrillas who reject a 2016 peace deal and criminal gangs formed by right-wing former paramilitaries are all involved in trafficking.
""The Mexicans are the principal buyers of the supply of coca produced in Colombia,"" Rafael Guarin, presidential adviser for security told Reuters on Wednesday, referring to cocaine's base ingredient. ""Fundamentally, the Mexicans take charge of the buying, trafficking and sale in the United States.""
The cartels field ""emissaries and negotiators and also individuals who verify the quality of the narcotics,"" Guarin said, adding that drugs are moved through Venezuela, via the Pacific or northern Ecuador to reach the United States.
Emissaries sometimes finance coca planting, he added. 
The Sinaloa Cartel is the most active, Guarin said, and has alliances with the ELN, former FARC members and the Clan del Golfo crime gang.
The Zetas have connections to the Los Pelusos crime gang, which controls trafficking along Colombia's border with Venezuela, while Jalisco Nueva Generacion buys from a group in Buenaventura on the Pacific.
The Beltran Leyva cartel works with a gang in the southwestern province of Putumayo that also has connections to the Sinaloa cartel.
Colombia had some 154,000 hectares (380,000 acres) of coca last year, according to the United Nations.
It faces unrelenting pressure from the United States to reduce production, with President Ivan Duque pledging to eradicate some 130,000 hectares this year. 

""It's a very pragmatic relationship for the cartels, which buy from whoever will sell,"" Guarin said.

Addressing a meeting of the Valdai Discussion Club, Putin suggested that the role of the United States had waned, along with that of Britain and France, while Beijing and Berlin - in terms of political and economic weight -- were heading for superpower status. 
If Washington was not prepared to discuss global problems with Moscow, Russia stood ready to have that discussion with other nations, said Putin, who was speaking via video link. 
He said Washington could no longer lay claim to exceptionalism and questioned why it would want to. 
Ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, Putin said he hoped the new administration would be ready for dialogue on security and nuclear arms control. 
Washington last week rejected a Russian proposal for an unconditional one-year extension of the last treaty limiting U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear weapons deployment, calling the suggestion ""a non-starter.""
The New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) accord, signed in 2010 is due to expire in February. It restricts the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads that Russia and the United States can deploy as well as the missiles and bombers that carry them.

Despite their differences, Moscow and Washington appear to be moving closer to a deal on New START.

The 20-year-old man had been categorised in 2017 as likely to pose a threat to public safety, said Saxony state's head of police, Petric Kleine. 
Some 600 suspected Islamists are in this category in Germany, according to authorities. 
The Syrian was released from prison, where he had served more than two years for recruiting members to a terrorist organisation, only days before the attack. 
In an assessment months before, authorities had said it was highly likely the man would commit more crimes once released, Kleine added.
He was under observation on the day of the attack and the two preceding days, said the head of the Saxony branch of the domestic intelligence agency, Dirk-Martin Christian. 
He added that people just released from prison were not normally monitored 24 hours a day, but declined to give more details.
Investigators accuse the Syrian of attacking two tourists, one aged 53 and the other aged 55, from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia with a knife. Both were severely injured and the 55-year-old later died.
The Syrian had come to Germany in October 2015 at the peak of the migrant crisis and was later granted refugee status, police said. He lost this status because of his criminal record in 2019, but could not be deported due to the civil war in his home country.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled on Thursday that abortion due to foetal defects was unconstitutional, banning the most common of the few legal grounds for pregnancy termination in the predominantly Catholic country.
After the ruling goes into effect, abortion will be only be permissible in Poland in the case of rape, incest or a threat to the mother's health and life, which make up only around 2% of legal terminations conducted in recent years.
""(A provision which) legalises eugenic practices in the field of the right to life of an unborn child and makes the right to life of an unborn child dependent on his or her health,... is inconsistent ... with the constitution,"" said Julia Przylebska, Head of the Constitutional Tribunal. 
Women's rights groups reacted with dismay. 
""The worst-case scenario that could have come true has come true. It is a devastating sentence that will destroy the lives of many women and many families,"" said lawyer Kamila Ferenc who works with an NGO helping women denied abortion. 
""It will especially force the poor to give birth to children against their will. Either they have no chance of surviving, or they have no chance of an independent existence, or they will die shortly after giving birth.""
Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, Dunja Mijatovic called it a ""sad day for women's rights.""
""Removing the basis for almost all legal abortions in Poland amounts to a ban and violates human rights. Today's ruling of the Constitutional Court means underground/abroad abortions for those who can afford and even greater ordeal for all others."" 
Conservative values have played a growing role in public life in Poland since the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) came into power five years ago on a promise to defend what it sees as the nation's traditional, Catholic character.
Curbing access to abortion has been a long-standing ambition of the party, but it has stepped back from previous legislative proposals amid widespread public backlash.
Critics say the Constitutional Tribunal may have acted on the party's behalf. While the Tribunal is nominally independent, most of its judges have been appointed by PiS. The party denies trying to influence the court.
Abortion rights activists say access to the procedure was often declined in recent years in Poland even in cases when it would be legal.
Many doctors in Poland, which already had some of the strictest abortion rules in Europe, exercise their legal right to refuse to terminate pregnancies on religious grounds. Some say they are pressured into doing so by their superiors.

Maria Kurowska, an MP with United Poland, a party in the ruling coalition with Law and Justice said: ""We are glad with what the Constitutional Tribunal ruled because one can not kill a child for being sick. This is not a foetus, it is a child.""

BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted on Thursday to delay an election to await a constitutional reform promoted by acting president Sadyr Japarov, a move that boosts his chances of staying on as full-time leader.
The Central Asian nation, which borders China and is closely allied with Russia, was rocked by protests this month against the results of an Oct. 4 parliamentary election, which awarded most seats to two establishment parties.
Protesters seized government buildings and forced the cabinet and President Sooronbai Jeenbekov to resign and the vote to be annulled. They also released nationalist politician Japarov from prison, allowing him first to be elected prime minister then to take over as acting president.
Japarov has sought to change the national charter, which bars him from becoming full-time president, but it had been unclear how he would manage to call a constitutional referendum while also overseeing a re-run of the parliamentary election.
However, parliament agreed on Thursday to delay the new parliamentary election - scheduled for Dec. 20 - until after the proposed constitutional reform.
Thursday's vote showed Japarov had enough supporters in the legislature to trigger a referendum that could delay or change the rules for the presidential poll due by mid-January. 
The exact contents of the proposed reform package are yet to be made public. Parliament also voted on Thursday to make the next parliamentary election more open by lowering the threshold for parties to gain seats to 3% of the vote from 7%.

As one of his first moves after assuming the interim presidency, Japarov reassured Moscow this month that it would remain Bishkek's No.1 partner and there would be no changes to the terms on which Russia maintains a military base in the former Soviet republic of 6.5 million people.

BERLIN/MADRID (Reuters) - Germany warned on Thursday against travel to neighbouring countries, Belgium's foreign minister went into intensive care and Spain said COVID-19 was ""out of control"" in many areas, as governments across Europe took action to fight the pandemic.
As German authorities reported more than 10,000 daily cases for the first time, Berlin issued travel warnings for Switzerland, Ireland, Poland, most of Austria and many Italian regions, including the capital Rome.
""The situation overall has become very serious,"" Lothar Wieler, of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's infectious diseases agency, said in Berlin, adding: ""We still have a chance to slow a further spread of the virus.""
After Europe appeared to have gained a measure of control over the epidemic following the dramatic lockdowns of March and April, a surge in cases over recent weeks has put the continent back at the heart of the crisis.
Hospitalisations and deaths across most of Europe have not yet reached the levels of the initial wave early this year, but authorities in many countries worry the situation could rapidly get worse.
More than 5.3 million people in Europe have contracted the disease and over 204,000 have died, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
India has had more than 7.7 million cases - the world's highest tally after the United States with 8.3 million. But elsewhere in Asia, from China to South Korea or New Zealand, draconian lockdowns and rigorous contact tracing have helped contain the disease.
Grappling with the enormous costs of the coronavirus, Europe's leaders are desperate to avoid a repeat of the blanket lockdowns that shut down their economies in the spring.
But as cases have surged, and health services have come under increasing pressure, they have been forced to impose and expand local restrictions aimed at reducing public gatherings to ever wider areas.
Underlining the reach of the disease, Belgian Foreign Minister Sophie Wilmes went into intensive care on Thursday. German Health Minister Jens Spahn tested positive a day earlier.
""OUT OF CONTROL""
""The second wave is a reality,"" Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa said on Thursday. ""In many areas of our country, the epidemic is out of control."" 
A number of Spanish regions are calling for localised curfews such as those implemented in France and Italy, where Lazio, the region around Rome, has joined Lombardy and Campania around Milan and Naples in imposing overnight curfews.
Amid the growing public alarm, Germany's statistics office noted that sales of toilet paper rose almost 90% last week from pre-crisis levels with almost equally sharp jumps in sales of disinfectants and soap.
Only Sweden, a European outlier which has relied largely on voluntary measures to promote social distancing, was an exception, declaring senior citizens no longer need to isolate themselves given lower COVID infection rates than in spring.
As the crisis has intensified, much of the public goodwill seen in the first phase of lockdowns has evaporated and central governments have engaged in angry spats with local authorities from Manchester to Madrid over issues ranging from health and welfare to transport and schools.
With winter coming, health services are looking ahead with apprehension as the wave of COVID patients coincides with the usual seasonal respiratory illnesses.

""We are already swamped,"" said Bruno Megarbane, head of intensive care at the Lariboisiere hospital in Paris. ""So, indeed, there is the fear that we will face a very difficult situation.""

TV footage released by Belarusian state showed Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR, smiling broadly as Lukashenko told him the two countries were facing a difficult situation and had few international allies.
Naryshkin's visit is likely to be seen as a show of support from Moscow for the Belarusian leader ahead of Monday when an opposition ultimatum for Lukashenko to step down, which he shows no sign of heeding, expires.
Lukashenko, who has faced over two months of protests over an Aug. 9 election victory protesters say was rigged, thanked Naryshkin for regularly sharing Russian intelligence information with Belarus. 
President Vladimir Putin has pledged to send in special Russian riot troops if necessary, and granted Lukashenko a loan, while Russian state TV specialists have flown in to help keep state TV functioning. 
Russia, which has long viewed Belarus as a friendly buffer state between itself and the NATO military alliance, has said it sees the problems facing Lukashenko as the result of unwanted external influence. 
Naryshkin told reporters after the talks that the two men had discussed closer military, economic and espionage ties between the two countries, which are already loosely united in a union state. 
The European Parliament on Thursday awarded its annual human rights prize, named after Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov, to the Belarusian opposition in a show of support for those protesting against Lukashenko's rule.

The parliament cited 10 opposition figures in its award statement, including the main opposition candidate Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and Nobel laureate author Svetlana Alexievich.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli delegation was accompanied by U.S. officials when it travelled to Khartoum on Wednesday for talks on a potential warming of relations with former adversary Sudan, a person briefed on the trip said on Thursday.
A U.S.-brokered deal normalising ties between Israel and Sudan could add another foreign-policy flourish to U.S. President Donald Trump's bid for re-election next month.
Top aides to Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing its new, U.S.-promoted relations with the Gulf states.
The Khartoum trip by Israeli representatives was first disclosed by Israeli public broadcaster Kan, which did not mention any U.S. involvement.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that Washington had begun the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and was also working ""diligently"" to get Khartoum to recognise Israel.
In an interview with Israel's Channel 13 News on Wednesday, Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen said he believed Israel was ""very close to normalising ties with Sudan"". 
A source, who was briefed about the Israeli visit, told Reuters that U.S. officials had escorted the delegates to Khartoum. The source, who could not be identified by name or nationality due to the sensitivity of the talks, gave no other details.
A second source confirmed the Israeli delegation’s trip, without commenting on any other officials being present.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office, which has been spearheading an Israeli outreach in the Gulf and Africa, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nor did the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.
Military figures leading Sudan's political transition have appeared open to normalising ties with Israel, but civilian groups including left-wing and Islamist politicians are more reluctant.
Sudan, which historically has been staunchly opposed to Israel, is 18 months into a political transition after autocrat Omar al-Bashir was forced from power following popular protests.

BEIRUT, (Reuters) - Lebanese veteran politician Saad al-Hariri was named prime minister for a fourth time on Thursday and pledged to form a new government that can tackle the country's worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war.
After his nomination, Hariri said he would quickly form a cabinet of specialists ""with a mission to enact the economic and financial reforms"" set out in a French plan to get foreign aid. 
But he faces major challenges to navigate Lebanon's sectarian politics to agree a cabinet, which must then fix a mounting list of woes: a banking crisis, currency crash, rising poverty and crippling state debts.
A new government will also have to contend with a COVID-19 surge and the fallout of the August explosion at Beirut port that killed nearly 200 people and caused billions of dollars of damage. 
The blast prompted the outgoing government, which succeeded Hariri's last administration, to quit.
At 50, Hariri has already served three terms since 2009 as premier - a post reserved for a Sunni in Lebanon's power-sharing system. His last cabinet was toppled almost exactly a year ago as protests gripped the country, furious at the ruling elite for decades of state graft and waste. 
Hariri, the sole candidate in Thursday's talks, was backed by a majority of parliamentarians. 
""I tell the Lebanese who are suffering from hardships to the point of despair that I am determined to work to stop the collapse that is threatening our economy, our society and security,"" he told reporters. 
""IN A LOOP""
Senior U.N. official Jan Kubis warned Lebanon's ""traditional political forces"" the country would not survive without an effective government to ward off chaos. ""Do not count on miracles, foreign elections or external donors – the rescue must start in Lebanon, by Lebanon,"" he tweeted.
The nomination of Hariri, long aligned with Western and Gulf states, follows weeks of political wrangling that has delayed a deal on a new government. He was backed by his own Future Movement, the Shi'ite Amal party, Druze politician Walid Jumblatt's party and other small blocs.
The heavily armed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, which took part in Hariri's last coalition cabinet, did not nominate anyone but said it would seek ""to maintain the positive climate."" 
Together with its allies, including Amal and Aoun's party, they hold a majority in parliament.
Lebanon's two main Christian blocs did not nominate Hariri. The Free Patriotic Movement, led by Aoun's son-in-law, said a veteran politician could not lead a technocrat government. 
Its rival the Lebanese Forces, the second biggest Christian bloc and a staunch Hezbollah opponent, also declined to name him.
Former colonial power France has tried rallying Lebanon's sectarian leaders but has been frustrated by the apparent lack of urgency or progress.
Hariri has presented himself as the ""natural candidate"" to build a cabinet that can revive the French roadmap, which lists long-neglected reforms and calls for resuming IMF talks.
Many in Beirut remained skeptical that any change would come. Even in the Tariq al-Jadida district where the Hariri family holds sway, Lebanese were weary after a year of turmoil had turned public uproar into despair. 
""Even if they bring a divine prime minister down from the sky, a government in Lebanon would not work, because fundamentally, there's no state,"" shop owner Adnan said.

In Beirut's Hamra street, Marwa Hodeib said she felt stuck in a loop. ""I think we might all leave the country and they'll still be here.""

VATICAN CITY/BEIJING (Reuters) - The Vatican and China on Thursday renewed an agreement on the appointment of bishops in China and the Vatican promised to push the communist government to allow more freedom of religion.
The accord gives the pope the final say over the appointment of Chinese bishops, and the Chinese government allows all of them, including those hailing from a state-backed Church, to recognise the pope's authority.
But conservative Catholics have accused the Vatican of selling out to Beijing and last month U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked the Vatican not to renew the deal. He set off a diplomatic incident by saying the Holy See was compromising its moral authority.
Beijing and the Vatican announced the two-year renewal in separate statements.
""It must be recognised that there are still many situations of great suffering. The Holy See is very aware of this, it acknowledges it, and will not fail to bring it to the attention of the Chinese government in order favour a more fruitful exercising of religious freedom,"" the Vatican said in the official newspaper Osservatore Romano.
It did not elaborate, but Church groups in Hong Kong have said Catholics and other Christians in China have faced restrictions such as not being allowed to bring their children to Mass.
The article said the accord was the result of a ""continuation of thought"" by Pope Francis' predecessors and that the draft ""had already been approved by Pope Benedict XVI"" before he retired in 2013.
This appeared to be addressed to conservative Catholics, many of whom continue to revere Benedict and distrust Pope Francis.
When Vatican's Secretary of State Cardinal Pio Parolin said at a conference this month that Benedict had approved the draft, Cardinal Joseph Zen, the former archbishop of Hong Kong and a strong opponent of the deal, accused Parolin of lying.
The article acknowledged that in the past two years only a few bishops had been appointed.
""Even if statistically this does not seem to be a great result, it is a good start,"" the article said.
TAIWAN TIES
Many believe it will eventually lead to diplomatic relations with Beijing, meaning that the Vatican would have to sever ties with Taiwan. 
But Parolin said on Wednesday that talk of diplomatic relations was premature and that the accord was strictly religious and not political.
""The two sides will continue to keep in close communication and consultation, and continue to push forward the process of improving relations,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in Beijing.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said that according to its information, the Vatican and China had not re-signed the agreement but ""reached a tacit understanding to extend the original agreement for another two years and maintain its experimental nature to evaluate the results"".
The Vatican has said numerous times that the agreement with China only deals with pastoral issues.
""Taiwan will continue to advance cooperation with the Holy See and the Catholic Church to jointly safeguard the core values of religious freedom and support those who are persecuted for their faith,"" the ministry said.
The Vatican is Taiwan's sole European ally. Only 15 countries have official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, mostly small and developing countries in Latin America and the Pacific.

165,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>",Pro-Sisi party set to lock in control as Egypt heads to polls,"CAIRO (Reuters) - As Egyptians prepare to vote for a new parliament, a party that champions the president seems assured of a sweeping victory. 
In the wake of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's broad crackdown on political dissent, Mostaqbal Watn, or Nation's Future, has emerged as the main force likely to carry Sisi's programme in a compliant parliament, and is expected by both voters and politicians to benefit from new electoral rules to lock in control of the chamber. 
The party has no formal link to Sisi but is flourishing at a time when the state's grip over politics and the media is at its tightest for decades.
Many in rural and poor areas refer to Nation's Future as ""the party of the president"". A music video produced by the party that has aired on state TV shows consumer goods including fridges and cookers being distributed to grateful citizens in packaging adorned with Sisi's image alongside the party logo.
Ahead of the vote, which begins on Saturday and lasts several weeks, the party's candidates have promised to help bring infrastructure and services to local areas.
""The Nation's Future Party is a party that naturally dominates on the ground,"" one candidate, Ramadan Abu Hassan, told a gathering of villagers near Beni Suef city, about 100km (60 miles) south of Cairo. ""For any disaster that happens, it will be by the citizen's side."" 
Reuters was unable to obtain an interview with Nation's Future. The state press centre did not respond to questions. 
Created in 2014, the year Sisi won his first term as president, Nation's Future held 57 seats in the outgoing parliament, which was dominated by a coalition of pro-Sisi parties.
More recently, in Egypt's newly recreated Senate, an advisory 300-member upper chamber with 200 elected members, it won nearly 75% of contested seats in elections in August.
A new electoral law means 50% of 568 contested parliamentary seats - up from 20% - will be elected from closed party lists. If the list wins a majority, everyone on it is elected and no candidates from competing lists win seats.
Critics say the change further shrinks the space for political competition.
The goal is ""to basically pretend that there is a political process surrounding Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, but what we really have is a one-man rule,"" said Hisham Kassem, a former newspaper publisher and political activist. ""It wasn't even this bad with (former president Hosni) Mubarak or with (former president Gamal Abdel) Nasser.""
APATHY
Seven prospective parliamentary candidates contacted by Reuters said they were required to make large donations to Nation's Future or a national fund set up by Sisi to get their names on the party's lists.
The deputy head of Nation's Future has said in televised comments that the party takes only voluntary donations, and denied using money to influence voters. 
As Sisi has consolidated control, interest in politics has dropped, with electoral turnout gradually declining.
A political coalition that Kassem joined, which aimed to reverse political apathy, fractured after two members were arrested last year. Kassem said any charges were unclear. State media said they were arrested on suspicion of links to a banned group and spreading false news. They are still jailed.
With Islamist and liberal opposition already sidelined, even some outwardly pro-Sisi candidates have found themselves excluded. 
One is 70-year-old Major General Tariq al-Mahdi, who was on the military council that took over when Mubarak was toppled in 2011, before serving as information minister and a regional governor. 
Speaking in a Cairo office adorned with medals and pictures from his military career, Mahdi said he tried to put forward parliamentary lists in reaction to the ""arrogance"" with which the Senate elections were organised, but was blocked by a court ruling, which he appealed.
He said he supports Sisi and state institutions but wanted to help ""transfer the pulse of the street into parliament"".
He criticized the use by some parties of handouts to mobilise support, without naming them. 
""I cannot enter the money contest or the (grocery) box contest, but I can get into the idea of choosing the best people available,"" Mahdi said.
Mohamed Abdelghany, a member of a small independent block in parliament who is standing for reelection, said economic pressures had made voters more susceptible to incentives, while the government had become more afraid of subversion and political opposition. 
Sisi has referred to plots against the state by unnamed enemies in recent public comments. Last month and in September 2019 there were small anti-Sisi protests, which led to hundreds of arrests.

""The best is to open the air vents for people and citizens to breathe and talk and hear another opinion, and this will put an end to any conspiracy of sabotage,"" said Abdelghany.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's centre-right opposition rejected a far-right proposal for a vote of no-confidence in the Socialist government on Thursday, a move which Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez seized on to propose a political deal over judicial reform.
The no-confidence motion over the minority leftist government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic was easily defeated when ultranationalist party Vox was the only party to back it. The motion was rejected by 298-52 votes.
The main opposition People's Party's decision to vote against it rather than abstain was seen as a gesture by PP leader Pablo Casado to distance his party from Vox and present himself as a more moderate figure.
""You are already part of Spain's problem and cannot be part of the solution that my party represents,"" Casado told Vox leader Santiago Abascal in a speech to parliament before the vote on the motion, which he denounced as a ""circus show"".
""PP does not want to be the party of lies, fear, rage and manipulation.""
Abascal said PP had committed ""a gigantic error"" by rejecting the motion. 
The prime minister responded to Casado's gesture by proposing a deal with the PP on a long-stalled judicial reform, which has held up the appointment of new judges to higher courts for two years.
""I announce here that on our behalf we will stop the clock of the reform of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) so we can reach an agreement with you ... for the sake of our democracy,"" Sanchez said.
Vox rose from obscurity to become the third largest group in parliament, and shares power with the PP in some regional and municipal governments. But the centre-right PP has been at pains to distance itself from the far right at the national level.
The central government has frequently clashed with regional authorities and with Casado over coronavirus measures, and some experts say those political quarrels have hampered the fight against the pandemic.

This week Spain became the first nation in Western Europe to pass 1 million total infections.

For weeks, doubts have swirled over Mexico's ability deliver its share of the water due to the United States under the accord as droughts in the north of the country sparked a row between the central government and the border state of Chihuahua.
Speaking at a regular news briefing, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Mexico had sealed a deal with the United States to fulfill its obligations, under which water would be drawn from international dams also used for human consumption.
Thanking U.S. President Donald Trump and his administration for showing ""solidarity"" over the issue, Lopez Obrador said the United States had agreed to help Mexico in the unlikely event of an emergency arising over water supply.
""We had a few difficulties to satisfy this accord, but they understood the special circumstances,"" Lopez Obrador said.
Farmers in Chihuahua had resisted the extraction of water from a major local dam due to the drought. They won support from the opposition-fronted state government, prompting a fractious stand-off with the Lopez Obrador administration.
Each side accused the other of politicizing the issue.
Meanwhile, U.S. farmers were pressing the Trump administration to make Mexico meet its obligations.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia can jail people for up to two years if they deliberately violate restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of COVID-19, the attorney general's office said, amid concern that citizens are becoming lax after a state of emergency was lifted.
The restrictions prohibit shaking hands, not wearing a mask in a public place, seating more than three people at a table or not keeping ""two adult steps"" - around six feet - apart . 
""Now it is as if COVID is no longer there, the public is not taking care,"" Health Minister Lia Tadesse tweeted on Thursday. ""This will cause a possible increase in the spread of the disease and might be a threat to the nation.”
Ethiopia, Africa's second-most populous nation and a regional powerhouse, declared a state of emergency in April to curb the spread of the pandemic. It was lifted in September.
The health ministry has recorded 91,118 COVID-19 cases, 1,384 deaths and 44,506 recoveries so far. 
The disease peaked there toward the end of August, but its difficult to know the true picture because testing has been also scaled back due to limited resources. At least 79 people died of COVID-19 in the past week, the health ministry said, but less than 2% of deaths are formally recorded. 
The new law permits fines and imprisonment for up to two years for anyone breaks the restrictions, the attorney general's office said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Wednesday.
Ethiopia also postponed its regional and parliamentary elections scheduled for August due to the outbreak. They are expected to be held next year. 
Africa has mostly not seen the huge wave of infections and deaths that have swept across Europe and the Americas. Experts say a much younger population, immediate measures to contain the virus and having a more rural population have all helped keep cases down. 
But many African leaders are urging vigilance, concerned that any surge in cases could overwhelm rickety public health systems.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Fourteen delivery workers in South Korea have died of overwork this year because they had to handle a sharply higher volume of packages due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the latest fatality this week, a union official said. 
A worker for CJ Logistics Corp collapsed while taking a short break late on Tuesday night and later died in hospital, according to an official at the union representing delivery workers.
The dead also included one worker who committed suicide after leaving a note about the harsh conditions he had toiled in, the official said.
One of the deaths was attributed to heart failure while the causes of death for the rest were only described as 'kwarosa' by the families, a Korean term used for sudden death due to heart failure or a stroke as a result of extreme hard work. 
CJ on Thursday issued a public apology over the deaths of five of its workers, vowing to improve conditions for its couriers. The country's top logistics firm with 20,000 delivery workers said it was discussing compensation with the families. 
""As the company's chief executive, I feel responsible for a series of deaths of couriers and deeply apologise for causing concerns to the people,"" CJ Logistics chief executive Park Keun-hee told a news conference.
The deaths triggered new public scrutiny on the complicated employment structure and whether the companies failed to ensure reasonable working conditions for the workers.
Earlier this week, President Moon Jae-in called for an overhaul of working conditions for delivery employees, saying they have suffered some of the worst hardships under the pandemic. 
Smaller delivery company Hanjin Transportation also made a public apology this week over the death of a courier and pledged to reduce the workload for its workers.
CJ said it would add more workers and ensure all couriers are signed up for industrial accident insurance.
But most contracts signed by the workers are with independent agents who act as middlemen, rather than with the company itself, leaving them outside the protection of labour law.
Yoon Sung-goo, an agent for CJ, told Reuters he had agreed to CJ's proposals to reduce workload of delivery workers and would discuss details. 

CJ Logistics is an affiliate of the country's food-to-retail conglomerate CJ Group.

Tens of thousands of people have marched through the streets of Belarus' capital Minsk every weekend since the election, despite police brutality and detentions, to denounce what they say is President Alexander Lukashenko's attempt to prolong his 26-year rule.
The EU, Britain, Canada and United States accuse Lukashenko of maintaining power by holding fraudulent elections, jailing opponents and muzzling independent media.

The authorities decreed a curfew on Wednesday night in response to the killings in Dabou, which Mayor Jean-Claude Niangne said were carried out by men armed with assault rifles and machetes.
Violence has broken out sporadically since August, when Ouattara announced his candidacy for a third term, a move his opponents say violates the constitution.
In all, more than 20 people have died in protests and clashes between rival supporters.
The events have stoked fears about a bigger slide into violence. A disputed election a decade ago led to a civil war that killed 3,000 people.
Niangne, a member of Ouattara's ruling party, said young men affiliated with the president's opponents took control of parts of Dabou earlier in the week, killing six people and wounding 40, before being pushed out on Wednesday by the police.
He said weapons belonging to a national lawmaker and former mayor of the town, who is an ally of exiled opposition leader Guillaume Soro, were used by the assailants.
The lawmaker, Ben Souk Sess, who is in exile in Mali, denied this and blamed the violence on youth gangs working for Niangne.
Ouattara's two main challengers in the election, former President Henri Konan Bedie and Pascal Affi N'Guessan, called on their supporters last week to boycott the electoral process and prevent it from going ahead.

They accuse the ruling party of manipulating the electoral process to ensure Ouattara's victory. Ouattara denies this and says he has the right to stand for re-election under a new constitution approved in 2016.

The visit comes amid an escalating U.S.-China rivalry that is being vigorously contested in Southeast Asia, especially in the South China Sea, which China claims as almost entirely its own territory. The claim is opposed by many regional states, including Indonesia.
Pompeo's visit comes after the U.S. made high-level approaches to Retno and Indonesia's defence minister Prabowo Subianto in late July and early August to grant landing and refuelling rights to its P-8 surveillance planes that monitor Chinese military activity in the resource-rich waterway.
The offer, first reported by Reuters, was rebuffed by Jokowi, according to four senior officials. Indonesia has long followed a neutral foreign policy and has never allowed its territory to be used as a staging ground for foreign military operations.
Pompeo declined to directly answer questions on the spy plane proposal, referring reporters to the Pentagon.
Spokespeople for the Pentagon, the Indonesian president, foreign minister and defence minister either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment. 
""There are commercial issues, security issues, and diplomatic issues where the United States has already improved the relationship between the countries,"" he said. ""But there's more that we can do.""

Pompeo's Jakarta visit will conclude a four-day trip that includes stops in India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

BRUSSELS/BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union wants the World Health Organization to become more transparent about how states report emerging health crises, a draft proposal on reforming the U.N. agency says, following criticism of China's initial handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The paper, drawn up by the German government after discussions with other member states, is the latest to outline the EU's months-long plans to address the WHO's shortcomings on funding, governance and legal powers. [nL8N2FL2RZ] [nL8N2F95QO]
The document, dated Oct. 19 and seen by Reuters, urges the WHO to adopt measures that would increase ""transparency on national compliance"" with International Health Regulations. These require WHO member states to quickly share information on health emergencies.
The United States has accused the WHO of being too close to China in the first phase of the pandemic, when Beijing was slow in sharing crucial information on the new coronavirus - which first appeared in the city of Wuhan.
President Donald Trump has said the United States will end its membership of the agency and stop its funding as a result.
The WHO has repeatedly dismissed the allegations. [nL8N2GX4L8] It did not respond to requests for comment on the EU proposal.
Asked about the document on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China wanted to ""actively participate"" in WHO reform, which he said should not serve the interests of any one country.
Reforms should ""better remove political interference"" from the WHO, increase its resources and ability to deal with global public health crises, and strengthen support for developing countries, he said in Beijing. 
The German government declined to comment on the content of the document as it was still a draft. 
The EU and its states are among the WHO's largest donors, and would become by far the top public contributors if the United States withdraws from the U.N. agency.
The EU draft will be discussed by EU health ministers at a video conference next week and is aimed to be the EU's common position ahead of the WHO assembly in mid-November, it said.
It reiterates EU support for the WHO and stresses the agency's central role in addressing global health challenges.
However, it lists insufficient transparency as the first of many challenges faced by the U.N. agency, as well as a lack of ""predictable and sustainable"" financing.
It also calls for ""a more effective and consistently applied reporting system by State Parties to the WHO Secretariat"".
That appears to be addressing criticisms that China and other countries have not shared information on the pandemic in a timely fashion.
The document says mechanisms to evaluate countries' compliance with reporting obligations should be strengthened and become periodic. 
The disparity between WHO member states' expectations and the organisation's capacities should be addressed as a priority, it said.
""WAKE-UP CALL""
Preparations for a review of the handling of the COVID-19 pandemic by the WHO and governments have been underway for months, and Germany has repeatedly urged EU member states to speed up that process so that a reform of the body could be discussed in earnest. [nL5N2EN6XI] [nL8N2DU49N]
EU health ministers have already broadly agreed a common position on reforms the WHO would need to undergo at a video conference they held in early October, according to a debrief of the meeting seen by Reuters.
Germany wanted a ""much more ambitious"" overhaul than many states would have accepted, the debrief says without elaborating.
At that meeting, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Gheybreyesus told EU ministers the COVID-19 pandemic ""should be seen as a wake-up call"" and said the agency was reviewing how its rules were applied by member states, according to the debrief.
The EU draft document, which was prepared after that meeting, also urges the WHO to revise its alerting methods in health emergencies, adopting a ""traffic light system"" that would convey more precisely the gravity of a crisis. [nL4N2B63KI]

BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China threatened on Thursday to retaliate against the latest U.S. arms sale to Chinese-claimed Taiwan, as the island welcomed the weapons package but said it was not looking to get into an arms race with Beijing.
The Trump administration has ramped up support for Taiwan through arms sales and visits by senior U.S officials, adding to tensions between Beijing and Washington, already heightened by disagreements over the South China Sea, Hong Kong, human rights and trade.
Beijing has applied increasing pressure on democratically-ruled Taiwan to accept China's sovereignty, including by flying fighter jets across the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer.
Responding the U.S. approval of a potential $1.8 billion arms sale to Taiwan, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news briefing that such sales should stop.
The sales ""seriously interfere with China's internal affairs, seriously damage China's sovereignty and security interests, send a seriously wrong signal to Taiwan independence forces, and severely damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" he said. 
""China will make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops,"" Zhao added.
He did not give details, but China has sanctioned U.S. companies in the past for selling weapons to Taiwan, though it is unclear what form they have taken.
The latest U.S. arms package includes sensors, missiles and artillery, and further congressional notifications are expected for drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles, made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, to serve as coastal defence cruise missiles.
In Taipei, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa thanked the United States and said the weapons were to help Taiwan improve their defensive capabilities to deal with the ""enemy threat and new situation"".
""This includes a credible combat capability and asymmetric warfare capabilities to strengthen our determination to defend ourselves,"" he added.
""This shows the importance attached by the United States to security in the Indo Pacific and Taiwan Strait. We will continue to consolidate our security partnership with the United States.""
Yen said they were not looking for confrontation.
""We will not engage in an arms race with the Chinese Communists. We will put forward requirements and build fully in accordance with the strategic concept of heavy deterrence, defending our position and defensive needs.""
Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by China's, which are expanding their capability with impressive new weapons like aircraft carriers and stealth fighters. 
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen has made defence modernisation a priority in the face of a rising Chinese threat, particularly ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any attack Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.
Washington, which, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei though it is its strongest global backer, has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so it can become a ""porcupine"", hard for China to attack.

Taiwan has been testing new surface-to-surface missiles which its media says have the ability to strike deep inside China, potentially giving the island the ability to attack far off Chinese air bases and command centres.

Hadi Jamal, a spokesman for an Afghan military unit confirmed the air strike on Wednesday evening but said it was ""not clear if the attack had accidentally killed civilians and children"" and an investigation had been launched. He did not elaborate on what kind of air attack had been carried out.
Taliban fighters had killed at least 37 government troops in attacks over the past 72 hours as the insurgents mounted an offensive to overrun Baharak district in Takhar, prompting government forces to call in air support, provincial officials said. 
Abdul Qayoom Hayrat, head of the provincial health department in Takhar said that ten of the dead were members of an Afghan special forces.
A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, confirmed the insurgents were engaged in fighting with government forces in Takhar. 
Afghanistan is suffering heightened levels of violence while 
talks are underway in Qatar that could help the United States find a way out of its longest war. 
The United States signed an agreement with the Taliban in February to promote a negotiated end to the 19-year-old conflict, and talks between the insurgents and the U.S.-backed government began more than a month ago, but have yet to yield any major breakthrough.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India is closing in on an agreement with the United States that will give it access to satellite data for better accuracy of missiles and drones, government and industry officials said, as it tries to narrow the gap with the powerful Chinese military.
The two sides are expected to announce the pact during the visit next week of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper for talks in New Delhi with Indian counterparts Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Rajnath Singh.
The United States, which antagonised Beijing this week by approving the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, has also been pushing for stronger security ties with India to help balance China's growing regional influence.
U.S. companies have sold India more than $21 billion of weapons since 2007 and Washington has been urging the Indian government to sign agreements allowing for sharing of sensitive information and encrypted communications for better use of the high-end military equipment.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's cabinet discussed the final draft of the Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement on Geospatial Cooperation on Wednesday, an Indian government source said.
An accord would provide India with access to a range of topographical, nautical and aeronautical data, a defence industry source said. 
It would also allow the United States to provide advanced navigational aids and avionics on U.S.-supplied aircraft to India, the defence source said.
""It is a foundational agreement, which the U.S. has signed with many of its partners for greater interoperability,"" the source said. 
India has traditionally been hesitant about getting drawn into a U.S.-led security alliance and antagonising China. But tensions have risen dramatically with China this summer, erupting into a clash between border troops in the western Himalayas.
This week New Delhi agreed to invite Australia into next month's naval exercises scheduled with the United States and Japan, disregarding concerns it would anger China, which sees such a grouping as directed against it.
""In tandem, the moves signal a new level of strategic convergence between the two democracies and a break from India's 'non-aligned' past,"" said Jeff Smith, a South Asia expert at the Heritage Foundation, about the proposed pact. 
Already there is robust intelligence sharing between U.S. and India, particularly about Chinese activity in the region, a second government official said. 
This includes information on PLA deployments on the Indian border and also Chinese maritime activity, including its deep water fishing fleets, which have caused friction between Beijing and other countries.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia said on Thursday it viewed U.S. allegations of forced labour in palm oil plantations as an ""old issue"" but it was willing to take appropriate action if needed.
Last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) banned the imports of palm products from FGV Holdings on suspicion of forced labour in its manufacturing process, and Malaysia said it anticipated another plantation firm could be banned as well.
In a statement on Thursday, Plantation Industries and Commodities Minister Mohd Khairuddin Aman Razali said the country had already halted the recruitment of new foreign workers.
""Therefore, the issue of forced labour raised and reported by the U.S Department of Labour is an old issue and has been taken action by the industry,"" he said.
""However, with the increasing incidents, MPIC is ready to consider appropriate action to address the issue,"" he said, using the ministry's acronym. 
The world's second largest palm producer has stopped the entry of new foreign workers from June until the end of the year as part of COVID-19 containment measures, but planters said it has exacerbated a long-standing labour shortage and impacted production. [L4N2FG14V]
Meanwhile, labour groups allege that thousands of foreign workers employed by the industry remain subject to forced labour conditions. 
Mohd Khairuddin said the government views the U.S. allegations seriously and the two countries need a fair platform to address the allegations that could affect bilateral trade. 
""Undoubtedly, the U.S. is an important market for Malaysian agricultural products which is one of the largest contributors to the country's export earnings,"" he said. 
Malaysia exported 14.1 billion ringgit ($3.40 billion) worth of agricultural commodities to the United States from January to August this year, he said.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand on Thursday rolled back an emergency decree aimed at ending months of protests against the government and monarchy that had only inflamed anger and brought tens of thousands of people onto Bangkok streets.
A government statement published in the official Royal Gazette said that as of 12 p.m. (0500 GMT) it would mean an end to measures that include bans on political gatherings of five or more people and publishing news that could affect security.
""The current violent situation that led to the announcement of the severe situation has eased and ended to a situation in which government officials and state agencies can enforce the regular laws,"" the statement said.
The only specific incident given for the ban was one in which Queen Suthida's convoy was jeered by protesters, but it came after protests that are the biggest challenge in years to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Protesters who have given Prayuth a three day deadline to quit said that withdrawing the measures was not enough.
""He's still seeking to stay in power while ignoring all the people's demands. The emergency decree shouldn't have been issued in the first place,"" Sirawith ""Ja New"" Seritiwat, one of the leaders, said:
Dozens of protesters - including many of the most high profile protest leaders - were arrested during the crackdown. 
Among them was Patsaravalee ""Mind"" Tanakitvibulpon, who was released on Thursday after being arrested a day earlier.Patsaravalee, 25, told reporters after being freed that the court had deemed the charges were not serious and that she still needed to attend classes and exams, so bail was granted without having to submit any guarantees.
Protesters say Prayuth rigged an election last year to keep hold of power he seized in a 2014 coup. He says the election was fair. Protesters accuse the monarchy of enabling years of military domination and want to curb the king's powers.

185,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 03:35AM ET</span>",South Korea finance minister loses home as housing policy comes back to haunt,"By Cynthia Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's finance minister, the architect of rules aimed at protecting tenants and slowing deposit increases, has himself been forced to look for a new home as landlords react to the rules by quickly replacing tenants so they can bump up deposits.
Hong Nam-ki is also faced with broadening his search as the average deposit where he lives 20 minutes from parliament has soared by a third since his housing rules took effect in July, with the irony of his predicament setting the internet alight.
""Worse comes to worst, he can camp by the Presidential Blue House, right?,"" one netizen asked on a real estate forum.
Seoul apartment prices have risen more than 50% since the left-leaning President Moon Jae-in inherited loosened mortgage rules from the previous administration three years ago.
To slow buy-to-rent demand, the Housing Lease Protection Act, led by Hong, capped increases of ""jeonse"" deposits at 5% and allowed tenants to extend standard two-year contracts for another two, unless landlords themselves move into the property.
Jeonse is a lump-sum returnable deposit paid instead of monthly rent. Landlords invest the deposit and pocket returns.
The Act led to an unprecedented shortage of jeonse housing nationwide as landlords sought to empty properties ahead of July implementation so they could increase deposits for new tenants, expecting not to be able to raise them again for four years.
In Hong's case, his lease ends in January at which time his landlord is set to move into the property, a realtor citing an industry database told Reuters, echoing local media reports.
""My fellow landlords, lets not rent out to Hong, let him suffer!"" wrote another netizen on the popular real estate forum. ""Lets make him feel what the government has done!""
Reuters could not immediately reach Hong's landlord for comment. A spokesman for Hong declined to comment.
For a comparable three-bedroom apartment in Hong's complex in up-market Mapo, western Seoul, the finance minister would now face deposits that have surged 32% in three months to 830 million won ($731,310), showed data from Naver Real Estate.
Hong, who has served the government for over 30 years, had a net worth of 1.06 billion won at December-end, government data showed.
SCHADENFREUDE
Hong is one of group of senior officials popularly blamed for failing to curb runaway home prices in Asia's fourth-largest economy even after more than 20 rounds of mortgage curbs and other steps during Moon's tenure. In that time, median Seoul apartment prices have risen more than 50%, KB Bank data showed.
His forced move opened a geyser of schadenfreude, with South Koreans struggling to find affordable housing mocking Hong for being a victim of his own making.
""Dear Hong, come and live in my place. I'll give you a good deal,"" said one netizen.
""Hong's so smart. Way to go bro. Keep playing the victim and demand a bigger job from Moon,"" said another.
Hong, who doubles as deputy prime minister for economic affairs, is himself a landlord but cannot move into either of his two properties. The tenant in his apartment in Uiwang, south of Seoul, has extended the lease by two years due to the new rules. The other property, in Sejong, is under construction.
At a regular parliament audit session in early October, Hong was asked by an opposition lawmaker if he had found a new home.
""I haven't found one yet,"" Hong said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Basing Japan's missile defence systems at sea may cost at least twice as much to complete as its now-abandoned plans for Aegis Ashore ground-based sites and delay it to 2028, a person with knowledge of the plans told Reuters. 
Fitted with powerful  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) radars, Japan's Aegis Ashore systems are meant to intercept missile strikes from North Korea and elsewhere. In June, defence minister Taro Kono suspended plans for two land sites, which would have cost about $2 billion to construct, citing the possibility that booster rockets could fall on local residents. 
Instead, he suggested installing the systems on sea platforms or ships. 
Defence ministry officials are considering several proposals, including putting Aegis on platforms resembling oil rigs, or on converted merchant ships or naval vessels. Kono's successor, Nobuo Kishi, has said he will make a decision on the future of Aegis Ashore by year end. 
Delays and higher costs could rekindle support for an onshore plan, as Japan's public finances are strained by debt exacerbated by massive coronavirus economic aid spending.
A defence ministry official said he was unaware of the new cost and time estimates for missile defence at sea. The land-based Aegis Ashore batteries were scheduled to be operational in 2025.
Some of those proposals could cost more than $4 billion each, not including interceptor missiles and operating expenses, which would exceed those of land stations because of fuel, maintenance and larger crews, said the person familiar with the matter, who has seen estimates being discussed by defence ministry officials.
The person declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the plans.
A destroyer has about 300 sailors, about 10 times more people than needed for a land site, according to Japan's defence ministry.
Armed with interceptor missiles designed to hit warheads in space, Aegis Ashore's Lockheed Martin SPY-7 radar has at least three times the range of older Aegis radars already on Japanese warships.
""We are here to support whatever Japan needs, and in our mind, there is no option that is off the table,"" said Tom Rowden, the vice president responsible for Lockheed's overseas Rotary and Mission System business, including Aegis Ashore in Japan. ""Our main focus here is to give Japan the capability that they need to be able to defend their country.""
In 2019, Japan listed China as its main security threat for the first time, pointing to Beijing's burgeoning defence spending and military manoeuvres. Japan has also said it is concerned about a resurgence in Russian activity around Japan.
Although Japan usually pays for big U.S.-built military projects through the U.S. government's Foreign Military Sales programme, it is buying SPY-7 directly from Lockheed and has paid half of the $300 million contract already. 
The possibility that Aegis Ashore will be based at sea has spurred Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp, which lost the contract to Lockheed in 2018, to promote its SPY-6 radar for Japan instead.

Defence ministry officials say they prefer the SPY-7 and are sticking with it. But some influential lawmakers from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, such as former deputy defence minister and deputy foreign affairs minister Masahisa Sato, favour SPY-6 because the U.S. Navy plans to use it on new Aegis Ashore destroyers.

187,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 22, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Analysis: China struggles to fill Trump's 'America First' leadership void,"By Tony Munroe
BEIJING (Reuters) - As Donald Trump has pulled the United States inward under his ""America First"" presidency, China has had only halting success at capitalising on a global leadership vacuum, presenting openings for a more internationalist Joe Biden administration if he wins next month's election.
Under Trump, Washington abandoned the Paris climate pact, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the UN Human Rights Council and UNESCO, and ditched the Iran nuclear deal. It has announced that it will withdraw from the World Health Organization (WHO) next July and has crippled the World Trade Organization by blocking appointments to its appeals panel.
Beijing, which accuses Washington of being ""addicted to quitting"", has struck a more globalist posture under President Xi Jinping: Chinese officials head four of the 15 UN agencies, and Beijing has boosted its WHO commitment by $2 billion.
As it has sought a seat at the table more befitting its status as the world's number-two economy, China has also formed its own multilateral institutions, including the Belt and Road Initiative and Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).
""China has been trying its best to take advantage of the U.S. retreat to advance its own goals,"" said Paul Haenle, director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing. ""Nevertheless, China has had difficulty translating its growing influence into foreign policy success,"" he said.
While China has all-but-quashed the spread of coronavirus and is a leader in vaccine efforts, its early mishandling of the outbreak that began in Wuhan has triggered a global backlash.
Beijing's clampdown on Hong Kong, its mass detention of Uighur Muslims, its island-building in the South China Sea and sabre-rattling towards Taiwan as well as more aggressive ""wolf warrior"" diplomacy, have also eroded sentiment towards China - even as Trump's policies have undermined U.S. standing.
China has struggled to leverage the exasperation of some U.S. allies towards Washington under Trump, with State Councillor Wang Yi, the government's top diplomat, facing pushback over Hong Kong and other issues during a recent five-country visit to Europe.
""Many see the U.S. retreat from global institutions under Trump as ceding fertile ground to China in this area, but what is striking is how much China's so-called 'wolf-warrior' diplomacy has undercut their ability to take advantage,"" said Susan Thornton, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia early in the Trump administration.
GLOBAL OPINION
A survey by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center found that unfavourable views towards China in advanced economies including the United States had soared over the past year.
In April, an internal Chinese report warned that Beijing faced a rising wave of hostility in the aftermath of the coronavirus, with global anti-China sentiment at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown, Reuters reported in May, citing people familiar with the matter.
If Biden wins, he is expected to maintain a tough stance on China but also to engage with allies and international bodies in a more traditional way. He has said he would keep the United States in the WHO and rejoin the Paris climate accord.
""On many issues of global governance, there is still much room for cooperation between the two countries,"" such as climate and COVID-19, said Jia Qingguo, a professor at Peking University School of International Studies who has advised China's government.
MIXED SUCCESS
Despite its growing economic and military might, China has been a sometimes-awkward multilateral leader, insisting that it is still a developing country and does not want to replace the United States.
Its diplomatic ties tend to be transactional, with a policy of non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries and a demand that it gets the same treatment, blasting what it calls Washington's ""long-arm jurisdiction.""
Its Belt & Road initiative has been criticised for a lack of transparency, environmental concerns, and the financial sustainability of projects, although the AIIB has been credited with adhering to global standards.
China's success at putting one of its own as head of France-based police coordination agency Interpol ended disastrously when the chief, Meng Hongwei, resigned after going missing in China, where he was sentenced to jail this year for graft.
""China's explicit ambitions to 'lead the reform of the global governance system' have not been clearly defined,"" said Julian Gewirtz, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""These statements are often swaddled in gauzy platitudes — and that means the rest of the world should judge China by its track record rather than its promises.""

188,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 10:18PM ET</span>","Thai Protesters Reject PM’s Olive Branch, Give Fresh Ultimatum","(Bloomberg) -- Thai protesters gave Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha three days to resign and meet other key demands that include reforming the monarchy, appearing to reject an olive branch he offered in a televised address.
Thousands of demonstrators on Wednesday night broke through police barricades and barbed wire to march toward Prayuth’s official office. They gathered near the building, known as Government House, shortly after the prime minister said his government is prepared to withdraw emergency rules banning large gatherings in the capital if the protest remain peaceful.
“We submitted the letter for Prayuth to resign, which is one of our three demands,” Free Youth, one of the main protest organizations, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday night. “If the government doesn’t give an answer within three days, the people will return with higher demands than before.”
Prayuth has struggled to stem the mounting street demonstrations, which have used Hong Kong-style pop-up rallies to avoid police and defy an emergency decree issued last week. The government has shown no signs of meeting the protester’s demands, which would upend the royalist elite that has maintained power throughout much of Thailand’s history, but it has also sought to avoid bloodshed that could further roil the economy.
“I will make the first move to de-escalate this situation,” Prayuth said in an address to the nation on Wednesday. “I am currently preparing to lift the state of severe emergency in Bangkok and will do so promptly if there are no violent incidents.”
The protests are underpinned by years of sluggish growth now exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has put the Thai economy on course for its worst performance ever by derailing the two main drivers: tourism and trade. The benchmark SET Index of stocks has lost 23% this year.
Thailand’s financial markets will take a wait-and-see approach to the protests and the government’s response, said Tim Leelahaphan, an economist at Standard Chartered (OTC:SCBFF) Bank Pcl in Bangkok.
“It remains to be seen if the emergency would hurt the government’s plan to gradually reopen tourism to foreign visitors from this month,” Leelahaphan said. “While the political situation has so far been under control, the lingering protests do not bode well for the Thai economic recovery.”
The demonstrations have shown no signs of letting up, and have even started to spread to other parts of Thailand. They have broken long-held taboos about publicly criticizing the royal family, with demands for the monarch to no longer endorse coups, provide transparency in how funds are spent, and get rid of laws that stifle discussion of the royal family.
Simultaneous rallies by pro-royalist groups in support of King Maha Vajiralongkorn also raised fears of clashes between the rival groups. Past protest movements in Thailand have ended in bloody crackdowns, most recently in 2010.
Prayuth, a former army chief who staged a coup in 2014, urged the protesters to trust the parliamentary process to address their grievances during a special session next week and said the government and the activists should “each take a step back” and “find solutions to the problems.” The king endorsed the session to be held from Oct. 26, according to a Royal Gazette notification Wednesday.
The youth-led protesters are also calling for the resignation of Prayuth’s government and a rewriting of the constitution, which was drafted by a military-appointed panel after the 2014 coup. The activists say the charter was instrumental in helping Prayuth retain power after the 2019 elections.
The prime minister said it was time to break the cycle of government leaders having to face mobs of opposing groups to prevent the country from becoming ungovernable and descending into chaos.
“The only sure way to achieve a sustainable, enduring resolution to the problems is to speak to each other, respect the due process of law, and then let the will of the people be resolved in parliament,” Prayuth said. “That is the only way.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior Trump administration envoy met secretly with a representative of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro last month to try to work out Maduro's peaceful exit from power, but no agreement was reached, three people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.
Richard Grenell, the former acting U.S. Director of National Intelligence and former ambassador to Germany, had discussions in Mexico City with Jorge Rodriguez, a close associate of Maduro, the sources said.
There was no immediate comment from the White House or State Department.
President Donald Trump has become increasingly frustrated over the failure of his policy of sanctions and diplomatic pressure to unseat Maduro, U.S. officials have said privately.
Maduro, a socialist whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries, has retained the support of Russia, China, Cuba and Iran. He is also backed by Venezuela's military.
As Trump seeks re-election on Nov. 3 trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls, he has sought foreign policy achievements that he can tout in the campaign's final phase. Grenell is also a senior Trump campaign adviser.
The sources gave conflicting views on whether the meeting was worthwhile but all agreed that no deal was struck or even significant progress made toward Maduro's exit.
One source said Maduro's representative showed some interest in finding a solution but signaled a desire to await the outcome of the U.S. election.
Another person familiar with the matter said arranging such talks may have sent a message of U.S. desperation that would only prompt Maduro to further entrench himself.
""They do want a solution, but they're waiting to see who the next president will be,"" the first source told Reuters. ""It was clear that they were trying to buy time.""
Grenell's meeting, first reported by Bloomberg News, followed earlier secret contacts between the Trump administration and Venezuelan officials, one of the sources said, without elaborating.
The meeting in Mexico's capital was not coordinated with the U.S. State Department, where Elliott Abrams serves as envoy on Venezuela and Iran, another of the sources said.
It was not known how the talks were arranged, but the source said no further meeting was scheduled.
Grenell, the special envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, was also involved in reaching a recent agreement between Serbia and Kosovo to work on improving economic ties.

But he is not known to have played a role before in Venezuela policy or other major Latin American issues.

The country's Ministry of Culture and Tourism made the announcement in a notice published on its website on Wednesday. 
China first suspended both domestic and outbound tours in January as part of stringent pandemic control measures to curb the spread of the virus which first emerged in the central city of Wuhan. However, since July it has allowed domestic tours to resume amid a sharp drop in the number of new local cases. 

Its curbs on outbound group tours have had a debilitating impact on the tourism industry in countries such as Thailand which have become heavily reliant on Chinese tourists over the years.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.
Reuters reported last week that the White House was moving forward with five separate sales of sophisticated military equipment to Taiwan with a total value of around $5 billion as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China and concerns rise about Beijing's intentions toward Taiwan.
Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.
The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, for an estimated $1.008 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.
Further congressional notifications are expected to follow Wednesday's including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles, made by Boeing, to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles. 
Sources have said the 100 cruise missile stations and 400 missiles would have a cost of about $2 billion.
Reuters was first to report in September that sales of major weapons systems to Taiwan were making their way through the U.S. export process.
The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for the defense of Taiwan.
The defense and foreign ministries in Taiwan welcomed the news, saying the weapons would help improve defensive capabilities.
""This arms sale shows that the United States attaches great importance to the strategic position of the Indo-Pacific region and the Taiwan Strait, and is actively assisting our country in strengthening our overall defense capabilities,"" Taiwan's Defense Ministry said. 
Beijing considers Taiwan a wayward province it has vowed to bring under control, by force if necessary. Washington considers it an important democratic outpost and is required by law to provide it with the means to defend itself.
The Chinese embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but China's foreign ministry said last week that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan severely damaged China's sovereignty and security interests. 
It urged Washington to cancel the planned sales and warned that China would ""make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops.""
The U.S. administration has stepped up pressure on Beijing in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.
Washington has been eager to see Taiwan bolster its defensive capabilities in the face of increasingly aggressive Chinese moves toward the island.
Last week, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said that while China probably was not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needed to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through non-military means, such as an embargo.

The government of President Nicolas Maduro in March created a strict quarantine that shuttered most businesses for months, though authorities have now allowed some economic activities during alternate weeks. The country has reported over 700 deaths and 87,000 infections from COVID-19.
The effects of the pandemic and restrictions have been much more pronounced in Venezuela than in other countries due to a lack of government support, said legislator Jose Guerra during a virtual news conference.
""In the case of Venezuela it is more acute... precisely because of the absence of complementary measures,"" said Guerra, of opposition party First Justice, which organized the survey. 
The survey found that 73.9% of people had reduced consumption of beef and chicken, while 82.3% said their income was insufficient to buy food for their family.
""If that happens in the capital, which (the government) has tried to exempt from all the problems... what is left of the rest of the country?"" said legislator Leonardo Regnault.
The survey consulted 950 people by telephone in the Capital District between Oct. 12 and Oct. 14 and had a margin of error of 5%, said Regnault.

The information ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian Senate late on Wednesday approved the nomination of Kassio Nunes to the Supreme Court, swiftly signing off on right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro's first nominee to the nation's top judicial body.
Nunes, a conservative and a former appeals court judge, was approved with 57 votes in favor, 10 opposed and one abstention. 
As a Catholic, Nunes' nomination came as a surprise after Bolsonaro earlier vowed to pick an evangelical Christian for the bench. 
But the president has promised to nominate an evangelical justice next year. Supreme Court Justice Marco Aurelio Mello will step down next year on reaching the legal limit of 75 years old, creating a vacancy.
During the nomination hearing, Nunes referenced God, prayers and psalms and said that his appointment to the Supreme Court was ""a true calling.""
""I have conviction that the work - the good fight - is a manifestation of God that leads everyone in all professional occupations,"" Nunes told a Senate committee on Wednesday, prior to his confirmation by the full chamber.
Nunes is 48 years old and will only be aged out of the court in 2047.

Several studies have shown a disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on ethnic minorities, and the British government in June promised further work to look into the causes of the disparities.
But the dynamics of whether certain groups are more likely to contract the virus to start with due to external factors, or are more susceptible to it once exposed, have been unclear.
The first quarterly report on COVID-19 health inequalities found that there was increased risk for Black and South Asian ethnic groups, adding that factors such as profession, deprivation and where people lived explained most of the increased risk, rather than genetics.
""The early work that I've seen doesn't suggest there's any genetic explanation for this,"" Dr Raghib Ali, a newly appointed government adviser on COVID and ethnicity, told reporters. 
Ali said that although being in an ethnic minority was a reasonable proxy for being in a higher-risk group at the start of the pandemic, public health measures should be targeted along more specific socioeconomic lines moving forward.
""Now we have more information as to what explains the increased risk ... there's no reason why a white bus driver should be treated differently from an Asian bus driver or a white doctor should be treated differently from an Asian doctor,"" he said. 
Although the report said most of the increased risk for ethnic minorities was readily explained by socioeconomic and geographical factors, it added that the factors did not fully explain the vulnerability of some ethnic groups, such as Black men. 
Ali also said that structural racism could not account for the different outcomes, as ethnic minorities in general had higher life-expectancy on average.

The powers will come into force from Jan. 1 when Britain's informal membership of the EU ends and it no longer has to abide by the bloc's rules on free movement. 
""For too long, EU rules have forced us to allow dangerous foreign criminals, who abuse our values and threaten our way of life, onto our streets,"" Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said.
""The UK will be safer thanks to firmer and fairer border controls where foreign criminals regardless of nationality will be subject to the same criminality rule.""
The changes, which will be laid before parliament on Thursday, will mean foreign criminals sentenced to at least one year in jail will be banned from entering Britain, while those with shorter sentences might also be barred depending on their individual cases.
Those who have not been given a jail term could also be refused entry if they are persistent offenders, or have a conviction of any kind in the previous 12 months and have not entered Britain before. 
The government said the rules, which would not apply to EU citizens covered by measures in the Brexit divorce deal, are part of measures designed to toughen Britain's borders. Controlling immigration was one of the key factors for Britons voting in 2016 in favour of leaving the bloc.
However, police and security officials have warned Britain would be less safe if no agreement on future ties with the EU can be agreed before Dec. 31 when the transition period ends.

The announcement also comes after London's Court of Appeal ruled earlier on Wednesday that it was unlawful for the government to forcibly deport migrants with as little as 72 hours notice.

Two other vessels, the Ataman and Cengiz Han along with Oruc Reis will continue work in an area southeast of the Greek island of Rhodes until Oct. 27, Turkey's Navy said in a maritime notice. The vessels had previously been scheduled to work until Oct. 22.
NATO members Turkey and Greece are at odds over conflicting claims to hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean and overlapping views on the extent of their continental shelves. Tensions flared in August when Ankara sent Oruc Reis to waters also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.
Ankara had withdrawn Oruc Reis from last month to ""allow for diplomacy"" before a European Union summit at which Cyprus sought sanctions against Turkey, but sent it back this month, prompting an angry rebuke from Greece, France and Germany.
After the summit the bloc said it would punish Turkey if it continued its operations in the region, in a move Ankara said further strained Turkey-EU ties. Turkey says its operations are within its continental shelf.
Earlier on Wednesday, Greece urged the EU to reconsider its customs union with Turkey in response to Ankara's exploration in the Mediterranean, deploring what it termed Turkey's ""imperial fantasies.""

197,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 04:22PM ET</span>",Armenian leader sees no quick diplomatic solution in Nagorno-Karabakh,"By Nvard Hovhannisyan and Nailia Bagirova
YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia's prime minister said on Wednesday he saw no possibility of a diplomatic solution at this stage in the conflict with Azerbaijan over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
His comments, after Azerbaijan's president said he believed the conflict could be solved militarily, increased doubts over a diplomatic initiative by major powers to bring peace to the South Caucasus region.
In the latest flare-up of the decades-old conflict, hundreds of people have been killed since Sept. 27 in clashes in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, which is part of Azerbaijan but populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians.
The violence has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, and increased concern about the security of pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry Azeri gas and oil to world markets.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday he had held separate talks with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan, who are expected to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Friday.
Pompeo said he hoped a diplomatic solution could be found.
""The right path forward is to cease the conflict, tell them to de-escalate, that every country should stay out - provide no fuel for this conflict, no weapons systems, no support - and it is at that point that a diplomatic solution, that would be acceptable to all, can potentially be achieved,"" he told reporters.
But hopes that Pompeo's direct involvement in mediation might lead to a breakthrough were dampened by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's remarks in an address to the nation.
""We have to realise that the Karabakh question, at least at this stage and for a very long time, cannot have a diplomatic solution,"" Pashinyan said.
""Everything that is diplomatically acceptable to the Armenian side...is not acceptable to Azerbaijan any more.""
Pashinyan had previously said that Armenia was ready for talks based on mutual concessions and a solution acceptable to all sides of the conflict.
Azerbaijan's main condition for ending the fighting is an Armenian withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh. Armenia rules this out, and accuses Azerbaijan of making a land grab.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said this month he believed there was a military solution to the conflict, while his aide Hikmet Hajiyev said on Wednesday that Azerbaijan did not expect any breakthrough from the planned talks in Washington.
FAILED CEASEFIRES
Azeri forces, bolstered in recent years by increased military spending and the purchase of weapons from close ally Turkey, say they have made territorial gains in the latest fighting. Nagorno-Karabakh says its forces have repulsed repeated attacks and that the situation is under control.
The fighting is the worst since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan as the Soviet Union broke up three decades ago, resulting in a war in which about 30,000 people were killed. 
In further diplomacy, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian flew to Brussels to meet leaders of the NATO military alliance and the European Union.
""We are deeply concerned with the violations of the ceasefire agreement that lead to new casualties,"" NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told a news conference after the meeting.
""It's important that the sides demonstrate restraint, observe the ceasefire regime and sit around the negotiation table."" 
Mediation has for years been led by Russia, France and the United States under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the continent's leading security and rights watchdog. 
But Azerbaijan says mediation has achieved nothing in three decades and wants Turkey involved in peacemaking.
Turkey said it would not hesitate to send soldiers and provide military support for Azerbaijan if such a request were made by Baku.
""There has not been such a request from our Azeri brothers yet, but we have said we will support them in any way they wish,"" Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay told CNN Turk.
He also criticised the OSCE's Minsk group of trying to keep the issue unresolved and supporting Armenia, both politically and militarily.
Russia has brokered two ceasefires since Sept. 27 but neither has held. There was no indication Lavrov had made any breakthrough in his talks with the Azeri and Armenian foreign ministers, Jeyhun Bayramov and Zohrab Mnatsakanyan.
In the latest fighting, both sides said clashes continued in several areas near the line of contact.
Nagorno-Karabakh said 834 of its military personnel had now been killed since Sept. 27, in addition to 37 civilians.

Azerbaijan says 61 Azeri civilians have been killed and 291 wounded, but has not disclosed its military casualties.

The attacks took place during opening hours on Oct. 3 but were only made public late on Tuesday by newspaper Der Tagespiegel and broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, which called them one of Germany's most serious attacks on artworks in decades.
A total of 63 objects were damaged, including Egyptian sarcophagi, stone sculptures, and 19th century paintings held at the Pergamon Museum, the Neues Museum and the Alte Nationalgalerie on Berlin's Museum Island.
Museum officials said ""first aid"" attempts to remove the spots left behind had been successful, though visible traces remained.
""Given our impression so far that the objects were chosen at random and that there is no obvious connection between them or a certain motivation, we believe the person acted alone,"" said Carsten Pfohl, a Berlin police investigator.
The museums, barely a stone's throw across the river from Chancellor Angela Merkel's own city centre flat, have been at the centre of lurid conspiracy theories in recent months in online communities of anti-mask and anti-social distancing truthers that have thrived during the coronavirus pandemic.
Attila Hildmann, a vegan celebrity chef who spreads conspiracy theories about the coronavirus to over 100,000 followers on the Telegram messaging service, wrote in August that the Pergamon, home to a reconstruction of a giant altar from the Ancient Greek city of Pergamon, contained the ""Throne of Satan"".

ABOARD HMS QUEEN ELIZABETH (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's national security adviser accused China on Wednesday of trying to steal COVID-19 vaccine research from the West, casting it as a malign rival that was seeking to monopolise every important industry of the 21st Century.
Trump identifies China as the United States’ main competitor, and has accused the Chinese Communist Party of taking advantage over trade and not telling the truth over the novel coronavirus outbreak, which he calls the “China plague”.
In a 20-minute broadside against China, Robert O’Brien told top British and U.S. military and intelligence officials that China was a predatory power that repressed its people and had sought to coerce both neighbours and Western powers.
""The CCP is seeking dominance in all domains and sectors... (and) plans to monopolise every industry that matters to the 21st century,"" O’Brien told the Atlantic Future Forum via a video link to Navy aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth.
""Most recently the PRC used cyber-enabled espionage to target companies developing Covid vaccines and treatments in Europe, the UK and the United States all the while touting the need for international cooperation,"" O’Brien said.
China, under President Xi Jinping, says the West - and Washington in particular - is gripped by anti-Chinese hysteria, colonial thinking and simply anger that China is now once again one of the world's top two economies.
China’s economic and military rise over the past 40 years is considered to be one of the most significant geopolitical events of recent times, alongside the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union which ended the Cold War.
O’Brien said the West had for decades granted China concessions, including membership of the World Trade Organization, believing it would open up economically and politically, while easing its own barriers against foreign companies.
""Sadly, those are promises that to this day it has not kept,"" said the 54-year-old former Los Angeles lawyer. “Instead the CCP leaders doubled down on their totalitarian approach and mercantilist, state-dominated economy.""
China in 1979 had an economy that was smaller than Italy’s, but after opening to foreign investment and introducing market reforms it has become the world’s second-largest economy.
It is now the global leader in a range of 21st Century technologies such as artificial intelligence, regenerative medicine and conductive polymers.
China's response to the novel coronavirus outbreak had, O’Brien said, ""erased any lingering doubts about its intentions."" 
He said China had co-opted international organizations and forced them to install Chinese telecommunicatiosn equipment in their facilities. He accused the Communist Party of blocking foreign companies while subsidising its own.
He said China’s flagship international project, the so-called Belt and Road initiative, involved offering impoverished nations “unsustainable loans” to build “white elephant” infrastructure projects using Chinese firms and labourers.

“These countries’ dependence on Chinese debt leaves their sovereignty eroded and with no choice but to hew to the party’s line on UN votes and … other issues,"" said O’Brien.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said on Wednesday the federal government will not buy a COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac, one day after the health minister said it would be included in the nation's immunization program.
The apparent about-face follows anti-China social media commentary by some of Bolsonaro's supporters and thrusts into the open a simmering debate over vaccine policy between the president and key governors, who have been exploring alternatives to the AstraZeneca (NYSE:AZN) vaccine the federal government has prioritized.
On Tuesday, Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said in a meeting with state governors that the ministry would buy the Sinovac vaccine to include in the immunization program, along with the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine. That inclusion would be contingent on approval by drug regulator Anvisa, he said.
Then on Wednesday, the Health Ministry announced that Pazuello has tested positive for the virus, making him the latest Brazilian official to do so. Bolsonaro tested positive earlier this year.
Sao Paulo state biomedical research center, the Butantan Institute, is testing the Sinovac vaccine, and Governor João Doria said he hopes to have regulatory approval by the end of the year to start vaccinating people in January.
But Bolsonaro said on Wednesday Pazuello had been misinterpreted during the meeting with Brazil's governors.
""For sure, we will not buy the Chinese vaccine,"" Bolsonaro said on social media, responding to a supporter who urged him not to buy the vaccine. 
Later in the morning, health ministry official Elcio Franco said all vaccines would be forced to go through federal health approval channels, but that the government had no interest in ""Chinese vaccines.""
Bolsonaro, a far-right leader who has drawn close to U.S. President Donald Trump, has made disparaging remarks about China in the past, even though it is Brazil's largest trade partner.
Sinovac did not immediately respond to request for comment.
'THE VACCINE IS WHAT IS GOING TO SAVE US'
The reversal surprised state governors, with Maranhao state Governor Flavio Dino saying there was ""general outrage."" Several other governors urged that vaccines be evaluated on science alone.
Butantan Institute director Dimas Covas told reporters that manufacturing of 46 million doses of the Sinovac vaccine would go ahead and be made available even if not included in the federal immunization program.
Sao Paulo governor Doria, who announced on Tuesday that the federal government had agreed to buy the doses of the Sinovac vaccine, argued in its favor on Wednesday.
""The vaccine is what is going to save us, save us all,"" he told reporters.
""It's not ideology, it's not politics, it's not an election that will save us. It's the vaccine,"" added Doria, who is viewed as a potential opponent for Bolsonaro in the 2022 presidential election. The president has minimized the gravity of the virus and criticized lockdowns that governors such as Doria have enforced. 
Brazil has been among the world's hardest hit nations by the pandemic, with more than 5 million infections and nearly 155,000 COVID-19 deaths, according health ministry statistics.
The inclusion of the vaccine, called CoronaVac, in the national vaccination program of a nation of 230 million people would be a major success for Sinovac in what could be one of the world's first immunization efforts against the coronavirus. 
The Brazilian government already has plans to purchase the AstraZeneca vaccine and produce it at its biomedical research center FioCruz in Rio de Janeiro.
On Wednesday, Anvisa said a volunteer involved in the trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine had died. 
But both Anvisa and Oxford said the trial would continue, with a source familiar with the matter telling Reuters that it would have been suspended had the volunteer been in the group that received the vaccine.
The Butantan Institute said on Monday that preliminary results from late-stage clinical trials of CoronaVac on 9,000 volunteers have proven that the two-dose Chinese vaccine is safe. Covas said efficacy data will not be released until trials are completed.

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis has said that same-sex couples should be protected by civil union laws in some of the clearest language he has used on the rights of gay people since his election seven years ago.
He made his comments in a new documentary ""Francesco"" by Oscar-nominated director Evgeny Afineevsky that was released on Wednesday.
""Homosexual people have a right to be in a family. They are children of God and have a right to a family. Nobody should be thrown out or be made miserable over it,"" he said.
""What we have to create is a civil union law. That way they are legally covered. I stood up for that,"" he said.
The pope appeared to be referring to when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires and opposed legislation to approve same-sex marriages but supported some kind of legal protection for the rights of gay couples.
The Catholic Church teaches that homosexual tendencies are not sinful but homosexual acts are. It teaches that homosexuals should be treated with dignity but is opposed to gay marriage.
Papal biographer Austen Ivereigh told Reuters that the pope's comments in the film were some of the clearest language the pontiff has used on the subject since his election in 2013.
""Pope Francis' clear and public support for same-sex civil unions marks a new stage in the church's relationship with LGBTQ people,"" said Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and author of ""Building a Bridge,"" a book about Catholic ministry to homosexuals.
""It shows his overall pastoral approach to LGBTQ people, including those who are Catholic, and sends a clear message to those bishops and Church leaders who have opposed such laws,"" Martin told Reuters.
'A VERY POSITIVE MOVE'
A spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who is a devout Catholic, described the pope's remarks as ""a very positive move."" 
""The Secretary-General has spoken out very forcefully against homophobia in favor of LGBTQ rights, that people should never be persecuted or discriminated against just for who they love,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
The pope, who early in his papacy made the now-famous ""Who am I to judge?"" remark about homosexuals trying to live a Christian life, spoke in a section of the film about Andrea Rubera, a gay man who with his partner adopted three children.
Rubera says in the film that he went to a morning Mass the pope said in his Vatican residence and gave him a letter explaining his situation. 
He told the pope that he and his partner wanted to bring the children up as Catholics in the local parish but did not want to cause any trauma for the children. It was not clear in which country Rubera lives.
Rubera said the pope telephoned him several days later, telling him he thought the letter was ""beautiful"" and urging the couple to introduce their children to the parish but to be ready for opposition.
""His message and his advice was really useful because we did exactly what he told us. It's the third year that they (the children) are on a spiritual path in the parish,"" Rubera says in the film.
""He didn't mention what was his opinion about my family so (I think) he is following the doctrine on this point but the attitude towards people has massively changed,"" he said.
In the United States, Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign, the country's largest LGBTQ civil rights organization, said in a statement on Wednesday: 

“Many members of the LGBTQ community have had difficulty engaging with places of worship because they have not been accepting of LGBTQ people. We are hopeful that this is another in a line of many actions toward full inclusion and acceptance for LGBTQ people in Catholicism, and in all faiths.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's minority Liberal government looked set to survive a confidence vote on Wednesday after a key opposition party said it would block any chance of an early election.
Legislators will vote later in the day on a motion from the Conservatives, Trudeau's main rivals, to set up a committee to probe whether Ottawa handed contracts to friends as it battled the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year.
Trudeau only won a minority of seats in the House of Commons in an election a year ago and needs the support of other legislators to survive. Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democrats, said his party would ensure Parliament kept working to help Canadians harmed by the pandemic.
""We will vote against an election,"" he told a news conference but did not specify whether his party would oppose the Conservative motion or abstain. 
Singh's commitment should mean Canadians will be spared a snap election as winter approaches and the country faces a worsening second wave of coronavirus.
The creation of committees is usually a low-key affair, but Trudeau said the Conservative push showed the party had lost confidence in him and put his political survival on the line.
""The Conservatives must know that they cannot paralyze a government that is totally concentrated on people's well-being,"" Trudeau earlier told French-language public broadcaster Radio-Canada, insisting he did not want an election.
The Liberals have more legislators than the combined forces of the Conservatives and the Bloc Quebecois, who will both vote against Trudeau. 
Parliamentarians, most of whom are attending remotely, are due to start voting at around 3:15 p.m. ET (1915 GMT) with the final result due at around 4:30 p.m.
More than 70% of Canadians say they do not want a snap election during the pandemic, according an EKOS Research poll. 
In polls, Canadians have given Trudeau's Liberals mostly good marks for handling COVID-19, but the country has reported an average of 2,401 new cases per day over the past week, and the second wave is clouding the economic outlook. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/3kj12VH)
Liberals would win 35% public support and the Conservatives 31% if a vote were held today, a result which could produce another minority Liberal government, said Frank Graves, president of polling company EKOS Research.
""Canadians have too many other things on their mind and too many things they think the government should be focusing on,"" Graves said by phone.
The Conservatives allege some of the more than C$200 billion ($152.5 billion) handed out in aid programs has been misspent.
In particular, they want to probe why the government awarded the contract to run a C$900 million student grant program to a charity that had paid Trudeau's mother and brother for speaking engagements in previous years.
Trudeau has already apologized for taking part in a cabinet decision to use the charity, which pulled out of the program.

The Dutch agricultural ministry will consult with experts to see what steps, if any, have to be taken to avoid poultry farms being infected, the ministry said in a statement.
Last month the European Union urged countries to step up surveillance against possible outbreaks of avian flu among wild and domestic birds.
The disease is highly contagious for birds, but risks of transmission to humans are considered low, according to EU health and food agencies.
The past few months have seen outbreaks among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan, which are on the autumn migration route for wild water birds heading to Europe.
Transmission to humans is rare, but has occurred in the past and can lead to death.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday the State Department was designating the U.S. operations of six more China-based media companies as foreign missions, a move he said was aimed at pushing back against communist propaganda.
Pompeo also told a State Department news conference the United States would launch a dialogue on China with the European Union on Friday and that on Sunday he would begin a trip to India, Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Indonesia.
He said he expected the meetings would include discussions about how ""free nations can work together to thwart threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party.""
The State Department named the newly designated publications as the Yicai Global, Jiefang Daily, the Xinmin Evening News, Social Sciences in China Press, the Beijing Review, and the Economic Daily. It brought to 15 the number of Chinese media outlets so designated this year.
It was the latest U.S. step to curb Chinese activity in the United States in the run-up to the Nov. 3 presidential election, in which President Donald Trump has made a tough approach to China a key foreign policy theme.
Pompeo said the move was part of efforts to push back against ""Chinese communist propaganda efforts"" in the United States. 
""They are also substantially owned, or effectively controlled by a foreign government,"" he said.
""We are not placing any restrictions on what these outlets can publish in the United States; we simply want to ensure that American people, consumers of information can differentiate between news written by a free press and propaganda distributed by the Chinese Communist Party itself. Not the same thing.""
The State Department has previously required Chinese media outlets to register as foreign missions and announced in March it was cutting the number of journalists allowed to work at U.S. offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160.
In response, China expelled about a dozen American correspondents with the New York Times, News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA)'s Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post.
The United States also said last month it would require senior Chinese diplomats to get State Department approval before visiting U.S. university campuses or holding cultural events with more than 50 people outside mission grounds.
China's embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Washington designated four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies in June and five in February. The designation requires the outlets to inform the U.S. State Department of their personnel rosters and real-estate holdings.

Over 40 U.S. government employees were affected by the incidents, which took place between late 2016 into 2018 and came to be known as the ""Havana syndrome."" 
Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Pompeo said ""significant U.S. government resources"" had been dedicated to solving the mystery but there was still no complete analysis, only theories, about how the incidents came to pass.
""We've done a lot of work to try and identify how this all took place and we continue to try and determine precisely the causation of this, while doing our best to make sure we're taking care of the health and safety of these people,"" Pompeo said.
Dozens of staff in Cuba in 2017 reported symptoms that included hearing loss, ringing in their ears, vertigo, headaches and fatigue, a pattern consistent with mild traumatic brain injury and initially described as the result of “sonic” or health attacks of some sort.

The State Department said in June 2018 that it had brought home diplomats from Guangzhou, China, over concern they were suffering similar symptoms. The incidents prompted the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to charge the diplomats were attacked by some sort of secret weapon.

The sinking of the ferry Estonia in the Baltic Sea was the deadliest peacetime shipwreck in European waters for centuries. An official investigation in 1997 concluded that the bow ramp of the ferry had failed during a storm, flooding the car deck and causing the vessel to roll over and sink.
The documentary, which aired on the Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Network in September included new underwater video images from the wreck site, showing previously undisclosed damage to the starboard side of the ferry.
That prompted Estonia's government to propose to Finland and Sweden that the investigation be reopened to try to determine whether the damage contributed to the sinking.
However, a preliminary examination report published on the Estonian government website concluded that the newly discovered damage was too small to have sunk the ship as quickly as it did. The hole probably appeared as the sinking ship hit rocks on sea bottom, it added.
""The findings cannot change the conclusions"" of the earlier investigation, said the new preliminary report, authored by four Estonian scientists and a senior adviser at Foreign Affairs Ministry.
The authors were shown the footage by the production company before the documentary was aired, but their report was published only this week. An Estonian government spokesman said the report was being released in the interest of transparency, and Estonia still wants the new investigation.
The Estonian-registered vessel lies in shallow Finnish territorial waters. Most of those killed were Swedes.

Developers late on Tuesday night opened a new restaurant, ""9 Pyramids Lounge"", which covers an area of 1,341 square meters and overlooks the Giza pyramids. There will also be a fleet of new environmentally-friendly buses to guide tourists around the plateau. 
""One of the problems always faced is that people say there are no special services for tourists, that there is no cafeteria, no restaurant, nothing that can be offered to visitors,"" said Mostafa Waziri, Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities. 
The new facilities are all easily taken part and reassembled so as to protect the antiquities and Waziri said the open-air restaurant offered ""a panorama view that cannot be matched anywhere in the world.""
Tourism accounts for up to 15% of Egypt's national output. However, officials have said previously the sector is losing around $1 billion each month after largely shutting down for several months from March due to the spread of coronavirus.
The changes at the plateau are part of wider efforts to develop key tourist sites in the country. Next year the Grand Egyptian Museum, which is set to be the world's largest archaeological museum, is due to open just beyond the Giza Pyramids. 
Egyptian business tycoon Naguib Sawiris, the plateau's main developer, said the 301 million Egyptian pound ($19.23 million)project is part of a greater plan to develop the UNESCO world heritage site and streamline tourists' experience.
""We will organise the salespeople,"" said Sawiris. ""We will not deprive them of their income but we will put them into suitable, nice places.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The head of Britain's GCHQ eavesdropping agency said on Wednesday it was seeking to engage more with business to harness top cyber talent behind programmes to accelerate world-class technology.
""We have a whole range of accelerator programmes...and we're looking to do much more of that,"" Jeremy Fleming told the Atlantic Future Forum. ""Defence becomes: how good are we at looking after our emerging technologies?
""We are trying to create ecosystems that bring in academia. They encompass start-ups, they bring venture capital, they bring business expertise and from time to time they also bring deep technical covert knowledge from GCHQ,"" Fleming said.
GCHQ is Britain’s main eavesdropping agency and has a close relationship with the U.S. National Security Agency as well as with the eavesdropping agencies of Australia, Canada and New Zealand in a consortium called “Five Eyes”.
Fleming, a former MI5 officer who has headed GCHQ since 2017, outlined a future heavily reliant on data and technology.
""We need to have a different debate with our publics, with our government, our parliament but also between allies on how we use that data and what privacy really means today,"" he said.
Fleming said his organisation was not diverse enough, with far too few people from ethnic minorities, adding, ""I'm interested in attracting a different set of minds.""
Asked what kept him awake at night, Fleming said one of his top concerns was that the security and defence services were able to organise themselves quickly enough to defend against the full range of modern security threats.
""I do worry that we are coming together quickly enough to produce the institutions, the global alliances that are going to take on the mantle from the (post-war) Bretton Woods system and really see us into this digital and technology age."" 
Fleming had a warning for adversaries.

""If you seek to use cyberspace as a place where you are going to...promote your values or try and degrade our interests, then we will be there to compete against you,"" he said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's parliament started debating on Wednesday a motion of no confidence in Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez launched by the far-right Vox party, with analysts and politicians expecting it to fail amid a growing power struggle on the right.
Among other accusations, Vox argues the minority leftist government has botched the handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Spain has the most cases in Western Europe, nearing 1 million, and is in its worst recession since the 1930s civil war. 
The vote is expected on Thursday, but Vox's 52 seats in the fragmented 350-seat lower house are well short of the 176 needed to bring down the coalition that only came to power in January, ending a long period of paralysis and repeat elections.
The main conservative opposition People's Party (PP), with 88 lawmakers, has rubbished Vox's motion and also criticized its anti-European rhetoric during the debate, increasing the likelihood that it will vote against. 
'CIRCUS SHOW'
""This is not a no confidence motion, this is a joke. Its uselessness makes a circus show out of it,"" PP Secretary-General Teodoro Garcia Egea told reporters, even though opinion polls show a majority of conservative voters back the motion.
That could benefit the anti-immigration, ultra-conservative Vox, already the third largest force in parliament.
""Voters on the right show broad support for the motion's political rationale regardless of the already known null consequences it will have,"" Andres Medina, head of polling and analytical firm Metroscopia, told state broadcaster RNE.
Vox leader Santiago Abascal promised to form an emergency government and call a new election if he wins the vote, labelling the current administration Spain's worst in at least 80 years and the world's worst at handling the pandemic. 

In a tongue-in-cheek response, Sanchez said the vote was doomed to failure. ""This could be a very helpful censure vote because it will be useful to see the majority of the Spanish people's representatives block their project of hatred, shock and fury,"" he told parliament.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Three constitutional court judges selected by Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi were sworn in on Wednesday after months of delay, granting him greater influence over lawmaking and election issues and riling his coalition partner.
The appointments mark a major victory for Tshisekedi over his long-serving predecessor Joseph Kabila, who has sought to maintain sway over the nine-judge court since leaving power in 2019. Each man now has four judges likely to back him, analysts said.
Tshisekedi and Kabila formed a coalition government following Democratic Republic of Congo's disputed 2018 election, but their partnership has soured.
The swearing in of the judges by parliament could deepen their rift, the analysts said, potentially damaging efforts to solve Congo's many security and economic problems and attract investment in its copper, cobalt and gold mines, oil fields and vast forests.
Tshisekedi flashed a smile and a v-sign for victory on entering parliament on Wednesday for a ceremony delayed by months of debate over the legality of the appointments.
""I acknowledge your swearing in and congratulate you,"" he told the judges after they took their oaths.
Kabila's FCC political alliance, which controls the senate and national assembly, said the appointments were unconstitutional and boycotted the ceremony.
It argues that Tshisekedi made space on the court by forcing out one judge before the end of his term and promoting two others to another court against their will, charges the president denies.
""The appointments and replacements of the judges concerned ... are null and of no effect,"" the FCC said in a statement on Tuesday.
Greater control of the court could shield the president from impeachment and strengthen his hand when fighting off political challenges from the FCC-controlled legislature. 
It could also increase political tensions, although there is no sign yet of a total breakdown in the Tshisekedi-Kabila relationship. Some analysts say it is in both parties' interest to keep their alliance afloat ahead of the 2023 presidential elections.
""Immediately it creates more paralysis and we will get short term tensions between the parties,"" said Vincent Rouget, an analyst from London-based security consultancy Control Risks. 
Civil society groups have spoken out against political appointments in the judiciary, regardless of who is in charge. Some said they had hoped the age of overwhelming presidential influence was on the wane when Kabila's 18-year rule ended. 
""Replacing judges under the orders of Kabila by judges under the orders of Tshisekedi does not advance the rule of law,"" LUCHA, a youth activist group, said on Twitter.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France, one of Europe's biggest military powers, will reach a NATO spending goal of 2% sought by the United States this year, the alliance said on Wednesday, but most member states still lag behind in a continual sore point for Washington.
France is estimated to spend 2.1% of its economic output on defence in 2020, NATO said in a report, attaining the goal set by NATO leaders at a 2014 summit after Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said 2020 would be the sixth consecutive year of increased defence spending by European allies and Canada, up by 4.3% in real terms.
""We expect this trend to continue,"" he told reporters.
While France was joined by Norway for the first time in reaching 2%, despite the coronavirus crisis that has sapped economies, only 10 of the 30 allies will hit the target this year, including the United States, the NATO report said.
Italy, Spain and Belgium are among the lowest spenders.
The issue of defence spending is likely to remain an issue for the United States whoever wins the presidential election on Nov. 3, diplomats, officials and experts say.
European reluctance to spend more on defence, despite several countries hosting U.S. troops in Europe, has been a major grievance of President Donald Trump, who has openly questioned NATO's continued value to Washington. 
That has eroded faith in a pillar of post-war European security - that U.S. forces would defend alliance members against any Russian aggression. European allies hope a victory for Democratic candidate Joe Biden, a former vice president and strong supporter of Washington's traditional alliances, in the Nov. 3 election would restore confidence.
Only the United States, Britain, Greece, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, France, Norway and Romania will spend 2% or more in 2020, although Turkey, Bulgaria and Croatia are close.

Germany, Europe's biggest economy, has pledged to reach the NATO defence spending target by 2031.

The man was taken into custody late on Tuesday after investigators found traces linking him to the crime, Dresden police said in a statement.
Spiegel magazine reported that the suspect had been known as an Islamist radical to German authorities for years. He had been sentenced to more than two years in prison for incitement to a crime against the state and recruiting members for Islamic State in the past. 
The Syrian had come to Germany in 2015, at the peak of the migrant crisis, and been refused asylum, Spiegel said. It was unclear why he attacked his victims.
The victims, one aged 53 and the other 55, were German men from the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia on vacation in Dresden, according to the police. They were severely injured in the knife attack and the 55-year-old later died.
The arrest follows the beheading last week of a French teacher in a Paris suburb by a Chechen teenager for showing caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in class.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Thousands of union members, teachers, students and indigenous people are set to participate in a national strike in Colombia on Wednesday to protest the social and economic policies of President Ivan Duque, the killing of human rights activists and recent police violence.
The marches are the latest in a sporadic series of protests that began late last year, including September demonstrations against police brutality that led to 13 deaths.
The government has warned that crowds create a high risk of coronavirus infections. Colombia, which held more than five months of national lockdown to stem the virus, is set to top 1 million confirmed infections later this week.
Protesters are demanding a variety of government concessions, including a guaranteed income for those who lost their jobs because of coronavirus, more funding for health and education and steps to stop gender-based violence.
Protest leaders, including indigenous representatives, have also demanded a meeting with Duque to discuss the murders of activists, whose deaths the government attributes to criminal gangs and leftist rebels.
""We march jointly today for the negotiation of an emergency petition, which will include health, life, farmer production, the rights of women, of vulnerable populations,"" said union head Diogenes Orjuela during a Tuesday press event with indigenous leaders.
Some 10,000 indigenous people have arrived in Bogota this week, principally from the country's southwest, appealing for Duque to meet with them.
""Not even the pandemic will stop our movement,"" said Hermes Pete, head of the Regional Indigenous Council of Cauca (CRIC). ""There is no other path but to keep fighting.""
The marches' crowds could be ""tomorrow's outbreaks,"" Duque warned on his nightly television broadcast on Tuesday. 

Business leaders have called for protests to be suspended on fears they could damage nascent recovery after lockdown. The government estimates the economy will contract 5.5% this year.

The rallies came just days after President Donald Trump announced the United States would remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation that dates back to toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir and made it difficult for the transitional government to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing.
Calls for protests started days earlier, aiming to coincide with the anniversary of the overthrow of the country's first military regime in 1964, but wound down following Trump's announcement on Monday.
A Reuters witness said security forces had blocked off all the bridges connecting Khartoum, Bahari and Omdurman across the Blue and White Nile to prevent protesters from reaching the downtown area. 
Sudan has been in economic crisis for decades. The Sudanese pound has fallen to 220 to the dollar on the black market from 50 pounds two years ago, and the country has $60 billion in foreign debts. The crisis has accelerated since the overthrow of Islamist autocrat Bashir last year.
Some of Bashir's remaining supporters were expected to join Wednesday's protests to voice their opposition against the government but crowds largely gathered to call for justice for those killed in violence throughout the protests last year, the Reuters witness said.

After meeting Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades and Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi in Nicosia, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said they all agreed that Ankara is ""blatantly"" violating international law. 
""Turkey's leadership has fantasies of imperial behaviour with aggressive behaviour from Syria to Libya, Somalia to Cyprus, from the Aegean to the Caucus,"" he said.
The EU should also take note of Turkey's 'many violations' of the EU-Turkey customs union accord, Mitsotakis said.
""It is not possible for a state, a third state, a country which is a candidate for EU membership, to be exempt from (customs) duties, to reap the benefits of the common market but at the same time threaten the eastern borders of the European Union,"" he said.
Huge gas finds off Egypt and Israel in recent years have prompted a rush of Mediterranean states claiming waters for future hydrocarbons research, exposing deep and longstanding disagreements.
Tensions between NATO allies Turkey and Greece over maritime boundaries have rekindled since August, when Turkey dispatched a a seismic survey vessel to a disputed area. Ankara has also sent a drill ship to a position off the coast of ethnically split Cyprus. 
The attempt to stake rival claims has also brought other players into the fray; Turkey and Libya agreed on sea boundaries last year, a pact which Athens says infringes its continental shelf. 
This year Greece signed a deal outlining a maritime boundary with Egypt, infuriating Turkey which says it encroaches on its territory.
Greece, Egypt and Cyprus hold regular summits to further regional cooperation. Sisi described the tripartite cooperation mechanism as 'unique'. 
The accords defining maritime borders, Sisi said, reflected the will to benefit from 'wealth available, especially promising oil and gas reserves'.

""We agreed on the need to address those escalatory policies that destabilise the region, and the need to coordinate with international partners to take appropriate measures to maintain regional security requirements,"" Sisi said.

ROME (Reuters) - After tackling war in Syria, Oscar-nominated Evgeny Afineevsky wanted his next documentary to send a message of hope, so he chose as its subject the only world leader he believes capable of uniting humanity: Pope Francis. 
Afineevsky, a Russia-born Jew, depicts Francis as the great connector, and ""Francesco"", which premiered at the Rome Film Festival on Wednesday, places the pope at the heart of a narrative that casts a wide net over some of the world's most pressing problems.
""The main thread of this movie is more about us as human beings, who are creating disasters every day. And he (the pope) is the one who is connecting us through these threads,"" Afineevsky, now a U.S. citizen, said in an interview.
Using the coronavirus as a launch pad, the two-hour film starts with footage of a deserted, rain slicked St. Peter's Square on the evening of March 27, when Francis led a surreal and solitary prayer service for relief from the rapidly spreading pandemic.
It then cuts to empty streets the world over to drive home the pope's message that ""we are all in the same boat"".
Afineevsky was nominated for an Oscar in 2016 for ""Winter on Fire"", about the popular uprising in Ukraine. After ""Cries from Syria"", a subsequent film on the civil war there, ""brought me to the darkest side of humanity,"" he felt compelled to produce something uplifting.
""Just like Pope Francis brings attention to the horrible situation that we as humanity have created, I wanted to find hope, light and love and give this hope to people. Through his (the pope's) actions, I found this,"" he said.
""It's the story of us, and him helping us, understand these things.""
The film tackles other topical issues such as the growing rich-poor gap, racism, climate change, sexual abuse, migration, human trafficking, political polarisation and relations between Christians, Moslems and Jews.
The viewer sees them through the pope's eyes, his pronouncements, his writings, his Tweets, his trips, and newspaper headlines. It also features Afineevsky's interviews with Francis and appearances by Catholic Church experts, refugees, sex abuse victims, a homosexual couple, a Holocaust survivor, rabbis and Moslems.
Footage of bombs in Syria, migrant boats sinking in the Mediterranean, typhoons in the Philippines, melting ice caps, the separation of families at the U.S. Mexican border, a refugee camp in Greece, and blacks killed by police in the United States, are interspersed with papal comments.
While positive in its overall evaluation, the film avoids the overt hagiography of documentaries of Francis made by religious groups.
It highlights the fact that he completely misjudged the scale and severity of the Church's sexual abuse crisis, and that he later publicly recognised his mistake and apologised.

""It is beautiful to see a leader in his position, and just a humble human being, who is able to say: 'I am sorry, I am wrong,'"" Afineevsky said.

Campania, around Naples, escaped largely unscathed from Italy's first coronavirus wave in the spring, but the region has seen infections soar in recent weeks and local authorities have closed most schools until the end of October.
""Mothers called me and said the kids are in floods of tears, they want to go back to school, they don't understand why schools need to be stopped,"" said Pamela Buda, while holding a class for pupils sitting on public steps in central Naples.
Tonino Stornaiuolo yells out his lessons to pupils listening from their balconies and on the streets outside their homes.
""We do everything to respect the rules because I think this emergency in Italy is serious and real,"" Stornaiuolo said.
The government has so far avoided imposing nationwide curbs on schools, businesses and freedom of movement, but has urged regional authorities to draw up their own restrictions if needed.
Lombardy, where Milan is located, has already introduced a curfew from 11 p.m. to 5.00 a.m. to put a stop to late night gatherings. Campania has said it will follow suit. [nL8N2HB5ZV]

""I wanted to find a way in which the kids could see us and share time with us, at least as long as it is possible and until we know whether there will be another lockdown,"" Stornaiuolo added.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Rights groups want participants in a G20 women's meeting starting in Saudi Arabia on Wednesday to seek the release of detained female activists and call out the kingdom for its record on rights.
As current chair of the Group of 20 major economies, Riyadh has tried to improve its image after global outrage at the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Kashoggi at its Istanbul consulate.
""[Saudi] continues to violate basic women's human rights and muzzle voices that demand equality,"" Amnesty International said ahead of the two-day virtual W20 meeting. 
""Your participation in the W20 must not be used in Saudi Arabia's whitewashing of its international reputation while they continue to jail peaceful women activists."" 
Saudi authorities arrested at least a dozen female activists in 2018. Rights group say at least three faced abuses including solitary confinement, electric shocks, flogging and sexual assault.
Officials deny torture. Few charges have been made public, but those against some of the women include contacting foreign journalists, diplomats and rights groups.
Amnesty and Human Rights Watch urged participants to raise the women's cases. 
Event organisers stressed their independence. ""It is in no way affiliated with the government of Saudi Arabia, or any government or business interest,"" they said in a statement.
De facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has introduced reforms enabling women to drive, travel without permission and improve access to jobs.
But rights group say more is needed as some aspects of the male guardianship system remain intact and the government recognises filial disobedience as a crime.
There has been increasing pressure on officials to boycott Saudi-led G20 events, which have largely been hosted virtually this year due to COVID-19.

On Wednesday more than 40 U.S. Congress members asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to withdraw from a November summit. The European Union parliament on Oct. 8 passed a resolution urging the bloc to downgrade its participation.

228,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Congress presses DOJ to improve jail reporting system after Reuters report,"By Peter Eisler and Jason Szep
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional leaders are calling on the U.S. Department of Justice to strengthen its tracking of deaths in local jails following a Reuters investigation that identified thousands of inmate fatalities and spurred criticism from human rights groups.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said fixing the DOJ's broken system for tracking inmate deaths “is critical to identifying problems in particular jails that must be addressed.”
Reuters documented 7,571 deaths at more than 500 jails from 2008-2019; two-thirds of those inmates – close to 5,000 – were awaiting trial and had not been convicted of the charges they faced. Many remained jailed because they could not afford bail.
“This report underscores why it’s urgent that the U.S. radically transform its pretrial systems,” said Laura Pitter, deputy director of Human Rights Watch’s U.S. Program. “It is no longer enough to say things have to change – it is an actual emergency.”
Pitter called Reuters’ findings “shocking but not surprising,” given that pretrial detention has been examined before, including by Human Rights Watch. The difference, she said: “We didn’t have access to a lot of the data Reuters was able to gather.”

Unlike state and federal prisons, which hold convicted criminals, jails typically are locally run, usually by county sheriffs or municipal police departments, and designed for short stays while inmates await trial or serve relatively brief sentences for lesser crimes.
In 2000, Congress passed the Death in Custody Reporting Act, requiring the Department of Justice to collect inmate mortality data from each of the nation’s 3,000-plus local jails. The Justice Department never has released jail-by-jail data – only state and national figures. That leaves the public, local officials and government agencies with little ability to identify jails with extraordinary death rates.
Reuters filed more than 1,500 public records requests to compile inmate death data for all jails with average populations of 750 or more inmates, and the 10 largest jails in nearly every state. The data showed a 35% increase in death rates overall from 2010 to 2019, including an 8% rise since 2016, the last year for which the Justice Department’s national data is available. Behind the trend, Reuters identified a chronically underfunded jail system, subject to scant oversight, even as inmate populations have grown sicker and more damaged by mental illness and substance abuse.
U.S. Representative Bobby Scott, the Virginia Democrat who co-sponsored the 2000 reporting law, said the Justice Department “has just ignored” a 2014 update of the law that includes provisions to make jail-by-jail death data publicly available and restrict federal grant money when jails fail to report deaths.
Since the Reuters report, the Justice Department has declined repeated requests to discuss the status of the data collection program. Reuters also sought comment from two senior Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee; they did not respond.
In an email last month, a Justice spokesman said the department has begun gathering inmate death data under a revamped collection program, but there are “no plans” to resume publication of the mortality reports issued by Democratic and Republican administrations for two decades.
Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat from Connecticut, the Senate sponsor of the 2014 reporting law update, said Congress may need to consider restricting the Justice Department’s funding if the law is not fully implemented.
“The problem is becoming worse, not better, and the key to solving any problem is understanding it,” said Blumenthal, citing the Reuters finding that jail death rates have continued to rise.
The report “is a stark reminder of the tremendous toll that even short-term incarceration has on our society,” said Brandon Buskey, deputy director of the Criminal Law Reform Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. Understanding that toll requires quality data on deaths in custody, he added, and “we should be outraged that our federal government refuses to tell the public these basic facts.”

ROME (Reuters) - Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin said on Wednesday that a controversial deal with Beijing on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops in China would be renewed.
The deal, which was first signed two years ago and expires on Thursday, will be renewed for another two years, he said.
Asked by reporters on the sidelines of an event at a Rome university if it was a done deal, Parolin said: ""Yes, I can anticipate to you that all will go well ... I'll leave you with a positive signal.""
The accord with Beijing gives the pope final say over the appointment of Chinese bishops and the government allows all of them, including those hailing from a state-backed Church, to recognise the pope's authority.
The deal has been highly contested by the U.S. State Department and conservative Catholics, who say the Vatican has sold out to the communist government.
Parolin said the final decision to renew had been made ""in the last few days"" after final contacts with the Chinese side. The deal would be extended without any new signatures because it was still an provisional deal.
The official announcement is due on Thursday, he said.
Vatican officials say the agreement is not perfect but establishes a dialogue with Beijing after decades during which Chinese Catholics faithful to the pope were driven underground.
""We hope that the Church in China can rediscover, thanks to this accord, its unity and that through this unity it can become an instrument to spread the gospel in Chinese society and work to help see authentic development for all the country's people,"" Parolin said.
""As far as the accord is concerned, we are content. There are still many other problems but we never expected the accord to resolve all the problems,"" he said.
Many believe the accord will eventually lead to diplomatic relations with Beijing, meaning that the Vatican would have to sever ties with Taiwan. Parolin said talk of diplomatic relations was premature. 
""For now we are not talking about diplomatic relations,"" Parolin said. ""We are concentrated on the Church.""

""We are taking one step at a time in the effort to normalise the life of the Church,"" he said.

Messina Denaro, 58, considered the most powerful member of the Sicilian Cosa Nostra, has been on the run since 1993 and already faced a life sentence for his role in bomb attacks that year in Florence, Rome and Milan which killed 10 people.
A court in the Sicilian city of Caltanissetta ruled late on Tuesday, at the end of a trial that began three years ago, that Messina Denaro was also one of the masterminds behind the killing of Falcone and Borsellino a year earlier.
Falcone, his wife and three members of his police escort were killed on May 23, 1992 when their cars were blown up on the motorway as they drove to Palermo from the nearby airport.
Borsellino, along with five members of his escort, was killed two months later, blown up by a car bomb which exploded as Borsellino crossed a street in Palermo outside the house of his mother who he was going to visit.
Messina Denaro, from a small town near the western Sicilian city of Trapani, is believed by prosecutors to be solely or jointly responsible for numerous other murders in the 1990s.
In 1993 he helped organise the kidnapping of a 12-year-old boy, Giuseppe Di Matteo, in an attempt to dissuade his father from giving evidence against the mafia, prosecutors say. The boy was held in captivity for two years before he was strangled and his body dissolved in acid.

The power of the Sicilian mafia has been weakened by decades of prosecutions, and it is now overshadowed by the Calabrian 'ndrangheta, which has a central role in European drug trafficking. Notheleless, Cosa Nostra still weighs on daily life in Sicilia through activities such as loan-sharking, extortion and drug dealing.

But this year has been hard because of the pandemic. She usually works for Havana's recording studios and performance venues, which had to close down for many months during Cuba's coronavirus lockdown.
""It's been very difficult because there's virtually been no work,"" said Villareal, a wiry woman with silver shoulder-length hair who uses a white walking stick. ""And I've also had to look after myself because you never know where there's coronavirus.""
Born into a family with a genetic predisposition toward visual impairment, only one of her three siblings still lives. She has a son and granddaughter in the city of Matanzas, about 62 miles (100 km) east of Havana, and visits there once a year. 
""I live on my own so it's been a bit difficult to be looking after the house while also going out working and looking for stuff,"" said Villareal, who retired from working for state cultural institutions in 2012 but still works privately to supplement her monthly pension equivalent to just $13.
Shortages of goods in Communist-run Cuba have worsened as the pandemic, which demolished tourism and hardened U.S. sanctions, further squeezed the struggling centrally planned economy.
Cuba's tough lockdown, including the suspension of public transportation, has enabled it to contain its coronavirus outbreak but made it even harder for Cubans like Villareal to make ends meet and hunt for scarce goods. 
Her disability and highly specialized profession – on the sidelines of a music world hard hit by the ban on public gatherings – have made it particularly tough for her to get by.
""But you get on with it because you always end up overcoming difficulties,"" she said.
Now at least, work is picking up again slightly for Villareal, after the government announced this month Cuba needed to adapt to a ""new normality."" Public transportation and most activities would resume, it said, albeit with precautions to prevent the spread of coronavirus, like reduced capacity in concert halls.
""It's a work worthy of a lot of respect,"" said Cuban singer and pianist Haydee Milanes, as Villareal tuned the piano in the recording studio of her father, one of Cuba's best-known singers, Pablo Milanes where she was rehearsing.
""It is utterly essential for us musicians that the pianos we use be well tuned so they sound good."" 
Villareal is grateful she got the opportunity to learn an interesting trade at a time when there were few opportunities for people with her disability.
Piano tuning actually first emerged as a skill particularly suited to the visually impaired or blind in the 1800s in Europe. The thinking was in part that their lack of sight would make their sense of hearing particularly acute.
Villareal is one of the most sought-after piano tuners in Cuba, where a world-renowned music scene draws on a European and African heritage. 
Still, the sextagenarian expects her trade to gradually disappear as piano playing loses popularity and technology like tuning software takes over. 
At the same time technological advances like screen readers and speech recognition software are opening new professional doors for the visually impaired. But Villareal plans to keep on tuning as long as she is physically able to.

""I think I will die tuning,"" she said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian opposition leaders on Wednesday called for the release of an elderly priest held on terror charges, one of 16 similar arrests rights groups say are politically motivated. 
Stan Swamy, an 83-year-old Jesuit priest working with tribal groups in India's eastern state of Jharkhand, was arrested earlier this month on accusations he assisted Maoist groups active in the region. 
He was refused bail and is being held under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), that critics say is one of several laws being abused by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. 
""The charges seem to be preposterous,"" said Shashi Tharoor, a lawmaker from the opposition Congress, that was one of half-a-dozen parties to speak at a news conference on Wednesday. 
""He should be released on bail even if the government insists on these far-fetched charges.""
Sonia Narang, a spokeswoman for India's federal National Investigation Authority that is in charge of the case, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Swamy's arrest is one of sixteen in connection with what began as an investigation into clashes between groups from India's upper and lower castes in 2018, according to the People's Union for Civil Liberties, a rights group. All are activists, academics and other intellectuals. 
The United Nations and several rights groups have said the detentions are part of a pattern of the government using India's laws to crack down on dissent, although New Delhi denies this. 
""He was charged and detained, and we understand that he is still detained, despite being 83 years old, despite being a long-standing respected human rights activist, working particularly on the rights of marginalized groups,"" Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, said on Tuesday. 
""So in our view this is an example of these laws being used to detain the wrong type of people for the wrong reasons.""
The UAPA has also been used to arrest several left-wing activists in connection with communal riots in India's capital earlier this year.

MUDDLES GREEN, England (Reuters) - This was to have been the year that an art gallery deep in the southern English countryside took the United States by storm with exhibitions of the extraordinary Lee Miller, a 1920s fashion model, surrealist and World War Two photographer.
Filming for a biopic starring Kate Winslet was also meant to have begun at Farleys House in Muddles Green, where the American-born Miller recovered from documenting the horrors of war and entertained guests including Pablo Picasso and fellow surrealist photographer and her former lover Man Ray.
Instead, the pandemic has put almost every plan on hold.
""It's like a wasteland of tumbleweed,"" said Ami Bouhassane, Miller's granddaughter. 
She curates the Miller archive with her father, Antony Penrose, Miller's son with the surrealist artist Roland Penrose.
COVID-19 has compounded the uncertainty created by Britain's departure from the European Union (EU), with a transition period ending on Dec. 31. That has left galleries anxious about how complicated it might become to stage shows and transport artworks abroad.
For more than a decade, Farleys House and Gallery has averaged four international exhibitions a year, loaned mostly around Europe, accounting for roughly a third of its revenue. Other income comes from rights relating to the 60,000 negatives in the Miller archive and from visitors to Muddles Green.
This year, it was planning on seven and to expand into the United States as part of a strategy to cope with Brexit. Two have gone ahead - one in Germany, traditionally one of its most important markets, and another in non-EU Switzerland.
A third show, intended for Europe, is being shown instead to Farleys' trickle of socially-distanced visitors, while the other exhibitions are in storage.
Such problems are shared to varying degrees by art institutions great and small as visitor numbers no longer justify large-scale exhibitions and planning is fraught.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the entirety of the arts and culture sector,"" said Arts Council England in an email. The body is helping to administer a government 1.57 billion pound ($2.04 billion) Culture Recovery Fund.
London's Wallace Collection, which includes works by Rubens, Van Dyck and Titian, has also seen a 90% fall in visitors and has deferred exhibitions to next year.
""Financially it doesn't make sense to do blockbuster shows at the moment,"" Xavier Bray, director of the museum, told Reuters.
Commercial revenue from events, a shop and restaurant has dropped by 1.5 million pounds and the museum faces ""a massive deficit"" this year, Bray said. ""Any help is going to be crucial to the survival of institutions like the Wallace Collection.""

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenyan documentary ""Softie"" opens in 2013 with Njeri Mwangi standing in a doorway, light illuminating a sleepy toddler on her hip as her husband Boniface sieves buckets of clotted blood outside. 
The next day, he dumps the blood and coaxes a herd of pigs to feast on it outside parliament to demonstrate against yet another pay rise for legislators, dubbed ""MPigs"" by protesters. 
Kenya is East Africa's richest nation, but its booming economy has an ugly underbelly. Runaway corruption traps millions in poverty, extrajudicial police killings are common and elections punctuated by deadly violence.
The government says it is investigating corruption, and several high level officials are in court, including the former finance minister. Some cases have been going on for decades.
Njeri and Boniface Mwangi are activists - they protest together and are arrested together - but as the film progresses, the focus moves from whether their crusade will succeed to whether their family will implode. 
""Families of human rights defenders or activists ... I want people to know we exist,"" Njeri, a movie buff and avid motorcyclist, told Reuters at the film's Kenya premiere this week. ""Our children really struggle."" 
Softie - an award-winner at the Sundance and Durban film festivals - shows the evolution of Boniface from an activist outraged by the 2007-8 election violence into a political candidate promising his new Ukweli party will change the system from within, a decade later. 
His family grapple with his absence, a house permanently full of people, and death threats targeting their three young children. Njeri, fearing for their lives, eventually takes the kids to the Unites States in 2016.
In one tense on-camera exchange before his family leaves, Boniface pleads with his wife: ""you need to have an ideal that you live for, that's worth dying for.""
""You think it will be better if you die?"" Njeri replies sadly. 
A later scene lays out the stakes. The couple's eldest son Nate returns from his American school with something he has made for father's day: a loving card for his mother. When filmmaker Sam Soko asks from behind the camera why there's no message for his father, Nate shrugs.
Moments like that forced a reckoning, said Boniface, who appeared with his family at the premiere, all in matching purple outfits. Now he's building his party, taking a rest from protests and spending time making meals for his family. He's finally realised he can't - and shouldn't - try to change everything himself. 
""Change is not an event... it's not a popcorn that pops in a microwave,"" he told Reuters. ""It's a very slow painful marathon - and then the marathon doesn't end.""
The film started out as a five-minute Youtube clip about organising a protest, said Soko, who is an activist himself. It sprawled into a seven year project. 

""It's essentially still an activist manual,"" he said. ""But a different kind of manual ... (about) what it means to love.""

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said work on extending the new START treaty, which expires in February, was continuing at the level of experts. ""We hope that all differences about the issue will be overcome through dialogue,"" he told reporters.
Peskov was speaking a day after the United States welcomed a proposal by Moscow to prolong new START by a year if both sides agreed to freeze their stocks of all nuclear warheads for that period.
Signed in 2010, the last U.S.-Russia pact of its kind limits the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers each country can deploy. 
A failure to extend the treaty would remove these constraints, threatening to spark a post-Cold War arms race and fuel tensions between the world's two largest nuclear weapons powers.

Despite the optimistic signals from both sides, arms control analysts say it will be very difficult for them to negotiate detailed verification procedures before the U.S. presidential election, now less than two weeks away.

Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin faces a challenge from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who met Malaysia's king last week in a bid to prove he has majority support from lawmakers, including administration defectors, to form a new government.
Muhyiddin has since been in talks for a possible cabinet reshuffle to add more members from the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), his coalition's largest party, after it threatened to withdraw, sources told Reuters.
In a statement, the party said it had agreed on a ""political ceasefire"" and to support Muhyiddin's government by focusing on national efforts to fight the virus and help those struggling in a pandemic-battered economy. 
""The cooperation of all parties in the government...must be strengthened in order to ensure political stability at a time when the country is facing the threat of COVID-19 and economic uncertainty,"" said the party's president, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi. 
Public anger over widespread graft led to a general election defeat for UMNO in 2018, its first since independence more than 60 years ago. 
But it returned to power in March by forming an alliance with Muhyiddin's Bersatu party after the government of veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad collapsed because of infighting.
Last month, UMNO said some party lawmakers supported Anwar's bid to be prime minister.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A few dozen Thai royalists held a rally in Bangkok on Wednesday in the face of protests against the government and the monarchy that have drawn tens of thousands of people to the streets in defiance of an official ban.
Protest groups also urged supporters to demonstrate for a seventh day by gathering at 4 p.m. (0900 GMT).
The royalists said they had no problem with protesters calling for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha - a former military ruler - but they should not touch on King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
""I beg you, do what you will, but do not touch the monarchy,"" one of the royalists, Sirimongkol Ruampan, 24, told Reuters. ""I don't believe in violence. I beg again, don't bring the monarchy into politics.""
Royalists, most of whom wore yellow, the king's colour, said their gathering was not political and so not subject to the ban on gatherings of more than five people imposed by the government last week.
Police spokesman Yingyos Thepjumnong told reporters that all groups would be treated the same.
""We are ready for big surprises every day,"" he said. ""We need to balance law enforcement with social peace and safety, no matter at whose gatherings.""
Pro-royalist groups took to social media using a hashtag that translates as #WeLoveTheMonarchy to proclaim their loyalty, but it was hijacked by supporters of the protests posting anti-royalist messages.
The protests have become the biggest challenge to Thailand's establishment in years and have drawn the most open opposition to the monarchy in decades despite lese majeste laws setting jail terms of up to 15 years for insulting the monarchy.
When protests began in July, they originally demanded a new constitution and the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth, accusing him of keeping hold of power last year by engineering an election that he says was fair.
The demands for changes to reduce the monarchy's powers came later.

The Palace has a policy of making no comment to media and has made no comment on either the protests or the demands of the protesters.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Lagos was under a round-the-clock curfew on Wednesday enforced by police roadblocks, as smoke rose from a flashpoint area in Nigeria's biggest city where soldiers shot at protesters the previous evening, witnesses said.
The Lagos state governor said 30 people were hurt in the shooting at a toll gate in the Lekki district, a focal point of nearly two weeks of nationwide protests against allegations of systematic police brutality. 
Four witnesses said soldiers had fired the bullets and at least two people had been shot. Two of the witnesses said the lights were turned off at the gate shortly before the shooting began. One said he saw soldiers remove bodies.
In a Twitter post, the Nigerian Army said no soldiers were at the scene.
Authorities imposed the curfew on Lagos on Tuesday after the governor said the protests had turned violent.
President Muhammadu Buhari, appealing for ""understanding and calm"", said on Wednesday he was committed to providing justice for victims of brutality, and that police reforms also demanded by the demonstrators were gathering pace.
His statement, disseminated by his spokesman, did not refer to the shooting at the Lekki toll gate, from where a witness saw smoke rising on Wednesday.
On Wednesday, Police set up roadblocks in Lagos and were not allowing vehicles to pass, although there were a few cars and people walking, two witnesses said. 
They said some of the police were armed and wore body armour, and many were in plain clothes. Witnesses also heard the sound of gunfire in the Okota and Ebute Metta areas of mainland Lagos.
'THE BUCK STOPS AT MY TABLE'
Thousands of Nigerians have demonstrated in protests that initially focused on a police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), that rights groups had for years accused of extortion, harassment, torture and murders.
The unit was disbanded on Oct. 11 but the protests have persisted with calls for law enforcement reforms.
Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu tweeted pictures of his hospital visit to victims of what he referred to as the ""unfortunate shooting incident"" in Lekki. 
He said 25 people were being treated for mild to moderate injuries, two were receiving intensive care and three had been discharged. 
""I recognise the buck stops at my table and I will work with the FG (federal government) to get to the root of this unfortunate incident and stabilise all security operations to protect the lives of our residents,"" said Sanwo-Olu.

Confirming earlier media reports, the police said in a statement on Wednesday that unknown suspects had splashed an oily liquid around the museums during opening hours on Oct. 3 but gave no further details. 
The Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, which oversees the collections at the museum complex on the Spree River, declined to comment immediately but said a news conference would be held at 1:00 p.m. local time (1100 GMT) on Wednesday. 
At least 70 objects were damaged, according to local media, including Egyptian sarcophagi, stone sculptures and 19th-century paintings held at the Pergamon Museum, the Neues Museum and the Alte Nationalgalerie. 
Weekly Zeit-Online, daily Der Tagesspiegel and broadcaster Deutschlandfunk reported the incident on Tuesday, describing it as one of Germany's most serious attacks on artworks in decades and saying it had been kept secret for more than two weeks.
Berlin's museum island, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the capital's most famous sights, houses large collections of art and cultural history of Europe and the Mediterranean region.

""I have a reasonable basis to believe that the announcement will come before Nov. 3 - that, if you'll permit me, is what I understand from my sources,"" Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis told Israel's Army Radio.
In a foreign-policy flourish ahead of his reelection bid, top aides to President Donald Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing Israel's new, U.S.-brokered relations with the Gulf states.
Trump signalled on Monday that Washington would remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, stirring speculation that it could be the next Arab country to move closer to Israel.
Akunis said several countries were candidates to normalise relations with Israel. He did not name these, saying that it was ""customary"" to let the first official word come from Washington.

""I will be very happy if the announcement will happen - and before the elections in the United States,"" he said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union told Britain on Wednesday to make up its mind on Brexit, putting the onus back on London to unlock trade talks as the bloc's chief negotiator said an agreement was still within reach with 10 weeks to go.
A frustrated European Union and piqued Britain both exhorted each other this week to compromise to avoid a disruptive finale to the five-year Brexit drama that would add to economic pain from the coronavirus crisis.
""Time is very short and we stand ready to negotiate 24/7, on all subjects, on legal texts. The UK has a bit of a decision to make and it's their free and sovereign choice,"" European Council President Charles Michel told the European Parliament. 
He said Britain's answer would determine its level of access to the EU's internal market of 450 million consumers, adding: ""This is just common sense.""
The EU's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told the parliament an agreement was still ""within reach"".
""Time is of the essence ... Along with our British counterparts, we must find solutions to the most difficult areas,"" Barnier said, in comments that pushed sterling higher.
London has this week refused to continue full negotiations, saying the EU must ""fundamentally change"" its stance.
The bloc sees this as bluff by Prime Minister Boris Johnson but has also extended an olive branch by talking up UK sovereignity, as well as the EU's openess to discuss intensively, across the board and on specific legal texts.
A UK spokesman said London noted ""with interest"" Barnier's comments that touch ""in a significant way on the issues behind the current difficulties in our talks"".
Barnier and his UK counterpart David Frost were due to talk on the phone at 1400GMT on Wednesday. 
Michel stressed the 27 EU members were ready for an abrupt split without a new agreement to avoid tariffs or quotas. He listed three main sticking points in the negotiations: guaranteeing fishing rights and economic fair play, and agreeing ways to settle future trade disputes.
""We don't need words, we need guarantees,"" he said of fair competition safeguards. ""Do our British friends want to regulate state aid and uphold high medical standards? If so, why not commit to them."" 
""DOORS OPEN""
Michel called for a ""binding, independent arbitration"" to redress market distortions swiftly, adding that London's draft new Internal Market Bill - which, if adopted, would undermine Britain's earlier divorce deal with the EU - only strengthened the bloc's resolve to ensure tight policing of any new deal. 
A deputy head of the bloc's executive European Commission, Maros Sefcovic, also said London must respect its Brexit settlement with the EU regardless of the outcome of trade talks.
Michel said losing access to British waters would inflict ""extraordinary damage"" on the EU's fishing industry and that the bloc was therefore seeking to prolong the status-quo just as London wanted to keep the EU's market open for UK companies.
""But the UK wants access to the single market while at the same time being able to diverge from our standards and regulations when it suits them. You can't have your cake and eat it too,"" Michel said. 
Following Brexit last March, Britain's current EU trading terms expire in 10 weeks and unfettered commerce can no longer be guaranteed without a new treaty.
Keen to avoid any blame, the bloc is ready to negotiate until mid-November but must then ratify any deal in the European Parliament before time is up.

""Our doors remain open and will remain open until the last day possible,"" Barnier said. ""But it takes two to reach a deal.""

245,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 06:30AM ET</span>",Analysis: Bolivia vote suggests pandemic may fuel populism in Latin America,"By Marcelo Rochabrun and Cassandra Garrison
LA PAZ/BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A landslide win by Bolivia's socialist party at weekend elections may herald a year of dramatic shifts in Latin American politics as the painful economic impact of the pandemic discredits incumbents and fuels demand for change.
Bolivia's former economy minister Luis Arce won Sunday's vote in the Andean nation, pledging to protect welfare spending as he takes over next month from a conservative interim government.
""The pandemic has caused the Bolivian people to suffer and this government did not know how to handle it,"" said Nicanor Baltazar, a leader of Bolivia's largest workers group, the COB. ""The people have understood that.""
With Latin America one of the hardest-hit regions in terms of COVID-19 deaths and impact on economic growth, analysts said the outcome in Bolivia could mark a shift towards populism as more elections loom in 2021. 
Voters will elect new presidents next year in Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras and Nicaragua, with major legislative votes also due in Mexico and Argentina.
Even before the coronavirus struck, violent protests had rocked countries including Chile and Colombia, fueled by anger over inequality and political scandals.
With Latin America's $5.7 trillion regional economy forecast to contract more than 9% this year and poverty indicators for its 650 million people due to surge back to rates last seen in 2005, tensions are already mounting.
The pandemic's economic fallout will leave Latin American governments burdened by crippling deficits and facing angry demands from voters for action on poverty and public services, said Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center's Argentina Project in Washington.
""The pandemic's toll in Latin America is a godsend to outsiders and populists, who will promise to repudiate debt, reject budget cuts and fight corruption,"" said Gedan.
IMF BACKLASH 
With several countries staggering under heavy debt burdens, a backlash against the international financial system in the form of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is already underway.
In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Arce rebuffed the idea of an IMF loan for Bolivia and vowed to dole out social payouts ""as many times as necessary."" 
In Costa Rica, one of the region's economic success stories, a proposed IMF loan provoked days of violent demonstrations against the center-left government of President Carlos Alvarado. 
And in Ecuador, which will hold presidential elections in February, unions will lead protests against an IMF deal on Thursday, commemorating a wave of protests last year that forced conservative President Lenin Moreno to abandon fuel subsidy cuts.
Would-be candidates for next year's election are jostling for position by criticizing a loan deal Moreno struck with the IMF.
In Colombia, a national strike is planned for Wednesday, the latest in a series of protests against the social and economic policies of conservative President Ivan Duque.
In Chile, meanwhile, where protests flared at the weekend, conservative President Sebastian Pinera has rolled back austerity measures and will hold a referendum on Sunday on whether to rewrite the constitution, a relic of Augusto Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule.
Claudia Navas, a Bogota-based analyst at Control Risks, said Arce's emphatic win in Bolivia could provide a ""key reference"" for left-wing opposition movements in Latin America, particularly in Colombia and Ecuador where they were already gaining ground.
""Conditions are favorable for left-wing political parties to gain more political spaces, if not the presidency,"" Navas said.
RISK OF A BACKWARD SLIDE
Yet incumbents of all political persuasions are at risk as anger mounts at declining living standards. In Argentina, leftist President Alberto Fernandez has seen his approval rating slide since April, amid frustration at his handling of the pandemic. 
In the region's biggest economies - Brazil and Mexico - populist leaders were already the electoral beneficiaries of mounting frustration at slow growth and rampant corruption before the pandemic struck.
President Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil, a right-wing populist swept to power in 2018, has preserved his popularity during the pandemic by hiking welfare spending.
In Mexico, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador - elected in 2018 amid outrage at graft - has eschewed large-scale government handouts but managed to focus the debate away from his handling of the pandemic and onto past corruption scandals.
Stephen Liston, senior director at the Washington office of the Council of the Americas, warned that anger and mistrust of governments as the economic crisis deepens could open the door wider to populism or an authoritarian backlash in a region with a troubling history of both.
""There is a real danger of a backward slide in democratic governance in the region,"" he said.

247,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",Iraqi leader battles pressure from friends and foes in security crackdown,"BAGHDAD (Reuters) - It was a series of intercepted phone calls on a tense night in June that made Iraq’s new prime minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi fully realise how few friends he had.
During one call, a senior Iraqi leader with strong ties to Iran instructed the security chief for Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone, which hosts government buildings and foreign embassies, not to stand in the way of militiamen who were storming the area, two Iraqi security officials said.
The militiamen were angry at the arrest of comrades accused of firing anti-U.S. rockets. During the hours-long standoff, the militia detained several members of a U.S.-trained counter-terrorism force, according to the security officials and two militia sources.
On the June 25 call, the leader with ties to Iran warned the Green Zone security chief, Shihab al-Khiqani, that “a clash would open the gates of hell” between the militias and the forces guarding the area, according to one of the security officials, who viewed a transcript of the call. The second security official and the two militia sources corroborated that call and said Khiqani was told by militia commanders in other phone conversations that night to avoid any standoff with the paramilitaries.
Kadhimi, a former intelligence chief and U.S. ally who had been in the Green Zone that night, learned of the conversations around a week later, after launching an investigation into the events, the two security officials said. They said it shook him, serving as a stark lesson about his enemies’ power.
Kadhimi fired Khiqani immediately after the investigation and embarked on a wide-ranging purge of top state security posts that he presses on with - now under renewed U.S. pressure.
The communications intercepted by Iraqi security services on the night of June 25 brought home the stark reality for Kadhimi that despite being backed by Washington, he could not even trust Iraqi government forces to stop Iran-backed militias running rampant outside his offices.
It set the tone for Kadhimi’s premiership, which has been marked by attempts to exert control over a fractious Iraqi state while placating both an unpredictable White House and the anti-U.S., Iran-aligned groups that want him to fail.
Since taking office in May after being Iraq’s third prime minister-designate in 10 weeks, a key part of Kadhimi’s policy is to reduce the stranglehold Iran-backed militias have developed on large parts of Iraq’s security forces since the U.S.-led ouster of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
But he operates in a complicated political reality that limits his ability to make changes, say security officials, militia leaders, senior politicians and Western diplomats.
They say Kadhimi’s approach might work but question whether his interim cabinet can make a difference before a general election expected as early as June.
The prime minister has recently had to contend with a threat from Washington to close its embassy if he cannot stop anti-U.S. rocket attacks by pro-Iran militias, and demands from the militias that he boot out American troops or they will escalate attacks on Western targets.
“The Americans want Kadhimi to go further and faster. He’s saying I can’t without toppling my government or starting a civil war,” one Western diplomat said.
Iraqi government spokesman Ahmed Mulla Talal said the prime minister had implemented many changes in the leadership of the security forces but that it was unrealistic to expect total reform within five months. “You can’t describe the big changes Kadhimi has made as being slow” because of the mismanagement of the security system by previous governments over the past 17 years, he said. 
He described the U.S. talk of closing its embassy as “a worrying step for the Iraqi government” but said “there is no pressure from any side to move faster on any step.”
The spokesman didn’t respond to specific questions about the June 25 call or Kadhimi’s response to it.
Kadhimi, a former journalist who regularly removes his tie to jump into helicopters and tour different provinces, has talked candidly about many challenges facing his government but has avoided mentioning specific militias that stand in his way. “I will not tolerate rogue groups hijacking our homeland to create chaos,” he tweeted days before the Green Zone incident.
In response to questions about U.S. pressure and Kadhimi’s record, a U.S. embassy official said Iraq had a “duty to protect diplomatic premises … but overall we are pleased that Iraq is taking steps to strengthen security for diplomatic missions in Baghdad.”
BOLD MOVE
Iraqi lawmakers chose Kadhimi as prime minister, with nods from both Iran and the United States - two countries that have repeatedly clashed in Iraq. His predecessor resigned last year as anti-government protesters took to the streets in their thousands, demanding jobs and the departure of Iraq’s ruling elite. Protesters blame many of Iraq’s ills on Iran-aligned militias and parties.
Kadhimi’s team, through frequent social media messaging, portray him as an uncompromising leader who will stop at nothing to wipe out rogue groups.
It was his first bold move against the militias that triggered that tense night in June. He ordered the U.S.-trained Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS (NYSE:CTS)) to detain 14 members of the most powerful Iran-aligned faction, Kataib Hezbollah, in response to rocket attacks on U.S. targets.
Militiamen led by Kataib Hezbollah’s top commander circled the Green Zone with guns in pick-up trucks and detained the CTS members. To pull the paramilitaries off, Kadhimi had to turn to his rivals, calling the same commanders and senior Iraqi leader tied to Iran who he later learned had told Khiqani to stand down that night. 
The militiamen left, but not before getting guarantees their comrades would be let go. Over the coming days, they were. 
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, asked Reuters not to name the senior Iraqi leader and commanders because it would also identify them. Their accounts were corroborated by the five militia sources and political insiders with knowledge of the incident.
A Kataib Hezbollah spokesman denied involvement in any recent rocket attacks against Western targets. He said the group was not directly involved in the Green Zone storming, and that it was carried out by supporters of Iraq’s state paramilitary forces.
Khiqani could not immediately be reached for comment.
APPOINTMENTS AND APPEASEMENT
Kadhimi has in recent months announced a raft of new military and security appointments.
His pick to succeed Khiqani as chief of Green Zone security, appointed last month, is an officer trained at Britain’s Sandhurst military academy.
Other key appointments by Kadhimi include the reinstated and popular CTS commander Abdul Wahab al-Saidi and Interior Minister Uthman al-Ghanimi, both viewed by the West as competent and free of party political ties.
But some appointments have appeased political parties, including groups Kadhimi needs to counterweight the pro-Iran camp, and even some Iran-aligned figures, Iraqi politicians and Western diplomats say.
Interior Minister Ghanimi’s new deputy, Hussein Dhaif, belongs to the party of populist and unpredictable cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who generally opposes Iranian influence but acts in his own interest and has sided with Iran when it has suited him.
National Security Adviser Qasim al-Araji, a former interior minister, is a member of the Iran-aligned Badr Organization that has long dominated the interior ministry.
“Kadhimi is under enormous pressure from all political blocs which keep insisting on certain jobs. He’s trying to push back but can’t ignore them completely, so he’s had to take on appointments he perhaps wouldn’t have chosen,” the Western diplomat said.
BALANCING ACT 
Kadhimi has had to play a similar balancing act abroad.
During his first foreign trip to Tehran in July, Kadhimi pledged not to let Iraq be used as a launch pad for aggression against its neighbour Iran. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei pressed the Iranian demand that U.S. troops leave Iraq.
On a visit to Washington the following month Kadhimi stressed that U.S. troops would long be needed to train Iraqi forces - a response to President Donald Trump’s assertion that America would eventually “obviously … be gone” and that the United States would continue to reduce the presence of its 5,000 remaining troops.
A key U.S. demand is for Kadhimi to force militias out of the Green Zone and stop rockets and roadside bomb attacks against diplomats and troops. Washington’s threat last month to close its embassy in Baghdad if attacks continued was a move Western diplomats said could pave the way for U.S. air strikes. A U.S. strike killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in Baghdad in January pushing the region to the brink of conflict.
Iran-backed militias who are still spoiling for revenge for those deaths have paused attacks for now - partly thanks to the U.S. embassy threat - but are asking Kadhimi to make U.S. forces leave, or they will resume fire.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that Iraq was doing more to protect diplomats in the Green Zone but declined to comment on whether Washington was still considering shutting its embassy.
The Kataib Hezbollah commander who led his men through the Green Zone in June, Abdul Aziz al-Mohammedawi, alias Abu Fadak, still occupies the office inside the zone of his slain superior Muhandis, according to militia officials, creating an uneasy presence of both his fighters and the U.S.-trained CTS counter-terror force.

No successful prosecutions over rocket attacks or killings of pro-democracy activists, a key promise by Kadhimi, have been made since he took office.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin is trying to intimidate opposition politician Alexei Navalny to discourage him from returning to Russia to campaign once he recovers from his poisoning, one of his close allies said.
As the 44-year-old has convalesced in Germany where he was flown for medical care after falling ill in Siberia in August, Navalny's team says Russian bailiffs have frozen his bank accounts and the title to his flat.
The Kremlin has since accused Navalny of working with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, prompting the pro-government Federal News Agency to report that Navalny could be guilty of treason. 
""We see all kinds of intimidation by them: 'let's arrest his apartment ... let's open cases into state treason',"" Leonid Volkov, a senior member of Navalny's team, told Reuters. 
""It's clear these are all just fakes designed to intimidate.""
Navalny says he will return to Russia, and the Kremlin has said he is free to do so. It has rejected Navalny's allegation that President Vladimir Putin was behind his poisoning with a novichok nerve agent.
""Until Aug. 20 we couldn't imagine that in modern Russia Putin could give an order to poison Navalny with novichok... this is a new reality that we have to learn to live with,"" Volkov said.
Navalny has complained for years that he is barred from state media and systematically targeted with lawsuits and bogus criminal investigations aimed at stifling his activities.
He remains the subject of a criminal investigation into slander of a World War Two veteran who cheered constitutional reforms being promoted by Putin. Last week, Yevgeny Prigozhin, a Kremlin-linked businessman, announced new plans to sue Navalny for libel.
Volkov said Navalny had no doubts about returning. 

""Obviously they don't want him to return. And that is precisely why he will.""

Speaking at a news conference midway through week-long talks in Geneva this week, Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) said the two sides had also agreed to maintain ""the current state of calm on the front lines and avoid any military escalation"". 
Libya has been split since 2014 between the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) in the east. 
This week's meeting between GNA and LNA military negotiators in Geneva will be followed by a political dialogue in Tunis from Nov. 9, Williams said, adding that foreign countries involved in the conflict ""need to take their hands off Libya"". 
Libyan oil output resumed in August after an eight-month blockade by the LNA but state producer National Oil Corporation (NOC) has warned of risks posed by the Petroleum Facilities Guards (PFG), made up of local armed groups. 
Williams said the sides in Geneva had agreed to delegate PFG commanders from both east and west to work with an NOC representative to present a proposal to restructure the guards to ""ensure the increase and continuation"" of oil flow. 
She added that they had agreed to make progress on an exchange of detainees between the warring sides and that the first flights between Tripoli and the eastern city of Benghazi would resume this week.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Five people have died after getting flu shots in South Korea in the past week, authorities said, raising concerns over the vaccine's safety just as the seasonal inoculation programme is expanded to head off potential COVID-19 complications.
Authorities said there was no reason to believe the deaths were linked to the vaccine but an investigation, including post mortems, was underway.
""It makes it hard for us to put out a categorical statement,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing on Wednesday about the deaths, which include a 17-year-old boy and a man in his 70s.
Coming just weeks after the rollout of the national vaccine programme was suspended over safety worries, the deaths have dominated headlines in South Korea.
Officials last month announced plans to procure 20% more flu vaccines for the winter than the previous year to inoculate 30 million people in a bid to prevent the health system being overloaded by patients with flu and COVID-19 exposure. 
However, the start of a free jab programme for around 19 million eligible people was suspended for three weeks after it was discovered that some 5 million doses, which need to be refrigerated, had been exposed to room temperature while being transported to a medical facility.
Boosting public trust in vaccines has become a major global challenge this year, as some countries rush to approve experimental COVID-19 vaccines before full safety and efficacy studies have been completed.
South Korea's flu vaccines are supplied by different drugmakers, including LG Chem Ltd (KS:051910) and Boryung Biopharma Co. Ltd., a unit of  Boryung Pharm  Co. Ltd. (KS:003850). A Boryung official told Reuters the company was aware of the reported deaths, but had no immediate comment. LG Chem said the company would follow government advice.
A 17-year-old boy who died on Friday was the first death noted by officials to follow receipt of the vaccine. The boy died two days after receiving the flu shot in Incheon, near the capital Seoul. 
A man in his 70s, who had Parkinson's disease and arrhythmia, was the most recent case. He died in Daegu on Wednesday, a day after receiving the flu vaccine. Daegu officials said the man had received vaccines since 2015 with no prior adverse reactions. 
Officials said 8.3 million people have been inoculated with the free flu vaccine since it resumed on Oct. 13, with around 350 cases of adverse reactions reported. The highest number of deaths linked to the seasonal flu vaccination was six in 2005, according to Yonhap news agency.
Even before the coronavirus pandemic, trust in vaccines was a growing challenge for public health bodies. The World Health Organization named vaccine hesitancy as one of the top 10 global health threats for last year.
In South Korea, a poll earlier this month found that 62% of 2,548 respondents in Gyeonggi province, near Seoul, would not get vaccinated against COVID-19, even if a vaccine is approved, until all safety questions are fully answered.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Soldiers opened fire on Nigerians protesting against police brutality in the Lekki district of the commercial capital Lagos on Tuesday, and at least two people were shot, four witnesses told Reuters.
Thousands of Nigerians have demonstrated https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27418O nationwide every day for nearly two weeks against a police unit, the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), that rights groups had for years accused of extortion, harassment, torture and murders.

""They started firing ammunition toward the crowd. They were firing into the crowd,"" said Alfred Ononugbo, 55, a security officer after the soldiers opened fire. ""I saw the bullet hit one or two persons,"" he said.

In a Twitter post, the Nigerian Army said no soldiers were at the scene of the shooting on Tuesday night in Lekki, an upmarket district where the toll gate has been the site of daily protests in Lagos, Africa's biggest city. 
Lagos State Goveror Babajide Sanwo-Olu tweeted pictures of him visiting people in hospital who were victims of what he referred to as the ""unfortunate shooting incident at Lekki"".

A Nigerian army spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
Inyene Akpan, 26, a photographer, said more than 20 soldiers arrived at the toll gate in Lekki and opened fire. He said he saw two people being shot. 
Akinbosola Ogunsanya, a third witness, said he saw around 10 people being shot. Ogunsanya, who said lights went out shortly before the soldiers arrived, also said he saw soldiers remove bodies.
Another witness, Chika Dibia, said soldiers hemmed in people as they shot at them.
Video verified by Reuters showed men walking slowly in formation toward demonstrators, followed by trucks with flashing lights, and the sound of gunfire popping. Another video showed the toll gate itself, with a protester waving a Nigerian flag, as people ran amid the sounds of gunfire.
A Reuters witness heard sirens and gunfire. 
DEFENCE MEETING
President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday held scheduled talks with the defence minister and the chief of defence staff around 6:15 p.m. (1715 GMT) to discuss national security, two presidency officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A spokesman for the president did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Nigerian army was due to begin a two-month national exercise on Tuesday. When the move was announced on Saturday, it denied the move was part of a security response to the demonstrations. Days earlier, the military said it was prepared to help maintain law and order. 
The weeks-long protests were sparked by a video that began circulating in early October purportedly showing SARS https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2711TK officers shooting a man in southern Delta state. Police denied the shooting.
Authorities on Tuesday imposed a round-the-clock curfew on Lagos as the state governor said protests had turned violent.

It is one of five of Nigeria's 36 states to have announced such measures in the last two days. The national police chief also ordered the immediate deployment of anti-riot forces nationwide following increased attacks on police facilities, a police spokesman said.

255,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 04:10AM ET</span>",Seven people handed over to judge in probe on French teacher's murder,"PARIS (Reuters) - Seven people, including two minors, were handed over to a judge overnight as part of an ongoing investigation into last week's murder of French teacher Samuel Paty, an official from the anti-terrorist prosecutor's office said.
Paty was beheaded on Oct. 16 in broad daylight outside his school in a middle-class Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin. Police shot the attacker dead.
Investigators say the teenager had sought to avenge his victim's use of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression. Muslims believe that any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.
A school parent who had posted a video accusing the teacher of using the caricatures in class was among the seven presented to the judge.
Richard Ferrand, speaker of the lower house of parliament and a former teacher, told BFM television that parents should ""stay out of schools and leave teachers alone. One must hand back full authority to the teachers.""
Prosecutors have said the attacker had approached pupils outside the school asked them to identify Paty as he left for home.
Two of those pupils were among those presented to the judge, as was Islamist militant Abdelhakim Sefrioui from the Cheikh Yassine Collective, whose closure could be decided later in the day by the French cabinet. 
The murder shocked France, and carried echoes of the attack five years ago on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, after the magazine had also published cartoons of Prophet Mohammad. Public figures called Paty's killing an attack on the Republic and on French values.
French regional newspaper La Nouvelle Republique has received threats on social media after it published a caricature of the Prophet Mohammad on its front page, one of its journalists said on Wednesday.
A national tribute in honour of Paty will be held at the Sorbonne university in Paris on Wednesday.

256,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Australian police probe alleged Vatican funds transfer amid Pell trial,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian police are investigating the alleged transfer of Vatican funds to Australia amid the prosecution of former Vatican treasurer George Pell for child sex abuse and have referred the matter to an anti-corruption body.
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed on Wednesday they have received information from Australia's financial crimes watchdog.
""The AFP is undertaking a review of the relevant information,"" the police said in emailed comments.
The AFP said it had also referred some aspects of the matter to the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC), which investigates misconduct by state police.
Police in the state of Victoria in 2017 laid several charges against Pell involving historical child sexual offences, but only one case, involving two former choirboys, went to trial in 2018.
Italian media recently reported that Pell's Vatican nemesis, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, sent 700,000 euros ($828,100) to Australia to help Pell's ""enemies"" while he was facing sexual assault charges. Becciu's lawyer has denied the reports.
The head of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) told a Senate committee on Tuesday that the agency had probed the allegations and given information to the AFP and Victoria police.
""I can confirm AUSTRAC has looked into the matter and we've provided information to the AFP and to Victoria Police,"" AUSTRAC Chief Executive Nicole Rose told a Senate Estimates committee hearing on Tuesday, when asked whether it had investigated the alleged Vatican funds transfer.
Victoria Police had no comment on the matter on Wednesday.
Pell was acquitted by Australia's High Court in April after serving 13 months in jail on charges he assaulted two choirboys. His lawyer said the Italian media reports on the alleged transfer of Vatican funds must be probed.
""If one is to give any credence to what has been alleged, then it is critical that all proper money tracing exercises be undertaken,"" Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter, told Reuters on Oct. 5.
Italian media have reported that the alleged wire transfer may have been used to ""buy"" the accusers in Pell's trial. Only one of those is alive.
Pell's accuser in the sexual assault case said through his lawyer that ""he has no knowledge of any payments allegedly made by the Vatican to Australia"". 
His lawyer, Viv Waller, also said she had no knowledge of any payments nor any investigation into alleged payments.
""I have not been contacted by Victoria Police, the Australian Federal Police or AUSTRAC,"" Waller said in emailed comments.
When Pell was economy minister, in charge of overhauling the Vatican's finances, he ran into strong opposition from Becciu, who was number two in the Vatican's Secretariat of State.
The Pope fired Becciu on accusations of embezzlement and nepotism in September. Becciu has denied all wrongdoing.
After Becciu was sacked, Pell said: ""The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances. He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments.""
Pell returned to Rome on Sept. 30 for the first time since 2017. He held a meeting with the Pope on Oct. 12.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Japan opposes any actions that escalate tension in the East and South China Seas, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said on Wednesday, but added that Tokyo was not aiming at an ""Asian NATO"" to contain any specific country.
Suga was wrapping up a four-day trip to Vietnam and Indonesia, his first overseas since taking office last month, as part of Japan's efforts to bolster ties with key Southeast Asian nations amid concerns about China's growing assertiveness there.
""Japan is opposed to any actions that escalate tensions in the South China Sea,"" Suga told a news conference in the Indonesian capital.
""Let me stress anew the importance of all the countries concerning the South China Sea issues not resorting to force or coercion, but working toward peaceful resolutions of the disputes based on international law.""
The trip follows this month's meeting in Tokyo of the “Quad”, an informal grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States that Washington sees as a bulwark against China’s growing regional influence.
China has denounced the grouping of the four democracies as a ""mini-NATO"" aimed at containing its development.
""Our response in the South China Sea is not aimed at any one country,"" Suga said, when asked if Japan wanted to create an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
Suga must balance Japan’s deep economic ties with China against security concerns, including Beijing’s growing push to assert claims over disputed East China Sea isles.
Some in his ruling party want to see a harder line, after ties warmed under his predecessor, Shinzo Abe.
""Japan is determined to defend its territory, territorial waters and air space,"" Suga said, adding that Japan also opposed actions that raised tension in the East China Sea.
Several members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have territorial disputes with China in the vital South China Sea, but are wary of alienating the group's major economic partner and getting entangled in an intense confrontation between Washington and Beijing.
But some welcome Japan's greater engagement in the region.
Suga agreed with President Joko Widodo on Tuesday to speed talks on the export of Japanese defence gear and technology to Indonesia and have their defence and foreign ministers meet soon.
A day earlier, the Japanese leader and Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Xuan Phuc also agreed in principle on a military equipment and technology export pact.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 21, 2020 01:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Australian writer detained in Beijing told supporter he was a former Chinese spy,"By Kirsty Needham and Cate Cadell
SYDNEY/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Yang Hengjun, an Australian writer detained in Beijing and facing trial for espionage on behalf of a country China hasn't publicly named was a former Chinese spy, according to a confidential letter he wrote to a supporter in 2011.
In the detailed letter he wrote to his former teacher, which was reviewed by Reuters, Yang revealed he had worked for China’s Ministry of State Security for a decade from 1989, including in Hong Kong and Washington, before moving to Australia. 
The 55-year-old, who became a well-known pro-democracy blogger, faces 10 years or more in jail after Chinese authorities charged him with endangering national security by joining or accepting a mission from the unidentified espionage organisation, said Feng Chongyi, the Sydney-based liberal scholar who Yang sent the letter to.
Yang has previously proclaimed his innocence, saying last month: ""I will never confess to something I haven't done.""     
Feng revealed the letter's details about Yang's past as a Chinese spy for the first time, which had been rumoured in overseas Chinese dissident circles, as a preemptive move to counter potential misinformation at Yang's trial over spying for another country. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify Yang's claim that he spied for China and some other details of his letter.
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to a statement it made on Oct 12, when a spokesman confirmed Yang had been indicted on charges of espionage on Oct 7, and that the first hearing of the case was underway.
""Relevant Chinese authorities are handling the case in strict accordance with the law and Yang Jun's legal rights are fully protected,"" spokesman Zhao Lijian said at the time, referring to his Yang's legal name.
The Australian government referred Reuters to Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne's statement last week that Australia has seen no evidence to support the charge of espionage against Yang.
Yang's Beijing lawyers have been forbidden from speaking about the trial to media by Chinese authorities. 
The case underscores what Yang's supporters describe as a crackdown on liberal voices in China since 2016 under President Xi Jinping and comes at a time when diplomatic relations between Australia and China are already at a low ebb.
HONG KONG, WASHINGTON
Yang generated a strong following online more than a decade ago after writing hundreds of articles about Chinese, American and Taiwanese politics. 
He was first detained in China in 2011 by police on suspicion of being an instigator of Beijing’s Jasmine Revolution – short-lived protests spurred by online democracy activists. He was released after three days following interventions by the Australian government. 
In his May 2011 letter to Feng, Yang denied he was behind the protests and said he told police he worked for the MSS after 1989.
According to his letter, Yang worked for the MSS in Hong Kong from 1992 until the city's handover from Britain to China in 1997, and then in Washington.
Yang's cover in Hong Kong was at a travel service, while in Washington he worked as a think-tank researcher, Feng said, though the letter didn’t refer to these activities. 
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a further request for comment about Yang's work for MSS in Hong Kong and Washington.
Yang asked the Guangzhou police interrogating him in 2011 to contact the MSS to confirm his identity, but also told them he didn’t need permission to write publicly about Chinese democracy because he had left the security agency years earlier.
""I have changed my mind and discovered a better way to patriotism. That is to promote China's social progress and political system reform to achieve democratic modernization, not just being a spy,"" he told them, according to the letter.
A person answering the phone at the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau on Wednesday said he was unaware of the case and the office did not immediately respond to a faxed request seeking confirmation of Yang's detention and questioning in 2011.
Yang had quit the MSS when he migrated to Australia in 1999 to follow his family, and became an Australian citizen in 2002, said Feng, who supervised Yang's PhD studies at Sydney's University of Technology in 2006.
SPY STORIES
Yang spent the next four years writing spy novels.
The three novels, published in Taiwan, are about a double agent, also surnamed Yang. In his 2004 novel, Finishing Stroke, the CIA director, U.S. president and Taiwan’s president are embroiled in a plot line about tensions in the Taiwan Strait. 
During his 2011 detention, police had demanded to know how Yang could write the novels without divulging state secrets, according to Yang's written account.
""I know the boundary between love of country and treason,"" he replied, according to the 13-page letter.
In addition to the letter, another source confirmed he told close friends of his MSS history after his 2011 detention.
After his three day detention in 2011, he was detained again by police entering China from New York in January 2019.  
DEMOCRACY ADVOCATE
Feng said he believed Yang's detention was linked to a national police crackdown on ""foreign interference"" reported by state media in the same month. 
""In 2019, he was suspected of being a person with the potential of organising Colour Revolution,"" said Feng, referring to pro-democracy protest movements sometimes linked by critics to U.S. or Western interests, without providing more specifics.
China's foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the details of Yang's arrest. 
Yang was living in New York in 2019 as a visiting scholar at Columbia University who supplemented his income by working as a ""daigou"" or online shopping agent for Chinese consumers wanting American products. 
""Yang Hengjun is being punished for his publications criticising human rights abuses and other malpractice of the (Chinese Communist Party) in China, and for promoting China's transition to introducing democracy,"" said Feng, who was himself detained by security police in Guangzhou in 2017.
AUSTRALIAN CONCERNS
The Australian government has raised serious concerns about Yang's treatment during his 21 months in detention, saying he had been shackled at times last year, interrogated for extended periods, with limited access to lawyers and unable to see his wife. She is only allowed to pass a message to her husband through consular officials on a narrow range of topics.
Yang's wife Yuan Xiaoliang, who spoke to Reuters in Shanghai about their relationship but not Yang's case or his MSS past, said Yang would not betray his family and readers in China. 
She also expressed concern for her husband's health, noting he had lost weight and that Australian consular officers who visited him last year told her they observed he was shaking as he walked while in detention.

""I once hoped that they would let him go. But now it seems impossible,"" said Yuan, who has been granted a permanent resident visa by Australia, but is prevented by authorities from leaving China. ""I am worried that he will not be able to survive.""

(Reuters) - A U.S. safety board on Tuesday called for new safeguards for small passenger vessels following a September 2019 early morning boat fire in California that killed 34 people.
The 75-foot (23-m) recreational diving vessel, Conception, with 33 passengers and six crew aboard, was anchored off Santa Cruz Island when it caught fire. All 33 passengers and one crew member died of smoke inhalation because they were trapped in the berthing area while a fire burned above.
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) urged all vessels with overnight accommodations to be required to have interconnected smoke detectors in all passenger areas and secondary means of escape that lead into a different space from the primary exit.
The board also called on the U.S. Coast Guard to establish an inspection program to verify that roving patrols are conducted as required.
The Coast Guard said in a statement it would ""carefully consider"" the NTSB recommendations ""through a deliberate process, which will include review by all subject matter experts and senior leaders responsible for implementing the potential regulatory changes.""
The absence of a required roving patrol on the Conception likely delayed the initial detection of the fire and directly led to the high number of fatalities, the NTSB found.
""Our new recommendations will make these vessels safer, but there is no rule change that can replace human vigilance,"" NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said.
The NTSB determined the probable cause of the fire and subsequent sinking was the failure of Truth Aquatics, the owner and operator, to provide effective oversight of its vessel and crew operations.
A lawyer for the owner of the Conception did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. Attorney's Office has an active criminal investigation of the accident and the NTSB said prosecutors asked it not to interview the captain ""out of concern that the interview could hinder the ability of their office to bring criminal charges against the captain.""

The NTSB said a contributing factor was the lack of a Coast Guard regulatory requirement for smoke detection in all accommodation spaces.

The civil lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages against Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also named more than 20 other Saudis as defendants. It coincides with complications in the U.S.-Saudi relationship over the 2018 slaying of Khashoggi, Riyadh’s human rights record, its role in Yemen’s civil war and other issues.
The Saudi embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. The crown prince - known by his initials MbS - has denied ordering Khashoggi's murder.
Khashoggi, who criticized the policies of the crown prince, Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, in Washington Post columns, was killed and dismembered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. He went there to obtain papers he needed to marry Hatice Cengiz, a Turkish citizen.
Cengiz and Democracy for the Arab World Now (DAWN), a U.S.-based human rights group founded by Khashoggi, a legal resident of Virginia, filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. It names several of the crown prince's aides and officials who were convicted in Saudi Arabia of the murder. The prosecution declared the Saudi case closed.
The lawsuit charged that MbS, his co-defendants and others carried out a plot to ""permanently silence Mr. Khashoggi"" no later than the summer of 2018 after discovering his ""plans to utilize DAWN as a platform to espouse democratic reform and promote human rights.""
A lawsuit was filed in August in a U.S. court by a former top Saudi intelligence official who accused the crown prince of sending a hit team to kill him in Canada, where he lives in exile.

Both lawsuits were brought under a law allowing U.S. court actions against foreign officials over allegations of involvement in torture or extrajudicial killings.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former fundraiser for U.S. President Donald Trump pleaded guilty on Tuesday to a charge that he illegally lobbied Trump to drop an investigation into a Malaysian embezzlement scandal.
At a hearing before Washington D.C. federal Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly, Elliott Broidy, who held finance posts in Trump's 2016 campaign and on his inaugural committee, pleaded guilty to a felony charge that he conspired to violate the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA).
Prosecutors alleged that Broidy received millions of dollars in payments from an unnamed foreign national to try to arrange the end of a U.S. investigation into billions of dollars embezzled from 1MDB, a Malaysian government investment fund.
FARA requires people who lobby the U.S. government for foreign entities to register with the Justice Department, which Broidy admitted he had not done. He faces a maximum prison sentence of five years and agreed to forfeit $6.6 million.
Documents seen by Reuters show that Broidy also sought unsuccessfully to facilitate the U.S. extradition to China of multimillionaire Guo Wengui, who has engaged in U.S.- based anti-China political activities with former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon. 
Bannon presently faces unrelated federal charges that allege that he and three others defrauded donors to a campaign to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico.
The judge did not immediately impose a sentence on Broidy and set a hearing for February. She said with court approval, Broidy could travel outside the United States, and that he could travel inside the country with approval of pre-trial services officials.
Malaysian and U.S. authorities estimate $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB in an elaborate scheme that spanned the globe and implicated high-level officials in the fund, former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, executives at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and others

LAGOS (Reuters) - Authorities on Tuesday imposed a round-the-clock curfew on the Nigerian state of Lagos - including Africa's biggest city - in response to protests against alleged police brutality which they said had turned violent.
The national police chief also ordered the immediate deployment of anti-riot forces following increased attacks on police facilities, a police spokesman said.
The Lagos state governor's spokesman, Gboyega Akosile, said: ""The curfew will not end tomorrow. A 24-hour curfew means all round the clock, day and night. It is indefinite. Nobody moves until we lift the curfew.""
Citizens in the commercial capital stocked up on food after the announcement. Staples such as tomatoes and eggs were sold out in some places as women in markets closed shops and people queued at cash machines. 
GT Bank, one of the largest lenders in Nigeria, said all its branches would remain closed for the duration of the curfew. 
Thousands of Nigerians demanding an end to alleged police brutality have taken to the streets every day for nearly two weeks across the country. Amnesty International said at least 15 people had been killed since the protests began.
Rights groups had for years accused the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a police unit targeting violent crime, of extortion, harassment and torture. But a video allegedly showing SARS officers killing a man in Delta state sparked the protests. Police denied the incident, and disbanded SARS on Oct. 11, but protests have persisted. 
Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said the curfew would apply to all parts of the state, including the metropolis of Lagos, Africa's largest city with 20 million inhabitants. Only essential workers were exempted.
It had been imposed as the protests had turned violent, he said.
""I have watched with shock how what began as a peaceful #EndSARS protest has degenerated into a monster that is threatening the wellbeing of our society,"" Sanwo-Olu said.
A police station in the Orile Iganmu area of Lagos was set ablaze on Tuesday, TV news station Channels reported.
The Lagos Chamber of Commerce said Nigeria's economy had suffered an estimated loss of 700 billion naira ($1.84 billion)in the last 12 days due to the disruption. 
Early in the protests, police fired on protesters in the Surulere area of Lagos and elsewhere. Armed gangs have attacked protesters in Lagos and the capital Abuja.
The southwestern state of Ekiti imposed a curfew hours after the announcement in Lagos. Its governor said protests had been ""hijacked"" by criminals who sought to ""rape, assault, rob and extort innocent citizens"". 
The southern state of Edo on Monday imposed a similar curfew after a jailbreak by prisoners during protests. Police said they had strengthened security around prisons nationwide.
The speaker of Nigeria's lower chamber of parliament, Femi Gbajabiamila, said he would not sign off on the federal budget for 2021 unless it included provisions to compensate victims of police brutality over the past two decades.
Youth minister Sunday Dare said on Monday the government had met demonstrators' demands for talks on reforms in law enforcement and urged them to enter into dialogue..

The proposed amendment, defeated by a 59-58 margin, would have still allowed abortion on demand until 12 weeks into a pregnancy but would have doubled waiting periods to 96
hours, banned clinics from advertising services and made women
declare their reasons for termination.
The proposal drew concern not just in Slovakia but also its northern neighbour Poland, where rights activists say hundreds and possibly thousands of women cross the border to Slovakia every year for abortions that would be illegal at home.
Proponents of the proposal, mainly from a Christian faction within the ruling OLANO party, said it would help women make informed decisions and provide financial support
earlier in pregnancy.
""Our proposal to help pregnant women did not go through. I regret that my colleagues did not, in this difficult economic situation, support those most vulnerable - pregnant women and children,"" the law's main author, OLANO-Christian Union deputy Anna Zaborska, said on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
""In six months we will submit our proposal again.""
Opponents of the proposal including dozens of human rights groups said the amendment would put women under stress and might force some into accepting unsafe abortions. 
Just 17% of people in Slovakia favour tougher abortion rules, according to a poll published in July. 
Slovakia, unlike the neighbouring Czech Republic, is
majority Roman Catholic although the church is less influential
than in Poland, whose government is deeply conservative.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's president-elect Luis Arce told Reuters on Tuesday that there was ""no role"" in his government for socialist party leader Evo Morales, who governed for almost 14 years before resigning under pressure last year and fleeing the country.
Arce swept to power in a Sunday ballot, with the official count - technically still underway - showing him with a majority of the vote, ushering the Andean country's socialists back into office just a year after Morales left.
From exile in Argentina, Morales remains the president of Arce's party, the Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, but Arce said any influence will be limited to that position.
""He will not have any role in our government,"" Arce told Reuters at the MAS headquarters in Bolivia's administrative capital La Paz.
""He can return to the country whenever he wants, because he's Bolivian... but in the government it's me who has to decide who forms a part of the administration and who does not."" 
A divisive former coca grower who is lauded by some for improving the fortunes of the poorest in one of South America's most impoverished countries, Morales has lived outside Bolivia since he fled last year following a vote shrouded by allegations of fraud. Morales disputes the allegations and says he was toppled in a right wing coup.
Morales also faces a raft of corruption allegations, which he has denied.
""Due process rights have not been respected in several cases against him (Morales),"" Arce said. ""I regret that politics have been judicialized, the right has judicialized politics."" 
TIME FOR AUSTERITY?
As finance minister under Morales, Arce helped preside over an economy that was growing faster than almost any in the region. But when he assumes Bolivia's presidency next month, he will be taking over a country facing a crippling recession. 
""We will have to have austerity measures. There's no other option if we don't have enough income to cover our current expenditures,"" Arce said. 
The 57-year-old said the economic model he helped implement under Morales worked and will work once again.
The UK-educated socialist, who ran on a platform pledging welfare spending, said cuts would not affect public investment, which he said will be a ""priority"" to reactivate growth.
He added he would issue bonds ""if necessary,"" despite having criticized the conservative interim government of President Jeanine Anez for seeking to issue debt.
Bolivia's vast but largely untapped lithium reserves are also a potential economic booster, he said, which could become crucial if the world shifts aggressively toward electric cars and other battery-operated devices. 
Arce acknowledged that Bolivia needs a ""strategic partner"" to be able to successfully exploit its lithium reserves, but that done correctly it could bring in as much as $2 billion to Bolivia by the end of his five-year term.
He said he would not change the dollar peg of the nation's currency, the boliviano, citing fears of sharp depreciation.
Under Morales, Bolivia and the United States severed its diplomatic relationship. Arce said he wants to ""reestablish relationships with all countries"" but put the ball in Washington's court.

""If they want to reestablish a relationship with us, the only thing we ask for is that we are respected as equals,"" Arce said.

TOROELLA DE MONTGRI, Spain (Reuters) - Caught with their pants down and wearing face masks, U.S. President Donald Trump and his challenger Joe Biden are the stars of a new range of defecating figurines that are a longstanding Christmas tradition in the Spanish region of Catalonia. 
Known as ""caganers"" or ""poopers"" in English, the small statues offer a satirical take on the year's biggest news stories and are traditionally hidden in nativity scenes for friends and family to find.
Masked health workers who have become emblematic of the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, also feature prominently in the 2020 Christmas lineup alongside the presidential hopefuls.
""In these four years Trump has been an excellent caganer, I mean excellent in terms of sales,"" said caganer artisan Marc Alos, 49, from his workshop in the small Mediterranean town of Toroella de Montgri.
Such was the popularity of the Trump figure in the run-up to the 2016 elections that Alos felt certain he would take the White House, despite polls pointing to a Hillary Clinton victory.
""We said that the day before the U.S. elections, and he won."" 

With another fraught vote looming, Biden appears to have the edge in pooper sales but Alos said it is still early to make any election night predictions: ""We are at the very beginning and Joe Biden is working a little better for us, but I don't know how this will evolve.""

The study will include a component specifically examining racism in the police, as part of a compromise between the Social Democrats, who have long demanded such a study, and conservative interior minister Horst Seehofer, who was opposed.
Last month, 29 police officers were suspended for sharing pictures of Adolf Hitler and doctored images of refugees in gas chambers in private chats, in the most dramatic of recent incidents where uniformed state officials were found to be indulging in private the kind of racist attitudes they are duty-bound to oppose.
Calls for a study of racist attitudes in the police have been lent added weight by the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States, with activists saying the attitudes that led to the killing by a policeman of George Floyd, a Black man, could also be found in German law enforcement.
But Seehofer, who has always resisted calls for a study that singled out police as perpetrators of racism, said this latest study was not the one that activists had sought.
""There will be no study looking at allegations and aspersions cast against the police,"" he said. The compromise study will also consider violence and hate directed against police.
Activists and some politicians have long accused the police of not doing enough to unearth potentially violent nationalists in their ranks, a sensitive issue in Germany where awareness of the World War Two genocide of millions of Jews by the Nazis under Hitler is strong.

ROME (Reuters) - Pope Francis wore a mask for the first time at a public function on Tuesday when he and other religious leaders attended a prayer service for peace around the world.
The pope wore a white mask during the service at the Rome Basilica of Santa Maria in Aracoeli. Previously he wore masks only in a car taking him to his weekly audiences in the Vatican.
He had come under some criticism, particularly on social media, for not wearing a mask at his general audiences and sometimes coming in relatively close contact with visitors.
Francis, 83, attended the service with other Christian leaders in the basilica, including the Patriarch Bartholomew, spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians.
Simultaneously in other locations in Rome, Jews were praying in the city's synagogue and Buddhist, Sikh, Hindu and Muslim leaders also prayed for peace.
The event took place as the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus has risen steadily in Italy in the past few weeks.
There has also been a relatively small spike in the Vatican, where four members of the Swiss Guards, the elite and colourfully dressed corps that protects the pope, have also tested positive for COVID-19.
The annual event was started by the late Pope John Paul and Rome's Catholic Community of Sant' Egido in 1986. It was scaled down this year because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The pope took off his mask while he read his address, as did other leaders when they spoke, but put it back on when he finished speaking.
The pope had part of one lung removed during an illness when he was a young man in his native Argentina. He sometimes breathes heavily after climbing steps.

Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury and spiritual leader of the world's Anglicans, was to have attended the event but could not because of COVID-19 restrictions.

The situation in Farabougou, most of whose population is ethnic Bambara, has again underscored the government's difficulties imposing its authority in a part of the country where jihadists linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are gaining strength.
The siege began two weeks ago when the militants, who have generally sided with Fulani herders in their conflicts with farming communities like the Bambara, kidnapped several villagers and clashed with local hunters.
Malian troops have not been able to reach Farabougou by land because heavy rains have made the roads impassable, a local resident said. 
In a statement, Mali's armed forces said a transport plane had ""conducted a significant humanitarian action"" on Monday and Tuesday by dropping a cargo of basic necessities in Farabougou.
But a resident of a neighbouring village, who asked not to be named, said the supplies of grains and cooking oil were insufficient to meet the population's needs. 
""It's the status quo. The village is still under siege. No one goes in or out,"" he said. 
Central Mali has emerged over the past few years as the epicentre of Islamist and inter-ethnic violence in the country, part of a wider deterioration of security across West Africa's semi-arid Sahel region. 
The insecurity was one of the driving factors behind a military coup in Aug. 18 that overthrew then-President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - COVID-19 vaccines should have labels and packages with information only in English, European Union regulators have agreed, loosening multilingual requirements that could slow the roll-out of shots in the continent.
The move, meant to speed up the distribution of any vaccine if and when it is available, is also a testament to the dominant position of the English tongue in the 27-nation bloc - despite Brexit.
EU health experts have agreed to limit the information on jabs' labels and packages ""to one EU official language, preferably English,"" an EU document said.
Vaccine makers had urged the EU to soften during the pandemic rules that require them to have labels in the bloc's 24 official languages.
The document was adopted in late September and published last week on a little watched webpage of the EU Commission.
When the EU executive commission first flagged in early September the possibility of temporarily cutting the language requirements on vaccines, consumer groups warned against risks for patients who may be administered jabs improperly.
The document, which was prepared by the EU Commission and endorsed by health experts from EU countries, says that information should be omitted if countries opted for multilingual labels.
However, vaccine makers remain obliged to provide paper leaflets for each dose in the languages of the country where the shot will be administered, the document says.
But leaflets could be distributed separately from vaccines, the EU document says, in a move meant to speed up their roll-out but which critics fear could cause delayed deliveries of information leaflets.

""The commission and member states must demand vaccine manufacturers to ensure that printed leaflets are available when consumers get the vaccine,"" said Ancel la Santos, of the consumer group BEUC.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A festering government crisis over passage of a national budget could push Israel into its fourth election since mid-2019, further straining an economy hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
Crunch time is approaching: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bickering coalition, patched together in May, has by law until Dec. 23 to pass the 2020 budget, a move held up by political stalemate and successive national ballots.
Failure to do so by the deadline would automatically trigger an election that both right-wing Likud leader Netanyahu and his main governing partner, centrist Blue and White party chief Benny Gantz, insist they do not want.
Yet, Gantz wants a 2021 budget passed in tandem, saying it would speed up Israel's economic recovery and is demanding real progress be made soon. ""It's either a budget or elections,"" he told Ynet TV last week. 
Netanyahu says that with the December passage date fast approaching, working out the details of such a longer-term package now was impractical. 
It's a game of thrones, political and economic commentators said, with a budget crisis a potential means for Netanyahu to hold a new election and scupper a ""rotation"" pact under which he would hand over the premiership to Gantz in November 2021.
Rating agencies have cautioned that further budget delays would raise concerns about Israel’s ability to implement prudent fiscal policies and could affect credit ratings. 
Two national lockdowns to lower COVID-19 infection rates have dealt heavy blows the economy, already in recession and set to contract for the first time in two decades, with unemployment now above 12%.
""We've been giving the government the benefit of the doubt and expect some reasonable medium-term fiscal consolidation action -- steps taken by the government,"" Karen Vartapetov, a sovereign ratings director at S&P, told Reuters.
S&P is carrying out a review of Israel’s rating next month and Vartapetov said all options were open, including no ratings action, an outlook downgrade to ""negative"" from ""stable"" as well as a ratings reduction.
Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron has urged Netanyahu's government to accelerate the 2021 budget, saying last week on Army Radio that it could be completed in December.
While the budget battle plays out, Momi Dahan, a Hebrew University economist, said concern over ""amateur management"" of the economic crisis could weigh on investors and consumers.
STREET PROTESTS 
Three top finance ministry officials have already quit, in a sign of frustration over the budget bickering. Israel is still using a pro-rated version of the 2019 budget.
The power-sharing accord between Netanyahu and Gantz stipulated Israel would pass a biennial budget for 2020 and 2021 - a de-facto insurance policy for a smooth transition of power.
But with Netanyahu's trial over alleged corruption, which he denies, due to resume in January, a fresh ballot next year could delay proceedings.
A renewed mandate gained by Netanyahu at the ballot box might help supporters promote legislation to freeze his trial.
""Forget the pandemic, forget the economy, forget everything. Netanyahu wants to survive,"" said Reuven Hazan, a political scientist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University. ""We're basically in the hands of one person."" 
But another election soon would be risky for Netanyahu, even as he hails the economic potential of agreements on formal relations with United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
""The budget by nature is political. But it's normally political with a sense of responsibility,"" said former Bank of Israel Deputy Governor Nadine Baudot-Trajtenberg. ""Now it's political with no sense of responsibility. And that's what's so worrisome."" 
A spokesman for Netanyahu declined to comment and a Likud spokesman did not respond to a request to comment.
Street protests calling for Netanyahu's resignation have become commonplace. Opinion polls show only about 30% of Israelis believe he has handled the health crisis effectively, while Likud may lose a quarter of its parliament seats in an election.
Gantz has said Blue and White could quit the coalition and dissolve parliament if the crisis is not resolved, despite surveys showing weak support for his party in an imminent election.
Netanyahu, who has spearheaded free market reforms for nearly two decades, denies any ulterior motive in budget policy.

""I have always worked for the benefit of Israel's economy, many times against no small experts and I was always right,"" he said on Saturday.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia and Azerbaijan said on Tuesday their foreign ministers would meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Washington on Friday in efforts to end the heaviest fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh since the 1990s.
The State Department did not immediately comment. But the planned meetings suggest that, just before the U.S. presidential election, Washington is stepping up involvement in moves to calm a conflict that has killed hundreds of people since Sept. 27. 
Russia has until now driven mediation efforts over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave within Azerbaijan that is controlled by ethnic Armenians, but two ceasefires brokered by Moscow this month have not stopped the fighting.
The two ex-Soviet republics said there was intense fighting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday, with the enclave reporting 43 more of its defence personnel had been killed.
The violence has raised fears that regional powers Turkey and Russia could be sucked into a wider conflict, and concern about the security of pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry natural gas and oil to world markets.
It was not immediately clear whether the warring sides' foreign ministers would meet Pompeo separately or at the same time. 
Azerbaijan said its foreign minister, Jeyhun Bayramov, would also meet envoys of the OSCE security and rights watchdog's so-called Minsk Group, whose co-chairs Russia, France and the United States have for years led mediation in the conflict.
Armenia released few details about Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan's plans in Washington. 
Turkey is also part of the Minsk Group but has not been involved in mediation, and its relations with its NATO allies have been further strained by the fighting.
Ankara has denied accusations that it sent mercenaries from the conflicts in Syria and Libya to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh. It has stepped up arms sales to Azerbaijan this year but denies any direct involvement in the fighting.
MORE FIGHTING, ANGRY RHETORIC
In an interview, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian accused Turkey of destabilising the South Caucasus with its strong backing for Azerbaijan. 
But he told France-24 television that he did not advocate military intervention by Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, or other countries that could lead to ""another Syria.""
In comments to Azerbaijan's parliament, Turkish Parliament Speaker Mustafa Sentop portrayed Armenia as the aggressor and criticised mediation by Paris, Moscow and Washington.
""If they are sincere on their path to peace, those who have held Armenia's leash and supported it for years need to end this dangerous game now and stop supporting Armenia. Azerbaijan does not have another 30 years to wait,"" Sentop said.
The Minsk Group, he said, ""is brain dead"".
Turkey and Azerbaijan want an end to what they call Armenian occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh, and Azerbaijan wants Turkey involved in peacemaking. Armenia rules this out and accuses Azerbaijan of making a land grab.
In a speech to the nation, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said Baku was willing to end fighting as soon as possible to complete the restoration of what it sees as its territorial integrity.
Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh reported new artillery battles on Tuesday and said fighting was intense in southern areas of the conflict zone.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry also reported fighting in several areas, including disputed territory close to the line of contact dividing the sides. It said Armenian forces were shelling the Azeri regions of Terter and Aghdam.
Nagorno-Karabakh says 772 of its military and 37 civilians have been killed in the fighting since Sept. 27. 

Azerbaijan says 61 Azeri civilians have been killed and 291 wounded, but has not disclosed its military casualties in the worst bloodshed since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000.

KOMBOLCHA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Widow-of-ten Marima Wadisha screamed, threw rocks and in her desperation even fired bullets at the locusts that descended on her sorghum fields in northeast Ethiopia.
But the insect swarms were so relentless that her entire crop - her family's only source of income - was destroyed.
""They never left for a week. We are left with an empty harvest, we tie our waist and cry day and night. How can (I) feed ... my children like this,"" she said, surrounded by five of them as she held a bundle of damaged sorghum.
The locust invasion is Ethiopia's worst in 25 years, United Nations food agency FAO says.
It has damaged an estimated 200,000 hectares of land there since January, threatening food supplies - a single square kilometre swarm can eat as much food in a day as 35,000 people - and the livelihoods of millions.
It is part of a once-in-a-lifetime succession of swarms that have plagued East Africa and the Red Sea region since late 2019, with the coronavirus pandemic exacerbating the crisis this year by disrupting the FAO's supply chain of pesticides and other equipment to fight them off.
""The biggest challenge now in the region is here, in Ethiopia and we are working on that together with our partners like the FAO,"" said the Desert Locust Control Organization's Eastern Africa Director for Eastern Africa Stephen Njoka.
Conflict and chaos in Yemen, where some of the swarms originated, have made spraying pesticide by airplane at source impossible. That combined with unusually heavy rains have swelled the swarms spreading across Ethiopia.
The World Bank has said the insects could cost East Africa and Yemen $8.5 billion this year, and the FAO's Ethiopia representative Fatouma Seid fears the pattern of destruction will be repeated next year.
""Infestation will continue into 2021. We are being re-invaded and the swarms will then go to Kenya,"" she said.

The schemes allow wealthy foreigners to buy citizenship in exchange for an investment of around 1 million euros ($1.2 million) in Malta and 2 million euros in Cyprus.
The European Commission said the decision was taken because the two member states granted nationality – and thereby EU citizenship – without requiring ""a genuine link with the country"", as passport holders were not obliged to reside there.
The Commission also sent a letter to Bulgaria raising concerns about its passport-for-sale scheme, it said in a statement.
""There cannot be a weak link in EU efforts to curb corruption and money laundering,"" Values and Transparency Commissioner Vera Jourova said.
Malta's Finance Minister Edward Scicluna said on Tuesday the country was replacing its current scheme with a new programme that would introduce tighter vetting of applicants, who will have to be residents of the islands for a year before their applications can be considered.
The commission has refrained from launching legal actions against EU states that sell residence permits, also known as ""golden visa schemes"", without requiring investors to stay in the country for a meaningful period, despite a European Parliament resolution urging such a move.
In a 2019 report the commission acknowledged golden visa and golden passport schemes posed similar money-laundering and organised crime risks.
Portugal, Greece and Bulgaria currently offer golden visa schemes under these lax conditions, a practice of which Latvia was pioneer in Europe. 
Cyprus said last week it was suspending its citizenship-for- investment programme, ditching a scheme the government had acknowledged was open to abuse after an investigation by Al Jazeera, a media outlet.
The commission said it would need concrete actions to stop the practice.
The EU cannot ban such schemes, but it can force countries to require ""effective residence"", meaning physical presence for a regular and extended period in the territory of the state concerned.
Both states circumvented those rules, the commission said.
The Cypriot and Maltese governments have two months to take action. Without meaningful changes, the commission could refer them to the bloc's Court of Justice and ultimately it can ask the court to impose penalties.

The anti-narcotics unit in charge of the operation reported that the total amount of drugs seized in the Terport de Villeta port, some 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Paraguayan capital, was 2,327 kilos.
The authorities said that the cocaine was hidden in a shipment of six charcoal containers that were to be shipped to Israel. ""The drugs were in one of the containers, in 4-kilo bags,"" Commissioner Osvaldo Ávalos told reporters.
The police arrested two people identified as responsible for planning the export and the prosecution identified one of them as a former director of the state television channel.

In a proposal submitted to the country's security council this month, the Finance Ministry suggested slashing Russia's military personnel by 10%, a figure that would amount to some 100,000 troops, the Izvestia newspaper reported on Tuesday. 
Some of those military officers would be given civilian posts instead, according to the proposal.
The Defence Ministry said similar moves in the past had highlighted ""inefficiency and led to numerous problematic issues affecting the combat capacity of the Armed Forces"".
It said it had sent its position to the security council ""on the unacceptability of these proposals and the absence of support for them from the leadership of the military department"".
""The proposal by the finance ministry to reduce the number of (military) posts will have zero economic effect,"" the Defence Ministry said in a statement carried by Krasnaya Zvezda, its official newspaper. 
The Finance Ministry, which also proposed raising the number of years of service required to receive a military pension, did not respond to a request for comment. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that no decision had been made on the matter, the Interfax news agency reported. 
In July, the Finance Ministry had proposed cutting state spending on the military by 5% between 2021 and 2023.
Military expenditures have increased during Vladimir Putin's presidency, but the Kremlin said in 2018 that Russia would cut its defence budget to less than 3% of GDP within the next five years.
Russia last year was the world's fourth-largest military spender, increasing its military expenditures by 4.5% to $65.1 billion from the previous year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. That amount corresponded to 3.9% of its gross domestic product, it said. 
Exact figures for military funding are considered a state secret in Russia.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - In an historic first visit by a Gulf Arab nation, a United Arab Emirates delegation arrived in Israel on Tuesday, accompanied by top U.S. officials, to cement a normalisation deal signed last month.
The UAE and Gulf neighbour Bahrain became the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to sign deals to establish formal ties with Israel despite ongoing differences over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. 
The deals, forged largely over shared fears of Iran, were brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of next month's U.S. presidential election.
""We are making history in a way that will stand for generations,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in welcoming Emirati Economy Minister Abdullah bin Touq al-Mari and Minister of State for Financial Affairs Obaid Humaid al-Tayer.
They were accompanied by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other American officials on the flight from Abu Dhabi to Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.
""I think that the visit of such a high level delegation from the UAE... will show our peoples, the region and the entire world the benefit of having friendly, peaceful and normal exchanges,"" Netanyahu said.
Four agreements were signed – relating to investment, scientific cooperation, civil aviation and visa exemptions during the visit, which was restricted to the airport due to coronavirus concerns.
Tayer said the deals offered ""great opportunities"" to ""achieve prosperity for both our ecnomies, and our people"".
Citing discussions on taxation and financial relations, he said there had already been significant progress between the two governments and added: ""We look forward to welcoming you to the UAE in the near future.""
PALESTINIAN ANGER
Washington and its allies have said the deals would foster regional peace and stability. But they have prompted anger from the Palestinians.
Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization said Tuesday's UAE visit came amid Israeli settlement expansion and was ""shameful"".
""The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance,"" he said in Ramallah, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said: ""Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands.""
Mnuchin, the most senior U.S. official to attend, called it an ""historic occasion,"" adding: ""With greater economic prosperity comes stronger security.""
Reflecting a realignment of regional powers concerned about Iran, he added that Israel, the UAE and USA ""share a similar outlook regarding threats and opportunities in the region.""
Another U.S. official in attendance, International Development Finance Corporation head Adam Boehler, said the three countries would set up a fund, initially projected to raise $3 billion, to encourage private-sector investment and regional cooperation.
He said he envisaged funding to enable the modernisation of Israeli-operated checkpoints for Palestinians.
The U.S. officials had on Sunday joined an Israeli delegation to Bahrain for a signing ceremony to formalise ties.
Israel and the UAE have already signed several commercial deals since mid-August, when they first announced they would establish full relations.

Serbia last month suspended military drills with foreign troops for six months, citing pressure from the EU to withdraw from joint exercises with Russia and Belarus.
The Russian government order, dated Oct. 15 and signed by Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, said the head of the proposed office would assist in resolving military and technical questions over Russian-Serbian cooperation.
The agreement, once signed by both parties, would give the Russian official in Serbia the right to visit Serbian divisions that use Russian weapons and military equipment, provided prior notice and consent were given. 
Officials from Serbia's defence ministry could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Serbia, whose military is based on ex-Soviet weapons technology, has procured MiG-29 fighter jets as well as helicopters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers from Russia in recent years. 
On Oct. 10, in a show of revamped military power, Serbia's army staged a major training exercise, demonstrating combat use of Russian-made weapons, including the Pantsir anti-aircraft system. It also displayed combat drones recently acquired from China.
Serbia is performing a delicate balancing act between its ambition to join the EU and its historical ties with Russia and China, which support its refusal to recognise the independence of its former southern province Kosovo.
Russia, meanwhile, is vying to keep fellow Orthodox Christian, Slavic Serbia within its sphere of geopolitical influence, with the opening of a defence ministry office a signal of Moscow's intent.

The Grand Mosque of Pantin, a low-income suburb on the capital's northeastern outskirts, had shared a video on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page before the attack that vented hatred against history teacher Samuel Paty. 
Police plastered notices of the closure order outside the mosque as the authorities promised a tough response against the disseminators of hate messages, preachers of radicalised sermons and foreigners believed to pose a security threat to France.
The six-month order was ""for the sole purpose of preventing acts of terrorism"", the notice issued by the head of the Seine-Saint-Denis department read.
The beheading of a public servant by a suspected Islamist for his use of religious satire to explore with students the debate surrounding freedom of expression, a deeply cherished tenet of democracy in secular France, has convulsed the country and shocked the world.
President Emmanuel Macron is increasingly concerned by what he calls Islamist separatism: the attempt by hostile elements within France's large Muslim community to impose conservative Islamic beliefs over the traditional values of the French Republic in some communities.
""ENEMY WITHIN""
Interior Minister Gerald Darmain said this week France was confronted by an ""enemy within"". 
The rector of the Grand Mosque of Panin, M'hammed Henniche, this weekend expressed regret over sharing the video on social media, after it emerged Paty had become the victim of a vicious online campaign of intimidation even before he was killed.
In the video, the Muslim father of one of Paty's students said the history teacher had singled out Muslim students and asked them to leave his class before showing the cartoons. He called Paty a thug and said he wanted the teacher removed. 
Henniche told Agence France Presse he had shared the video, filmed by the father of a student at Paty's school, not to endorse the complaint but out of concern for Muslim children.
The student's father is now in police custody.
Calls by Reuters to the mosque on Tuesday went unanswered. 
""There's no room for violence in our religion"", the mosque said in a statement published on Facebook on Monday. ""We strongly condemn this savagery."" 
One Pantin resident, who gave her name as Maya and said her husband prayed at the mosque, called the closure ""sad for our community"".

The payment of $335 million is part of a deal with the United States to get Sudan removed from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, which has been a hurdle for Khartoum as it sought debt relief and external borrowing.
Sudan has transferred the required amount, bank governor Mohamed al-Fatih Zainelabidine told a news conference
Acting Finance Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali also said that Sudan needed to accelerate the adjustment of its foreign exchange rate.
Sudan is in the midst of an economic crisis which has accelerated since the overthrow of Islamist autocrat Omar al-Bashir last year.
Thanks to U.S. sanctions going back to the 1990s, Sudan has been largely cut off from the international banking system. But Zainelabidine said local banks would restore correspondence relations next week following the U.S. move.
The Sudanese pound has fallen on the black market to 220 versus the dollar, while the official exchange rate is around 55. But since the U.S. announcement on Monday the pound has gained from 250 the day before on the black market.
Ali gave no details on the future foreign exchange policies.

BASHIQA, Iraq (Reuters) - Saad Hussein, a 42-year-old Yazidi Iraqi, is one of the last in the northern region of Nineveh producing the anise-flavoured spirit, arak, from local dates.
Forced to flee his home town of Bashiqa, close to Mosul, when it fell to Islamic State in 2014, he returned after the defeat and expulsion of the Islamic militants to reopen his small distillery. 
""This is part of our heritage, but it's almost extinct. There is almost no one here in the area that does it,"" he said.
""I have always loved the craft, and used to work in it previously. So I wanted to revive this craft,"" 
He hopes to introduce the drink to a new generation, after most of the Christian and Yazidi Iraqis with whom it was popular fled the area.
The Yazidis are an ancient religious minority who combine Zoroastrian, Christian, Manichean, Jewish and Muslim beliefs. The group was brutally persecuted by Islamic State who viewed the Yazidis as devil worshippers.
It slaughtered more than 3,000 Yazidis, enslaved 7,000 women and girls and displaced most of the 550,000-strong community from its traditional home in northern Iraq.
Hussein fills vast blue vats with dates, adds water and pulps the sweet fruit. He then places the mixture in a sealed pot and heats it to distil the alcohol. 
This is an old method that has been used exclusively in the city for decades, he explained. 
""Our Christian brothers were our main clients for this product. But immigration is part of the reason [our business suffered],"" he said. 
Imported spirits also crushed the market, which was once so large it sustained numerous small local distilleries.
Ghazwan Khairi is a customer of Hussein's. 

""I know that [his] work is great, I know what materials he uses and where he gets them. Also the flavour is great,"" he said, as he departed Hussein's workshop with a bottle.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan said on Tuesday it would take countermeasures to ensure next year's Tokyo Olympics are not derailed by cyberattacks after Britain and the United States accused Russia of orchestrating efforts to disrupt the Games.
Olympics organisers reported no significant impact on their operations for the 2020 Games, which were postponed until next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Britain and the United States on Monday condemned what they said were a series of malicious cyberattacks orchestrated by Russian military intelligence, including attempts to disrupt the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied the allegations, attributing them to ""Russophobia"". He told reporters: ""Russia has never carried out any hacking activities against the Olympics.""
Japanese chief cabinet secretary Katsunobu Kato said Japan would make every effort to protect the Games from possible hacking attempts.
""We cannot turn a blind eye to malicious cyberattacks that threaten democracy,"" Kato told a news conference, adding that Japan was gathering and analysing information and in close contact with Britain and the United States.
""The Olympics are a major international event that attract attention, and cybersecurity measures are extremely important.""
British officials said on Monday the hackers from Russia's GRU military intelligence agency had also conducted ""cyber reconnaissance"" operations against Tokyo Games organisers.
They declined to give specific details about the latest attacks or say whether they were successful but said they had targeted Games organisers, logistics suppliers and sponsors.
The organising committee said in a statement they had already made extensive cybersecurity preparations and that there had been little disruption to its platforms. 
DOPING SCANDAL
""While we have constantly monitored various types of cyberattack on the digital platforms owned by Tokyo 2020, no significant impact has been observed in our operations,"" spokesman Masa Takaya said.
Olympic sponsor Panasonic (OTC:PCRFY) Corp said in a statement it was strengthening its global monitoring efforts, adding: ""We did not detect any evidence of an attack.""
A representative for fellow sponsor  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp declined to comment. 
A string of hacking attempts have been conducted against international sporting organisations which Western officials and cybersecurity experts say were orchestrated by Russia since its doping scandal erupted five years ago. 
Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations.
Russia was banned from the world's top sporting events for four years in December over widespread doping offences, including the Tokyo Games. 
An International Olympic Committee (IOC) spokesman said cybersecurity was one of their priorities. 
""The IOC and the Organising Committees of the Olympic Games have identified cyber security as a priority area and invest a lot to offer the Olympic Games the best cyber security environment possible,"" the spokesman told Reuters in an email.

""Given the nature of the topic, we do not divulge those measures.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Several thousand students and workers protested in Indonesia's capital Jakarta on Tuesday against President Joko Widodo's new jobs law, the latest in a series of rallies opposing legislation that the government says is needed to attract investment.
Dressed in yellow, blue and green jackets denoting their universities, students demanded the president, widely known as Jokowi, revoke the so-called ‘omnibus’ bill that critics say harms labour rights and the environment.
""Our main problem here is that the bill does not accommodate what the people want,"" Remy Hastian, a student from the State University of Jakarta, told Reuters at the rally.
It was the latest in a series of protests that have erupted across the archipelago in recent weeks, some of which have ended in sporadic violence and thousands of arrests. 
""When I graduate, there won't be a job for me,"" said Sigit Ari Sandi, a student from Bogor, who singled out measures aimed at loosening rules on minimum wages. 
Tuesday’s protest, which was joined by joined by labour groups, marked one year since Jokowi was inaugurated for a second term in office. 
He comfortably won the re-election last year but in an opinion poll released by Kompas newspaper on Tuesday, 46.3% of respondents said they were dissatisfied with the first year of his second term, while 39.7% said they were satisfied.
On Tuesday, Jokowi is meeting Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who is visiting Southeast Asia's largest economy for talks that will cover security and are likely to include investment.
The flagship jobs legislation, a revision of more than 70 existing laws that was passed on Oct 5, is designed to remove longstanding impediments to doing business by cutting red tape, easing restrictions on foreign investment and boosting labour market competitiveness. The government says it will lead to widespread employment generation.
But trade unions, student groups, academics and civil society groups say the legislation harms protection for workers, including those on minimum wages, severance pay and maternity benefits, and weakens environmental protection.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - U.S. pressure on Sudan to normalise ties with former adversary Israel has stirred public debate on a topic that was long taboo, exposing splits that could complicate any swift settlement of a deal.
An agreement between Sudan and Israel may have edged closer on Monday when U.S. President Donald Trump signalled that Washington would remove Khartoum from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. 
Military figures leading Sudan's political transition have appeared open to normalising ties, but civilian groups including left-wing and Islamist politicians are more reluctant. 
A technocratic government has so far rebuffed U.S. advances aimed at pushing Sudan to follow the lead of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both of which signed agreements to establish formal ties with Israel at the White House last month.
Khartoum's caution reflects concerns that such a major foreign policy move at a time of deep economic crisis could upset the delicate balance between military and civilian factions, and even put the government at risk, two senior Sudanese government sources said.
""Taking a historic decision over relations with Israel requires a situation of economic and political stability in the country,"" said one of the sources.
""After the lifting of U.S. sanctions, Sudan could discuss dialogue about normalisation with Israel and its benefits to Sudan, according to Sudan's interests."" 
Sudan, which historically has been staunchly opposed to Israel, is 18 months into a political transition after autocrat Omar al-Bashir was forced from power following popular protests.
The government faces spiralling inflation of more than 200% and has struggled to provide basic commodities and services. The coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding have added to its woes.
Removal from the terrorism list -- once Khartoum sets aside $335 million it agreed to pay to U.S. victims of militant attacks and their families -- could help ease economic pain, partly by unlocking international financing and debt relief.
Washington has offered Sudan development and humanitarian help, U.S. and Gulf-based sources said in September, after U.S. officials and military head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan discussed the issue of Israel in September.
But while the United States has been lobbying hard for Sudan to normalise with Israel just as it finalises Khartoum's removal from the list, Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has argued the two issues should not be linked. 
NEED FOR TIME
""It is not possible for an entire people to be forced to normalise in a week or two,"" acting Finance Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali told Sudanese TV on Monday. 
""If it is our wish to normalise relations with Israel, we must give a suitable chance for the issue to be studied in detail.""
Despite apparent support from Burhan, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda in February, and his military deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who recently praised Israel's economic development, a rapid move to normalise ties could fracture the civilian coalition they share power with.
""Our view of the Zionist entity remained fixed -- that it is a racist entity hostile to all national liberation movements,"" said Sadiq Farouk, a Communist Party leader from the coalition that backs the government.
Hamdok has said he is not authorised to decide on ties with Israel. ""With this position, Hamdok wants to avoid any decision that might lead to a split in the ruling coalition that supports the government,"" said Fath Alrahman Ahmed of Khartoum's Al-Neelain University.
Recognising Israel could also trigger a backlash from Islamist factions loyal to Bashir that have sought to discredit the transition. 
Still, people have been able to signal support for establishing ties publicly for the first time. 
A former member of parliament, Abulgasem Bartum, says he is planning a private trip with 40 Sudanese businesspeople, sportspeople, and cultural figures to Israel as a confidence building measure next month.
In Jerusalem, Zvi Hauser, chairman of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, told public broadcaster Kan Israel could help the region with science and technology and he hoped Sudan joined the ""wave"" of recognition.
Some younger Sudanese, less wedded to the Palestinian cause than their parents or grandparents, say they could also back the move. 
""I have no objection to Sudan having normal relations with Israel if this is in the interest of the country,"" said Ahmed Ibrahim, a 30-year-old telecommunications company employee. 

""We want jobs, health, education and a better life ... Sudan should take care of itself.""

The Federal Prosecutor's Office (GBA) said on Tuesday it has filed charges against the men, identified as Alexander S. and Alexander O. under German privacy laws, for allegedly ""acting commercially for the secret service of a foreign power"".
The indictment comes amid friction between Germany and Russia following the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, which Chancellor Angela Merkel has demanded Moscow explain.
Alexander S. is charged with selling machine tools for around 8 million euros ($9.4 million) to a state-owned armaments group that manufactures missile systems for the Russian army in the period from Jan. 2016 to Jan. 2018.
Prosecutors said Alexander S. exported the tools to Russia in seven deliveries and deceived Germany's export control authorities by specifying sham recipients and falsifying end-use certificates. They did not give detilas of the tools.
The European Union imposed a ban on selling and exporting so-called dual-use goods that may be intended in whole, or part for military purposes, to Russia in 2014 due to its involvement in the war in Ukraine.
Alexander O. is charged with assisting Alexander S. by maintaining contacts with the recipients of the deliveries and being present when the transactions were discussed. He is said to have received commission payments.
The defendant Alexander S. was arrested in February and has been in custody since then, while Alexander O. is still at large, the GBA said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Tuesday it would be ready to freeze its total number of nuclear warheads if the United States did the same in order to extend their last major arms control treaty by a year.
The offer, two weeks before the U.S. presidential election, appeared to narrow the gap between the two sides over the fate of the New START agreement, which is due to expire in February.
The United States last week rejected a Russian offer to unconditionally extend the pact for one year, saying that any proposal that did not envisage freezing all nuclear warheads was a ""non-starter"".
But a statement published by the Russian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday suggested that the two countries' positions had moved closer.
""Russia is proposing to extend New START by one year and is ready together with the United States to make a political commitment to 'freeze' the number of nuclear warheads held by the parties for this period,"" it said. 
New START, signed in 2010, imposes limits on the two countries' strategic nuclear arsenals.
Extending it would mark a rare bright spot in the fraught relationship between the two countries. Failure to do so would remove the main pillar maintaining the nuclear balance between them and add yet another element of tension.
The Russian foreign ministry said the warhead freeze and one-year extension would be possible if Washington did not make any additional demands. It said the extension would give the two sides time to discuss nuclear arms control in greater depth. 
Moscow and Washington have been at odds over the treaty despite several months of talks. The United States has called for China to be included in a broader treaty that would replace New START. China has rejected that proposal. 
Last year the United States pulled out of a Cold War-era arms control pact banning ground-launched nuclear and conventional ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of between 310 and 3,400 miles (500-5,500 km), citing Russian violations denied by Moscow.

Lobsang Sangay, the president of the Tibetan Central Administration (CTA), met the new U.S. special coordinator on Tibet last week. Sangay said it was the first time that the head of the CTA had been received at the State Department.
""China will take all necessary measures to protect its interests,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said during a daily news conference in Beijing on Tuesday.
China's irritation with the United States over Tibet comes at a time when relations between the two world powers are at their lowest point in decades over a range of issues, including trade, Taiwan, human rights, the South China Sea and the coronavirus.
Describing Sangay as an anti-China separatist, Zhao said the United States should cease any official contact with him.
The meeting ""sent a seriously wrong signal to Tibetan independence forces,"" he said. 
""The U.S. should immediately stop using the Tibet issue to interfere in China's internal affairs.""
China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it describes as a ""peaceful liberation"". International human rights groups and exiles routinely condemn what they call China's oppressive rule in Tibetan areas. 
Since its formation in 1959, the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamshala in northern India. China's relations with India became fraught in recent months following a bloody clash between troops stationed on the disputed Himalayan border.

PARIS (Reuters) - Restaurateur Pascal Mousset has a new menu he hopes will persuade his patrons to change the habit of a lifetime in response to Paris's coronavirus curfew, by - perish the thought - eating dinner as early as the English.
They can order his 19-euro ""After Work"" offering of foie gras, boar pate and calamari until 8:00 p.m., an hour before the lockdown takes effect in the capital and eight other cities - and just when they might normally be contemplating their starters.
Mousset, whose restaurant Chez Francoise is popular with lawmakers, throws in two glasses of beer or wine to help wash the food down. 
""We said to ourselves we have two options: close in the evenings and turn off the lights or do something positive,"" he said, after last week's announcement of the new curbs gave the trade just 48 hours to adapt.
The French have long considered themselves more culinarily sophisticated than their British neighbours.
They tend to baulk at the prospect of having to eat their evening meal too early or rush their wine and, for some, the jury's still out on whether such behaviour might now be permissible.
""We'll see if we can get used to the Anglo-Saxon habit of eating out at 7.30 p.m.,"" said self-employed Denis Alexandre, 53, lunching with a friend in a favourite restaurant in the affluent 16th arrondissement.
Others like Xavier Denamur, who owns five bars and restaurants, are turning to takeout deliveries - permitted post-curfew - to make ends meet during the six weeks for which the night-time shutdown is scheduled to last.
He says his staff are struggling to adjust. ""My barmen have become delivery-boys. Logistically, it's a bit of a mess.""
But they still have at least one resolutely un-British touch of refinement to fall back on - delivering the meals on porcelain plates.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Australia will join three-way naval exercises involving the United States, Japan and India, in a move that could provoke concern from China, which has criticised similar joint drills in the past.
Here are some of the most common questions on the Malabar exercise: 
WHAT IS THE MALABAR EXERCISE?
The Malabar naval exercise began in 1992 as a training event between the United States and India. Japan joined it in 2015, but Australia has not participated since 2007. 
The exercise was conducted off the coast of Guam in the Philippine Sea in 2018 and off the coast of Japan in 2019. 
This year's drills are likely to be held in the Bay of Bengal and the Gulf, India's defence ministry says. Dates have not yet been confirmed.
WHY IS IT SIGNIFICANT?
It will be the first time that the United States, India, Japan and Australia - the informal grouping known as the Quad - have participated in a joint military exercise of this size. 
The four democracies in the Indo-Pacific hope the exercise can act as a counterweight to Chinese military and political influence in the region.
India, which is locked in a military stand-off on the disputed land border with China, hopes the expansion of the exercise will contain what it sees as Beijing's intrusion into its territory, analysts say. 
""The road to peace in the mountains may lie through the sea,"" a leading newspaper, the Hindustan Times, said in an editorial on Tuesday. 
WHAT SHIPS WILL PARTICIPATE?
""It will be the best of the best,"" said Captain D K Sharma, a defence analyst at BharatShakti.in and a former Indian navy official. 
India, which last year sent two smaller warships, was likely to send a larger carrier this time as smaller distances are involved, Sharma said. 
The United States already has the supercarriers Nimitz in the Gulf and Ronald Reagan in the Bay of Bengal, both possible participants in the drill.
Japan's navy is likely to send one of its two 'Izumo-class' helicopter carriers, Sharma said, the largest in its fleet and which have been part of the exercise for several years. 
Australia could send one of its newest ships, such as the destroyer Hobart, he added. 
HOW WILL COVID-19 AFFECT THE EXERCISE?
Participants usually meet in the host country before the drills begin, as well as exchanging crew members for observation purposes. 
But India's defence ministry has said this year's exercise will be ""non-contact"", meaning participants will not meet in person, nor will crews be transferred between ships, as a precaution against the coronavirus.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Attorneys for Mexico's former defense minister, Salvador Cienfuegos, were due in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday as prosecutors seek to have him held without bond on charges that he used his power in office to protect a major drug cartel.
Cienfuegos, 72, is charged with four counts of drug trafficking and money laundering. His lawyers may also tell the court whether their client will fight attempts to send him to New York, where the indictment was handed down in a U.S. district court.
It was not clear if Cienfuegos, who appeared at his first hearing last week via video link from a federal detention center, would be present for the proceedings.
He was arrested last week at Los Angeles International Airport over accusations that he took bribes in return for protection for alleged cartel members, which included warning them about U.S. investigations.
Prosecutors have accused Cienfuegos of using his office to protect the H-2 narcotics cartel, directing operations against rival gangs and finding maritime transport for shipments of drugs such as heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.
The arrest of Cienfuegos - nicknamed El Padrino, or ""The Godfather,"" in an August 2019 indictment that was sealed until last week - marked the first time a former Mexican defense minister has been indicted and detained.

Cienfuegos has not yet entered a plea to the charges. During a brief court appearance last week Cienfuegos' attorneys asked that his bond hearing be postponed to give them more time to prepare.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The NATO military alliance is considering a summit in March in Brussels to welcome a new U.S. president if Democrat candidate Joe Biden wins, diplomats and officials said, with a gathering in the first half of next year if Donald Trump is reelected.
While the U.S.-led alliance agreed last year to hold a summit in 2021, a meeting in the spring would be an early chance to repair transatlantic ties if Biden were to be voted into the White House on Nov. 3, after a bruising four years under Trump.
Trump has said that the Western alliance is ""obsolete"" and some allies are ""delinquent"" as well as issuing a veiled threat in July 2018 to pull the United States out of the alliance.
He also announced his intention earlier this year to cut the U.S. troop contingent in Germany, faulting Berlin for failing to meet NATO's defence spending target and accusing it of taking advantage of the United States on trade.
Biden, who leads in opinion polls, is seen in Europe as offering a shift in U.S. policy away from Trump's 'America First' agenda, which has undermined European priorities on issues from climate to the Iran nuclear deal.
""Most allies want a Biden victory next month, but they would obviously work with a reelected Trump administration,"" one diplomat at NATO's Brussels headquarters said.
A March summit ""would give Biden a platform to bring Europe and North America back together and also give NATO a chance to put the Trump era behind it,"" a second diplomat said.
Two officials echoed that statement. They and the two diplomats also said that if Trump were reelected, NATO would seek to hold a summit in early summer, but that there was less urgency because he had already attended NATO summits and his position was seen as likely to harden.
The now 30-member North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, which was created in 1949 to confront the threat of the communist Soviet Union, declined to comment.
COVID-19
NATO summits, with their pomp and gravitas, have traditionally been the setting for the nuclear-armed alliance to showcase its unity and agree new political and military goals in its long stand-off with Russia.
In a potential twist of fate, any NATO summit next year is likely to hear the results of a report commissioned in 2019 on reforms to the alliance, after Trump questioned its relevance.

Any summit plans would have to consider coronavirus pandemic restrictions that have complicated in-person gatherings of government leaders, diplomats said. Last week, three leaders were forced to leave a European Union summit in Brussels because of COVID-19 infection risks.

Taiwan's charges, including that a Taiwanese diplomat ended up in hospital after the altercation, are hotly disputed by China, which views the democratically-run island as its own territory with no right to formal state-to-state ties.
The Pacific is a major source of competition between the two, where Taiwan has official diplomatic relations with four countries, though not Fiji. 
Taiwan says the Chinese diplomats were trying to take pictures of a Taiwan national day event at a hotel to see who was there, and that in the altercation that followed people from both sides were injured.
Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said Taiwan was a ""peace-loving country"" that invited people to events around the world for its Oct. 10 national day, which marks the founding of the Republic of China, Taiwan's official name.
""Going forward we will continue to hold national day receptions,"" she said. ""This will not change.""
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian labelled Taiwan's remarks as ""rubbish"" and ""bogus accusations"". 
Fiji's foreign ministry has yet to comment on the incident.
Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said the world needed to see what China was capable of, saying what they did was a ""barbaric act"". 
""China's officials posted overseas are acting like hooligans; beating people is not acceptable. We sternly condemn this,"" he told reporters. 
The issue was hard to deal with because the Chinese diplomats there have diplomatic immunity, Su added.

""But we must appeal to the international community with the relevant evidence.""

COLOMBO/MALE (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will visit Sri Lanka and the Maldives this month, officials of both Indian Ocean nations said on Tuesday, as Washington seeks to counter China's growing influence in the region. 
Pompeo will hold two-way talks in Colombo on Oct. 28, a spokesman for Sri Lanka's foreign ministry said, but gave no details. 
Two people familiar with arrangements for the trip said Pompeo was likely to stop in the Maldives' capital of Male for several hours on the same day.
""Incoming visits of official foreign delegations will be announced once a visit is scheduled and confirmed,"" the Maldives' foreign ministry said in a statement. 
China's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, visited Colombo this month. In recent years, Beijing has increasingly provided financing and construction for critical infrastructure in Sri Lanka and the Maldives, alarming traditional regional power India.

Last week, an Indian government source said Pompeo was also set to visit New Delhi this month, along with Defense Secretary Mark Esper, for talks with Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.

Paty was murdered on Friday in broad daylight outside his school in a middle-class Paris suburb by an 18-year-old of Chechen origin. Police shot the attacker dead.
The teenager sought to avenge his victim's use of caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression. Muslims believe that any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.
The murder shocked France, and carried echoes of the attack five years ago on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Public figures called the killing an attack on the Republic and on French values.

A national ceremony in honour of Paty will be held at Paris' Sorbonne university on Wednesday.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A Thai court on Tuesday ordered the suspension of an online TV station critical of the government, which has accused it of violating emergency measures aimed at ending three months of protests.
Voice TV had also been found to have breached the Computer Crime Act by uploading ""false information,"" digital ministry spokesman Putchapong Nodthaisong told reporters.
Thailand has drawn criticism from rights groups for banning demonstrations and the publication of news seen as damaging by the government as it tries to end the protests against Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha and the powerful monarchy.
Rittikorn Mahakhachabhorn, Editor-in-Chief of Voice TV, said it would continue broadcasting until the court order arrived.
""We insist that we have been operating based on journalistic principles and we will continue our work presently,"" he said.
Thailand said on Monday that three other media organisations are under investigation.
Voice TV is owned in part by the Shinawatra family of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra and his sister Yingluck, who was overthrown by Prayuth in a 2014 coup. Both fled Thailand to escape corruption cases they branded political.
Street protests since mid-July are the biggest challenge in decades to the monarchy under King Maha Vajiralongkorn and to Prayuth, who rejects accusations of engineering an election last year to keep power. 
The demonstrations have been largely led by youths and students in contrast with a decade of street violence between supporters of Thaksin and conservative royalists before Prayuth seized power.
Protests have only gained momentum since the government announced a ban last Thursday and arrested dozens of protesters, including many of the main leaders.
A lawyer for two of them, Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak and Panusaya ""Rung"" Sithijirawattanakul, said they would be arrested again on Tuesday as soon as they had been freed on bail granted by a court over earlier charges related to the protests.
Prime Minister Prayuth has said he will not quit in the face of the protests.

His cabinet agreed on Tuesday to hold an emergency session of parliament next week about the crisis. Prayuth's supporters hold a majority in the parliament, whose upper house was named entirely by his former junta.

309,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Indonesia rejected U.S. request to host spy planes - officials,"By Tom Allard
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia rejected this year a proposal by the United States to allow its P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance planes to land and refuel there, according to four senior Indonesian officials familiar with the matter.
U.S. officials made multiple ""high-level"" approaches in July and August to Indonesia's defence and foreign ministers before Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, rebuffed the request, the officials said.
Representatives for Indonesia's president and defence minister, the U.S. State Department press office and the U.S. embassy in Jakarta did not respond to requests for comment. Representatives for the U.S. Department of Defence and Indonesia's foreign minister Retno Marsudi declined to comment.
The proposition, which came as the U.S. and China escalated their contest for influence in Southeast Asia, surprised Indonesia's government, the officials said, because Indonesia has a long-standing policy of foreign policy neutrality. The country has never allowed foreign militaries to operate there.
The P-8 plays a central role in keeping an eye on China's military activity in the South China Sea, most of which Beijing claims as sovereign territory. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei have rival claims to the resource-rich waters, through which $3 trillion worth of trade passes each year.
Indonesia is not a formal claimant in the strategically important waterway, but considers a portion of the South China Sea as its own. It has regularly repelled Chinese coast guard vessels and fishing boats from an area to which Beijing says it has a historic claim. 
But the country also has growing economic and investment links with China. It does not want to take sides in the conflict and is alarmed by growing tensions between the two superpowers, and by the militarisation of the South China Sea, Retno told Reuters.
""We don't want to get trapped by this rivalry,"" Retno said in an interview in early September. ""Indonesia wants to show all that we are ready to be your partner."" 
""OVER-REACH""
Despite the strategic affinity between the U.S. and Southeast Asian states in curbing China's territorial ambitions, Dino Patti Djalal, a former Indonesian ambassador to the United States, said the ""very aggressive anti-China policy"" of the U.S. had unnerved Indonesia and the region.
""It's seen as out-of-place,"" he told Reuters. ""We don't want to be duped into an anti-China campaign. Of course we maintain our independence, but there is deeper economic engagement and China is now the most impactful country in the world for Indonesia.""
Greg Poling, a Southeast Asia analyst from the Washington D.C.-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said trying to get landing rights for spy planes was an example of clumsy over-reach.
""It's an indication of how little folks in the U.S. government understand Indonesia,' he told Reuters. ""There's a clear ceiling to what you can do, and when it comes to Indonesia that ceiling is putting boots on the ground.""
The U.S. recently has used military bases in Singapore, the Philippines and Malaysia to operate P-8 flights over the South China Sea, military analysts said.
China has ramped up military exercises this year, while the U.S. has increased the tempo of naval freedom of navigation operations, submarine deployments and surveillance flights.
The P-8, with its advanced radar, high definition cameras and acoustic sensors, has been mapping the islands, surface and underwater realms of the South China Sea for at least six years.
When carrying sonobuoys and missiles, the planes can detect and attack ships and submarines from long range. It also has communications systems that allow it to control unmanned aircraft.
In 2014, the U.S. accused a Chinese fighter jet of coming within 20 feet and executing a barrel roll over a P-8 patrolling the South China Sea. China described the U.S. complaint as ""groundless"".

310,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 20, 2020 01:26AM ET</span>","As the Arctic's attractions mount, Greenland is a security black hole","By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - On a windy August afternoon in 2017, Akitsinnguaq Ina Olsen was relaxing in the old harbour of Nuuk, Greenland's capital, when a Chinese icebreaker sailed unannounced into the Arctic island's territorial waters.
""I saw it by chance,"" Olsen, 50, told Reuters. ""My first thought was: 'They're already here!' They're pretty cheeky, those Chinese.""
She pulled out her phone and took a picture of the 167-meter long Chinese icebreaker Xue Long (Snow Dragon), before it turned around and disappeared. 
The Chinese ship was one of a growing number of unexpected arrivals in Arctic waters as shrinking sea ice has fast-tracked a race among global powers for control over resources and waterways. Both China and Russia have been making increasingly assertive moves in the region, and after the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last year said now is ""America's moment to stand up as an Arctic nation and for the Arctic's future,"" military activity is stepping up.
Greenland is a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark and Copenhagen runs the island's defence through its Joint Arctic Command. On several occasions since 2006, foreign vessels have turned up unexpectedly or without the necessary protocols, in waters that NATO-member Denmark aims to defend, Greenland residents and military sources in Denmark and the United States told Reuters.
Copenhagen and its Arctic neighbours have tried in recent decades to keep the region what they call a ""low tension"" area. But each event underscores new challenges for Denmark and its allies. 
The main problem: It's hard to see what's going on there.
Greenland, which U.S. President Donald Trump offered unsuccessfully to buy from Copenhagen last year, is largely an ice sheet with a rocky coastline of 44,000 km (27,000 miles) - longer than the earth's equator. It's hidden by almost complete darkness in the winter months.
Beneath its rocks and ice are abundant resources of minerals and rare earth metals used in equipment from smartphones to electric vehicles and military jets, as well as uranium and potentially vast resources of oil and natural gas.
Greenland offers more than resources. The island, which is nearer to New York than New York is to Los Angeles, is also a strategic window onto space. 
Located at Thule, the United States' northernmost air base houses the 21st Space Wing's network of sensors, which provides early missile warning and space surveillance and control. Thule is one of the few places in the world with access to satellites that orbit the poles, completing coverage of the globe which is essential for weather forecasting, search-and-rescue and climate research.
""Historically the Arctic, like space, was characterised as a predominantly peaceful domain,"" Secretary of the U.S. Air Force Barbara Barrett said in July when presenting America's Arctic strategy in the transcript of a webinar hosted by the Atlantic Council think tank.
""This is changing.""
Several countries are building new icebreakers to increase freight traffic. China, which in 2018 declared itself a ""near-Arctic"" nation, has said it wants to build infrastructure and ""participate in the governance of the Arctic."" 
China has ""really gone from zero to 60 in space, very quickly,"" U.S. Space Force chief General John W. Raymond told the July presentation. He said China's capabilities ""threaten our access to space in the Arctic"" both in Alaska and Thule. 
The icebreaker that Olsen photographed in 2017, used by China's Polar Research Institute for scientific expeditions, had been invited by a researcher in Greenland, the researcher said. But it had not, as would normally be expected, applied in advance for clearance, the head of the Joint Arctic Command Kim Jorgensen told Reuters. 
Also in the area taking advantage of the short Arctic summer, a multinational search-and-rescue exercise spotted the Xue Long. Danish armed forces invited it to seek permission to enter, which was granted, Jorgensen said. 
China's foreign ministry did not comment on that incident but said in a statement it respects the sovereignty and jurisdiction of ""the Arctic countries in the area"" and is ready to make positive contributions to the peace, stability and sustainable development.
By this year, Western allies had increased their presence. U.S. destroyer Thomas Hudner, together with Denmark's Joint Arctic Command, sailed for the first time into the deep fjord near Nuuk in August. In August and September, a U.S. Coast Guard cutter carried out joint exercises with Danish and French naval vessels on Greenland's west coast. And last month, Denmark for the first time joined the United States, UK and Norway in a large-scale military exercise in the Barents Sea near Russia.
Danish Defence Minister Trine Bramsen told Reuters in a statement that Denmark wants to keep tension low in the Arctic, ""but we must not be naive."" Russia is trying to limit the right to free navigation in international waters, she said; Denmark is taking steps towards strengthening the Armed Forces' surveillance and presence there. 
A spokesperson at the U.S. embassy in Copenhagen said Denmark needs to strengthen its defence in the Arctic with additional investment.
Moscow's ambassador to Denmark, Vladimir Barbin, said talk of threats to freedom of navigation is a ""made-up pretext"" for naval exercises and Russia's activities in the Arctic are peaceful. U.S. policy ""accompanied by bellicose rhetoric, is creating a new reality and splitting Arctic states and could open (the) sluice gates for overspill of tension from the outside to the Arctic region,"" he told Reuters in a statement.
BELOW THE RADAR
Some Arctic regions are relatively well covered by satellite and radar. But since the early 1990s, Greenland has slipped off the radar. 
From 1959 to 1991 Greenland was part of the North American Aerospace Defence Command, an integrated chain of 63 radar and communication centres stretching 3,000 miles from Western Alaska across the Canadian Arctic. It had four radars operating on its ice sheet. Two were dismantled; the other two were abandoned and are now slowly sinking into the ice. 
Today, to monitor its vast area, Greenland has one aircraft, four helicopters and four ships. In addition to enforcing sovereignty, they handle fishing inspection and search and rescue operations. Six sleds powered by 80 dogs patrol the remote northeastern part.
In August 2006, a local couple said they spotted a submarine while they were hunting reindeer at the remote Qassit fjord in southern Greenland, said Niels Erik Sorensen, who headed Denmark's Arctic Command at the time. The couple told the police and made a drawing, which the military identified as a likely Russian model.
""This was the first sighting since the end of the Cold War,"" said Sorensen. 
The sub was mentioned in a 2016 report on Denmark's Arctic defence, which said candidly that ""there is no access to a coherent picture"" of the situation in the area of responsibility for its Arctic Command. Neither the airspace nor activities below sea-level are monitored. 
As there is no surveillance, it said, ""it is not possible to assess whether violations of sovereignty are taking place in the air. Thus, no deliberate violations of the airspace ... have been found.""
In another part of the Arctic that year, a U.S. Coast Guard vessel accidentally discovered a joint Russian-Chinese naval exercise in Arctic waters near Kamchatka, said Paul Zukunft, who retired as Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard in 2018.
""This is a region where we did not have any satellite coverage,"" he said. ""But we did have a ship up there, and they literally stumbled upon this joint naval exercise between Russia and China that otherwise would not have been known."" 
Russia's ambassador said there are no joint Russian-Chinese military-naval exercises in the Arctic Ocean. The Chinese foreign ministry did not comment.
The Danish government promised in 2019 to upgrade military spending in Greenland with a payment of 1.5 billion Danish crowns ($237 million) for surveillance. Denmark's Bramsen said that was a ""first step"" and Copenhagen has yet to decide how to spend the money. 
For now, Denmark has no satellites to monitor traffic around Greenland. In 2018, it started receiving a few satellite images a day from the European Union's Maritime Safety Agency, but they aren't always detailed enough for military purposes.
""Denmark will never be able to defend itself in the Arctic,"" said Steen Kjaergaard, head of the Centre for Arctic Security Studies at the Royal Danish Defence College, which does research for the defence ministry.
""The government is trying to strike a balance.""
""DARK TARGETS""
That balance is becoming increasingly delicate. For years, it's been fairly easy for foreign researchers to access the waters around Greenland and those between Greenland, Iceland and the UK, researchers and military sources say: All that's needed is to fill in a form seeking permission. 
Last year, though, Danish authorities failed to approve an application from a Swiss-led group of international researchers, the government said in response to a Freedom of Information request from Reuters. The researchers were planning to travel on a Russian icebreaker, 50 Let Pobedy (50 Years of Victory) on the first-ever circumnavigation of Greenland.
Authorities let the application expire without responding.
Two sources with knowledge of the matter said they had become suspicious that the icebreaker, used for several earlier expeditions in Greenland, could serve non-scientific purposes such as tapping information from subsea fibre cables or mapping the seabed to ease access for Russian submarines.
In 2016, a Russian vessel, Yantar, which the U.S. Navy has alleged transports submersibles that can sever and tap into cables miles beneath the ocean's surface, anchored outside Nuuk, where a subsea communications cable lands that connects Iceland and America. 
Ambassador Barbin said Russia considered the icebreaker decision an ""unfortunate misunderstanding,"" noting that this year Denmark agreed to another Russian icebreaker visiting Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
Even NATO allies arrive unannounced in these vast, dark waters. 
Foreign ships usually report their arrival using the international Automatic Identification System ship-tracking system. When analysing satellite images, the Joint Arctic Command often identifies what it calls ""dark targets"" - objects that look like ships but can't be identified on the system.
If the Danish military sends out vessels or helicopters to the target, they often find an iceberg. When the targets have turned out to be ships, these have most often been U.S. marine vessels that haven't reported their arrival, military sources say. 

The U.S. embassy didn't comment. Denmark's defence ministry said the allies are working to bolster information sharing.

Millennials, or those born between 1981 and 1996, are more disillusioned than Generation X, those born between 1965 and 1981, or Baby Boomers born between 1944 and 1964 and the Interwar Generation of 1918-1943.
""Across the world, younger generations are not only more dissatisfied with democratic performance than the old, but also more discontented than previous generations at similar life stages,"" the Cambridge study found.
The picture is bad in the United States, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa, France, Australia and the United Kingdom. 
But satisfaction has increased in Germany, South Korea and many of the post-Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe. 
The main reason behind the disillusion with democracy among young people was inequality of wealth and income, the report said, citing figures showing that Millennials make up around a quarter of the U.S. population but hold just 3% of the wealth. Baby Boomers held 21% of the wealth at the same age. 
The study suggested that the populist challenge to mainstream, ""establishment"" politics could actually help improve democratic engagement by shocking moderate parties and leaders into reversing the decay.

314,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 06:40PM ET</span>",Trump: U.S. to remove Sudan from state terrorism sponsors list after payment to victims,"By Matt Spetalnick, Nafisa Eltahir and Khalid Abdelaziz
WASHINGTON/DUBAI/KHARTOUM (Reuters) - President Donald Trump announced on Monday the United States would remove Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism 
as soon as Khartoum sets aside the $335 million it has agreed to pay to American victims of militant attacks and their families.
The deal could also set in motion steps by Sudan toward establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a U.S. official told Reuters, following similar U.S.-brokered moves by the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The details were still being worked out, the source said.
Although Trump made no mention of Israel in his tweet announcing the breakthrough with Sudan, rapprochement between Israel and another Arab country would give Trump a new diplomatic achievement as he seeks re-election on Nov. 3.
Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism dates to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir and makes it difficult for its transitional government to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing.
Many in Sudan say the designation, imposed in 1993 because Washington believed Bashir was supporting militant groups, has become outdated since he was removed last year and Sudan has long cooperated on counterterrorism.
U.S.-Sudanese negotiations have focused on funds that Washington wants Khartoum to deposit in escrow to be paid for victims of al Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, U.S. government sources said.
""GREAT news! New government of Sudan, which is making great progress, agreed to pay $335 MILLION to U.S. terror victims and families,"" Trump tweeted. ""Once deposited, I will lift Sudan from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list.""
A Sudanese government source said Khartoum was ready to pay compensation to U.S. Embassy bombing victims.
""Thank you so much, President Trump!"" Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok tweeted. ""We very much look forward to your official notification to Congress rescinding the designation of Sudan as a state-sponsor of terrorism.""
While Trump can act on his own to remove Sudan from the list, congressional legislation is needed to ensure the flow of payments to embassy bombing victims and their families - and immediate action on Capitol Hill is far from certain.
Urging congressional action, Edith Bartley, spokeswoman for Americans killed in the Nairobi bombing, said the funds would meet a commitment by three successive presidents ""to condition normalization (with the U.S.) on compensating survivors and the families of those who were lost to acts of terror.""
ISRAEL WAS STICKING POINT
A key sticking point in the negotiations was Sudan's insistence that any announcement of Khartoum's delisting not be explicitly linked to normalization with Israel. Differences remain between Sudanese political and military officials on how far to go in the warming of relations with Israel.
Hamdok, who runs the country together with the military in a transition since the toppling of Bashir, told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in Khartoum in August that the normalization issue should not be tied in with Sudan’s removal from the terrorism list.
One possibility, a U.S. official said, would be for Washington to leave it to Sudan and Israel to go public later, possibly in coming days, with an agreement on opening relations.
The UAE and Bahrain in September became the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to agree to formal ties with Israel, forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
Asked whether an Israel-Sudan breakthrough was imminent, Israeli Finance Minister Israel Katz told Israel's Army Radio: 
""I hope that the intensive contacts will yield positive fruit.""
The Trump administration, which is also expected to offer economic aid, must now notify the U.S. Congress of its intent to take Sudan off the terrorism list.
A remaining obstacle is that Congress must pass legislation restoring Sudan's sovereign immunity, a shield against future legal claims for past attacks once it pays the compensation it already owes. Sudan had lost that protection because of the terrorism designation.
Echoing concerns of other lawmakers, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said in an Oct. 15 letter to Pompeo that ""corrective action"" was needed to ensure the deal did not make it more difficult for victims of al Qaeda's Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to sue for damages. Sudan was accused of giving safe haven to al Qaeda leaders.

315,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",'Xi Thought' Is Creeping Into Everything From Chinese Sci-Fi to Company Filings,"(Bloomberg) -- What sort of science fiction does Xi Jinping like? How can China’s weathermen use the president’s political philosophy to improve their forecasts? In what ways can “Xi Thought” help prepare the country for the next big earthquake?
These are the sorts of questions Communist Party cadres are now pondering as they prepare for the next big milestone in the president’s effort to cement his control: Elevating Xi Thought alongside Maoism. The esoteric concept is expected to be written into the five-year development blueprint that will be unveiled after party meetings later this month. Everyone from diplomats to executives to sci-fi writers are under pressure to incorporate the broad, often fuzzy tenets of Xi Thought into their policies.
The project is central to Xi’s effort to quiet opposition and to stay on past 2022, when he’s expected to seek a third five-year term as party chief. Once Xi has own “-ism,” the theory goes, he’ll be elevated to a political standing on par with Mao Zedong, whose portrait hangs over Tiananmen Square and is printed on the currency. It will also make it all-the-more difficult to question his edicts.
“Its importance lies in prominently raising Xi’s personal profile,” said Carl Minzner, a professor at Fordham Law School who specializes in Chinese law and governance. “Every time the command to study it is uttered on TV, and every time is written in a party document, it is a highly visible signal to both party officials and citizens at large as to who is on top, and whose orders actually matter.”
While some key tenets of Mao’s philosophy are included in the iconic “Little Red Book,” Xi Thought is still being shaped and yet to be compiled in one place, although the three-volume “Xi Jinping: The Governance of China” -- a collection of his speeches, writings, sayings and ideas -- contains clues. More than 20 applications of Xi Thought on everything from economic management and military reform to controlling the media and the arts that have appeared in state media since 2018, according to Qian Gang, director of University of Hong Kong’s China Media Project.
The effort to make Xi Thought a guiding principle for nearly every aspect of Chinese life will loom over a conclave of some 300 top party leaders slated to begin Oct. 26 in Beijing. For the first time they’ll also draft a longer-term blueprint that runs until 2035, in the latest indication of how long Xi, 67, could lead.
He Lifeng, the chairman of the National Development and Reform Commission, wrote in the party-run People’s Daily newspaper last month that Xi’s thinking on the economy was a “powerful weapon to withstand major risks and challenges, and solve major problems.” The leader’s ideas should be should be studied and adopted as guidance when drafting five-year plans, He said.
Companies Get in Line
That’s forcing companies, agencies and schools to contemplate what Xi-ism means for them. Where Mao Zedong Thought was geared toward adapting Marxist-Leninism to a pre-industrial society, Xi Thought is concerned with maintaining party control more than four decades after China opened to the world and began to experiment with market forces. Almost 400 of some 3,900 listed companies in China paid homage to the Communist Party and its leader in their annual reports this year, the Economist reported.
The push began three years ago, when Xi got the unwieldy “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism With Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” written into the party charter and Chinese constitution. Around the same time, he pushed through an amendment scrapping constitutional provisions that would’ve forced him to hand over the presidency in 2023.
During a visit by Xi last week to the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong, provincial party secretary Li Xi vowed to “raise high the great banner” of Xi’s thinking, making him the latest Politburo member to pledge loyalty in similar terms.
“Xi Thought is a way to cement a hold on power by signaling allegiance to his policy objectives in as many places as possible,” said Martin Chorzempa, research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “The hallmark of its impact in the business-economic sphere is an increased role for party committees in companies, a resurgence of state companies in terms of getting access to capital, and tighter controls on especially tech companies to manage content in line with government thinking.”
Xi wants a stronger, more disciplined party to reassert influence it had ceded to the government and private sector after leader Deng Xiaoping began his “reform and opening up” movement in 1978. Xi Thought envisions a China that’s more self-reliant in key areas including technology and food security and is more assertive in securing its place in the world.
The process prioritizes conformity with the leader’s views over immediate results in any given field. Foreign Minister Wang Yi declared “Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy” a total success in the August issue of the party journal Seeking Truth, even as negative views of China surged after its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and crackdowns on dissent in places like Hong Kong and Xinjiang.
No other leader besides Mao has had his ideology raised to the level of “thought,” which carries a special meaning in Communist Party propaganda. Deng’s reforms are described as “Deng Xiaoping Theory,” while concepts advanced by Xi’s immediate predecessors, Presidents Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, don’t even carry their names.
Rana Mitter, director of the University of Oxford’s China Center, said Xi was seeking “not just a set of ideas, but a way to think about them as a complete package” to shape his ideology. “Language matters: ‘Maoism’ is an idea, ‘Dengism’ is not, even though Deng was an influential leader,” Mitter said.
Criticism of Xi Thought is not an option, as the leader maintains his unprecedented wave of disciplinary investigations against party officials. The country’s top anti-graft body, the National Supervisory Commission, has so far warned 20 central government agencies that they were “not doing enough” to master and implement Xi’s thinking, according to statements posted on the agency’s website.
The China Meteorological Administration was found in August to have some gaps to bridge in applying Xi’s idea of domestic and international situations into their work while the China Earthquake Administration got wrapped for not fully reflecting Xi’s Thought into their disaster prevention work. Writers and producers in the nation’s burgeoning science fiction scene were urged by an official industry association to take Xi Thought on board and transform China into a sci-fi powerhouse.
Ultimately, Xi Thought can be whatever Xi thinks he needs to ensure his own rule.
“It seems quite obvious from all signals, that he wants to serve beyond 10 years, perhaps for 20 years,” said Willy Lam, an adjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong’s Centre for China Studies, who has authored numerous books on Chinese politics. “To remain in power for that long, he needs to consolidate his power base.”

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Monday dealt Ghislaine Maxwell a blow by refusing to block the release of a deposition she gave concerning her relationship with the late financier and registered sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said there was a presumption the public had a right to see Maxwell's 418-page deposition, which was taken in April 2016 for a now-settled civil defamation lawsuit against her.
In an unsigned order, the court also said U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan did not abuse her discretion in rejecting Maxwell's ""meritless arguments"" that her interests superseded that presumption.
Lawyers for Maxwell did not immediately respond to requests for comment, including whether they plan a further appeal.
The order upheld Preska's decision in July to release the deposition and hundreds of other documents from the 2015 defamation lawsuit by Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's accusers.
That case was settled in 2017, and many of the documents have been made public.
But Maxwell's lawyers said bad publicity from disclosing ""intimate, sensitive, and personal details"" from the deposition could undermine her ability to defend against criminal charges that she enabled Epstein's sexual abuses.
They said the British socialite thought her deposition would remain confidential, and that releasing it would violate her constitutional right against self-incrimination, and imperil a fair trial because jurors might hold its contents against her.
The appeals court separately rejected Maxwell's request to modify a protective order in her criminal case, so she could access confidential materials she hoped would persuade Preska to keep the deposition under wraps.
Maxwell, 58, has pleaded not guilty to helping Epstein recruit and groom underage girls as young as 14 to engage in illegal sexual acts in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement in the deposition.
A trial is scheduled for next July.
Giuffre said she was a teenager when Maxwell pulled her into Epstein's circle, where she was groomed and trafficked for sex with Epstein and other wealthy, powerful men.
The push to unseal the deposition came from Giuffre and the Miami Herald newspaper, which had investigated Epstein's conduct and his successful effort in 2007 to avoid federal sex trafficking charges.
Lawyers for Giuffre and the newspaper were not immediately available for comment. The U.S. Department of Justice, which opposed modifying the protective order, did not immediately respond to a similar request.
Maxwell was arrested on July 2 in New Hampshire, where prosecutors said she had been hiding out.
She has been locked up in a Brooklyn jail after U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversees the criminal case, called her an unacceptable flight risk.
Epstein killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges announced the previous month.
The cases in the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals are Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, and U.S. v. Maxwell, No. 20-3061.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian archaeologists have uncovered a 37-meter-long (120-foot-long) cat etching in a little-explored area of the country's celebrated Nazca Lines UNESCO heritage site which is home to hundreds of gigantic geoglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years.
The figure, made up of a long body, striped tail and head with distinctive pointed ears, predates some of the area's better known-figures that include a hummingbird, spider and a human, the country's Culture Ministry said. 
It is one of a number discovered in recent years by drone exploration of the protected 400-square-kilometer (250-square-mile) region that lies some 450 km south of the capital Lima between the towns of Nazca and Palpa. 
Johny Isla, the ministry's specialist for the Nazca-Pampa region, said it was estimated to be around 2,000 years old and made up of groves carved into the mountain coupled with groupings of stones.
""The figure was in the process of disappearing because it was on a slope that was subject to quite extensive erosion which resulted in it being hidden for many years,"" he told Reuters Television.
The geoglyph has been painstakingly cleaned and preserved by a team of archaeologists to make it more easily visible, the ministry said in a statement, adding that the discovery was ""further evidence of the rich and varied cultural legacy"" of the area.
The Nazca Lines, which can only be seen from the air, include etchings of a monkey, spider, pelican, whale, dog and lizard. 
The geoglyphs created by the Nazca and Paracas cultures are striking reminders of Peru's rich pre-Columbian history and are considered archeological enigmas, as no one knows for sure why they were drawn, or so large and for so long.
The area has been closed to tourists since March because of the coronavirus pandemic but is due to reopen on Nov. 10.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Climate change and human activity are harming Antarctica and threatening wildlife from humpback whales to microscopic algae, more than 280 scientists and conservation experts say in urging protections for the icy region. 
The coalition - all women - called for creating a new marine protection area around Antarctica, as governments on Monday began a two-week meeting of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources. 
Two Antarctica areas are already protected: The South Orkney Islands and the Ross Sea. The new protection area, proposed in 2018 by commission members Chile and Argentina, would cover the western Antarctic Peninsula, the northernmost part of the southernmost continent. 
The peninsula's complex ecosystem includes penguins, seals and tiny crustaceans called krill, which are the main staple for hundreds of marine animals, including fish, birds and baleen whales.
Unlike with the rest of Antarctica, one-third of which remains unvisited, there are no large areas of the peninsula untouched by humans. Fishing, tourism, climate change and research infrastructure all present challenges to the wildlife, the scientists say in a commentary published in this week's journal Nature. 
The peninsula is also one of the fastest-warming places on Earth, registering a record high temperature of 20.75 degrees Celsius (69.35 degrees Fahrenheit) on Feb. 9. 
As the region warms, sea ice is shrinking back, leaving krill larvae unsheltered. This could have an impact that cascades through Antarctica's food chain, the scientists say.
Protecting the peninsula ""would show the international community that collective action to tackle a global problem is possible,"" Spanish science policy advisor Marga Gual Soler told Reuters. She called the frozen continent ""a beacon for science collaboration and international diplomacy for over 60 years."" 
The 289 scientists who signed the commentary are part of the Homeward Bound program, which organizes expeditions for women to Antarctica. For decades, women scientists were prevented from traveling to the continent's bases due to a lack of facilities for women, said Anne Christianson, an environmental scientist at the University of Minnesota.
""Having more than 200 women join forces and say, 'This is our legacy, we deserve a say in how this area is protected,' is very powerful,"" Christianson said.

The commission, which includes the European Union, Russia and the United States, has also been asked to consider marine protection areas off East Antarctica and in the Weddell Sea.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hands point above head = need umbrella; Hands held over head = need helmet; Hands crossed over chest = enough supplies here.
Thai protesters are learning a whole new language, developed within days to coordinate among crowds of thousands of people at demonstrations that have swollen in defiance of a government ban and despite the arrest of many protest leaders.
""Everyone has been helping each other out,"" said 19-year-old Riam, who like most protesters would only give one name. ""At first, we had to work out what people were saying, but with the gestures, it's pretty easy to guess.""
Some of the words in the Thai hand signal vocabulary are the same as those used by protesters in Hong Kong. Some they made up themselves and have now gained common usage.
Three months of protests in Thailand have sought to bring down Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and to curb the powers of the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
They gained added momentum last week with a government crackdown that brought the arrest of several of the highest profile protest leaders and saw police using water cannon for the first time on Friday.
That has also meant a need to be able to quickly move protective equipment and other supplies from point to point so that everyone can be prepared.
Police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen noted that the protest situation was ""very dynamic"" and that people should understand their presence there was illegal.
Since Friday, police have not tried to break up protests, but protesters are taking no chances.
Their new language only took shape at the weekend - when groups started to teach and practice the moves together. Some messages are still passed down human chains by shouting them in a form of Chinese whispers that are anything but whispered.

""Everyone is well educated and learns how to survive without the leaders,"" said 20-year-old Tangmae as she demonstrated some of the signs. ""We should communicate so the protest can happen in an orderly way.""

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's socialists all but sealed a dramatic election comeback after their centrist rival Carlos Mesa conceded the vote on Monday, with several unofficial vote counts giving the party of ousted leader Evo Morales an unassailable 20 percentage-point lead. 
The win, still to be confirmed by the official count, would sweep the party of leftist Morales back into power a year after he was forced to resign following a fraught election that sparked widespread protests and violence.
The socialist MAS party's candidate Luis Arce, 57, took more than 50% of the votes, rapid counts showed, with Mesa on around 30%, a far larger gap than pollsters had predicted.
""The result of the quick count is very strong and very clear,"" Mesa said at a press conference after the socialist party had claimed victory in the early hours of the morning.
""The difference between the first candidate and (our) Comunidad Ciudadana party is wide and it is up to us, those of us who believe in democracy, to recognize that there has been a winner in this election.""
Arce's team on Monday said that the initial results looked ""hard to change"" but that the former finance minister during Morales' near-14 year socialist administration would only make a statement once the official results were complete.
That process may take several days. The official count on Monday afternoon had tallied around a quarter of the votes, showing Mesa slightly ahead but widely expected to gradually fall back as more votes were counted from MAS strongholds.
The result is a body blow for Bolivia's conservatives, who had hoped to present a new model for the country beyond Morales, who sought an unprecedented fourth term last year despite term limits, which had led to protests again him.
Arce, a close Morales ally, may bring a more moderate and technocratic stance than his former boss, who oversaw stable growth and elevated indigenous groups but drew criticism for an authoritarian streak and trying to hold on too long to power.
""This could be the beginning of a new era for the MAS party, replacing Evo,"" said Franklin Pareja, a political analyst.
The win could also see Morales return from exile in Argentina, where he has been living since fleeing the country after his resignation last year, when he claimed there had been a right-wing coup against him.
Morales in a press conference on Monday indicated he intended to go back to Bolivia, though Arce has cautioned he would have to deal with outstanding justice department investigations before returning to a government role.
Morales had been one of the longest-standing leaders of Latin America's so-called ""pink wave"" of leftwing governments, who won plaudits for his support of indigenous groups.
Arce, a trained economist who studied at the University of Warwick in England, drew support from leftists around the region, including in Mexico, Argentina, Cuba and Venezuela.

""We celebrate that a serious conflict was resolved by peaceful and democratic means,"" tweeted Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Attacks against indigenous lobster fishermen over the weekend are ""disgusting,"" a government minister said on Monday, as Ottawa provided more police resources to tamp down clashes over lobster fishing rights in eastern Canada.
Tensions between local commercial fishermen and fishermen from the Mi'kmaq First Nation in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia have been escalating in recent days in a conflict over indigenous fishing rights.
Clashes over the weekend and earlier last week involved hundreds of people outside lobster pounds that handle indigenous-caught lobster. 
""The acts of violence we have seen in the past days and weeks are disgusting, unacceptable, racist in nature,"" Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said.
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in 1999 that the Mi'kmaq First Nation had the right to hunt and fish for a ""moderate livelihood"" in their traditional territory.
But the ruling left many grey areas - including the practical definition of ""moderate livelihood"" - leading Mi'kmaq fishermen to begin catching lobster outside the federally-mandated fishing season and raising the ire of local commercial lobster fishers.
Protests in support of both sides resulted in clashes last week that at times turned violent, with one person being arrested after attacking Chief Michael Sack of the Sipekne'atik First Nation. Meanwhile, the head of the province's fishing union resigned, citing concerns for his personal safety.
A lobster pound where Indigenous fishermen stored their catch was set on fire, resulting in one person being admitted to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries, police said on Sunday.
On Sunday, Sack said the military needed to be brought in to keep the peace. Indigenous nations have a fraught relationship with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the force responsible for policing in much of rural Canada.
Federal Public Safety Minister Bill Blair pushed back on the suggestion on Monday, as he called for an end to the violence.

""This isn't a military operation, it is a peacekeeping operation,"" he said. ""We have taken steps necessary to ensure that (the RCMP has) adequate resources to do the job.""

The UAE and fellow Gulf state Bahrain in September became the first Arab states in a quarter of a century to sign agreements to establish formal ties with Israel, forged largely through shared fears of Iran.
""Together the UAE and Israel will stand better prepared to confront the malign threats from the Iranian regime, their proxies, and other extremist groups,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi.
His televised remarks were made at the first Abraham Accords Business Summit held on Monday with the participation of Israeli delegations.
Mnuchin and other U.S. dignitaries will accompany the UAE government delegation to Israel on Tuesday. He arrived in Abu Dhabi from Bahrain, where U.S. officials joined an Israeli delegation on a trip to Manama to sign a communique formalising nascent ties.
The UAE cabinet statement said the Abraham Accord would be ""an avenue of peace and stability to support the ambitions of the region's people, and enhance efforts for prosperity and advancement, especially as it paves the way for deepening economic, culture and knowledge ties.""
Israel had ratified the deal in a cabinet vote and a parliamentary vote last week.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in a speech to parliament on Monday, said the historic treaties would bring real peace between peoples, including economic peace.
""Especially at a time of the coronavirus, this is so important. A peace of investments that will strengthen our economy and allow us to help the citizens of Israel even more,"" he said.
Israel and the UAE have already signed several commercial deals since mid-August, when they first announced they would normalise ties. 
They will ink a deal on Tuesday to allow 28 weekly commercial flights between Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Israel's Transportation Ministry has said
On Monday, they reached a bilateral agreement that will give incentives and protection to investors who make investments in each other's countries.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Germany has granted refugee status to a Hong Kong pro-democracy activist facing a rioting charge in connection with last year's anti-China protests, the protester told Reuters on Monday.
The 22-year-old university student showed Reuters a letter from the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF) dated Oct. 14 that confirmed the granting of refugee status.
""I chose to flee from Hong Kong because I knew I wouldn't be given a fair trial,"" the protester, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters by phone from an undisclosed location in Germany. ""I'm grateful to the German government.""
There was no immediate response from BAMF or the German Consulate in Hong Kong to Reuters' requests for comment.
Hong Kong authorities have arrested more than 10,000 people in relation to the pro-democracy protest movement, which prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law on June 30.
Critics say the new law has further eroded the wide-ranging freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The activist said she was arrested at a protest last November. She says she fled to Germany via Taiwan several days later, without telling her family.
""It felt surreal, and I was very upset that I needed to leave Hong Kong like that as I knew I might never return,"" she said.
Two prominent Hong Kong activists, Ray Wong and Alan Li, were also granted political asylum by Berlin in 2018.
The group ""Haven Assistance"" run by Wong and Li issued a statement saying the student had been granted refugee status in Germany for three years. It urged Berlin to improve and broaden its asylum policies towards Hong Kong.
Some Western governments, including Britain and Canada, have offered a path to citizenship for some seeking to flee Hong Kong.

Maduro's adversaries say the parliamentary vote is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party, and most opposition parties have ruled out fielding candidates. 
The consultation will likely help the opposition demonstrate the broad rejection of Maduro after years of economic crisis, but does not by itself offer a clear path toward a change of government or resolution of the economic situation.
""This is, I want to emphasize, the last resource we have in the constitution,"" said Blanca Marmol, a former supreme court magistrate who is helping organize the effort, in a press conference alongside other citizen activists.
""We have been fighting for 20 years, making use of all the resources that the constitution establishes, which have been systematically snatched (from us).""
The group has not yet determined the logistics or the exact date. They are seeking to activate physical centers and are also studying the possibility for virtual participation, which would be crucial to ensure participation of some 5 million Venezuelans who have emigrated to escape the economic crisis. 
The idea of a popular consultation was first proposed in August by opposition leader and congress chief Juan Guaido, who is recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's legitimate president following Maduro's disputed 2018 re-election. 

The term of the current opposition-run assembly expires in January.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - A new ceasefire in the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh was in jeopardy on Monday with Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces reporting shelling and heavy fighting.
Among accusations on both sides, Azerbaijan said it had ""neutralised"" a missile fired by Armenian forces at an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan on Sunday, several hours after the ceasefire went into force. Armenia denied firing it. 
The ceasefire was agreed on Saturday after an earlier deal brokered by Russia failed to halt the deadliest clashes in the South Caucasus since the 1990s.
So far, the main driver of diplomacy between the ex-Soviet enemies has been Russia. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev both told Russia's TASS news agency in separate interviews on Monday that they were ready to come to Moscow for talks.
The failure to stop the fighting has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis, and put new strains on ties between Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and its NATO allies which want the conflict to end.
Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave of Azerbaijan that is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, said 729 of its military personnel and 36 civilians had been killed in fighting that began on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan said 61 Azeri civilians had been killed and 282 wounded. It has not disclosed its military casualties. 
Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces were shelling their positions in northern and southern areas of the line of contact that divides them.
They said Azeri forces had shelled civilian settlements including the town of Martuni and four villages - charges that were denied by Azerbaijan. They reported one civilian killed and one wounded in Martuni.
The Azeri defence ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Agjebedin, Tovuz and Dashkesan regions far from the conflict zone - accusations denied by Armenia.
The ministry also said Terter and Aghdam regions were under shelling. AzTV state television said one of its journalists was wounded in Terter. 
The Azeri prosecutor general's office said Armenia had targeted a pipeline in the Khizi district of Azerbaijan, more than 300 km (186 miles) from the conflict zone, on Sunday afternoon. The pipeline, which carries oil to Novorossiisk in Russia, was not damaged but some missile fragments fell about 250 metres (820 feet) away, it said.
Dismissing the report, Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said: ""It's a total lie.""
ANGRY RHETORIC
A ceasefire brokered in Moscow earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed, but it had little impact on the fighting.
The new ceasefire was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to the Armenian and Azeri foreign ministers by telephone. 
In a fresh appeal for peace on Monday, Lavrov said it was vital to stop the angry rhetoric around the conflict, a step, he said, that ""does not require any great effort"". 
Russia, France and the United States chair a body called the Minsk Group, which has attempted to help resolve the conflict under the umbrella of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).

Turkey says their mediation has failed, and Azerbaijan wants a role for Ankara in peacemaking. Baku seeks an Armenian withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh, but Armenia rules this out and accuses Azerbaijan of making a land grab.

Dutch justice minister explains lockdown rules for weed","AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government told parliament on Monday it could sit back and relax as there are no extra rules needed to prevent people having or smoking cannabis in public places during the coronavirus pandemic.
The government ordered a partial lockdown on Oct. 13, closing restaurants except for takeaway services and forbidding the sale of alcohol and marijuana after 8 p.m.
But parliament, stressed at the prospect that the rules for weed-smokers might still be laxer than those for alcohol-drinkers, passed a motion directing the government to ensure that smoking marijuana and hashish in public would not be tolerated in public places between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m.
Justice Minister Ferd Grapperhaus told the lawmakers in a letter that they might be slightly confused by the complexities of the country's existing laws and practices.
Under Dutch law, the possession of marijuana remains technically illegal, Grapperhaus explained in a letter to parliament. While police do not usually enforce the law against people who hold less than five grams, they always have the power to do so.
Under the country's tolerance policy, the drug is sold openly at cafes known as ""coffee shops.""
But the Oct. 13 lockdown rules had already specified that cafes and restaurants would be closed except for takeaways and that sales of alcohol, marijuana and hashish would be banned after 8 p.m.
In addition, Grapperhaus wrote, gatherings of more than four people are temporarily banned. That ensures that police could break up an unruly marijuana-smoking mob - if one should ever form during the pandemic.

""Thus, the demands of this motion may be satisfied by making use of existing powers,"" the minister explained.

CHICHESTER, England (Reuters) - An 80-year-old retired British army major is attempting to row 100 miles (161 km) in a boat he built from corrugated iron to raise money for a hospice, following the example of record-breaking fundraiser Captain Tom Moore.
Michael Stanley, also known as Major Mick, said he built the vessel during the COVID-19 lockdown, inspired by boats he had seen used by children in India.
""It was an idea I had in my mind when the lockdown came. I thought I'd buy two sheets of corrugated iron and hopefully make it float like a boat,"" he said in an interview. 
Stanley started rowing the boat, which he has named ""Tintanic"", along the Chichester canal in West Sussex, southern England, last month. 
""It goes extremely well, I've worked out it travels about two miles an hour,"" he said. ""It glides through the water and generally speaking doesn't leak too much."" 
He is doing two three-mile round trips every week until he completes his challenge, which is benefiting the local Saint Wilfrid's Hospice. 
Stanley, who served in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards for 35 years, has already raised 12,000 pounds ($15,600), beating his original 1,000 pound target.
His challenge emulates on water the feat of 100-year-old Captain Tom Moore, who raised a record 33 million pounds by walking 100 laps in his garden. Moore was knighted by Queen Elizabeth for his achievement in July.

WARSAW (Reuters) - In April, in the midst of a nationwide coronavirus lockdown in Poland, Katarzyna found out that the baby she was carrying had a severe genetic disorder and would probably die before birth or shortly after. 
She immediately decided to terminate the pregnancy. When she finally managed to, five weeks later and after meeting some 10 doctors, securing a fallback plan in Germany and researching home methods, she knew she would not try to get pregnant again.
""I knew how difficult it can be to get a legal abortion in Poland, so I chose to be stubborn,"" said 38-year-old Katarzyna, who lives in a small town in central Poland and already has two daughters, one of them disabled.
""I don't think I could survive this sense of helplessness and the contempt from the medical community if something went wrong again,"" she said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the subject of abortion is largely taboo in Poland.
Terminations like hers are at the heart of a fierce public debate about abortion rights in predominantly Catholic Poland, expected to culminate with a rare ruling by the Constitutional Tribunal as early as Thursday on whether they are permissible.
Many doctors in Poland, which has some of the strictest abortion rules in Europe, already exercise their legal right to refuse to terminate pregnancies on religious grounds. Some say they are pressured into doing so by their superiors. 
Many in Poland's conservative ruling party, Law and Justice (PiS), including its leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, believe abortions requested on the basis of foetal defects should be banned, and that only terminations due to incest, rape or a threat to a woman's life or health should remain legal. Abortion on demand is already banned in Poland.
But PiS, which came to power five years ago promising to entrench more traditional, Catholic values in public life, has so far been reluctant to push new restrictions through parliament because previous debates sparked a big public outcry.
Its critics say PiS now hopes instead to use the Tribunal to change policy - a charge it denies - after a series of judicial reforms that the European Commission says has undermined the independence of Poland's courts.
A group of right-wing lawmakers has asked the Tribunal, which reviews the compatibility of laws with the constitution, to rule on the legality of aborting defective foetuses. 
""(Abortion) has always been a difficult issue for parliament, it awakens massive public emotions,"" said Bartlomiej Wroblewski, a PiS lawmaker and one of those seeking a verdict.
""I thought we needed to find another place where constitutional arguments on the right to life, on human dignity, the ban on discrimination, can be decisive,"" Wroblewski said.
""GIGANTIC"" STRAIN
PiS denies trying to influence Tribunal rulings, although its shakeup of Poland's judiciary has prompted charges at home and abroad that it is subverting democratic norms. PiS says its reforms only aim to make the judiciary more efficient and fair.
""PiS is afraid to take responsibility for making abortion rules more restrictive. They know perfectly well that current rules are already very difficult to accept,"" Barbara Nowacka, a left-wing lawmaker, told Reuters.
""They want to ban abortion using the Tribunal, which is politicised and staffed with judges appointed illegally,"" she said, referring to changes that give the ruling party a bigger say in appointing judges.
While taking a firmer stand against abortion would play well with PiS's conservative base, there is no wider public clamour for change. An opinion poll published late last year, after PiS won re-election, showed fewer than 15% back a tightening of abortion rules.
Government data shows roughly 1,000 legal abortions are conducted in Poland each year, mostly due to foetal abnormalities. 
Rights activists say thousands more women terminate pregnancies illegally or travel abroad, mainly to Germany, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, where rules are far less strict.
A friend helped Katarzyna find a doctor in Germany who performs abortions for Polish women in case her hospital in Warsaw backed out. She was determined to shield her daughters from the shock of losing a severely ill baby sibling.
If it were not for the coronavirus pandemic, Katarzyna added, ""I wouldn't have gone begging (for an abortion in Poland)... I would have gone abroad.

""The psychological strain was gigantic"".

AMMAN/ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is withdrawing troops from a military post in northwest Syria that was surrounded by Syrian government forces last year, but is consolidating its presence elsewhere in the region, sources familiar with the operation said on Monday.
The observation post at Morek was one of a dozen set up by Turkish soldiers in 2018 under an ill-fated deal to calm fighting between Syrian government troops and Turkey-backed rebels controlling the northwestern Idlib region.
Morek and several other Turkish posts were surrounded last year by advancing Syrian government forces. Ankara has kept them manned and re-supplied since then, while reinforcing the remaining rebel-held territory to hold back government forces and prevent millions of refugees streaming towards Turkey.
Turkish officials have in the past ruled out pulling back from a single observation post, but the sources said there was no longer any military value in staying at Morek.
""The dismantling of the base has begun,"" a senior Syrian opposition figure close to Turkey told Reuters. 
The withdrawal from the exposed position would take several days, he said, describing it as part of Turkish efforts to ""consolidate ceasefire lines"" reached in a March agreement with Russia which halted the heaviest fighting in years around Idlib.
Two other sources familiar with the operation, who asked not to be named, said the withdrawal started early on Monday. ""The Turkish armed forces are not considering evacuating another observation post at this stage,"" one of them said.
Syrian rebels say Turkey retains between 10,000 and 15,000 troops in the pocket of northwest Syria, alongside rebel fighters backed by Ankara and jihadist forces it has committed to disarm and contain.
Already home to 3.6 million Syrian refugees, Turkey is determined to prevent a further influx of people fleeing fighting. The United Nations says there are around 4 million people in north-west Syria, of which 2.7 million have been displaced during the nine-year-old conflict.

Turkey has backed rebels who sought to overthrow Bashar al-Assad. But the Syrian president, supported by Russia and Iran, has driven back the rebel fighters who once threatened to encircle Damascus and are now confined to their small pocket in the northwest of the county.

WASHINGTON/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The United States' land borders between Canada and Mexico will remain closed to all non-essential travel until Nov. 21, the U.S. Homeland Security Department said Monday.
The extension comes as the United States remains one of the worst-affected countries in the world and is reporting the second-highest number of new cases daily.
""To continue to limit the spread of COVID, the U.S., Mexico, and Canada will extend the restrictions on non-essential travel through Nov. 21. We are working closely with Mexico and Canada to identify safe criteria to ease the restrictions in the future and support our border communities,"" said U.S. Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf on Twitter.
Mexico’s foreign ministry also confirmed that the measures will remain in place and unchanged until Nov. 21.
Canada's Public Safety Minister Bill Blair earlier disclosed the latest one-month extension on Twitter, confirming a policy put in place in March to control the spread of COVID-19. 
""We'd love to have the border open ... but we can't do that unless we're comfortable that Canadians are being kept safe,"" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in an interview on AM 900 CHML Hamilton radio earlier on Monday.
""Right now, the situation in the United States continues to be of concern,"" Trudeau added.
Last month, on the day the border extension was confirmed, U.S. President Donald Trump said it would open ""pretty soon"" because Canada wanted the restrictions lifted. But Canada's government has made it clear it does not want the restrictions removed until COVID-19 is under control in both countries.
The restrictions are particularly painful for U.S. and Canadian towns along the border that are tightly intertwined.

Statistics Canada said earlier U.S. visits to Canada by automobile had plummeted by more than 95% in August compared with August 2019.

The quiet cobbled village of Sahel was hosting the third annual competition between female teams in the mountainous Kabylie region to push for a bigger role for women in Algerian society. 
""Women before weren't free, weren't allowed to work outside of the house ... now we have rights, we can be lawyers, pilots, or do any other jobs, and we are equal to men,"" said Houria Hamza, one of the players. 
The cause of women's rights in Algeria has gained traction in recent weeks after the rape and murder of a young woman whose alleged assailant had already been accused of attacking her years earlier. 
The case has prompted outrage and protests in Algiers, despite a public ban on demonstrations because of the coronavirus pandemic. Police have arrested a suspect. 
""They don't have a heart and they don't have a brain. Those who kill deserve to be killed,"" said, Naima, 52, a Sahel villager who did not want to give her last name, referring to men who attack women. 
In the Kaylie region east of Algiers, a bastion of Amazigh-speaking Berber culture, women had long held influential roles in society but a 1990s Islamist insurgency pushed many back into their homes. 
Hamza, a 37-year-old housewife, helped her team to win the title after defeating the village of Tabouda in a penalty shootout cheered on by dozens of women clapping and chanting. 

""There is a lot for women to achieve. Just as much as men. Maybe even more than men,"" said Fadila Bekkouche, head of the village's women's association.

The ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) said the three – two women and a man – were abducted on Wednesday while campaigning in Rakhine before a Nov. 8 election.
The western region, where most parliamentary seats are held by Rakhine nationalist opponents of Myanmar’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi, has been beset by an insurgency that has intensified this year.
The Arakan Army (AA), the rebel group battling government troops there, said in a statement posted online the three candidates would be ""detained and investigated as required by circumstances till a certain time"".
It accused the NLD of complicity with military ""atrocities"" against civilians but said it was willing to free the group in return for the release of students arrested while protesting the war and other ""innocent people"" detained by authorities.
""If they make demands in this way, it would difficult for us to comply,"" Myo Nyunt, a member of the NLD’s central executive committee, told Reuters by phone.
The country's election committee said on Saturday more than half the polling stations initially planned in Rakhine will no longer operate, as parts of the state are too unstable for voting.
The AA, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist ethnic majority in Rakhine, seeks greater autonomy for the region from the central government.
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced since fighting began in early 2019 and dozens killed. 
The Arakan Student Union said four of its members had been detained on Monday after marching through the state capital of Sittwe holding banners criticising the government and military.
Several other students have been arrested after similar protests in recent weeks.

TORONTO (Reuters) - As Canada's world-class ski resorts brace of a winter without international tourists due to closed borders, many are betting that locals eager to get onto the slopes will help make up for the lost revenues for the resorts.
Canada closed its borders since March to all but immediate and extended family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to limit the spread of COVID-19.
That poses a problem for both the ski resorts and their towns, mainly concentrated in the west coast province of British Columbia, who rely on international tourists buying ski lessons, renting gear and spending locally, to buoy their economies.
""We are desperately trying to make that up with domestic booking,"" said Michael Ballingall, senior vice president of Big White Ski Resort, located around 450 km (280 miles) east of Vancouver. The resort plans to roll out flight deals and discounts on long-term stays to attract Canadians.
Although international visitors represent just 21% of reservations, they contribute 32% of revenue, Ballingall said, underscoring how the different spending patterns of domestic visitors won't necessarily bridge the budget gap - Canadians take fewer lessons, buy little or no equipment and eat out less frequently.
Ballingall said the resort had lost C$4 million in bookings as of Sept. 1.
Whistler Blackcomb, the site of the 2010 Winter Olympics and consistently ranked as the top ski resort in the world by trade publications, is optimistic about locals filling in the gap left by international skiers, said Marc Riddell, West Coast director of communications for the resort's owner, Vail Resorts (NYSE:MTN) Inc.
The company, which also owns Vail and Breckenridge resorts in Colorado, and Park City (NASDAQ:PCYG) in Utah, reported in its most recent quarterly earnings that it had sold 18% more passes as of September than in the season prior, in part driven by more people renewing their passes. 
However, the dollar value of those sales decreased by 4% year-over-year, because of credits from lost passes in the previous year due to the pandemic shuttering resorts early. Vail does not track the number of passes sold by each specific resort.
In Whistler, Riddell said, the resort is ""optimistic it'll be a good season, but we are aware of what's going on around the world. We understand the border closure will have an impact on our traditional customer base.""
Tourism Whistler declined to say how much accommodation bookings dropped this year, but said that in a normal year 60% of Whistler's visitors were international. The overwhelming majority of those people are unlikely to be able to enter Canada this season.
The town's mayor, Jack Crompton, thinks this means it will be an unusually good year for locals because the mountain will be missing so many skiers.
""One of the big advantages of Whistler is that when you're here you're very close to no one,"" he said.
Another boost to Whistler's tourism is expected to come from Canadians relocating on a longer-term basis to take advantage of remote-work policies, to the point where the local tourism board has created a landing page on the topic, Crompton said.
For Sophie Galloway, 22, online classes and a lighter course load at her university in Vancouver mean that it's been worth it to buy a season's pass at Whistler, hoping for shorter lift lineups and emptier slopes.
She has been social distancing since March and is ""looking forward to have skiing as that one thing"" to do during the pandemic, she said.

""I would like to think (Whistler is) taking good precautions,"" she said, adding that she feels safe skiing because ""unless you have an accident, you don't have contact with a lot of people.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India announced on Monday that Australia will join annual naval exercises scheduled with the United States and Japan, in a move that could raise concerns in China, which has previously criticised any joint drills as destabilising.
India is hosting the Malabar drills in the Bay of Bengal scheduled for later next month. 
""As India seeks to increase cooperation with other countries in the maritime security domain and in the light of increased defence cooperation with Australia, Malabar 2020 will see the participation of the Australian Navy,"" the defence ministry said in a statement. 
Australia will be returning to the joint manoeuvres after its participation in 2007 that drew criticism from China. 
The United States has been pushing for a deeper collaboration with Japan, India and Australia as a bulwark against China's growing regional influence.
These four have formed the so-called Quad, a loose strategic coalition of the four leading democracies in the region. The joint drills will be the first concrete action of the grouping, analysts say.
""The participants of Exercise Malabar 2020 are engaging to enhance safety and security in the maritime domain. They collectively support free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific and remain committed to a rules based international order,"" the Indian defence ministry said. 
China has denounced the Quad as an attempt to contain its development.
India's decision on expanding the exercises comes at a time when it is locked in a military stand-off on the disputed land border with China. 
Thousands of troops are in close proximity in the western Himalayas, where India says Chinese troops have intruded deep across its side of the de facto border. 
Beijing denies any intrusion and says India has been building roads and other infrastructure in the disputed area causing the crisis. 
There was no immediate word from China on the Malabar exercises. 
The drills will be the biggest in years involving U.S. and Indian aircraft carriers, as well as major ships from Japan, and Australia, said Captain D. K. Sharma, a former Indian navy spokesman. 
""This is a most welcome step. It will meet the challenge posed by China.""
Australia's diplomatic relations with China also worsened this year, after Canberra led calls for an international inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic and Beijing imposed trade sanctions on Australian beef and barley.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Sitting in his caravan in downtown Sofia, Alexander Balkanski, a former acrobat and trapeze artist and the founder of Bulgaria's largest circus, swings between hope and despair as he counts the emotional and financial costs of the COVID-19 pandemic.
This year Balkanski, 78, had hoped to celebrate the 200th anniversary of his family's involvement in circus and the 20th birthday of Circus Balkanski, but the lockdown has drastically curtailed the season, which usually runs from April to November.
Balkanski mortgaged his home to raise 250,000 euros for a new tent ordered to mark the anniversaries. He had to re-arrange his programme six times amid accumulating bills and artist cancellations, and the circus only opened its doors on Sept. 1.
""All over Europe circuses are on their knees, including us,"" said Balkanski, whose family originally came from Italy and who himself has been performing since the age of eight.
A welcome injection of 50,000 euros in state aid was spent within days on back pay, rents and maintenance bills for his 40-member troupe.
People initially flocked back to the Big Top in September to watch Balkanski's son and daughter-in-law perform an acrobatic 'Wheel of Death' and the 'Hell Riders' from Colombia on motorcycles.
Balkanski also contracted aerial gymnasts and other performers from Italy, Ukraine, Moldova and Russia.
But, like much of Europe, Bulgaria has seen a surge in COVID-19 infections this autumn, and this has quickly dented the numbers of visitors coming to the 2,000-seat venue.
""We started the first week very well, with about 300-600 visitors per day. The second week we saw a 10% drop,"" he said.
In recent days, that has slowed to a trickle of a few dozen.
""I do not want circus to die before me. I want to go before the circus dies,"" said Balkanski.
During a long career he has performed to Communist-era leaders such as Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov and the Soviet Union's Leonid Brezhnev, and also to U.S. President Richard Nixon and Britain's Queen Elizabeth.
His most cherished memory is performing at the Vatican City for Pope John Paul II in 1986.
Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, Balkanski remains defiant that the show must, and will, go on.

""Bulgaria needs to know that Circus Balkanski is alive. Our season ends on Nov. 22 and I am sure we will have the strength to persevere.""

AMARA, Iraq (Reuters) - Hasanain Alminshid had received death threats for his human rights activism for years, but ignored most of them. After his mentor was gunned down outside a police station, he finally made the difficult choice to flee Iraq.
""It's too dangerous now. There have been killings in the open in front of security forces,"" he said, speaking by 'phone from Istanbul, where he has based himself since that incident in November last year.
Alminshid, 29, his mentor Amjad Aldhamat and several other activists had attended a meeting with police to discuss a planned protest in their hometown of Amara in southern Iraq during some of the most deadly anti-government unrest that swept Iraq last year.
As Aldhamat walked out, gunmen sped past in a car with tinted windows and no licence plates and shot him dead. Alminshid left the country five days later.
It was one of dozens of targeted killings that have pushed more and more young Iraqi civil society activists, rights workers and journalists to flee what they say is a continuing onslaught by militia groups.
Rights groups say the departure of people whose activities range from educating Iraqis about their right to vote to leading protests against perceived abuses has further weakened civil society movements that have been active for decades.
The independent rights organization Al-Amal says at least 44 kidnappings and 74 attempted killings of activists have taken place, mostly in Baghdad and southern Iraq, in the last year. 
It has documented at least 39 killings since October 2019, when thousands of Iraqis took to the streets in mass anti-government protests demanding jobs and the departure of the ruling elite which they said was corrupt.
The protests toppled former prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi in December but lost steam after more than 500 people were killed in a crackdown by security forces and unidentified gunmen, and during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Assassinations escalated with the beginning of the protests last year,"" said Hassan Wahab of Al-Amal. ""We have started losing our sources on the ground.""
Reuters spoke to seven activists who fled Iraq in recent months, five of whom said that they were advised by local police to leave because they could not guarantee protection from armed groups.
A military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that security forces were often powerless to protect activists from rogue militias, because those groups had powerful political backers whom he did not name.
Militias linked to political parties, some backed by Iran, have tightened their grip over state institutions since the U.S. invasion that toppled President Saddam Hussein in 2003.
LOST HOPE
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who took office in May, has pledged justice for activists killed or abused by armed groups, and has faced off against some Iran-backed parties.
But the formation of nearly 35 committees by the new government to tackle the challenges, including pursuing those responsible for protesters' deaths, has resulted in no prosecutions so far.
""I've lost all the hope I had in Kadhimi,"" Aldhamat's brother, Mohammed Aldhamat, told Reuters in Amara.
Speaking in Amjad's home, where their mother also lives, he added that his family had been told they would see the results of the investigation into his brother's death within three months. Four months have passed with no word.
An Iraqi government spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said state institutions were ""infiltrated"" by parties and militia groups that had no interest in punishing the killers of protesters.
The government has vowed to crack down on what it says are criminal armed groups trying to destabilise the country, and to impose state control over weapons as part of efforts to reduce the influence of militias.
Alminshid said a police officer at the hospital where Aldhamat was pronounced dead asked him a few questions, but no one has contacted him since.
The day after Aldhamat's killing, military authorities in Amara sent a memo to the interior ministry recommending that security forces protect nine other activists it said were on a hit list, according to a document seen by Reuters.
A military official confirmed the document's authenticity.
One of the activists on that list, 28-year-old Hamza Qassem, got wind of the memo through a friend in the Amara police force and left for Istanbul, where he, Alminshid and other exiled Iraqis who used to run a rights NGO in Amara now reside.
That NGO no longer exists. Seven of its founders are in Turkey and three have been killed.
""Amara has become a terrifying city,"" Qassem said.
The main protest site in Amara, which was occupied a year ago by throngs of anti-government protesters, is now sealed off by security forces and metal gates.

""We took to the streets and asked for a nation, but the authorities gave us a cemetery,"" said one of the protesters, Haider Halim. ""The only solution is to leave.""

Rinat Akhmetchin, who resigned as mayor in July, was charged with negligence after a fuel tank at a power station in the remote, industrial region lost pressure and collapsed in late May, leaking more than 20,000 tonnes of fuel into rivers and subsoil.
Greenpeace has compared the incident to the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez oil spill off the coast of Alaska.
The Krasnoyarsk Regional Court said in a statement that in addition to his community service, Akhmetchin would have his salary cut by 15% during that period. It did not specify the capacity in which he would carry out his community service.
Russia's Investigative Committee, the body that probes serious crimes, charged Akhmetchin with criminal negligence in June, saying he had failed to coordinate and organise emergency measures to contain and control fallout from the spill.
Norilsk, a city of 180,000 people located 300 km (190 miles) inside the Arctic Circle, is built around Norilsk Nickel, the world's leading nickel and palladium producer.

The company has disputed the environmental cost of the spill as assessed by Russia's environment watchdog.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Restaurants and shops in the European Union could be barred from marketing products as ""veggie burgers"" or ""vegan sausage"" if farmers get their way in a debate this week in the European parliament.
Proposed amendments to a farming bill would also prohibit describing non-dairy items as being ""like"" or in the ""style"" of milk, butter or cheese.
Farmers say the measures are needed to protect consumers from being misled. Medical groups, environmentalists and companies that make vegetarian products say it would be a step backwards in meeting the bloc's environmental and health goals.
The amendments will be discussed during debate of wider agricultural reforms. The European Parliament cannot impose the changes on its own, but would adopt a position ahead of negotiations with the bloc's member countries.
Under one proposed amendment, terms such as steak, sausage, escalope, burger and hamburger would be permitted only for products containing meat.
The European Court of Justice already banned the likes of ""soy milk"" and ""vegan cheese"" three years ago, ruling terms such as milk, cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt cannot be used for non-dairy products. A proposed amendment would go further, barring marketers of plant-based foods from comparing them to dairy with words such as ""style"", ""type"", ""method"" or ""like"".
European farmers association Copa Cogeca says the European Union should put an end to ""surrealistic"" descriptions. It argues that condoning such terms as ""vegan burger"" would open a Pandora (OTC:PANDY)'s box that would confuse consumers and harm farmers.
In the opposite corner, a group of plant-based food proponents, including producers Unilever (NYSE:UL) and Ikea as well as the European Medical Association, called the proposals ""disproportionate and out of step with the current climate"".

Some party groups are seeking a softer approach. A proposal backed by the Socialists would continue to allow terms for meat-free products that have been in use for a long time, as long as packaging makes clear they contain no meat.

344,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","As U.S. election looms, Europe weighs risk of a disputed result","By Robin Emmott, Andreas Rinke and Luke Baker
BRUSSELS/BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - With less than three weeks until the U.S. presidential election, European capitals are concerned about the risk of a disputed outcome and the impact it would have in the United States and abroad.
While Democrat candidate Joe Biden leads in opinion polls, the 2016 election produced a split between the popular vote and the Electoral College. Analysts say that remains possible on Nov. 3.
With Trump equivocating on whether he would accept a peaceful transfer of power if he loses, and suggesting the Supreme Court may have to decide the winner, the risk of a contested result is significant.
One British bookmaker is offering 9/4 that Trump will lose the popular vote but be re-elected, odds that imply a 69% probability. A poll of global fund managers by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) found 60% expected the result to be disputed.
In major European capitals, where many quietly hope the election will produce a change of president and a shift in U.S. policy on issues from climate to trade, NATO and the Iran nuclear deal, caution prevails.
""The majority of EU governments hope for a Biden victory, although no one would say that,"" said one EU diplomat.
""Governments are looking at scenarios, contingency plans, although it remains to be seen what could be done in the case of Trump contesting the result.""
German officials have been thinking through the implications for months - since Trump raised doubts about whether he would accept the outcome. ""We analyse what could happen, different scenarios,"" one said. 
Presidential elections have been disputed in the past, as in 2000, when lawyers for Al Gore and George W. Bush spent a month arguing over a Florida recount that the Supreme Court ultimately decided in Bush's favour.
But a dispute this time could last longer and be more unpredictable, officials say, including the risk of violence on the streets, legal challenges and the chance Trump refuses to vacate the White House. 
LEADERSHIP VACUUM?
That would have grave implications in a country already polarised over race and politics and battling the coronavirus. 
Washington is in a trade dispute with China and trying to exert influence from the South China Sea to Yemen. A contested result could risk a leadership vacuum that Beijing, Moscow or Pyongyang might seek to exploit. Geopolitical analysts are concerned, for example, that China might move against Taiwan.
For Britain, it would create more uncertainty as a potential no-deal Brexit kicks in on Jan. 1, and as London tries to clinch a trade deal with Washington.
Britain's Foreign Office says it is ""ready for any outcome"".
For France, it could mean the difference between the United States fully withdrawing from the Paris climate accord or potentially rejoining it under Biden. 
NATO wants a strong U.S. recommitment whether Trump or Biden wins, and countries in east Europe, always wary of Russia, want U.S. security promises kept, including more troops in Poland. 
""There are several concerns – one is that Trump will be reelected,"" said a senior EU official. ""The other big concern is that there might be violence on the streets in the U.S. after the elections.""
Some European officials feel more confident now about Biden winning.
""I think the game's almost over,"" said one. ""For a long time we thought Trump would do it, but now, I don't see it.""
Yet in Brussels, officials fear Trump's return would mean another four years of tension. They are preparing for either outcome, while hoping that the result is accepted. 

If Trump disputes it, one official said, ""it would send Washington into political paralysis"". Brussels would have to look at ""how quickly the rats leave the sinking ship"", including how quickly the Republican party distances itself from Trump.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Boldizsar Nagy hoped that the tales in the children's book ""Wonderland Is For Everyone"" would help youngsters to learn to accept minorities and fight social ostracism.
Instead, it has caused a stir in Hungarian politics, with the far-right and the ruling nationalist government labelling it ""homosexual propaganda"" that should be banned from schools. 
More than 1,200 psychologists have since signed a petition in defence of the book, which was edited by Nagy. The tales include stories about Tivadar, a bunny born with three ears, an adopted boy, and Batbajan, a Roma boy, who is hated by his step-mother for his skin colour but finds love when he meets Zeke, a fair-haired boy. 
Only a few of the 17 stories that teach acceptance towards people who are in some way ""different"", are about LGBT+ heroes.
Nagy, 37, who is gay and has Roma roots, says the backlash signals a rise in official intolerance of LGBT+ people and fits into the government's political agenda.
""It is unbecoming that a children's book is used for inciting hatred...or political gains,"" he said. ""Looking at what happened in Poland or Russia, it does not bode well for the future. We are concerned.""
Russia in 2013 passed a law banning the distribution of ""propaganda of non-traditional sexual relationships"" to minors.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which faces elections in early 2022 and promotes a strongly Christian-conservative agenda, has so far refrained from strong attacks on the LGBT+ community, unlike Poland, where homophobia has been part of the ruling PiS party's ideology.
This appears to be changing now.
Orban, who faces the biggest challenge of his decade-long rule due to the coronavirus pandemic and a deep recession, told state radio that Hungary was a tolerant country when it comes to homosexuality, but ""there is a red line that should not be crossed ... leave our children alone.""
In a speech over the weekend, he returned to the issue.
""There is a growing debate around us, a struggle almost at daggers drawn, about the future of our children. What influences should they be under?...How should they relate to their families, to Hungarian identity, and even to the sex they have been born into?""
A government spokesman declined to say if the government was planning any legal changes. In a reply to Reuters questions he said: ""We have said all we wanted with relation to this issue."" 
LIVING WITH STIGMA
The book sold out fast after a lawmaker from the far-right Our Homeland party tore a copy apart and shredded it at a news conference. On Friday, a new edition came out in print. 
Several actors have volunteered to take part in a podcast, and the support they received was encouraging, Nagy said. But a widening divide in society around the issue could make lives of LGBT+ people harder, he said.
""It takes years for everyone to accept their indentity which is a stigma in Hungary...especially if you grow up in the countryside or in a religious family,"" he said.
""This book was a little bit also self-therapy for me.""
Nagy came out when he was 30 and he was able to openly talk about being gay at work. Living in a stable relationship for six years, he and his partner want to adopt a child.
This is only possible in Hungary for gay couples if one of them applies as a single person as Hungary does not allow gay marriage.
Having been on the waiting list for two years, they had high hopes. These were dampened on Oct. 5 when the government tweaked legislation, saying that for each child, a married couple should first be searched nationwide. The civil law already says married couples should enjoy priority in adoption. 

""We thought we would have a child by Christmas...theoretically single people and gay people can still adopt a child, but this will be a much longer process,"" Nagy said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean Pedro Campos hatched a plan to bake and sell homemade sourdough bread to neighbors after riots in Santiago last year shuttered the restaurant where he worked and the coronavirus pandemic left many shops closed. Business is now booming.
Campos is not alone in reinventing himself. More than 2 million Chileans have lost their jobs in the past year, the result of a one-two punch from the mass protests in 2019 and the pandemic this year.
Campos told Reuters the predicament forced him to learn a new trade. ""I needed to start making something,"" he said.
Now he doubts he'll ever go back to work for someone else.
The size of the informal sector - unreported, often clandestine jobs that range from selling masks on the street to ad hoc construction work - is hard to measure.
But the trend has prompted the government to launch a 'Your Company in a Day' campaign to legalize and cut red tape for entrepreneurs like Campos. In August alone, economy ministry data show that 16,545 companies were created, around a fifth more than a year earlier - despite the health crisis.
Small local businesses are flourishing on social media and chat groups like WhatsApp, offering items from food and beverages to jewelry and even bikes. 
""This shows that people know entrepreneurship can be an alternative source of employment, and a way to reinvent themselves with economic support that allows them to get ahead,"" economy ministry undersecretary Esteban Carrasco told reporters.
Andrés, who lost his job as a chef in a restaurant, joined with two partners to create a ""virtual pizzeria,"" whose menu he promotes with photos on Instagram. They deliver pizzas by bike.
Andres - who didn't want to give his last name because the work remains ""underground"" and informal - said booming sales were encouraging them to set up a bigger, better business model.

""We have a lot of underground sales to wholesalers who buy 50 pizzas from us and resell them in their condos or to their contacts,"" he said.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Ozioma Egemasi says Nigerian police slapped, whipped and struck him with the butt of a pistol when he refused to pay them a bribe. Then he heard them discuss whether to kill him.
The 24-year-old music label manager shared his experience on Instagram, one of thousands of mostly young Nigerians who are taking to social media to speak out against alleged abuses by police and to coordinate ongoing protests.
Thousands of people have taken to the streets daily across the country in one of the biggest shows of public anger in 30 years, posing a major challenge to President Muhammadu Buhari amid an economic slump made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.
""I was scared. It meant they were willing to do anything to get whatever they wanted to get from me,"" said Egemasi, recalling the January encounter with members of Nigeria's Special Anti-robbery Squad (SARS).
Reuters could not independently verify his account. A Lagos state police spokesman did not respond to phone calls and a text message seeking comment on the allegations.
The police force has previously denied accusations against SARS that are fuelling the unrest, although it said earlier this month that ""unruly and unprofessional"" officers had been arrested and were facing disciplinary actions.
Other concessions have been made since nationwide demonstrations began on Oct. 8: SARS was disbanded on Oct. 11 and a new police unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team, was created to ""fill the gaps"".
But it has not had the desired effect. Protesters say they have heard such promises before and demand deeper changes, including the prosecution of police accused of wrongdoing.
Rallying under the #EndSars hashtag and harnessing social media to raise awareness and funds and to garner support from international celebrities, protesters have built a momentum that previous actions led by civil groups and unions failed to do.
There are clear parallels with anti-government movements in places like Hong Kong and Belarus, said Antony Goldman, chief executive of London-based political risk advisory firm ProMedia Consulting.
""They have increasingly connected young, urban populations that have found a cause, and social media has triggered very rapid momentum,"" Goldman said.
The Nigerian protesters have drawn support from Black Lives Matter activists in the United States, including the movement's co-founder Opal Tometi, and from Canadian rapper Drake and British-Nigerian actor John Boyega.
A Twitter account using the name of the internet activist collective Anonymous said last week it had hacked into Nigerian government websites in solidarity with the #EndSars campaign. Government officials did not confirm any breaches. [L8N2H80L6]
TECH TARGETS? 
Members of Nigeria's burgeoning tech industry, a bright spot for foreign investors in Africa's most populous nation, say they are often singled out by police for spot checks.
Iyinoluwa Aboyeji, co-founder of software developer training firm Andela and payments company Flutterwave, said so many employees had been harassed that his companies had protocols in place to call senior police officials in the event of an arrest.
Egemasi said his laptop and financial transactions on his cell phone aroused the suspicion of the five SARS officers who stopped him in a Lagos street at the start of the year.
""This happens all the time to young people because they believe we are young and not supposed to have that kind of money,"" he told Reuters. 
He said he was freed after paying a 500,000 naira ($1,300) bribe.
As he spoke, Egemasi was surrounded by more than a thousand protesters at a toll gate in the upmarket Lekki district of Lagos on Saturday.
Music blared out of tall speakers. A giant electronic billboard displayed slogans such as ""Soro Soke"", a Yoruba phrase meaning ""Speak Up"". And activists doled out free food and collected litter in black plastic bags.
CROWDFUNDING
Such gatherings have largely been financed through crowdfunding, activists say. 
The Feminist Coalition, a Nigerian rights group coordinating some of the logistics, said on its fundraising page it had received more than 73 million naira ($192,000) as of Sunday. 
The funds have been used to hire private security guards to defend protesters against armed gangs who attacked some demonstrations last week, pay for private ambulances and cover the legal bills of more than 70 participants arrested across Nigeria, according to a spokeswoman for the group.
The crowdfunding is necessary to avoid political interference, said the spokeswoman, who asked not to be identified for fear of censure by the government.
""This is a decentralized, democratic process."" 
Two Nigerian banks closed the group's accounts last week, so they converted their savings to bitcoin and started fundraising in the cryptocurrency, she added.
Donations soared after  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) CEO Jack Dorsey on Wednesday posted a tweet https://twitter.com/jack/status/1316485283777519620?s=20 encouraging his nearly 5 million followers to contribute.
The crowdfunding has helped make the demonstrations among the biggest and longest-running in decades, said Cheta Nwanze of SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based risk advisory firm.
The provision of free food was a ""very good use of resources,"" he added. Most people live on less than $2 a day. 
""It's helping to sustain the momentum.""

351,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>",Kyrgyzstan acting president seeks constitution change to run for full term,"(Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan's new acting president Sadyr Japarov, who came to power last week in a popular uprising, said on Monday he plans to run for a full term if the country amends its constitution to allow it.
Japarov's new ambitions could put him at odds with some of the political parties that helped bring him to power, which had backed him only as an interim leader to chart a path out of a political crisis which followed a disputed election.
The constitution bars caretaker presidents from running in elections they oversee. Japarov, 51, took over as acting president last week after unrest toppled his predecessor Sooronbai Jeenbekov's government.
""Parliament is currently preparing amendments to laws governing presidential and parliamentary elections,"" Japarov told the Russia 24 news channel in an interview. ""If I am able to run as a result of those amendments, I will do so.""
A nationalist opposition figure who had been serving a sentence for attempting to kidnap a political opponent, Japarov was freed from prison by his followers during violent protests which followed a disputed parliamentary election on Oct. 4.
Parliament named him prime minister last week and Jeenbekov confirmed him before quitting. His rise so far appears to have been blessed by Kyrgyzstan's key ally Russia, which indicated its support for his cabinet. The uprising was the third popular revolt to topple a president in Kyrgyzstan since 2005.
As prime minister and acting head of state, Japarov must now oversee a rerun of the parliamentary election as well as a vote for a new president. Dates for both votes have yet to be set. Amending the constitution could require a referendum.
Japarov last week named his closest ally Kamchybek Tashiyev head of state security, and published a long-term programme, a clear hint he planned to become more than a temporary leader.
In the Russia 24 interview, he also reassured Moscow it would remain Bishkek's No.1 ally and ruled out the revision of any bilateral deals. Kyrgyzstan borders China and hosts a Russian air base.

""Our ties with Russia are multifaceted and we cannot be distant from Russia in terms of geopolitics, or military cooperation, or economy,"" Japarov said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The head of the Tibetan government in exile said he met the new U.S. special coordinator on Tibet, whose appointment last week angered China, at the State Department, the first political head of the Tibetans in exile to be hosted there in 60 years.
U.S. Secretary of State of Mike Pompeo last week appointed senior human rights official Robert Destro as special envoy for Tibetan issues. Beijing responded sharply, saying this was an attempt to destabilise Tibet and that it would not allow any interference there.
While U.S. officials including most U.S. presidents have met the Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, at the White House, they have been careful about formally hosting the head of the government-in-exile as this would be seen as a major provocation by Beijing. 
Lobsang Sangay, the president of the Tibetan Central Administration (CTA), said this was the first time the head of the CTA was received at the State Department.
""So this is historic, they are thereby acknowledging the Tibetans' democratically elected leader and the CTA. It was a sound political gesture on the part of the U.S government,"" he told Reuters over telephone from the United States.
U.S. President Donald Trump has not yet met the Dalai Lama but has taken a tough posture towards China. Relations between Washington and Beijing are at their lowest point in decades over a range of issues, including trade, Taiwan, human rights, the South China Sea and the coronavirus.
China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it describes as a ""peaceful liberation"" that helped the remote Himalayan region throw off its ""feudalist"" past. But critics say Beijing's rule amounts to ""cultural genocide.""
Sangay said he and Destro agreed on the early passage of the new Tibet Policy and Support Act through the U.S. Senate in the next few months. 
The legislation, which was approved by the House of Representatives this year, lay out a stronger U.S. stand on Tibet since the original act in 2002, Sangay said. 
It calls for the establishment of a U.S. consulate in Lhasa, the absolute right of the Tibetans to choose a successor to the Dalai Lama and preserving Tibet's environment.

""This is big, it is a major revision of the 2002 Tibet policy act,"" Sangay said. ""Everything we wanted, is there in the act.""

353,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 19, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>","China denies report it may detain Americans, says U.S. mistreats its scholars","BEIJING (Reuters) - China denied on Monday that foreign nationals are under threat of arbitrary detention, following a newspaper report that Beijing had warned Washington it might arrest Americans in China.
The Chinese foreign ministry said it was Washington that was mistreating foreign citizens, accusing the United States of ""outright political repression"" of Chinese academics. 
""The U.S. claim that foreign nationals in China are under threat of arbitrary detention is playing the victim and confusing black and white,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a regular news briefing. China protects the safety and legitimate rights of foreigners, he said.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday that Chinese officials had issued repeated warnings to U.S. government officials that China may detain Americans in response to the Justice Department's prosecution of Chinese scholars affiliated to the military.
In September, a State Department advisory warned against travel to China, saying the Chinese government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans for U.S. citizens and others ""to gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments"".
The Trump administration has increasingly accused China of using cyber operations and espionage to steal U.S. technological, military and other know-how. Beijing denies this.
Earlier this year, Chinese prosecutors in June indicted two Canadian citizens on espionage charges, a move seen by Western governments as punishment for Canada's arrest of Huawei Technologies Co.[HWT.UL] Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in late 2018.

Beijing has denied the indictment was related to Meng's case and has repeatedly called for the release of Meng. China hopes Canada can think more about the future of the two countries' relationship and settle Meng's case at an early date, said Zhao.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin is in talks on a possible cabinet reshuffle in an attempt to appease a key ally that has threatened to pull support for the ruling coalition, three sources said on Monday. 
Muhyiddin is facing a premiership challenge from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who last week met Malaysia's king in a bid to prove he has majority support from lawmakers, including from among government turncoats, to form a new government.
The prime minister has since entered fresh discussions with the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest party in his coalition, to negotiate new terms that could include more prominent cabinet positions for the party, sources close to the government and UMNO said.
A breakthrough in the talks could stall Anwar's premiership bid, but also leave Muhyiddin hanging by a two-seat majority in the 222-seat parliament while he grapples with an economy battered by the coronavirus and a new surge in infections.
""UMNO is negotiating and it shows they are not ready to exit the coalition,"" said one source.
Another source from UMNO said the party wants more say in deciding on matters such as who among the party are appointed to cabinet and what portfolios they would hold.
The sources asked not to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The two parties are also discussing which constituencies they would contest in a general election, even though polls are not imminent, two of the sources said.
Elections are not due until 2023, but some in the government have pushed for early polls to win a stronger mandate.
Muhyiddin's office and UMNO did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
ANWAR'S BID
UMNO lost a 2018 election in its first defeat since independence over 60 years ago, amid popular anger over allegedly rampant corruption.
But it returned to power in March when it allied with Muhyiddin after the collapse of the administration of veteran politician Mahathir Mohamad.
UMNO members have since balked at playing second fiddle to Muhyiddin's smaller Bersatu party, coalition sources have said.
Speculation has been rife that UMNO lawmakers facing corruption charges were behind Anwar's premiership bid.
On Sunday, UMNO denied that its president, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, and former leader Najib Razak had signed a letter withdrawing support for Muhyiddin and backing Anwar instead. 
Najib was found guilty in July and sentenced to 12 years in jail. He has appealed the verdict and is out on bail, but faces three other corruption trials. Zahid is also in the middle of a graft trial.
Anwar dismissed the rumours last week as ""irrelevant and irresponsible"", and said there was no space for cutting deals with individuals for support.

HANOI (Reuters) - Japan and Vietnam agreed on Monday to strengthen security and economic ties, including an agreement in principle for Japan to export military gear and technology to the Southeast Asian nation, amid concerns about China's regional assertiveness.
""It is a big step in the field of security for both countries that we reached an agreement in principle on the transfers of defence equipment and technology,"" Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga told reporters after meeting his Vietnamese counterpart, Nguyen Xuan Phuc, in Hanoi.
""Vietnam, which is serving as ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian nations) chair this year, is key to realise a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" Suga added.
The leaders also agreed on the importance of maintaining peace, security, freedom of navigation and overflight in the South China Sea, and the peaceful settlement of disputes, Phuc said in a joint media appearance with Suga.
Vietnam and many other Southeast Asian nations have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea.
""Vietnam welcomes Japan, a global power, to continue to actively contribute to regional and global peace, stability and prosperity,"" Phuc said.
Suga, who took office last month after Shinzo Abe quit because of poor health, is making his overseas diplomatic debut this week with a trip to the vital Southeast Asian nations of Vietnam and Indonesia.
In a speech later Monday, Suga said Japan opposed any steps to heighten tensions in the South China Sea.
""Regarding the South China Sea issue, it is important for all countries concerned not to rely on force or threat but to work toward peaceful resolution based on international law,"" Suga said, avoiding harsh anti-China rhetoric.
SUPPLY CHAIN DIVERSITY
Japan must balance its deep economic ties to China with security concerns, including Beijing's push to assert claims over disputed East China Sea isles.
ASEAN members remain wary of losing access to China's economy, and are reluctant to become entrapped in an intense confrontation between Washington and Beijing.
Japan, which ended a decades-old ban on overseas arms sales in 2014 to help strengthen the nation's military and lower the cost of home-built military equipment, has been in talks with Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand on deals to allow such exports.
""We have to make sure the equipment and technologies transferred to Vietnam (are) to be used in a peaceful manner and contribute to regional peace,"" Japanese foreign ministry spokesman Tomoyuki Yoshida told a separate news briefing.
Suga's visit also coincides with Japan's efforts to diversify its supply chains and reduce reliance on China by bringing production home or moving it to Southeast Asia.
""The new coronavirus has made it even clearer that to maintain international supply chains, it is important to lower the risk of disruption and to create sustainable supply systems,"" Suga said.
He added that Japan would further deepen its collaboration with ASEAN in this area.
Vietnam is a popular choice for Japanese companies. Half of the 30 Japanese firms that used a 23.5 billion yen government programme to diversify supply chains in Southeast Asia targeted Vietnam, which has aggressively courted such investment.
Suga said the two countries would bolster their cooperation to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
""We agreed on restarting 'business track' travel as well as passenger flights between the two countries today,"" Suga told the joint media event.
Suga also said Japan would help Vietnamese ""trainees"" working in Japan, many of whom are struggling as the COVID-19 outbreak hits Japanese companies.

Suga and Phuc witnessed the signing of a memorandum of understanding for Japan's Marubeni Corp to invest $1.3 billion in a power plant in Vietnam's Can Tho province and another for Tokyo Gas Co Ltd and PetroVietnam Power Corp to jointly develop a $1.9 billion gas-fired plant in Vietnam.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police said on Monday they had ordered an investigation of four news outlets under emergency measures imposed last week to try to stop three months of protests against the government and monarchy.
The announcement prompted anger from media groups and accusations of an attack on press freedom by the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader the protesters are seeking to drive from office.
According to a police document dated Oct. 16, investigations have been ordered into content from four media outlets as well as the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page of a protest group.
""We received information from intelligence units concerned that parts of the content and distorted information have been used and disseminated to cause confusion and instigate causing unrest to society,"" police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen told a news conference.
He said it was for Thailand's broadcast regulator and digital ministry to investigate and take appropriate action, adding that there was no plan to curb press freedom.
Putchapong Nodthaisong, a spokesman for the digital ministry, said it had requested court orders to take down content by the four media outlets and a protest page, among more than 300,000 pieces of content it said violated Thai laws.
Prachatai, an independent outlet among those being investigated, described it as a censorship order.
""Honored to report accurate info about human rights and political development in Thailand, we'll try our best in continuing to do so,"" Prachathai English said on Twitter.
The Manushya Foundation, an independent group which campaigns for online freedom, called the measures an attempt to silence free media.
""Since the ban on protests did not work, the military-backed government hopes to create fear of telling the truth,"" its director Emilie Palamy Pradichit said.
""We urge free media to resist.""
The government ordered a ban on news and online information that could affect national security last Thursday as it also banned political gatherings of more than five people in the face of the growing challenge.
Protests have taken place every day since then, the latest drawing tens of thousands of people in Bangkok and across the country. Police gave a figure of 20,000 protesters in the capital.
""We will prosecute everyone,"" deputy Bangkok police chief Piya Tawichai said, adding that 74 protesters had been arrested since Oct. 13.
Protesters seek the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth, accusing him of engineering last year's election to keep hold of power he first seized in a 2014 coup. He says the election was fair.
The protesters have also grown more vocal in demanding reforms to the monarchy to reduce the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn. The Royal Palace has made no comment on the protests or protesters' demands.
Protesters have said they will demonstrate every day, but had yet to set out a plan for protests on Monday.
Prayuth has said he will not quit. Speaking at Government House on Monday, Prayuth said he supported a proposal for a special parliament session to discuss the situation. His supporters have a majority in parliament.

""We are just asking people not to do wrong and destroy the government and people’s property,"" he said. ""What the government needs to do is to protect the monarchy.""

China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory, has recently ramped up pressure on Taipei to accept Chinese sovereignty, including sending fighter jets near the democratically-run island.
The Pacific is a major source of competition between the two, where Taiwan has formal diplomatic relations with four countries, though not Fiji. China says Taiwan is one of its provinces, with no right to full ties with foreign countries.
Taiwan's foreign ministry said the incident happened on the evening of Oct. 8 at a Taiwan national day reception organised by Taiwan's representative office in Fiji, where two Chinese diplomats tried to force their way in to take pictures and collect information on who was attending.
Violence ensued after Taiwanese diplomats tried to prevent them from entering, and a Taiwanese diplomat was sent to hospital with a head injury, the ministry said.
Fiji police forced the Chinese diplomats from the venue, who later said it was them who were attacked by Taiwanese diplomats, the ministry added.
Neither China nor Fiji's foreign ministry immediately responded to requests for comment.
Speaking in parliament, Taiwan Deputy Foreign Minister Henry Tseng said: ""We are still looking at whether this represents common behaviour or was an isolated incident. But we condemn these irrational acts by the Chinese diplomats.""
Larry Tseng, the head of the ministry's East Asia and Pacific affairs department, said the Chinese were trying to work out whether any Fijian politicians were present at the event.
There were injuries on both sides in the ""pushing and shoving"" that took place between the Chinese and Taiwanese diplomats, he added.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's next parliament is set to be the most inclusive ever, with several people of colour, members from the rainbow communities and a high number of women.
The ruling Labour Party was handed a resounding mandate in the election over the weekend, as voters rewarded Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern for her decisive response to COVID-19.
Although Ardern has the numbers to govern alone, she is in talks with former ally the Green Party to build a wider consensus.
Labour won 64 of the 120 parliamentary seats, and more than half of those are female candidates. It also has 16 indigenous Maori MPs, the first leader of African origin, Ibrahim Omar, and Vanushi Walters of Sri Lankan origin. 
""This is the most diverse parliament we have ever had in terms of gender, and minority ethnic and indigenous representation,"" said Professor Paul Spoonley from the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at Massey University.
Its also expected to be the most rainbow representative parliament system in the world, with about 10% of the members in the 120-seat house being openly lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. 
This includes prominent leaders like Finance Minister Grant Robertson who is openly gay.
The Greens surprisingly won as many as 10 seats in parliament and a majority of them are women, indigenous leaders or LGBTQ+.
The majority of the new MPs elected into parliament are also much younger and many of them are millennials, Spoonley said.
""What we have seen is a departure of many of the older, male, white MPs including some who have been in parliament for over 30 years,"" said Spoonley.
Ardern herself arrived onto the global scene in 2017 when she became the world's youngest female head of government at the age of 37.
The 40-year-old leader is feted globally as a progressive leader, who is a champion for woman's rights, equality and inclusivity.

People gathered early in the day in demonstrations downtown and in cities throughout Chile that gained size and fervor through the evening. Many touted signs and rainbow colored homemade banners calling for a ""yes"" vote next Sunday in a referendum over whether to scrap the country's dictatorship-era Constitution, a key demand of the 2019 protests.
The demonstrations, while largely peaceful early on, were marred by increasing incidents of violence, looting of supermarkets and clashes with police across the capital later in the day. Fire truck sirens, burning barricades on roadways and fireworks on downtown streets added to a sense of chaos in some neighborhoods. 
Interior Minister Victor Perez spoke late in the evening, praising the early, peaceful rallies while blasting the late-night mayhem. He called on Chileans to settle their differences by voting in the upcoming Oct. 25 constitutional referendum.
""Those who carry out these acts of violence do not want Chileans to solve our problems through democratic means,"" Perez told reporters, vowing to punish those who crossed the line Sunday.
Early in the day, an angry mob jeered and threatened a Communist Party mayor. Later, masked individuals firebombed a police headquarters and church. Vandals attacked another Santiago church in the early evening, setting its spire aflame and choking side streets with smoke.
More than 15 metro stations were temporarily closed amid the unrest. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in skirmishes with sometimes violent, hooded and masked people.
Last year's protests, which began Oct. 18, raged until mid-December as Chileans gathered nationwide to call for reforms to the pension, healthcare and education systems. Rioting and looting resulted in billions of dollars in damage and losses to the country's businesses and infrastructure. The unrest saw the military take to the streets for the first time since the rule of dictator Augusto Pinochet.
Police estimated that Sunday's rally in Santiago attracted around 25,000 people by 6 p.m., far smaller than the largest protests of 2019. 
In the past few days, small-scale demonstrations and isolated incidents of violence have nonetheless resurfaced in Chile, as the capital's 6 million citizens emerge from months of confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most demonstrators on Sunday wore masks, but many could be seen in tight groups, raising concerns about a potential health risk.

362,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2020 08:35PM ET</span>",White House official went to Syria seeking Americans' release,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House official traveled to Damascus earlier this year for secret meetings with the Syrian government seeking the release of at least two U.S. citizens thought to be held there, a Trump administration official said on Sunday.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, named the official as Kash Patel, a deputy assistant to President Donald Trump and the top White House counterterrorism official, saying he had flown to Damascus.
""It is emblematic of how President Trump has made it a major priority to bring Americans home who have been detained overseas,"" said the official, who was confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal.
The White House and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The newspaper, citing Trump administration officials and others familiar with the negotiations, described Patel's trip as the first time such a high-level U.S. official had met in Syria with the isolated government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in more than a decade.
Syria erupted into civil war nearly a decade ago after Assad in 2011 began a brutal crackdown on protesters calling for an end to his family's rule.
The newspaper said U.S. officials hoped a deal with Assad could free Austin Tice, a freelance journalist and former Marine officer who disappeared while reporting in Syria in 2012, and Majd Kamalmaz, a Syrian-American therapist who disappeared after being stopped at a Syrian government checkpoint in 2017.
At least four other Americans are believed to be held by the Syrian government, the newspaper reported, but little is known about those cases.
The Journal reported that Trump wrote Assad a private letter in March, proposing a ""direct dialogue"" about Tice.
It said that Lebanon's top security chief, Abbas Ibrahim, met last week at the White House with national security adviser Robert O'Brien to discuss the Americans held in Syria, according to people involved in the talks.

Talks with Syria have not gotten very far, according to people briefed on them, the newspaper reported, saying Damascus has repeatedly demanded Washington withdraw all its forces from the country.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador described Thursday's arrest of ex-Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos as evidence of rampant corruption in past governments. But it also dealt a heavy blow to a powerful institution he relies on.
Speaking in the southern state of Oaxaca on Saturday, Lopez Obrador said the DEA had dealt for years with Cienfuegos and Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's security minister from 2006 to 2012, who has also been charged in the United States with drug-trafficking offenses.
During that time, Lopez Obrador said, U.S. and Mexican officials deliberately allowed arms to be trafficked into Mexico in an attempt to trace them to cartel leaders, leading to many deaths. But only Mexicans were being held accountable, he said.
""Why is it that it's just the people in Mexico who took part in these acts being accused or implicated, and (the DEA) aren't criticizing themselves, reflecting on the meddling by all these agencies in Mexico?"" Lopez Obrador said. ""They came into the country with complete freedom, they did whatever they wanted.""
In view of the DEA's involvement, he said, it should give an account of what it had done in Mexico.
A spokeswoman for the DEA declined to comment. 
The arrest of Cienfuegos has raised uncomfortable questions about Lopez Obrador's faith in the armed forces, which he has given responsibility not just for fighting drug gangs but for overseeing vital civilian infrastructure.
Cienfuegos was in charge of the army from 2012 to 2018 under former President Enrique Pena Nieto.

Lopez Obrador has voiced support for Cienfuegos' successor in the army and his navy counterpart.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of opposition supporters rallied on Sunday in the city of Karachi as part of a campaign to oust Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who they accuse of being installed by the military in a rigged 2018 election.
Nine major opposition parties formed a joint platform called the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) last month to begin a nationwide agitation against the government.
""You've snatched jobs from people. You have snatched two-time a day food from the people,"" said opposition leader Maryam Nawaz about Khan while addressing the rally, which drew growing crowds in the second such gathering in three days. 
She is the daughter and political heir of the former three-time premier Nawaz Sharif. 
""Our farmers have hunger in their homes... our youth is disappointed,"" said another opposition leader, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. 
The protests come as the country's economy - which had already tanked before the global pandemic - struggles with double digit inflation and negative growth, which Khan’s opponents blame on his government.
Khan's two-year tenure has also seen mounting censorship and a crackdown on dissent, critics and opposition leaders. 
""Inflation has broken the back of poor citizens forcing many to beg to feed their children,"" said Faqeer Baloch, 63, at the Karachi rally. 
""It is high time that this government should go now,"" he said as the crowd chanted, ""Go Imran go!"" 
The next general election is scheduled for 2023.
The rally in Karachi followed a protest by the alliance in eastern Gujranwala city on Friday, which was the biggest demonstration against Khan since he took office.
Speaking via video link from London to the Gujranwala gathering, Sharif accused army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa of rigging the 2018 elections and orchestrating his ouster in 2017 in what he said were trumped up charges aided by judiciary.
Maryam said her party was not anti-military, but, ""If you say that we will respect those who would crush the ballots under their boots, that's not going to happen."" 
The military, which denies meddling in politics or electoral wrongdoing, has yet to respond specifically to Sharif's accusations. 
Khan, who came to power on an anti-graft platform and denies the army helped him win, has defended the military.

LAGOS/YENAGOA (Reuters) - The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) will help train Nigeria's new tactical force as thousands nationwide continued to march against police brutality and in demand of further reforms, Nigeria's police inspector general said in a statement on Sunday.
Protests began roughly two weeks ago demanding the dissolution of the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), which was accused by Nigerians and groups such as Amnesty International of extortion, brutality and torture.
The police force has repeatedly denied the accusations against SARS, though it said earlier this month that ""unruly and unprofessional"" officers had been arrested and were facing disciplinary actions 
The new unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team, was created to ""fill the gaps"" left when police disbanded SARS on Oct. 11. 
SWAT training will begin on Monday in partnership with the ICRC and ""other development partners"", Mohammed Adamu, inspector general of police, said in a statement. Former SARS officers are not eligible to join SWAT, the statement said. 
The ICRC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Police said the ICRC would join training on humanitarian laws, police conduct in conflict, and human rights in the use of force, arrest and detention.
Senate President Ahmad Lawan, after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari on Sunday, called on protesters to stand down in light of the steps leaders had taken. 
But protesters are demanding further protections against the police, including independent oversight and psychological evaluation of officers.
Hundreds joined a prayer march on Saturday in Port Harcourt, and peaceful marches and demonstrations continued in Lagos, Abuja, Warri, Enugu and Makurdi. Supporters launched an online radio station to bolster the movement. 
Most demonstrations are now peaceful, after authorities barred police from using force against protesters.

But at least two were killed around demonstrations on Saturday in Osogbo in southwestern Osun state, a spokesman for Governor Gboyega Oyetola told Reuters. The spokesman said an angry mob had attacked Oyetola's convoy, and that one person was killed before he arrived and the second after he had left.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Ersin Tatar, prime minister of the breakaway state of North Cyprus, won a presidential election runoff on Sunday with almost 52% of votes, in a result which could further strain ties with the Cypriot government.
Tatar is a supporter of separate administrations on the Mediterranean island which split after a 1974 Turkish invasion in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup. 
Incumbent president Mustafa Akinci, 72, whose relations with Ankara had been strained, had been a supporter of reunification.
As well as having an impact on inter-island talks, the election result may also affect negotiations over the contested maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean, which has Turkey at odds with Greece and Cyprus.
Turkey, which is the only country to recognise North Cyprus as an independent state, said recently that separate administrations were the only solution after United Nations-mediated peace negotiations between Cyprus and North Cyprus broke down in 2017.
In his victory speech, Tatar thanked Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, with whom he has strong relations.
""They will never tear the ties between us and Turkey,"" he said.
""In light of the approval we received, it is the preference of our people in all disputes to lay claim to our own state, to lay claim to our land and lay claim to the guarantorship of Turkey,"" Tatar added. 
""Yes, we are open to an agreement with Cyprus but the Turkish Cypriot people will accept the terms of this agreement with a free will.""
Footage showed voters wearing masks and gloves as part of measures against the novel coronavirus as they cast their ballots. With a population of some 326,000, northern Cyprus has reported 852 infections and five deaths as of Sunday, according to official media.
Erdogan congratulated Tatar in a tweet and said Turkey would make every effort to protect the rights of Turkish Cypriots.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a tweet: ""We will protect the legitimate rights and interests of (the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus) in the eastern Mediterranean all together."" 

Earlier this month, Tatar, speaking alongside Erdogan, said northern Cyprus was reopening part of the beachfront of a resort abandoned for 46 years, in a move seen as potentially damaging to efforts to revive dispute settlement talks. The president of Cyprus, Nicos Anastasiades, said the reopening was illegal.

MANAMA (Reuters) - Donald Trump's Middle East envoy said on Sunday the U.S. President's push for an Israeli-Arab rapprochement was gaining momentum and he hoped more accords would follow even if Trump loses next month's election. 
Avi Berkowitz, who accompanied an Israeli delegation which visited Bahrain on Sunday, said the so-called ""Abraham Accords"" had bipartisan support in the United States and were designed to bear long-term fruit by encouraging grassroots engagement between Israel and its new Arab partners.
""Peace is something everybody should celebrate and see as a positive thing for the world,"" Berkowitz said in an interview. ""It's our sincere hope that, no matter who wins the election, the Abraham Accords will continue to grow.""
Bahrain followed the United Arab Emirates in agreeing last month to normalise ties with Israel, angering Palestinians who had conditioned any such regional rapprochement on statehood, with East Jerusalem as capital of their independent state.
The U.S. administration has been racing against the clock to secure normalisation deals for Israel, in an effort to help Trump secure re-election in November.
For U.S. allies in the Middle East, it is a chance to close ranks on Iran more overtly.
The flight carrying the Israeli delegation flew over Saudi Arabia, an accommodation by the Gulf's powerhouse, which has so far resisted U.S. appeals to normalise ties with Israel.
""That is a decision for them to ultimately come to, our conversations with them have been positive on numerous fronts,"" Berkowitz said when asked about any Saudi plans to follow suit. 
""We look to them for an understanding in the region of the temperature of how things are going on numerous fronts, we've had very good discussions with them but time will tell,"" he added. 

Berkowitz, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and other officials will travel on Monday to the UAE, where the accord with Israel has opened up bilateral commerce.

Germany is experiencing an accelerating second wave of infections, and the Handelsblatt daily earlier quoted a party leader as saying it would be irresponsible to hold a gathering for 1,000 delegates on Dec. 4 as planned.
But a spokeswoman for the centre-right party said the in-person event in Stuttgart was still on: ""That's what the CDU leadership has decided.""
Stuttgart is the capital of the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, which at the weekend invoked its highest pandemic threat level.
Merkel on Saturday urged the public to stay at home and avoid travel where possible to minimise the spread of COVID-19. The number of coronavirus infections hit a daily record of 7,830 on Saturday.
One party leader told Handelsblatt that an in-person gathering could not be justified when the government was telling people to stay at home. Other senior party figures have, however, called publicly for it to go ahead as planned.
The 66-year-old chancellor, who has already stepped down as party leader, will not run for a record fifth consecutive term at a general election due in September 2021, meaning the CDU will be seeking re-election with a new figurehead.
An attempt to stage-manage the succession fell apart this year when Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who won a leadership vote two years ago only to struggle in the role, said she would step down.
Three candidates - Armin Laschet, Friedrich Merz and Norbert Roettgen - are now vying to lead Germany's most popular party. 

Parliament this month passed legislation allowing virtual party conferences to pass resolutions and elect leaders, either by postal vote or by locally-held secret ballot.

JERICHO, West Bank (Reuters) - Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Israel on Sunday for treatment of a worsening case of COVID-19, the Palestine Liberation Organization said.
Witnesses said Erekat, 65, was on a stretcher when he was placed inside an Israeli ambulance outside his home in Jericho, in the occupied West Bank. Erekat, who is also secretary-general of the PLO, disclosed on Oct. 8 that he had contracted coronavirus.
He was rushed to Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center. A hospital spokeswoman said Erekat was in a serious but stable condition. He needed high-flow oxygen support and was being treated in an intensive care ward for coronavirus patients.
There is heightened concern over Erekat's vulnerability to the illness because he underwent a lung transplant in the United States in 2017.
""Following his contraction of COVID-19, and due to the chronic health problems he faces in the respiratory system, Dr. Erekat's condition now requires medical attention in a hospital,"" the PLO's Negotiations Affairs Department said in a statement.
A member of Fatah, the most powerful faction within the PLO, Erekat has been one of the most high-profile faces of the Palestinian leadership for decades, especially to international audiences. 
Erekat is one of the most senior advisers to Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, and also served in top positions under Abbas' predecessor, Yasser Arafat.
His negotiating days date back to the earliest public negotiations with Israel in 1991 at the Madrid Conference during the presidency of George H.W. Bush, when Erekat was part of the PLO team.

A proponent of a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Erekat has been a leading Palestinian voice in opposing Israel's settlement policy in territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

The Taliban launched a major offensive in the southern province of Helmand in a bid to take the provincial capital, prompting U.S. air strikes in support of Afghan security forces, which were being overrun.
""American forces have violated the Doha agreement in various forms by carrying out excessive air strikes following the new developments in Helmand province,"" Taliban spokesman Qari Muhammad Yousuf Ahmadi said in a statement on Sunday.
The U.S.-Taliban agreement, signed in Doha, provides for foreign forces to leave Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees and a pledge from the insurgents to sit down with the Kabul administration to find a peaceful settlement to decades of war.
""Responsibility and consequences from continuation of such actions shall fall squarely on the shoulders of the American side,"" Ahmadi warned, adding that air and drone strikes had also been carried out in other provinces.
Col. Sonny Leggett, spokesman for the U.S. forces, denied that the strikes violated the agreement.
""The entire world has witnessed the Taliban's offensive operations in Helmand - attacks which injured and displaced thousands of innocent Afghan civilians,"" Leggett tweeted, reiterating a call for ""all sides"" to reduce violence.
Talks between Taliban and Afghan government negotiators began last month in Doha, but the process has only moved slowly, while violence has continued. Diplomats and officials have said this is sapping the trust required for the talks to succeed.
After the Helmand fighting, U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said on Thursday that the Taliban had agreed to ""reset"" their commitments and reduce the number of casualties.

Earlier this month, the Taliban welcomed U.S. President Donald Trump's tweet that all American troops should be ""home by Christmas"" - well before the May 2021 timeline agreed in Doha.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Deni Blanco used to sell food outside voting locations in La Paz each election cycle, an easy way to make some extra money. This year, as Bolivia holds elections in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, she is selling something else: pens. 
""My sister saw it on TV, that this time every voter should bring their own pen to vote, and she said, 'Why don't we sell them?'"" Blanco said, outside an outdoor voting location in Ciudadela Ferroviaria, a low-income area of La Paz. 
Blanco was selling pens for 1 boliviano ($0.15) each, and after two hours of voting said she had sold around 50. 
Bolivia is holding mandatory in-person presidential elections on Sunday, even though it has been hard-hit by the pandemic. Nearly 8,500 Bolivians have died of the disease, giving it one of the highest fatality rates per capita in the world.
For an interactive graphic tracking the global spread of COVID-19, open (https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/) in an external browser.
Bolivia's ballot, much-delayed due to the pandemic, will be a test for electoral authorities in the region. Neighboring Peru is set to elect a new president next April. 
Americans are also set to elect a president next month, but while in the United States citizens can vote over several days or by mail, that has never been an option in Bolivia. 
Paceños, as residents of La Paz are known, said they generally felt safe about the protocols, but social distancing was not always easy to maintain. Voters must wear masks, while poll workers wear goggles in addition to masks. 
""People don't respect the social distancing,"" said Eric Echevarria, who voted for the first time. 
Among the changes is that citizens used to be able to vote anytime between 8 a.m and 5 p.m. Now voter rolls are split into morning and afternoon voting pools.
Bolivians also used to dip their fingers in purple ink to make a fingerprint after casting their vote. Now the ink must be touched with cotton to avoid contagion, though not everyone follows that rule. 

""There are people like me who can dip the finger, after all I'm not sick,"" said Deisy Mamani, a voter in La Paz's Zona Sur.

From Paris to Lyon, Marseille and Lille large crowds gathered quietly, pausing regularly to applaud, hold minutes of silence or sing the national anthem.
Prime Minister Jean Castex attended the gathering on Place de La Republique in Paris along with Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer and politicians from across the spectrum, showing solidarity after a killing that has shocked the country. 
""You don't scare us. We are not afraid. You will not divide us. We are France!"" Castex tweeted later.
Paty, 47, was killed outside his school in a Paris suburb by an 18-year-old attacker. Earlier this month, the teacher had shown his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering a number of Muslim parents. Muslims believe that any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.
The assailant, who was born in Russia of Chechen origin, was shot dead by police soon after the attack. Police have detained 11 people in connection with the killing.
People at the events on Sunday wore masks against COVID-19 and carried signs such as ""Teaching yes, bleeding no"" or ""I am Charlie"" in a reference to satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, whose offices were attacked in a mass killing five years ago.
""We're here to defend the Republic, the values of the Republic: liberty, equality, fraternity and secularism. We can feel that the nation is threatened,"" Pierre Fourniou, 83, said in Paris.
Paty had been the target of an angry campaign on social media before he was killed. Castex said in an interview in Journal du Dimanche newspaper that the government is working on a strategy to better protect teachers from threats. 
President Emmanuel Macron was due to hold a security meeting with key ministers later on Sunday, his office said.

A national tribute will be organised for Wednesday.

The ICC issued arrest warrants against Bashir in 2009 and 2010 on charges of war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity during his campaign to crush a revolt in Darfur in which an estimated 300,000 people died.
The delegation, led by Chief Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, arrived in Sudan late on Saturday to discuss the cases of Bashir and two other former officials wanted by ICC.
Bensouda also met the powerful deputy leader of Sudan's ruling council, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who said the government was willing to cooperate with the court, state news agency SUNA reported. 
Though Sudanese transitional authorities have said they will work with the ICC for those accused of war crimes to appear before the tribunal, it is unclear where and how hearings would take place. 
Bashir and the two other former officials, Ahmed Haroun and Abdel Raheem Muhammad Hussein, were jailed after the uprising that led to Bashir's overthrow in April last year.
""Sudan's commitment to achieving justice is not only part of international obligations, but also comes in response to popular demands to establish justice,"" a cabinet statement cited Hamdok as saying as he met the ICC delegation. 
Bashir has already been sentenced to two years in prison on corruption charges and is currently on trial over the military coup in which he took power in 1989.
His lawyer has denounced the various charges against the former president as politically motivated.

In the past week, bars and restaurants have been ordered to close except for takeout orders, and schools have moved to distance learning. Sport and fitness clubs, theatres and cinemas had already shut, but shops have remained open.
On Saturday, the Czech Republic reported 8,713 new cases. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said it had registered 828 cases per 100,000 population in the last two weeks, more than 10 times the rate in neighbouring Germany.
Since schools reopened in September, the cumulative number of cases has risen almost seven times.
Officials have warned that hospital admissions are set to rise sharply until the restrictions show an impact.
""We will not decide this week about a lockdown,"" Havlicek said on Czech Television. ""We have clearly said we will wait (until Nov. 2) for results.""
Interior Minister Jan Hamacek said on CNN Prima's Sunday show the new measures should cut the R number, which measures average spread from one infected person, by 30-40%. A number above 1.0 indicates an exponential increase, and the current rate is estimated at around 1.4.
If the latest restrictions are not effective enough, he said there were few options other a lockdown.
The growth in cases, with almost 100,000 this month in a country of 10.7 million, and 1,352 deaths overall from COVID-19, is forcing authorities to make plans for field hospitals and seek foreign help.
The Czech Fire Rescue Service said it had sent a formal request through European Union channels for ventilators.
In Prague, more than 500 sports fans, including militant soccer supporters' groups known as ultras, protested against the coronavirus measures, defying restrictions on gatherings. 

Police used water cannon and tear gas and local media saisd there had been some injuries.

""The current tiered restrictions will not bring the transmission rates down sufficiently or prevent the continued spread of the virus,"" he said.
""A three-week period of nationally increased restrictions, with the right levels of financial support, will allow us to reset before winter, stop transmission spiralling, protect and prepare health services, give time to get the test-trace-isolate systems fully functional, and save lives,"" he said.
Farrar, who is director of the Wellcome Trust and a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the response needed to be immediate because putting it off would only worsen and lengthen the crisis.
He told Sky News that the best time to have locked down was two to three weeks ago, but it wasn't too late now.
Senior minister Michael Gove, however, said a two- or three- week national lockdown - named a ""circuit breaker"" by some - was not being considered.
""The spread and the nature of the disease does not merit that approach at the moment,"" he told Sky News on Sunday.
Gove did concede that there were problems with the level of compliance with the rules already in place for those who tested positive for COVID-19.

He said the level of government support available for those who were required to self-isolate was kept under constant review.

Belarus, a former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, has been rocked by strikes and weekly street protests since authorities announced that Lukashenko, who has ruled in authoritarian fashion since 1994, had secured re-election on Aug. 9 with 80% of votes.
The Interfax news agency put the number of protesters at over 30,000. It said about 50 had been detained by the police, and that the mobile broadband signal had been disrupted in parts of the city.
It also said loud noises that sounded like stun grenades had been heard close to the march. A senior police official said last week that officers would reserve the right to use firearms against demonstrators.
Security forces have detained more than 13,000 people since the election, including all significant opposition leaders who have not left the country, and clamped down on independent media.

Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who has fled to Lithuania, last week urged Lukashenko to quit by Oct. 25 or face what she said would be nationwide strikes that would paralyse Belarus.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Voters in Guinea went to the polls on Sunday as octogenarian President Alpha Conde sought to extend his decade in power after pushing through a new constitution that allowed him to run for a third term, sparking months of violent protests.
At least 50 people have been killed over the past year during demonstrations against the new constitution, Amnesty International said, and violence erupted repeatedly during campaigning in recent weeks.
In the capital, Conakry, dozens of voters queued quietly at a polling station in a primary school whose exterior wall was plastered with posters of Conde.
""I hope that things will happen in peace,"" said Mariama Camara, a housewife.
""I voted for change,"" said Mamadou Diallo, a trader.
While no reliable opinion polls are available, many political analysts expect Conde to prevail after he won overwhelming approval for the new constitution in a referendum in March - although that vote was boycotted by the opposition.
Conde, 82, faces 11 challengers, including his long-time rival Cellou Dalein Diallo. Diallo, a former prime minister who finished runner-up to Conde in elections in 2010 and 2015, has warned about fraud and said he will challenge any irregularities.
Conde, who has described the constitutional reform as fair and democratic, says he needs more time to finish major mining and infrastructure projects in the West African country.
""Guinea cannot develop if there is not peace, security and unity. We do not want violence,"" Conde said after casting his ballot at the Boulbinet primary school in Conakry.
""Those who want to challenge the results must do so within a legal framework, with recourse to the constitutional court,"" he said, dressed in white and flanked by bodyguards.
Guinea has made progress developing its mineral riches, including bauxite and iron ore, and gross domestic product has doubled under Conde's presidency. But many Guineans complain the mining boom has not ended frequent power cuts and unemployment.
The national election commission said on Saturday provisional results would be published within three days after it receives the last polling station tally. The constitutional court will then have eight days to declare a winner.
The United Nations has warned about divisive appeals to ethnic affiliations on the campaign trail. Conde and Diallo both draw much of their support from their respective ethnic communities.
Guinea has been plagued by sporadic political unrest since independence from France in 1958, often fuelled by ethnic tensions.
Pro-democracy activists are concerned that the election - and a presidential vote due later this month in neighboring Ivory Coast - may damage democracy in a region that had previously won praise for its leaders' adherence to term limits.

Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara, who first won power in 2010, is also seeking re-election, having argued that a new constitution in 2016 reset the clock on the two-term limit.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of anti-government protesters took over key intersections in Bangkok on Sunday, defying a ban on protests for the fourth day with chants of ""down with dictatorship"" and ""reform the monarchy.""
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader the protesters seek to oust, is concerned about the spreading protests and the government wants to talk, his spokesman said.
Demonstrations have persisted despite the arrest of dozens of protesters and their leaders, the use of water cannon and shutdowns on much of Bangkok's metro rail system in a bid to quell over three months of street action.
""Free our friends"", the protesters called out as they stood in a rain, a mass of colourful ponchos and umbrellas. Some held up pictures of detained protest leaders. Thai Lawyers for Human Rights said at least 80 protesters had been arrested since Oct. 13 with 27 still being held. Police have not given an overall number.
Prayuth's spokesman said the prime minister feared the protests, which have spread across the country of 70 million, could be used by troublemakers seeking to instigate violence.
""The government wants to talk to find a way out together,"" spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters. He did not specify with whom the government hoped to speak.
After the arrest of many of the protest leaders, previously unknown figures have emerged to lead crowds which organise by themselves.
Police made no immediate steps to intervene as protesters took over Victory Monument and Asok, two of Bangkok's most important transport hubs. Police said there were around 10,000 people at Victory Monument alone. A spokesman said there was no plan to suppress the protest there.
Protesters say Prayuth engineered last year's election to keep power he seized in a 2014 coup - an accusation he denies. 
MONARCHY IN FOCUS
The demonstrations have also become more openly critical of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy, breaking a longstanding taboo, demanding curbs to its powers despite potential jail terms of up 15 years for anyone insulting the king.
During demonstrations by tens of thousands of people at multiple points across Bangkok on Saturday, protesters painted a flag on the road with ""Republic of Thailand"" written across it. The writing was painted out overnight. 
The Royal Palace has made no comment on the protests.
The government banned demonstrations in Bangkok on Thursday.
Across Thailand, demonstrations were being organised in at least 19 other provinces on Sunday. Solidarity protests were also being held or planned in Taiwan, Denmark, Sweden, France, the United States and Canada.
Protesters, who have adopted the fast moving tactics of Hong Kong activists, kept police guessing about where demonstrations would be held with a slew of social media posts.
Links have grown between protesters in Thailand and Hong Kong in a so-called Milk Tea Alliance referring to drinks popular in both places. Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong tweeted in support of Thai protesters.

""Their determination for #Thailanddemocracy cannot be deterred,"" he said.

""I want to say a word of encouragement and support for the fishermen who have been held in Libya for more than a month, and for their families (who) are hoping to be able to embrace their dear ones soon,"" Francis said at his weekly blessing in St. Peter's Square.
Libyan patrol boats detained two Sicilian fishing boats on Sept. 1 and brought the crews to Benghazi, where the military commander Haftar holds sway. The crews, made up of Italians and Tunisians, were accused of operating in Libya's territorial waters.
The fishing grounds have been disputed since 2005, when Libya's then ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, unilaterally extended Libyan territorial waters to 74 nautical miles offshore from 12. Haftar, who controls eastern Libya, is trying to enforce this.
Italian newspapers have reported that Haftar wants Italy to hand over four Libyan nationals convicted of human trafficking in return for freeing the fishermen. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio told parliament on Thursday that such an exchange would be ""unacceptable"".
Francis also called for talks to bring peace to Libya, which is divided between Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA). The GNA is internationally recognised.

""Brothers and sisters, the time has come to stop every form of hostility and favour dialogue that brings peace, stability and unity to the country,"" he said.

385,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 18, 2020 08:31AM ET</span>",Bolivians hope presidential election will restore political stability,"By Marcelo Rochabrun
LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivians began voting on Sunday in a presidential election many hope can restore stability to a nation that was plunged into turmoil after a fraught and eventually voided vote last year, leaving the country in the hands of an interim president.
Frontrunners in the election are Luis Arce, who champions a return to the socialist and pro-indigenous policies of former President Evo Morales, and Carlos Mesa, a centrist who served as president in the early 2000s. 
Polls show Arce ahead, but not enough to avoid a runoff that would take place in late November. 
""The vote is set to be the most important since Bolivia returned to democracy in 1982,"" said Carlos Valverde, a political analyst. 
A last-minute decision by Bolivia's electoral authority not to release preliminary results on Sunday night has added a layer of tension to the election. Morales said the decision was ""highly worrying,"" while Mesa's party said it was disappointing but understandable. 
It was not clear when the first official results will now be available, although private firms are still expected to conduct exit polling. 
The in-person vote amid the coronavirus pandemic will also be a test of the left's clout in Latin America. Morales was a key figure in a wave of leftist presidents in the region over the last decade. 
Bolivia erupted in violence late last year when Morales sought a fourth term in a disputed election that has since been annulled. The violence cost at least 30 lives, sparked food shortages and forced Morales to resign after almost 14 years in power.
On Saturday, La Paz, a city starkly divided by class and race, appeared calm but residents acknowledged they are worried that the result could spark more violence, especially if Arce's vote count falls short. 
Arce told local media this week that the only way his rival could win is ""through fraud."" 
Freddy Mamami, a member of Arce's Movement Toward Socialism party who is running for Congress, told Reuters: ""If the electoral verdict is in line with the objective reality we see, nothing will happen."" 
The socialist stronghold of El Alto, a center of last year's violence, is seen as particularly volatile. The city was built by indigenous Bolivians atop a mountain overlooking La Paz and has grown to dwarf the capital city in population. 

The election was originally scheduled to take place in May, but was postponed several times due to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.

Costes owner Karoly Gerendai said that turnover at one of his reopened restaurants is down to about a tenth of pre-lockdown levels, forcing him to look for new ways to do business.
""Now that there are not many people either on the wheel or in the restaurant because there are no tourists, the opportunity arose that we could do this,"" he said of the event at the landmark attraction in central Budapest.
""It is now especially important for people to be able to be separate from other guests to be safe, and the ferris wheel is ideal with its separate cabins.""
As of Sunday, Hungary had reported 46,290 COVID-19 cases with 1,142 deaths and the economy is heading towards a 5-7% contraction this year.
Tickets for the novel Costes dining experience cost up to 48,000 forints ($154.40) each for a four-course meal and sold out within days, Gerendai said, as affluent local clients sought a rare escape from the constraints of coronavirus restrictions.
Gerendai is planning to repeat the event when warmer weather arrives in the spring, though the cooler October night was no deterrent for customers on Saturday. 
""We wanted to get out a bit and enjoy an experience again because we have been living quite closed in,"" said Szabolcs Balazs, who took the meal with his wife and two children.

""We used to go to restaurants quite often; we have been to two Michelin-starred ones, but because of COVID we stopped going. So this is the only chance for us now because here we are really separated.""

Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, leader of the Maronite church, was speaking a day after demonstrators marched through Beirut to mark the first anniversary of a protest movement which erupted last October against corruption and mismanagement.
In the year since, Lebanon's problems have been compounded by the coronavirus pandemic and a devastating explosion in Beirut in August. 
""Take your hands off the government and liberate it. You are responsible for the crime of plunging the country into total paralysis in addition to the implications of the corona pandemic,"" the patriarch said in his sermon.
His remarks came after two main Christian parties, the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) and Lebanese Forces, said this week they would not back the nomination of former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to lead a new government to tackle the deep economic crisis, further complicating efforts to agree a new premier. 
""The responsibility and accountability is collective. Who among you officials has the leisure of time to delay consultations to form a government?"" he said. 
""No one is innocent of Lebanon's (financial) bleeding.""
The head of the Shi'ite Amal party and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri said he was optimistic next week would bring reassuring news for Lebanese in terms of government formation. 
""We will see movement starting Monday,"" he was quoted by NBN television as saying, without elaborating. 
In his Sunday sermon, Greek Orthodox Archbishop Elias Audi also lambasted the political elite.
""Return to your conscience, leaders ... be humble and listen to the pain of your people,"" the archbishop said.
Hariri, who quit as prime minister last October in the face of the nationwide protests, has said he is ready to lead a government to implement reforms proposed by France as a way to unlock badly needed international aid. 

Parliamentary consultations to name a new prime minister were due to be held last Thursday, but President Michel Aoun postponed the discussions after receiving requests for a delay from some parliamentary blocs.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Sunday of violating a new humanitarian ceasefire in fighting over the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, hours after it was agreed. 
The truce agreed on Saturday came into force at midnight (2000 GMT) after a week-old Russian-brokered ceasefire failed to halt the worst fighting in the South Caucasus since the 1990s. At least 750 people have been killed since fighting began on Sept. 27.
At 1010 GMT, the Azeri defence ministry said the Aghdam region, adjacent Nagorno-Karabakh, was under Armenian shelling. It said overnight Armenian military units opened fire from large-caliber weapons along the border, which Armenia denied.
Armenia said the Azeri army had fired twice during the night and used artillery and accused Baku of rejecting its request to withdraw the wounded soldiers from the battlefield.
""This step ... was categorically rejected by Baku,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement. Baku called the statement misinformation.
The Azeri defence ministry said: ""The enemy fired at the vicinity of the Jabrail city, as well as the villages of this region ... using mortars and artillery"". It added that the Azeri army ""took adequate retaliatory measures"".
The ministry said that Azeri military units downed Armenian Su-25 warplane, ""which was attempting to inflict airstrikes on the positions of the Azeri army in Jabrail region."" Yerevan swiftly denied that.
Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces had launched an attack on the enclave's military positions and there were casualties and wounded on both sides.
Nagorno-Karabakh is a mountain territory that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.
The ceasefire earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed in the clashes, but it had little impact on the fighting around the enclave.
The new truce was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to his Armenian and Azeri counterparts by phone and called on sides to observe the truce that he mediated a week ago.
Russia, France and the United States belong to the Minsk Group, which has attempted to help resolve the conflict under the umbrella of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
Baku said on Saturday that 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on Sept. 27. It has not disclosed its military casualties.

Nagorno-Karabakh says 673 of its military personnel have been killed, and 36 civilians.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli delegation accompanied by the U.S. treasury secretary flew to Bahrain on Sunday to formalise nascent relations and broaden Gulf cooperation that Washington has promoted as an anti-Iran bulwark and potential economic bonanza.
Bahrain followed the United Arab Emirates in agreeing last month to normalise ties with Israel, stunning Palestinians who had demanded statehood before any such regional rapprochement.
The breakthrough, overseen by U.S. President Donald Trump, is a foreign policy flourish ahead of his reelection bid next month. For the U.S. allies, it is a chance to close ranks on Iran more overtly. 
The Israeli delegation, which boarded an El Al Israel Airlines charter flight to Manama, was accompanied by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. His office said the mission seeks ""expanded economic cooperation"" among Israel, Bahrain and the UAE.
At a ceremony with Mnuchin at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, U.S. Middle East envoy Avi Berkowitz said that Israel and Bahrain would sign a joint communique ""bringing forward tourism and banking and diplomatic relations"".
Also speaking at the airport ceremony, the head of the Israeli delegation, National Security Adviser Meir Ben-Shabbat, said talks would also focus on sectors such as finance and aviation.
RELATIONSHIP UPGRADE
Israel and Bahrain signed a ""Declaration of Peace, Cooperation, and Constructive Diplomatic and Friendly Relations"" at a White House ceremony on Sept. 15, a document that fell short of a formal treaty.
An official involved in the visit said the communique would upgrade the relationship between the two countries.
The signing of the declaration with Israel last month drew anger among Bahrainis at home and abroad. Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim minority rules a Shi'ite majority population, has said the deal protects its interests from Iran.
The route of El Al Flight 973, a nod to Bahrain's telephone code, was to take it over Saudi Arabia, an accommodation by the Gulf powerhouse that has so far resisted U.S. appeals to normalise ties with Israel.
Mnuchin and the other U.S. officials travel on Monday to the UAE, where accord with Israel has uncorked bilateral commerce. On Tuesday the U.S. dignitaries will join the UAE's first delegation to Israel. 
Though less oil-rich than the UAE, Bahrain - host to the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet - has geo-strategic significance.
A Sept. 13 report by Israel's Intelligence Ministry saw potential for defence cooperation with Bahrain, describing it as threatened by ""Shiite political sedition, directed by Iran and its proxies"".

Israel could also help Bahrain with renewable energy, food security and banking and finance technologies, it said.

Career politician and current president Mustafa Akinci, 72, supports reuniting the island, which split after a 1974 Turkish invasion in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup.
Only Ankara recognises Northern Cyprus as an independent state. Other countries consider it part of Cyprus. The latest United Nations-mediated peace negotiations failed in 2017 and there has been no progress in talks since.
Ersin Tatar, 60, the current prime minister who has also served as finance minister, has closer ties with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. Tatar supports separate sovereign administrations on the island, a plan that Turkey has recently said is the only solution. 
Tatar won the first round of the election last week with 32.34%, ahead of Akinci who got 29.80%.
As well as having an impact on inter-island talks, the result of north Cyprus' election may influence negotiations over the contested maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean, which has Turkey at odds with Greece and Cyprus. 
Voting was scheduled to end at 1500 GMT, official media said. Footage showed voters wearing masks and gloves as part of measures against the novel coronavirus. With a population of some 326,000, northern Cyprus has reported 836 infections and five deaths as of Saturday.
Earlier this month, Tatar, speaking alongside Turkey's Erdogan said northern Cyprus was reopening part of the beachfront of a resort abandoned for 46 years in a move that could hurt efforts to revive dispute settlement talks.

The National People's Congress Standing Committee voted to adopt the law on Saturday, according to Xinhua, and it would come into effect on April 15, 2021. 
The law would establish systems for biosecurity risk prevention and control, including risk monitoring and early warning, risk investigation and assessment, and information sharing. 
It would also have provisions to prevent and respond to specific biosecurity risks, including major emerging infectious diseases, epidemic and sudden outbreaks, and biotechnology research, development and application, reported Xinhua.
China had announced in May that it aimed to fast-track the passing of the biosecurity law by year-end, following the global coronavirus outbreak which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan. 
China has managed to nearly stamp out domestic transmissions of the coronavirus following aggressive measures to curb its spread. New infections detected last week in the eastern coastal city of Qingdao however ended China's run of about two months without reporting a local case.

HANOI (Reuters) - A landslide early on Sunday left at least 22 military personnel missing in Vietnam's central province of Quang Tri, the government said, in what could be the largest military loss in peace time as the country battles the worst flooding in years.
Intense rainfall since early October has caused floods and mudslides that have killed more than 70 people in central Vietnam, with more heavy rain expected over the next few days.
The landslide hit the barracks of a unit of Vietnam's 4th Military Region, the government said in a statement on its website, days after another landslide killed 13 people, mostly soldiers, in the neighbouring province of Thua Thien Hue.
""We had another sleepless night,"" an emotional deputy defence minister, Phan Van Giang, told reporters on Sunday. 
The government later said the bodies of three of the missing personnel have been recovered. 
""We've never lost so many military members, including two generals and high ranking officials, in natural disasters,"" the government of the Southeast Asian nation said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
State media on Sunday reported rivers in Quang Tri province rose to the highest water levels in over 20 years. 
In Thua Thien Hue province, rescuers battled driving rain in search of at least 15 construction workers missing after a landslide at the start of the week in a mountainous area.
Rain of as much as 600 millimetres is likely to continue in parts of central Vietnam until Wednesday, the country's weather agency said on Sunday.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - After a thumping election win, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that she would form a government within three weeks but declined to say whether she would rule alone or form a coalition.
Ardern on Saturday delivered the biggest election victory for her centre-left Labour Party in half a century. Her new majority in parliament will allow her to form the first single-party government since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996. 
""Whilst there will be another three weeks before we have that final result, my expectation is that we will work on the government formation within that frame,"" Ardern told a news conference. 
Labour won 64 of the 120 seats in the country's unicameral parliament. 
For the last three years, Ardern was in a coalition with the Green Party and the nationalist New Zealand First party. Although she no longer needs support, coalitions are the norm in New Zealand as parties look to build consensus.
""I have been a consensus builder but I also need to work with the mandate that Labour has been given as well,"" Ardern said.
""I have said to the Greens that I would talk to them next week,"" she said. ""I don't want to draw any conclusion at this point.""
The Greens returned with a bigger mandate of 7.6% of the vote, but NZ First, led by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, did not gather enough support to return to parliament. 
The Maori Party, representing the indigenous community which is about 15% of the population, made a comeback to parliament.
The resounding victory is a yes vote for Ardern's progressive, democratic governance and for her leadership in crushing COVID-19 in the country, as well as her handling of a massacre of 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques and a fatal volcano eruption.
Ardern, 40, burnished her reputation this year with her ""go hard, go early"" approach to COVID-19, which had all but eliminated the coronavirus in the country, until a new case was reported on Sunday.
New Zealand has had just 25 deaths and around 1,500 infections. In the new case, health officials said the infected person was identified early and risk of transmission was contained. 
Ardern retains a solid international following with her promotion of issues including woman's rights, social justice, and multilateralism.

Still, there has been criticism of her economic policies, and a looming summer season with no international tourists will be a major test.

The 2007 Security Council arms embargo on Iran was due to expire on Sunday, as agreed to under the 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States that sought to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for economic sanctions relief. 
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have soared since U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from the deal, however.
In August, the Trump administration triggered a process aimed at restoring all U.N. sanctions, after the U.N. Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend the conventional arms embargo on the country.
""Today's normalization of Iran’s defense cooperation with the world is a win for the cause of multilateralism and peace and security in our region,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter.
Days after triggering the process, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Russia and China not to disregard the reimposition of all U.N. sanctions on Iran which Washington has demanded.
When asked whether the United States would target Russia and China with sanctions if they refuse to reimpose the U.N. measures on Iran, Pompeo said: ""Absolutely.""
""We have already done that, where we have seen any country violate ... the current American sanctions, we've held every nation accountable for that. We'll do the same thing with respect to the broader U.N. Security Council sanctions as well,"" he said.
Iran has developed a large domestic arms industry in the face of international sanctions and embargoes that have barred it from importing many weapons.

Western military analysts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities, although concerns about its long-range ballistic missile program contributed to Washington leaving the Iran nuclear deal.

The newspaper, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, said Chinese officials had issued repeated warnings through multiple channels to U.S. government officials.
The paper said China's message was the United States should end prosecutions of Chinese scholars in U.S. courts, or Americans in China could find themselves in violation of Chinese law.
A State Department advisory on Sept. 14 warning against travel to China said the Chinese government uses arbitrary detention and exit bans for U.S. citizens and others ""to gain bargaining leverage over foreign governments.""
The White House referred questions to the State Department, which said in an emailed statement that it stresses ""to the Chinese government – including at the highest levels – our concern about China's coercive use of exit bans on U.S. citizens and citizens of other countries, and will continue to do so until we see a transparent and fair process.""
The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday.
The Trump administration has increasingly accused China of suing cyber operations and espionage to steal U.S. technological, military and other know-how in a strategy to supplant the United States as the world's leading financial and military power. Beijing denies the allegations.
In July, the Justice Department said the FBI had arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly concealing memberships in the Peoples Liberation Army when applying for visas to conduct research at U.S. academic institutions.
Last month, the United States said it had revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese nationals under a presidential measure denying entry to students and researchers deemed security risks, a move China called a violation of human rights. 

At the time, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States continued to welcome ""legitimate students and scholars from China who do not further the Chinese Communist Party's goals of military dominance.""

(Reuters) - British police forces have been granted access to details of people who have been told to self-isolate under the government's 'test and trace' system, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said late on Saturday. 
A spokesman for the department said it agreed with the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) that officers could have access on a case-by-case basis to information on whether a specific individual has been notified to self-isolate. 
""The memorandum of understanding ensures that information is shared with appropriate safeguards and in accordance with the law. No testing or health data is shared in this process,"" the spokesman said in an emailed statement.
The development was reported earlier by Sky News, which also cited an NPCC statement saying police will continue encouraging voluntary compliance but will enforce regulations and issue fixed penalty notices (FPN) when needed.
""Where people fail to self-isolate and refuse to comply, officers can issue FPNs and direct people to return to self-isolation. Officers will engage with individuals to establish their circumstances, using their discretion wherever it is reasonable to do so,"" the NPCC statement said.
The test and trace system, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised would be world beating, has seen setbacks including a glitch identified earlier this month that delayed the upload of nearly 16,000 cases into computer systems, including for contact tracers.
In recent weeks, the COVID-19 infection rate has risen sharply in Britain with an accelerating second wave, prompting Johnson and other regional leaders to introduce tighter restrictions and local lockdowns.

Britain has one of the highest death rates from the virus in Europe and previously suffered the worst economic contraction of any leading nation from the outbreak.

""I am deeply concerned about the suspicious fire and confident that investigators will find the answers they need to hold those responsible to account"", Blair said in a statement.
""I have now approved a request from Nova Scotia's Attorney General to enhance the presence of contracted RCMP resources as needed in that jurisdiction in order to keep the peace"", he added.
Earlier in the day, the fire led to a man being admitted in hospital with life-threatening injuries, the RCMP said.
The development capped a week of rising tensions over Indigenous fishing treaty rights. 
The blaze broke out at one of two facilities where Indigenous fishermen had stored their catch, which were raided and vandalized by commercial fishermen in southwest Nova Scotia this week.
The two clashes earlier in the week involved hundreds of people outside lobster pounds that handle Indigenous-caught lobster.
""The current tensions cannot continue. The temperature of this dispute must be lowered, now. The threats, violence, and intimidation have to stop"", the Canadian public safety minister said.

""We all need to acknowledge that a lasting resolution to this dispute can only be concluded if it is rooted in the recognition of legitimate Mi'kmaq treaty rights"", he said.

The newspaper said it had obtained pictures showing Blair, who served as prime minister from 1997 to 2007, leaving a London restaurant 10 days after his return from Washington last month.
The Sunday Telegraph said it understood that Blair appealed to Whitehall officials for special dispensation from the COVID-19 rules, but that he was not issued with the formal exemption letter he would have needed to avoid a 14-day isolation period.
Blair was in Washington for a White House ceremony at which Israel signed agreements establishing formal relations with Bahrain and the UAE. 
The newspaper quoted a spokesman for Blair as saying he was invited by the U.S. government because of the role he played in the deal, describing the ceremony as a ""diplomatic conference"".
The spokesman also insisted Blair ""posed no risk to anyone"" as he was tested before his departure, on arrival at the White House, and again several times since returning to the UK.
Several major figures have been accused of damaging public confidence in the UK government's coronavirus response by breaking or appearing to break rules. 

In May, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, refused to quit after it emerged he had driven 250 miles (400 km) from London to northern England when all but essential travel was forbidden.

French President Emmanuel Macron last week ordered nightly curfews in cities where the coronavirus was the most active, saying it was spreading at parties and private gatherings and action was needed or else hospitals risked being overwhelmed.
While some people understood the need to contain the virus, restaurant managers cautioned about the impact on a sector that already suffered major losses during the spring lockdown.
""There will surely be employees who will lose their jobs, several restaurants will go bankrupt,"" said Stefano Anselmo, 44, manager of Italian restaurant Bianco in Paris. ""It's a disaster.""
France, like other European countries, is grappling with how to slow the virus’ spread and ease pressure on a once-again strained healthcare system while keeping its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.7 trillion) economy open and protecting jobs.
""For restaurateurs I understand that it is difficult but there is a moment when it is necessary to make a balance between public health and economic health,"" said Bastien Delaunay, a 22-year-old law student.
The number of new coronavirus infections in France jumped more than 32,000 in one day on Saturday for the first time since the start of the epidemic, health ministry data showed.
The 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfews will last at least four weeks.
""On Saturday night we used to go out all the time. We organised many things and now that's over. At 9 p.m. we must go home. That's the time when we used to go out,"" 22-year old Jeanne Baudin, said while sitting on a terrace with friends.

ABUJA/LAGOS (Reuters) - The Nigerian army will begin a two-month national exercise, it said on Saturday, while denying the move was part of any security response to recent widespread demonstrations against alleged police brutality.
Operation Crocodile Smile would run across the country from Oct. 20 to Dec. 31, the first time the annual exercise, typically concentrated in the Delta region, will be nationwide, Musa said. 
The move comes just days after the army said it was ready to step in and restore order, but Musa said in a statement that the exercise ""has no relationship with any lawful protest under any guise whatsoever"".
Nigerians demanding an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit and pressing for reforms and accountability have been rallying across the country.
The army had on Wednesday issued a statement warning what it termed ""subversive elements and trouble makers"" that it was ""ready to fully support the civil authority in whatever capacity to maintain law and order and deal with any situation decisively"".
Protesters have been using Twitter and the #EndSars hashtag to spread photos and videos showing alleged police brutality. Social media is also a hub for organising demonstrations and Nigerians are using it to collect money and food to feed protesters and support those who are arrested. 
Additionally, a group calling itself Anonymous has claimed to have hacked various government websites in recent days, and warned it will continue to hack government websites and Twitter accounts in order to aid the #EndSars movement. 
""The army hereby enjoins all law abiding Nigerians to go about their lawful activities unhindered as the exercise has nothing to do with ENDSARS protest, but a yearly event set out by the (army) in its efforts to ensuring safety and security of Nigeria and her citizens,"" Musa said in a statement.
Government officials have not responded to requests for comment on whether any websites were hacked, and Reuters could not independently confirm the claims. However Musa said the exercise would for the first time include cyber warfare training.

""The exercise is deliberately intended to be all- encompassing to include cyber warfare exercises designed to identify, track and counter negative propaganda in the social media and across the cyberspace,"" Musa said in the release.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Marigolds, known in Mexico as ""the flower of the dead"" for a scent believed be strong and sweet enough to attract souls and draw them back, are generally all around by mid-October as the Day of the Dead approaches.
But with the country exceeding 85,700 official deaths from the coronavirus pandemic this year, the bright, orange color has not been as prominent as Mexican authorities have said cemeteries will remain closed for the Nov. 2 celebration. 
""There have been a lot of losses this year,"" said Concepcion Cruz, who cultivates marigold in Mexico City. She said only about half as many of the flowers are being grown this year as would have been planted normally for the annual holiday. 
Ratcheting back the celebrations is a sacrifice that must be made if Mexico is to curb the spread of the pandemic, said Columba Lopez, director of Mexico City's Commission for Natural Resources and Rural Development. 
""People have to stay at home,"" he added.
The Day of the Dead tradition blends Catholic rituals with the pre-Hispanic belief that the dead return once a year from the underworld.
Cemeteries, public gardens and houses light up in the bright, orange color as marigolds are planted everywhere in October. 
In their homes, Mexicans build altars adorned with photographs of the deceased, marigolds, candy sculls, papier-mâché skeletons and chocolate coffins. 
The dead are also offered their favorite food, pastries, tequila and cigarettes - or whatever might entice them to return from the underworld.
With cemeteries closed but more dead to remember this year, Mexicans are planning more private remembrances for their loved ones.

""This year is very special because my family members died of COVID-19,"" said Dulce Maria Torres, who was buying flowers at a traditional market in the Mexican capital. ""It's important to me and we want to make them a beautiful offering.""

PARIS/CONFLANS-SAINTE-HONORINE, France (Reuters) - The teenager who beheaded a teacher outside the school in a Paris suburb where he taught had approached pupils in the street and asked them to point out his victim, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard said on Saturday.
Police shot dead the 18-year-old attacker, who was born in Russia, minutes after he murdered 47-year-old history teacher Samuel Paty in broad daylight in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine on Friday.
A photograph of the teacher's body, accompanied by a message claiming responsibility posted on Twitter, was discovered on the assailant's phone, found near his body. Ricard said the Twitter account belonged to the attacker.
The post was removed swiftly by Twitter, which said it had suspended the account because it violated the company's policy.
Ricard quoted the message as saying: ""In the name of Allah the most gracious, the most merciful, ... to (President Emmanuel) Macron, leader of the infidels, I have executed one of your hell-hounds who dared to belittle (Prophet) Mohammad.""
Earlier this month Paty had shown his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a class on freedom of expression, angering a number of Muslim parents. Muslims believe that any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.
The attacker, of Chechen origin, had been living in the town of Evreux northwest of Paris, and was not previously known to the intelligence services, Ricard told a news conference.
The killing shocked the country and carried echoes of an attack five years ago on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Prime Minister Jean Castex said it bore the hallmarks of Islamist terrorism. 
""I want to share with you my total indignation. Secularism, the backbone of the French Republic, was targeted in this vile act,"" Castex said. 
Unions, anti-racism groups and Charlie Hebdo are organising a gathering in central Paris on Sunday to commemorate the murdered teacher. 
A national tribute will be organised for Wednesday, Macron's office said. 
'BETWEEN HAMMER AND ANVIL'
Four close relatives of the attacker were detained soon after the attack. Five more were detained overnight, including the father of a pupil at Paty's school, College du Bois d'Aulne, and an acquaintance of the pupil's father known to the intelligence services, the anti-terrorism prosecutor said.
A tenth person was placed in custody in connection with the attack later on Saturday, BFM TV said, citing judicial sources. 
In the days after the lesson on freedom of expression, the pupil's father recorded several videos in which he branded the teacher a thug and called for him to be fired. In one, he urged others to ""join forces and say 'stop, don't touch our kids'"".
The videos where shared on social media.
The half-sister of the pupil's father had joined Islamic State in Syria in 2014, the prosecutor said. It was not immediately clear if the teenage attacker knew either the pupil's father or the father's acquaintance.
Parents of pupils laid flowers at the school gate. Some said their children were distraught.
""(My daughter) is in pieces, terrorised by the violence of such an act. How will I explain to her the unthinkable?"" one father wrote on Twitter.
In an outpouring of grief, the hashtag #JeSuisSamuel (I am Samuel) trended on social media, like the #JeSuisCharlie call for solidarity after the attack on Charlie Hebdo in 2015. 
Before that attack, Charlie Hebdo had published caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed, unleashing divisions that still cast a pall over French society.
Muslim leaders condemned Friday's killing, which many public figures perceived as an attack on the essence of French statehood and its values of secularism, freedom of worship and freedom of expression.
Deadly attacks by Islamist militants or their sympathisers was devastating for France's Muslim community, Tareq Oubrou, the imam of a Bordeaux mosque, said. 

""We are between hammer and anvil,"" he told France Inter radio. ""It attacks the Republic, society, peace and the very essence of religion, which is about togetherness.""

As a second wave of infections gathers pace, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has stepped up local restrictions in parts of England where cases are surging - hoping to shield the economy by allowing the least-affected regions to remain open.
As of midnight, London was moved up to the ""tier 2"" or ""high-risk"" level. This bans people from meeting anybody outside their household or ""support bubble"" - including friends or relatives who help to care for children - in any indoor setting.
The rules also forbid more than six people to meet outdoors, though the police chose not to enforce them as several thousand anti-lockdown campaigners marched down Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping streets in normal times.
The protesters view COVID-19 restrictions as unnecessary and a breach of their human rights. Some oppose mask-wearing and vaccinations.
Some carried placards saying: ""MY BODY MY CHOICE, NO TO MANDATORY MASKS"". 
""There's plenty of things that can kill you, you know, it could happen any day,"" said protester Aragorn Kyley, 17. ""It's about living, not just surviving. We want to be able to enjoy our lives, not just be stuck at home.""
As of Saturday, 57% of the United Kingdom's population was living under tighter COVID-19 restrictions. 
However scientists from the SAGE group that advises the government, and the main opposition Labour Party, want ministers to go further and impose a short nationwide lockdown or so-called ""circuit breaker"" for the spread of the disease.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Demonstrators marched through Lebanon's capital on Saturday to mark the first anniversary of a protest movement that toppled the government but was then overwhelmed by economic crisis, coronavirus and a devastating explosion in Beirut.
The demonstrations that broke out last October spread nationwide against a political elite that had ruled since the 1975-1990 civil war, presiding over an economic crisis and a collapse in the currency.
While the turmoil led to the resignation of prime minister Saad al-Hariri, politicians have since failed to form a government capable of addressing the country's challenges.
The global pandemic and the Aug. 4 explosion at Beirut's port, which killed nearly 200 people, brought further suffering and robbed the protests of momentum.
Those marking the anniversary in Beirut said they were not abandoning their demand for revolution and for President Michel Aoun to step aside.
""The revolution did not die,"" said activist Rabih al-Zein. ""We can hold this corrupt authority accountable and the proof is we brought down two governments.""
Hundreds of protesters marched past the central bank, a target of protesters' anger over a financial crisis that has seen the Lebanese pound lose nearly 80% of its value, and the parliament building before gathering near the damaged port.
A metal sculpture spelling out the word ""Revolution"" and topped by flames lit up the evening sky in front of the port.
The protests come ahead of talks between Aoun and parliamentary blocs to choose a prime minister. Hariri is in the running to form a government, although obstacles remain.
The legitimate grievances of the Lebanese people have gone unheeded during a ""harrowing year"" of crises, said Jan Kubis, the United Nations special representative for Lebanon.

""People’s commitment to and yearning for deep reforms and changes continues to be strong, even if the momentum has receded,"" Kubis said. ""They have planted the seeds for systemic changes. One year on, their struggle continues.""

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Local offices of Ivory Coast's ruling party were ransacked and the house of an opponent of President Alassane Ouattara was set on fire, as rival supporters clashed in an eastern city ahead of the presidential election, residents said on Saturday. 
The clashes in Bongouanou came after the opposition candidate, former premier Pascal Affi N'Guessan, and Ouattara's other main challenger, former president Henri Konan Bedie, had on Thursday called on their supporters to boycott the Oct. 31 vote and prevent it from going ahead.
More than a dozen people have been killed since August in protests against Ouattara's candidacy for a third term, which his opponents say violates the constitution. 
""When Affi called for the disruption of the campaign and the election by all means, some young people went to the office of the RHDP (the ruling party) and broke everything there,"" Ferdinand Kouamé, a teacher in Bongouanou, told Reuters.
""There was a fight between the youths of the RHDP and the opposition,"" Kouamé said. ""They resumed this morning and the house of Affi was burned."" Restaurants and other houses were also attacked, said another resident. 
Jean Bonin, an adviser to Affi, said he was waiting for the results of a police investigation into the fire. 
A police spokesman said several people had been injured in the clashes but there were no deaths. 
Affi is representing the party of former president Laurent Gbagbo, whose refusal to concede defeat to Ouattara after the 2010 election sparked a brief civil war in the world's top cocoa producer that killed 3,000 people. 
Affi and Bedie, who was president from 1993 to 1999, accuse the ruling party of manipulating the electoral process to ensure Ouattara's victory.

PARIS (Reuters) - The teenager identified by prosecutors as Abdoulakh A. lived with his family and had never appeared on the radar of French intelligence agencies. But he propelled himself into their sights in horrific manner on Friday evening when he beheaded a school teacher in broad daylight. 
The 18-year-old had a record of juvenile delinquency but was too young for police to have built up a file on him. He lived in a Chechen community that is not well understood by intelligence services.
He used a knife to decapitate the middle school history teacher, Samuel Paty, who had shown cartoons mocking the Prophet Mohammad to his students in a class on freedom of expression. He was shot dead by police minutes after the attack in a Paris suburb.
The profile of the attacker, as recounted by law-enforcement officials, illustrates the difficulties security agencies face identifying would-be attackers who are often exposed to extreme ideology on the internet and whose contacts with other Islamist militants, if they have any, may have been purely virtual.
The government says about 20,000 people in France are on the intelligence agencies' ""Fiche S"", a watchlist of people of posing a security risk to the country. Only a small number of these are under active surveillance. 
Abdoulakh A. was not on the list at all, police sources said. 
This is not the first time intelligence services have been blindsided like this.
The 25-year-old Pakistani man who wounded two people last month in a meatcleaver attack outside the former Paris office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which published cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammad, was not on the Fiche S list.
Nor was the IT worker with the Paris police force who knifed four colleagues to death a year earlier.
OPAQUE COMMUNITY
Abdoulakh A., who was Russian-born and of Chechen origin, was living in the town of Evreux northwest of Paris, according to authorities. On Friday night, police arrested his parents, younger brother and one grandparent, a judicial source said, wanting to establish what they knew of his plans and if he had any accomplices.
Some Islamist militants in western countries have been characterized as ""lone wolf"" attackers. However counter-terrorism experts say it is rare that attackers truly act alone, even if they don't physically meet their accomplices. 
The challenge for security services has been to tap into the networks that groom Islamist attackers, both by building stronger relationships with Muslim communities, and infiltrating jihadist social media accounts.
They have had some success in doing that with France's North African community, which has been in the country for many generations. But the Chechen community is more opaque, with most of its members having arrived after the mid-1990s.
""We don't know too much what is happening in the Chechen diaspora,"" said Asiem El Difraoui, a political analyst and specialist on jihadism. ""There are not many people in the intelligence services who understand the language, and there is a shortage of translators."" 

Mairbek Vachagaev, a Chechen emigre living in Paris who runs a newsletter for the Chechen community, wrote on the Telegram messaging service after Friday's killing: ""I'm sure that the whole 67,000-strong Chechen Diaspora in France is in shock over what happened.""

Prosecutors also denied mistreating Roman Giertych, who fainted during his detention on Thursday and is currently defending billionaire bank owner Leszek Czarnecki, a thorn in the government's side who is suspected of cheating clients of his Idea Bank.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau (CBA) said on Thursday that Giertych had taken part in a scheme to take money out of a company and launder funds, to the tune of more than 90 million zlotys ($23 million).
Giertych's lawyer said the charges were misplaced and that he would challenge them.
Civic rights ombudsman Adam Bodnar said on Thursday that the circumstances of Giertych's arrest raised ""serious concerns"".
Prosecutor Jacek Motawski told a press conference on Saturday that any suggestion that Giertych's ""health condition ... resulted from unauthorised interference by the CBA officers"" was ""completely unfounded"".
Giertych was also representing Czarnecki two years ago when the billionaire alleged that the head of the state financial regulatory authority, Marek Chrzanowski, appointed by the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, had sought a bribe from one of Czarnecki's banks in return for protection. Chrzanowski has since been indicted on corruption charges.

Hariri, who quit as prime minister last October in the face of nationwide protests, has said he is ready to lead a government to implement reforms proposed by France as a way to unlock badly needed international aid.
But Hariri, Lebanon's most prominent Sunni Muslim politician, has failed to win backing from the two main Christian parties - the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) and Lebanese Forces.
Parliamentary consultations to name a new prime minister were due to be held last Thursday, but President Michel Aoun postponed the discussions after receiving requests for a delay from some parliamentary blocs.
The FPM, which is led by Aoun's son-in-law Gebran Bassil, said it could not back a political figure such as Hariri because French President Emmanuel Macron's proposal had called for a reformist government made up of and led by ""specialists"".
As a result, the party's political council ""decided unanimously not to nominate... Hariri to lead the government"", a statement said, adding that Aoun's week-long postponement would not lead the party to reconsider its position.
Hariri could still secure a parliamentary majority if the powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its ally Amal endorse him for premier.
But the absence of support from either of the main Christian blocs would hand him at best a fragile mandate to tackle Lebanon's gravest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
The country has plunged into financial turmoil and the value of the Lebanese pound has collapsed. COVID-19 and a huge explosion at Beirut's port two months ago have compounded the crisis and pushed many Lebanese into poverty.
Hariri, who has served twice as prime minister, resigned two weeks after huge protests erupted exactly a year ago.

The demonstrations, triggered by plans to tax voice calls made through the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging application, grew into wider protests against Lebanon's political elite.

The delegation, led by prosecutor Fatou Bensouda, would discuss ""cooperation"" with Sudan over the wanted men, without naming them, according to the statement. It is the first visit by the court since Bashir was ousted last year.
Bashir, who has been jailed in Khartoum since he was toppled after mass protests last year, is wanted by the ICC for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in Sudan’s troubled Darfur region.
The Hague-based court issued arrest warrants for him in 2009 and 2010 accusing him of masterminding atrocities in his campaign to crush a revolt in Darfur region.
Sudan has also detained Ahmed Haroun and Abdel Raheem Muhammad Hussein, two former officials who are wanted for crimes against humanity in a conflict in Darfur that has killed an estimated 300,000 people.
Bashir's lawyer has repeatedly denounced the court charges against the former president as politically motivated.
There was no immediate comment from the court.

Sudan's civilian government, which is running the country under a three-year transition with the military, has signed a peace agreement with former rebels in Darfur and other neglected regions which had been fighting Bashir's government for years.

415,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>","New Zealand's Ardern storms to re-election with 'be strong, be kind' mantra","By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Jacinda Ardern turned speaking from the heart and smiling through adversity into a winning formula for a blowout re-election as New Zealand's leader on Saturday.
Now Ardern, who made a name for herself by crushing COVID-19 in the country and healing the nation after a massacre of Muslims by a white supremacist, faces a challenge to show her leadership extends beyond crisis management and kindness.
Her Labour Party won a landslide victory in the general election, a resounding mandate that ushers in New Zealand's first purely left-leaning government in decades and may allow her to form a single-party government.
The win is also the reward for Ardern's leadership through a series of extraordinary events that shaped her first three-year term: the gunman's massacre of 51 worshippers at two Christchurch mosques and the eruption of the White Island volcano, which killed 21.
""Be strong, be kind,"" New Zealand's youngest prime minister in more than a century repeated through these dramatic events, her empathetic leadership and crisis management skills often masking her government's shortcomings.
Ardern's left-leaning government will face a looming economic hangover from COVID-19, a deep plunge in output and surge in debt after her strict lockdowns, a worsening housing crisis and a growing divide between rich and poor.
Despite promising a transformational term in 2017, Ardern's affordable housing programme was set back by blunders, plans for a capital gains tax that would have addressed the growing rich-poor divide were scrapped, and her government fell woefully short of its goal to reduce child poverty.
Even on climate change, which Ardern called ""my generation's nuclear-free moment"", progress has been incremental.
""I think it's fair to say they have not achieved what they had hoped to achieve,"" said Ganesh Nana, Research Director at Wellington economic think tank BERL. ""There are many disappointed with the pace of change.""
REFRESHING CHANGE
Ardern burst onto the global scene in 2017 when she became the world's youngest female head of government at the age of 37.
She became a global icon in a rise dubbed ""Jacinda-mania,"" as she campaigned passionately for women's rights and an end to child poverty and economic inequality in the island nation.
Ardern, raised a Mormon by her mother and police officer father, left the church over its stance on LGBTQ people in the early 2000s and has since described herself as agnostic.
Asked by a television presenter, hours after being appointed Labour leader in 2017, whether she planned to have children, Ardern said it was ""totally unacceptable in 2017 to say that women should have to answer that question in the workplace"".
Ardern did in fact have a baby daughter in June 2018, eight months after becoming prime minister - only the second elected leader to give birth while in office, after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto. 
Many took her pregnancy and maternity leave in office as symbolising progress for women leaders. Within three months of arriving in the world, her daughter Neve Te Aroha was at the U.N. General Assembly in New York with her mother.
Ardern is feted globally as part of a new wave of progressive and young leaders that include France's Emmanuel Macron and Canada's Justin Trudeau.
Helen Clark, a former New Zealand prime minister for whom Ardern worked after university, said the young leader represents a refreshing and sharp point of difference in a world where news is dominated by utterances of populist and authoritarian leaders.
""Jacinda Ardern can be best compared with the three Scandinavian women prime ministers who are from the centre-left,"" said Clark, co-chair of a World Health Organization panel on the global COVID-19 response.
""All of them have led good responses to the pandemic, putting health security first and communicating in an empathetic way with the public in each of their countries.""
CHRISTCHURCH
Last year Ardern received worldwide praise for her response to the Christchurch attacks, which she labelled terrorism. She wore a hijab as she met the Muslim community the next day, telling them the country was ""united in grief"". 
She delivered a ban on semiautomatic firearms and other gun curbs, a stark contrast to the United States, where lawmakers and activists have struggled to address gun violence despite numerous mass shootings.
At the U.N. General Assembly, Ardern, asked world leaders: ""What if we no longer see ourselves based on what we look like, what religion we practice, or where we live ... but by what we value?

""Humanity, kindness, an innate sense of our connection to each other. And a belief that we are guardians, not just of our home and our planet, but of each other.""

418,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Analysis: Arrest of ex-army chief puts Mexican president's plans under siege,"By Drazen Jorgic and Dave Graham (NYSE:GHM)
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The spectacular fall from grace of Mexico's previous armed forces supremo has raised awkward questions about the president's reliance on the military to fight drug gangs and manage an increasing portfolio of vital civilian infrastructure.
Thursday's arrest of former Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos in the United States at the Los Angeles airport on drug trafficking charges sent shockwaves through the political establishment and embarrassed a once highly trusted institution.
It threatens to sour government relations with the military, which since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador assumed power in December 2018 has been tasked not just with reducing violence, but also managing ports and even building an airport. 
""He has placed his entire political capital on making his political project work through the armed forces,"" said Falko Ernst, a senior analyst with the International Crisis Group. ""If he steers away from that, there's no one else to turn to right now. He doesn't have many other options left.""
Lopez Obrador responded to the Cienfuegos arrest by vowing to root out military corruption - a promise which sits uneasily with the faith he previously put in Mexico's generals.
Now the same military leaders the president is counting on to pacify Mexico after years of gang violence may end up sidelined in top civilian security appointments, officials say.
Before Cienfuegos' detention, speculation was growing that Lopez Obrador would appoint a general to replace Security Minister Alfonso Durazo, who has flagged his intention to run for the governorship of the northern state of Sonora in 2021.
""This is a game changer,"" said a senior Mexican police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Lopez Obrador would have to ""pay a high political price"" to put a military figure in charge of the civilian body, the official added.
Then there is the question of bad blood.
Charging Cienfuegos, who ran the army from 2012-18, with the very crime he was meant to be rooting out risks shaking a key pillar of the Mexican state to its core - and incurring its wrath, another government official said.
""The army won't take this too well,"" said the official.
Lopez Obrador on Friday resoundingly backed Cienfuegos' successor at the head of the army and his counterpart in the navy, saying he had personally vetted them and vouched for their honesty.
Generals have been locked up on drugs charges before.
But the arrest of the army's one-time chieftain by a foreign power is a heavy blow to the prestige of an institution that has prided itself as the principal guarantor of stability in the country since the Mexican Revolution a century ago.
In part this is because successive Mexican presidents, who can only serve a single six-year term, have opted to chop and change alternative, civilian police institutions rather than build on what their predecessors began, critics say.
Yet that was often a reaction to the perceived corruption inside those bodies, as evinced by the December 2019 arrest of former Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna by U.S. officials for allegedly taking bribes from the Sinaloa cartel.
Garcia Luna denies the charges. Ironically, Lopez Obrador said the arrest of Cienfuegos flowed from that probe.
NEGATIVE SPIRAL
Lack of civilian alternatives to the military risks creating a negative long-term spiral, analysts say.
Alejandro Hope, a former Mexican intelligence official, said if security is handed over to the military, there is no point in investing in the training of civilian commanders.
""After a few years, there are no civilian commanders to turn to and there is no alternative but to leave the responsibility to the military,"" he wrote in the El Universal newspaper.
Once an outspoken critic of the military himself, Lopez Obrador has bolstered the armed forces' economic interests by tasking the army to build a $3.2 billion airport for Mexico City. He has also ordered the navy to take over the running of key ports that Mexican cartels have infiltrated.
In his political declarations, Lopez Obrador is often at pains to exalt the esprit de corps and probity of the army, despite ample past evidence of corruption.
Some people close to the government were even privately celebrating Cienfuegos' detention, saying it only confirmed their suspicions about rot in the military.
""This breaks with the historic pact of impunity that protected the army,"" said a senior member of the president's ruling party, the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA).
In a sign of the U.S. mistrust in Mexican officials, the government in Mexico City was not kept in the loop about details of Cienfuegos' alleged crimes or the timing of the arrest. Officials expressed shock and amazement about the news.

""There was no knowledge of it in security areas,"" one senior government official told Reuters.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 17, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",Ardern wins landslide re-election in New Zealand vote,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's centre-left Labour Party won a landslide victory in New Zealand's general election on Saturday as voters rewarded her for a decisive response to COVID-19.
The mandate means Ardern, 40, could form the first single-party government in decades, and face the challenge of delivering on the progressive transformation she promised but failed to deliver in her first term, where Labour shared power with a nationalist party.
""This is a historic shift,"" said political commentator Bryce Edwards of Victoria University in Wellington, describing the vote as one of the biggest swings in New Zealand's electoral history in 80 years.
Labour was on track to win 64 of the 120 seats in the country's unicameral parliament, the highest by any party since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996. 
If Labour wins more than half the seats, Ardern could form the first single-party government under the current system.
Ardern came out of her home in Auckland, waved and hugged gathered supporters. Opposition National Party leader Judith Collins said she had called the prime minister to congratulate her for an ""outstanding result"". 
Labour had 49.0% of the votes, far ahead of National at 27%, the Electoral Commission said, with 77% of ballots counted in an election that was largely a referendum on Ardern's aggressive handling of COVID-19.
""People were very grateful and very happy with how we’ve handled COVID, they like the shape of the plan that we’ve got going forward from here for the economy,"" said Finance Minister Grant Robertson, a top Labour MP.
Geoffrey Miller, analyst at political website Democracy Project, said the victory was ""very much a personal triumph for Jacinda Ardern's 'superstar' popularity and brand.""
Of Ardern's current coalition partners, the nationalist New Zealand First Party had 2.6% and the Green Party 7.6%. If she is unable to form a Labour-only government, she is expected to continue to rely on the minor Greens while jettisoning New Zealand First.
A Labour-Green coalition would be the first fully left-leaning government since the 1970s, a scenario that National's Collins warned would mean more taxes and an environment hostile to business.
Ardern has pledged to raise taxes on top earners, while Collins promised short-term tax cuts, but they have otherwise shown few major differences on policy. 
'BE STRONG, BE KIND'
The prime minister won global acclaim for her handling of a mass shooting last year by a white supremacist in Christchurch, with her inclusive ""be strong, be kind"" mantra and swift action to ban guns.
She burnished that reputation this year with a ""go hard, go early"" approach to the new coronavirus, which has eliminated locally spread COVID-19 in the nation.
The election was delayed by a month after new COVID-19 infections in Auckland, that led to a second lockdown in the country's largest city.
While known internationally for promoting progressive causes such as woman's rights and social justice, at home Ardern faced criticism that her government failed on a promise to be transformational.
Life is back to normal in New Zealand, but its borders are still shut, its tourism sector is bleeding and economists predict a lasting recession after the harsh lockdowns.
The economy shrank at an 12.2% annual clip in the second quarter, its steepest drop since the Great Depression. Debt is forecast to rise to 56% of gross domestic product from less than 20% before the pandemic. 

New Zealanders also voted on Saturday in referendums to legalise euthanasia and recreational marijuana, with results to be announced on Oct. 30. The latter vote could make New Zealand only the third country in the world to allow the adult use and sale of cannabis nationwide, after Uruguay and Canada.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of Thais chanted at protests that popped up across Bangkok on Saturday in defiance of a crackdown on three months of demonstrations aimed at the government and the powerful monarchy.
After police used water cannon for the first time against a protest by thousands of people in central Bangkok on Friday, protesters agreed to assemble at different points across the city on Saturday.
Several hundred, many in black t-shirts, staged a rally at the Lat Phrao station in northern Bangkok. Protests were also reported from several other parts of the city as police said rail services were shutting in much of central Bangkok to thwart the demonstrations.
""Prayuth get out"" the protesters chanted, in reference to Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former military ruler they accuse of engineering an election last year to prolong the hold of the army.
In a widening crackdown, police have arrested more than 50 people - including several protest leaders - in the past week.
""Violent or not, all gatherings are illegal,"" police spokesman Yingyos Thepjamnong told a news conference.
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters: ""There is no win or lose for any side. It's all damage to the country. The government would like to ask protesters to not gather and remain peaceful.""
On Thursday, it ordered a ban on protests which have become the biggest challenge in years to the government and have brought unprecedented criticism of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
Immediately after the ban, tens of thousands of people protested in Bangkok in defiance. Thousands more rallied on Friday, pushing back against riot police who responded by firing chemically-laced water that was dyed blue.
""I condemn those who cracked down on the protesters and those who ordered it. You all have blood on your hands,"" protest leader Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree, said after being freed on bail following his arrest on Friday.
Police said that their response to Friday's protest had been proportionate and in line with international norms.
Protesters demand the removal of Prayuth, who first took power in a 2014 coup. He rejects protesters' accusations that he engineered last year's election to keep power. Breaking a longstanding taboo, protesters have also called for curbs on the power of the monarchy.

The Royal Palace has made no comment on the protests but the king said Thailand needed people who love the country and the monarchy.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other on Saturday of fresh attacks in violation of a week-old Russian-brokered truce that has failed to halt the worst fighting in the South Caucasus since the 1990s.
Baku said 13 civilians were killed and more than 50 wounded in the city of Ganja by an Armenian missile attack, while Yerevan accused Azerbaijan of continued shelling.
The fighting is the worst in the region since Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces went to war in the 1990s over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain territory that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and governed by ethnic Armenians. 
The Azeri Prosecutor General's office said a residential area in Ganja, the country's second-largest city and miles away from Nagorno-Karabakh, was shelled by missile strikes and around 20 apartment buildings had been hit. Armenia denied the claim.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev accused Armenia of committing a war crime by shelling Ganja.
""They will be held responsible for that ... If the international community does not punish Armenia, we will do it,"" he said.
Aliyev said the Azeri army has completely taken over two regions previously held by separatists, Fizuli and Jabrail.
""We are dominating the battlefield,"" he said, adding that Azeri armed forces never targeted civilian settlements.
Aliyev also questioned Armenia's ability to keep replacing military hardware destroyed in battles, a thinly veiled jab at Yerevan's ally Moscow.
He reiterated his stance that Baku would only stop its offensive once Armenia withdraws from Nagorno-Karabakh.
In Ganja, rescuers worked at the scene on Saturday morning, picking through rubble, a Reuters photographer said. Some houses had been almost levelled. An excavator was clearing the debris.
""We have been living in fear for days ... We are suffering a lot. We would rather die. I wish we were dead but our children would survive,"" one resident of the city, 58-year-old Emina Aliyeva, told reporters.
The Armenian defence ministry denied the Azeri claim on shelling cities in Azerbaijan and accused Baku of continuing to shell populated areas inside Nagorno-Karabakh, including Stepanakert, the region's biggest city.
Three civilians were wounded as a result of Azeri fire, the Armenian foreign ministry said.
A Reuters cameraman in Stepanakert said he had heard several explosions on Friday night and in the early hours of the morning.
Armenia also said several Azeri drones flew over settlements in Armenia, attacked military installations and damaged the civilian infrastructure.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan called attacks ""an attempted genocide of the Armenian people"".
""We must defend ourselves, like any nation that is threatened with extermination,"" he told the French newspaper Liberation.
Baku said on Saturday that 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on Sept. 27. Azerbaijan has not disclosed military casualties. 

Nagorno-Karabakh says 633 of its military personnel have been killed, and 34 civilians.

The Daily Mail reported on Saturday that Jennifer Arcuri, when asked if she had an affair with Johnson, said: ""I think that goes without saying ... it's pretty much out there.""
In an interview with the newspaper, Arcuri says Johnson, who was married to second wife Marina Wheeler at the time, bombarded her with ""avalanches of passion"".
Arcuri gave a number of TV interviews after the allegations came to light, saying she and Johnson had enjoyed a ""very special relationship"", though she repeatedly refused to say whether they had had an affair.
Johnson was London mayor from 2008 to 2016. He became prime minister last year. 
Downing Street had no immediate comment.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an investigation in September 2019 following a newspaper report that Johnson, when mayor of London, had failed to disclose his personal links to Arcuri, who received thousands of pounds in public funding and places on official trade trips.
Johnson denied any wrongdoing, saying everything was done with full propriety and that there was no interest to declare.
In May the IOPC said he would not face criminal action. 

The matter was referred to the watchdog because Johnson was head of the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, a role equivalent to a police commissioner, during his term as mayor.

Canada suspended the export of some drone technology to Turkey earlier this month as it probes allegations the equipment was used by Azeri forces involved in fighting with Armenia.
In a phone call on Friday, Erdogan and Trudeau discussed improving relations and increasing bilateral trade, the Turkish presidency said, adding that they also talked about overcoming issues regarding cooperation in the defence sector.
""During the call, President Tayyip Erdogan said Canada's suspension of the export of some military goods to Turkey due to the Azerbajian-Armenia conflict... is against the spirit of alliance,"" the presidency said.
Turkey and Canada are both members of NATO.
Following Canada's announcement, Turkey's Foreign Ministry had said the suspension showed a double standard.
Turkey's military exports to its ally Azerbaijan have risen six-fold this year, with sales of drones and other military equipment rising to $77 million last month alone before fighting broke out over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, according to exports data.
Canadian arms control group Project Ploughshares says video of air strikes released by Azerbaijan indicates the drones had been equipped with imaging and targeting systems made by L3Harris Wescam, the Canada-based unit of L3Harris Technologies (NYSE:LHX) Inc.
Ankara has said it stands firmly beside its close ally in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.

Grey-haired and bespectacled Alexandra Wong, 64, had been a familiar face at anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, often waving a large British flag, but she disappeared from the streets around August last year.
Activists and human rights groups had expressed concern over her whereabouts.
Speaking to media for the first time since her release after completing 14 days in quarantine, Wong said she had been detained by Chinese police when she tried to return to her home in Shenzhen on August 14, 2019.
During about one and a half months detention at various centres, where up to 26 people would sleep in a room of less than 200 square feet, Wong said she was being interrogated almost every day about the Hong Kong protests.
""I didn't know what crime I committed,"" Wong said. 
The Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau could not be reached for comment.
After the detention, Wong said she was sent to the northwestern province of Shaanxi for a five-day patriotic camp in late September last year. 
Until early this month, Wong had been restricted by authorities from returning to Hong Kong, pending a trial that never took place in the end. She stayed in her home in Shenzhen where she would get regular visits by the national security officers, she added. 
""I was scared I would be stopped from coming back to Hong Kong... I was scared everyday something might happen again everyday day,"" Wong said. 
Wong called for the release of the 12 activists who were intercepted at sea in late August by mainland authorities as they tried to flee by boat to Taiwan.

""I'm worried about the 12 young people; their treatment could be worse than me.""

The region, where most parliamentary seats are held by Rakhine nationalist opponents of Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi, has been beset by an ethnic insurgency that has intensified this year.
The ruling National League for Democracy said three of its candidates were abducted in Rakhine while campaigning on Wednesday. Police did not respond to requests for comment, and Arakan Army insurgents made no statement.
Some areas ""are not in a position to hold a free and fair election,"" the committee said in a statement late on Friday.
There will be no voting in nine of 17 townships in Rakhine, according to the statement, while another four will have minimal voting.
""This has a huge impact on us. We have only a few spots for voting left,"" said Myo Kyaw, spokesman for the Arakan League for Democracy, one of the major parties in Rakhine. 
""There is no such thing as a 100% free and fair election. The election this year is worse than the others before it,” he added.
The government did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on what the cancellation of polling stations would mean for the fairness of the election. 
In the last election in 2015, the ethnic Arakan National Party won most of the seats for Rakhine state and the third-highest number of votes nationwide. The party seeks a federal system in Myanmar, with more power for its states.
Rakhine drew the eyes of the world in 2017 when more than 730,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during a military crackdown, a campaign that UN investigators said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"". The army said it was responding to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
The current conflict is being waged by the Arakan Army, which is fighting for greater autonomy for the western region. Its recruits are largely Buddhists, who make up most of the population of Rakhine as well as Myanmar.

Opposition parties have urged Myanmar's government to postpone the election because of surging coronavirus infections and a rising death toll, but Suu Kyi has said the ballot must go ahead.

A pod of around 40 whales was sighted swimming close to the shore in shallow muddy water early on Saturday before some of them got stranded, the department said in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account. The rest remained offshore, but in shallow waters. 
Rangers and volunteers were onsite, it said. ""We appreciate the public's concern but at this stage NO FURTHER HELP IS NEEDED.""
The next high tide was expected Saturday evening. 
The whales were stranded on a beach in the Coromandel Peninsula. Auckland, the country's biggest city, lies 55 km (34 miles) to the west, on the far shore of the Hauraki Gulf.
In late September, several hundred whales died in shallow waters off the Australian coast in one of the world's biggest mass whale strandings.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 09:35PM ET</span>",U.S. to carry out first federal execution of a woman in seven decades,"By Brendan O'Brien
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it has scheduled the first federal execution of a woman in almost 70 years, setting a Dec. 8 date to put to death Lisa Montgomery, convicted of a 2004 murder. 
Montgomery, who was found guilty of strangling a pregnant woman in Missouri, will be executed by lethal injection at U.S. Penitentiary Terre Haute, Indiana, the department said in a statement. 
The last woman to be executed by the U.S. government was Bonnie Heady, who was put to death in a gas chamber in Missouri in 1953, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. 
The justice department on Friday also scheduled a Dec. 10. execution for Brandon Bernard, who with his accomplices murdered two youth ministers in 1999. 
The two executions will be the eighth and ninth the federal government has carried out in 2020. 
The Trump administration ended an informal 17-year-hiatus in federal executions in July, after announcing last year that the Bureau of Prisons was switching to a new single-drug protocol for lethal injections, from a three-drug combination it last used in 2003.
The new protocol revived long-running legal challenges to lethal injections. In August, a federal judge in Washington, D.C. ruled the Justice Department was violating the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in not seeking a doctor's prescription to administer the highly regulated barbiturate.
But an appeals court held the violation did not in itself amount to ""irreparable harm"" and allowed federal executions to proceed. 
In 2007, a U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri sentenced Montgomery to death after finding her guilty of a federal kidnapping resulting in death.
Her attorney, Kelley Henry, said that Montgomery deserves to live because she is mentally ill and suffered childhood abuse.
""Lisa Montgomery has long accepted full responsibility for her crime, and she will never leave prison,"" Henry said in a statement. ""But her severe mental illness and the devastating impacts of her childhood trauma make executing her a profound injustice.""
Bernard's attorney, Robert Owen, said in a statement the federal government misled the jury in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, which in 2000 found Bernard guilty of murder. Its decision was tainted by false testimony, Owen said. 
""This evidence confirms that Mr. Bernard is simply not one of the 'worst of the worst' offenders for whom we reserve the death penalty, and that sparing his life would pose no risk to anyone,"" Owen said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos used his power in office to protect a faction of the Beltran-Leyva cartel, directing operations against rival gangs and even finding maritime transport to ship drugs, U.S. prosecutors said on Friday.
Cienfuegos, arrested at Los Angeles airport on Thursday, took bribes in return for protection that included warning cartel members about U.S. investigations, according to prosecutors in New York who have charged the 72-year-old with four counts of drug trafficking and money laundering.
""In exchange for bribe payments, he permitted the H-2 Cartel - a cartel that routinely engaged in wholesale violence, including torture and murder - to operate with impunity in Mexico,"" prosecutors said in a court filing. 
The H-2 Cartel is a name for a remnant of the Beltran-Leyva gang. 
Cienfuegos served from 2012 to 2018 in the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto, several of whose aides and party members are now accused of high level corruption. Pena Nieto has denied allegations he took a cartel bribe.
The detention comes less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, seeking a second term, has made clamping down on drug cartels a priority, though without major progress since he took office in 2017.
The arrest of Cienfuegos - nicknamed El Padrino, or The Godfather, in an August 2019 indictment that was sealed until he was in U.S. custody - marked the first time a former Mexican defense minister has been indicted and detained.
Awarded a Pentagon honor for excellence just two years ago, his criminal activities, if proven, are another sign of flaws in the U.S.-backed war on drug cartels. Mexico has suffered hundreds of thousands of deaths and disappearances in cartel violence this century. 
Cienfuegos' downfall has far reaching implications for Mexico's anti-cartel strategy, led largely by the armed forces for more than a decade. 
Ahead of mid-term elections next year, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador will seek to capitalize on the capture of such a high-ranking member of his predecessor's government. 
Lopez Obrador pledged to suspend anyone inside his government implicated in the charges, but needing to avoid instability, he stepped carefully. 
""We won't cover up for anybody,"" he said, before voicing support for Cienfuegos' successor at the head of the army and his counterpart in the navy, noting he had personally vetted them and vouched for their honesty.
Lopez Obrador incorporated the arrest into his narrative that his predecessors presided over a debilitating increase in corruption in Mexico, for years convulsed by horrific levels of drug gang violence. 
""If we're not talking about a narco state, one can certainly talk about a narco government, and without doubt, about a government of mafiosi,"" Lopez Obrador said. 
""We're cleaning up, purifying public life.""
There had been no open probe in Mexico of Cienfuegos and his arrest was linked to the case against Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's security minister from 2006-2012, Lopez Obrador said. 
Garcia Luna is on trial in New York charged with accepting millions of dollars in bribes from captured kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel, which he was meant to fight.
NO INTERFERENCE
U.S. prosecutors say there appear to have been close ties between Cienfuegos and the H-2 gang, founded by the Beltran-Leyva brothers, related through marriage to ""El Chapo"" and from the same hill town. The gang was at the time in a bloody war with the Sinaloa Cartel.
One of the Beltran-Leyva brothers was killed in 2009, another arrested in 2014. By the time of Cienfuegos' alleged crimes between 2015 and 2017, the gang had a new leader called Juan Francisco Patron.
The minister's protection helped the cartel ship tonnes of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana without significant interference from the Mexican military, prosecutors said in a memo accompanying the indictment in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. 
According to the court documents, which cite evidence intercepted from Blackberry (TSX:BB) Messenger communications, Cienfuegos made sure military operations did not target the cartel, focusing offensives on rival groups instead. 
He is also accused of introducing the gang's senior leaders to other Mexican officials in exchange for bribes. Information he passed on about cooperating witnesses in a U.S. investigation led to the murder of a cartel member wrongly believed to be assisting U.S. law enforcement, the documents said. 
The thousands of intercepted communications included ones in which the minister discussed his historical assistance to another drug trafficking organization, prosecutors said.
Mexico's armed forces are generally perceived as less prone to corruption than the police. However, that image has eroded since former president Felipe Calderon first sent in the military to fight the gangs at the end of 2006.
A tall, imposing man, Cienfuegos fought to shield the army from potentially embarrassing investigations. 
On his watch, the army was accused of extrajudicial killings, including the June 2014 Tlatlaya massacre in central Mexico, where 22 drug gang members were shot dead.
Last month, arrest warrants were issued for soldiers in connection with the kidnapping and suspected massacre of 43 student teachers in September 2014. 
During a brief court hearing in Los Angeles on Friday, Cienfuegos was ordered to remain in U.S. custody at least until a formal hearing on his detention next week. Prosecutors expect him to be arraigned in New York in the coming weeks. 
He could face more than 30 years in prison if convicted.

Reuters was not immediately able to contact a lawyer the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn said was representing the defendant.

CONFLANS-SAINTE-HONORINE, France (Reuters) - The middle school teacher knifed to death on the street of a Paris suburb on Friday showed his teenage students a cartoon lampooning the Prophet Mohammad as part of a class on freedom of expression earlier this month, parents said.
Nordine Chaouadi told Reuters he was the father of a 13-year-old pupil who attended the civics class given by the teacher, whom parents gathered outside the college referred to as Mr. Paty. French media have identified him as Samuel Paty.
The teacher had asked pupils who were Muslim to raise their hands and invited them to leave, advising them he would be showing a caricature of Mohammad that might cause offence, said Chaouadi.
For Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous.
Chaouadi said his son, a Muslim, interpreted the teacher's actions as done out of kindness and respect for their faith. 
""He did it to protect the children, not to shock them,"" said Chaouadi.
Some parents took offence, however. Two or three days later, they held a meeting at the school with the teacher, school principal, and an official from the education authority.
""It went well. There was no shouting or talking over each other. My wife took part in it. She said it was a man who made a mistake, it happens to everyone,"" Chaouadi added.
One man who said his daughter was in the class gave a similar account of the lesson in a video recorded around the time of the meeting. However, he branded the history teacher a thug, and posted the video on social media. The post was shared by a Paris mosque, among others.
Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate the video. 
In the video, the man says: ""If you want to join forces and say 'stop, don't touch our children, then send me a message.'
""This thug should not remain in the national education system, should no longer teach our children. He should go educate himself,"" he continues in the recording.
The school, the College du Bois d'Aulne in the middle-class suburb of Conflans-Saint-Honorine, could not immediately be reached for comment.
It was unclear whether the attacker, who was shot dead by police and has not been named, had seen the video.
Lawmakers and teachers' unions hailed the slain teacher's courage for confronting challenging taboos in French society. Freedom of expression was a core tenet of democracy, they said.
Jean-Remi Girard, president of the National Union of School Teachers, told BFM TV that children needed to understand that blasphemy can shock, but is legal.
Blood has been spilled before in France over satire targeting Islam. Islamist militants killed 12 in a gun rampage in the office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in 2015 after it published a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad.
Local centre-right lawmaker Antoine Savignat said, ""If we cannot talk about the Charlie Hebdo caricatures in school, we end up in denialism... In France, the country of freedom of expression, this cannot be allowed to happen.""

The video, taken in the coastal city of Sinop, showed a narrow column of smoke headed high into the blue sky. In recent days Turkey had issued notices restricting air space and waters off the coastal area to allow firing tests.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Turkey had tested the S-400 system on Friday but did not provide details. 
Tests of the S-400s, if verified, could stoke tensions between Turkey and the United States, which sharply opposed Ankara's purchase of the weapons from Moscow on grounds they compromise shared NATO defence systems.
State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said the United States has expressed to the most senior levels of the Turkish government that the acquisition of Russian military systems such as the S-400 is unacceptable, adding that Washington has been clear on its expectation that the system should not be operationalised.
""If confirmed, we would condemn in the strongest terms the S-400 test missile launch as incompatible with Turkey’s responsibilities as a NATO  Ally and strategic partner of the United States,"" Ortagus added.
The Pentagon, separately, said that the S-400 should not be activated.
""Turkey has already been suspended from the F-35 program and the S-400 continues to be a barrier to progress elsewhere in the bilateral relationship,"" a Pentagon spokesman said. 
Turkey's defence ministry said it would neither deny nor confirm missile tests. 
Washington reacted last year by suspending Turkey from its F-35 jet programme and has threatened sanctions. 
Defence analyst Turan Oguz said a preliminary assessment of the colour, intensity, angle and route of the smoke in the video coincided with S-400 missiles. The angle of the column suggested the target ""must not be too high,"" he added. 
Last year the military conducted radar tests of the surface-to-air defences, which is among the world's most advanced and can spot and track incoming aircraft at medium and long ranges. 
Turkey signed the S-400 deal with Russia in 2017. Deliveries of the first four missile batteries, worth $2.5 billion, began in July last year. 
U.S. Senator Jim Risch, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the test ""unacceptable behaviour"" from a NATO ally.
In a statement, Risch said the move damages the alliance and posed a direct threat to the F-35 and other U.S. and NATO allies’ systems.
“U.S. law requires sanctions against countries that continue to deepen their defence relationship with Russia, and the administration should send a strong signal that Turkey must divest its S-400s,"" he said.
U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said President Donald Trump's affinity for Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan posed a serious threat to the United States' national security.

""Turkey must be sanctioned immediately for its purchase and use of this system,"" Menendez said in a statement.

PARIS (Reuters) - A middle school history teacher in France was knifed to death near the school where earlier this month he had shown his pupils cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad, considered blasphemous by Muslims, French officials said on Friday.
The attacker was shot dead by a police patrol a few streets away from the scene of the attack late on Friday afternoon, in a residential suburb north-west of Paris.
""One of our fellow citizens was assassinated today because he was teaching, he was teaching pupils about freedom of expression,"" French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters at the scene of the attack.
""Our compatriot was flagrantly attacked, was the victim of an Islamist terrorist attack,"" Macron said. ""They won't win... We will act. Firmly, And quickly. You can count on my determination.""
The incident carried echoes of the attack five years ago on the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. It published caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed, unleashing divisions that are still casting a pall over French society.
Friday's killing, by targeting a teacher, was interpreted by many public figures as an attack on the essence of French statehood, with the values it espouses of secularism, freedom of worship, and freedom of expression.
""This evening, it's the Republic that's under attack,"" Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer wrote in a tweet.
The victim of Friday's attack sustained multiple knife wounds to the neck, according to a police representative. One law enforcement source said the teacher had been beheaded in the attack.
French broadcaster BFMTV reported that the suspected attacker was 18 years old and born in Moscow. Law enforcement officials did not name the attacker, or his victim.
A police source said that witnesses had heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"". 
The attack took place in the street in front of the middle school where the victim worked, in the suburb of Conflans Sainte-Honorine. The area is a middle class neighbourhood with many residents who commute to work in Paris. 
CIVICS LESSON
According to French media reports, the teacher who was killed had earlier this month shown pupils the cartoons as part of a civics lesson.
A Twitter thread posted on Oct. 9 contained a video of a man who said his daughter, a Muslim, was one of the pupils in the class, and that she was shocked and upset by the teacher's actions. 
The man in the video urged Twitter users to complain to the authorities and get the teacher removed from his post. Reuters was unable to independently verify the authenticity of the video.
France has over the past years seen a series of violent attacks by Islamist militants, including the 2015 Charlie Hebdo killings, and bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theatre and sites around Paris that killed 130 people.
Less than a month ago, a man originally from Pakistan used a meat cleaver to attack and wound two people who were on a cigarette break outside the offices where Charlie Hebdo was based at the time of the 2015 attack.
The issue of the cartoons had been revived last month when Charlie Hebdo decided to re-publish them to coincide with the start of the trial of accomplices in the 2015 attack.
Al-Qaeda, the militant Islamist group that claimed responsibility for those killings, threatened to attack Charlie Hebdo again after it republished the cartoons.
The magazine said last month it published to assert its right to freedom of expression, and to show it would not be cowed into silence by violent attacks. That stance was backed by many prominent French politicians and public figures.

Reacting to Friday's attack outside the school, Charlie Hebdo wrote on its Twitter account: ""Intolerance has crossed a new threshold and does not seem to give ground to anything in imposing its terror on our country.""

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo voiced deep concern about Northern Cyprus' reopening part of a beachfront resort abandoned since Turkey invaded the island in 1974, calling it provocative and seeking its reversal, the State Department said on Friday.
Pompeo made the comments in a call with Cypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides, the Department said, referring to Turkish Cypriot authorities partial reopening of the beach town of Varosha, a former resort area fenced off and abandoned in no-man's land since the 1974 invasion divided the island. 
""The Secretary expressed deep concern and noted such a move was provocative and inconsistent with UN Security Council Resolutions 550 and 789 and not conducive to a return to settlement talks,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
""The Secretary urges a reversal of the re-opening,"" she added. ""The United States continues to support a comprehensive settlement to reunify the island as a bizonal, bicommunal federation, which would benefit all Cypriots and the entire region.""

An affluent neighborhood of high rise hotels, residences and shops, Varosha's 39,000 Greek Cypriot residents fled in the second wave of an invasion mounted by Turkey in 1974 triggered by a brief Greek inspired coup. It was sealed off by the Turkish military, and effectively left to rot.

""We will stand up loudly and clearly for human rights all around the world, whether it is talking about the situation faced by the Uighurs, whether it is talking about the very concerning situation in Hong Kong, whether it's calling out China for its coercive diplomacy,"" Trudeau said in a news conference.
However, Trudeau added that he was not looking to escalate tensions with China.
A long-running diplomatic dispute heated up again this week when the Chinese government took issue with Trudeau's earlier comments, and on Thursday the Chinese envoy to Ottawa, Cong Peiwu, warned Canada against granting asylum to Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters.
Cong said the ""health and safety"" of the 300,000 Canadian passport holders in Hong Kong could be jeopardized by these ""violent criminals"" and so Canada should not protect them.
The diplomatic dispute stems from the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, a Chinese citizen, in Vancouver in late 2018 on a bank fraud warrant issued by U.S. authorities.
Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition in a Canadian court. Shortly after Meng's arrest, Beijing detained two Canadians on national security charges and halted imports of canola seed.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenian and Azeri forces fought new clashes on Friday, defying hopes of ending nearly three weeks of fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Turkey for inflaming the situation by arming the Azeris.
The worst outbreak of violence in the South Caucasus since Armenia and Azerbaijan went to war over the enclave in the 1990s, the fighting risks creating a humanitarian disaster, especially if it draws in Russia and Turkey.
Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but populated and governed by ethnic Armenians. 
Turkey has increased military exports sixfold this year to its close ally Azerbaijan. Russia is close to both sides but has a defence pact with Armenia. News agency RIA reported the Russian navy had started planned military exercises in the Caspian Sea. 
(Graphic: Ethnic tensions in Nagorno-Karabakh, https://graphics.reuters.com/ARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN/xklpyqoddpg/armenia-azerbaijan-2020_ethnic.jpg)
There were further signs on Friday that a Russian-brokered ceasefire agreed last Saturday to allow the sides to swap detainees and the bodies of those killed had all but broken down.
Armenia and Azerbaijan each accused the other of launching attacks, and each said it had the upper hand.
Armenian defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said Azerbaijan had conducted artillery bombardments of Nagorno-Karabakh from the north, ""with total disregard for the humanitarian truce"". He added that Azeri forces had been repelled and had suffered significant losses.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said Nagorno-Karabakh forces had been forced to retreat and Azeri forces retained the advantage along the line of contact that divides the sides.
Reuters could not independently verify these reports.
Baku also accused Yerevan of a missile attack on Ordubad in Nakhchivan autonomous province, a region which belongs to Azerbaijan but is surrounded by Armenia and Iran. Armenia denied such an attack.
The Nagorno-Karabakh defence ministry reported 29 more military casualties, bringing to 633 the number of servicemen killed since fighting broke out on Sept. 27. The region's ombudsman said civilian deaths now totalled 34.
Azerbaijan does not disclose military casualties. The Azeri prosecutor-general's office said 47 civilians had been killed and 222 wounded.
CRITICISM OF TURKEY 
The hostilities, close to pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry gas and oil to global markets, are stoking concern in Europe and the United States that Turkey and Russia, already at loggerheads over Syria and Libya, will be dragged in.
(Graphic: Turkey's arms exports to Azerbaijan surge, https://graphics.reuters.com/ARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN/TURKEY-ARMS/oakvenzyxpr/chart.png) 
Pompeo said Turkey had worsened the conflict, calling for a diplomatic resolution, rather than ""third-party countries coming in to lend their firepower to what is already a powder keg of a situation,"" he told broadcaster WSB Atlanta.
Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said Pompeo's remarks were not in line with official U.S. government statements on the conflict. 
""These remarks also do not correspond to the status of the United States as one of the co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group,"" it said, referring to the committee created by the OSCE security watchdog to mediate in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Ankara accuses Armenia of illegally occupying Azeri territory. Armenia says Turkey has encouraged Azerbaijan to pursue a military solution to the conflict, putting Armenian civilians in danger.
Armenia's foreign ministry said Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan had spoken by phone with United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, asking the international community to ""neutralise"" Azeri actions which he said posed ""an existential danger of the people of Nagorno-Karabakh"".
Meanwhile, Iran tweeted that its foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had offered the Azeri side Teheran's help with the peace process.
ECONOMIC DAMAGE 
The conflict between the two former Soviet republics threatens to further damage their economies, already hit by the COVID-19 pandemic and, in Azerbaijan's case, weak oil prices. 
With 43,280 COVID-19 cases, Azerbaijan said it would close secondary schools and shut the underground rail system in the capital Baku between Oct. 19 and Nov. 2. 
Armenia said on Friday its caseload had risen to 61,460.
In projections drafted before fighting started, the World Bank predicted Armenia's economy would shrink 6.3% this year, while expecting Azerbaijan to contract 4.2%.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - ""You have to thank Trump"" posters in Hebrew suddenly started appearing on minibuses in Tel Aviv this week, as Republican ads brought the race for the White House onto the streets of Israel.
Democrats are also targeting American-Israelis. They arranged a 40% discount with the courier service DHL for voters whose home states require overseas ballots to be sent by mail.
Votes everywhere are precious as the U.S. election approaches. Israel is in focus because many dual nationality American-Israelis are registered in swing states such as Florida and Pennsylvania, which could help decide the race.
There are no reliable statistics on American-Israelis' political leanings, but Marc Zell, chairman of Republicans Overseas Israel, estimated there were 25,000-30,000 eligible Florida voters in the country.
""That could be the deciding factor in that state's contest,"" he said, pointing to George W. Bush's narrow Florida victory in 2000, which handed him the election.
Republican President Donald Trump has had an outsized influence in Israel during his term in office, delighting many by recognising Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.
Meanwhile, Democratic candidate Joe Biden's supporters have sent election postcards to Israeli Democrats and independents from swing states, where, they say, around half of American-Israeli Democrats are registered.
""Trump has used Israel as a partisan football to serve his own constituencies, like Christian Evangelicals,"" Democrats Abroad Israel chair Heather Stone told Reuters.
Biden, she said, was ""a long-time friend of Israel who will help keep alive"" the vision of a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
BIDEN OR TRUMP
The parties' estimates of the number of eligible dual citizens resident in Israel range from 100,000 to 300,000. Some experts who track the information said it was likely to be more than 250,000.
Half a dozen American-Israeli voters interviewed by Reuters identified the coronavirus crisis, economic policy and candidates' stands on Israel as guiding their decisions.
One New York voter, Hezi Kugler, said he was voting for Biden to bring ""a return to decency and a restoration of integrity"" at the highest level of government.
""Trump has done some things that are good for Israeli interests, but his lack of global leadership has created an enormous vacuum in the region that is generally bad for Israel,"" said Kugler, 62, an energy industry professional in Tel Aviv.
In the Israeli city of Beit Shemesh, Republican David Wiener said Trump was the right choice because he approached thorny Middle East conflicts ""from a business perspective"".
Last month, Trump hosted a White House ceremony in which Israel, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed deals to establish formal relations.
""Gulf countries see Israel as an opportunity to expand their industries ... Trump took advantage of that with the UAE,"" said Wiener, 39, an aerospace engineer registered in Pennsylvania.
PALESTINIAN OUTREACH
Although the election is most visible in Israel, there are also many Palestinians eligible to vote.
The U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem has encouraged voting by both sides, hosting Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) live events with Arabic subtitles geared towards residents of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.
For Democrats Abroad, Stone said she was working with Palestinian activists in East Jerusalem and in the Palestinian diaspora to get out the vote. 
One East Jerusalem activist, Kefah Abukhdeir, said Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza face multiple barriers to sending votes abroad, including unreliable postal services that she called ""practically non-existent"".
""We haven't had much luck turning out voters here,"" she said.
In Gaza, where an estimated 300 American-Palestinians live, Kamal Abusharia said he hoped to vote for the first time since the early 1990s in part due to anger towards Trump.
But he held out little hope that Biden would reverse all of Trump's pro-Israeli moves were he to win. 

""I don't think that Biden would work to (return) the embassy (to Tel Aviv) or put the issue of Palestinian refugees back on the table,"" he said.

While Armenia's population is less than three million, overseas-based ethnic Armenians are estimated at around eight million.
Although the donations help to meet urgent needs such as medical aid and shelter, Armenians working or settled overseas have a long tradition of sending money back home. 
Such remittances accounted for around 11% of Armenia's annual output last year. Yet this year's coronavirus crisis caused a near 20% plunge in those funds, central bank data shows, even as the pandemic savages Armenia's tiny economy and defence spending mounts. 
(Graphic: Remittances to Armenia are down this year - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/oakvenajwpr/Capture.PNG) 
But the diaspora might still be coming to the rescue. More than $120 million has been raised for humanitarian needs since fighting erupted in late September, and donations are piling up, according to the website of the country's largest nonprofit, Hayastan All Armenian Fund.
This month, Kardashian, who visited Armenia last year, said she donated $1 million to the Los Angeles-based Armenia Fund, an independent nonprofit organisation aimed at funding humanitarian and infrastructure needs for Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.
Footballer Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who plays for Italy's AS Roma and is a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, has been active on Twitter, calling for donations and pleading with Russia, France and the United States to push for peace to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. 
Others are also stepping up, 
""The Armenian diaspora is very small, but our unity is our strength,"" said Derenik Grigorian, 26, an ethnic Armenian born and raised in London.
""This is a moment of unrest for Armenians, we're anxious from afar, but donating money is a way of reaching some internal peace, knowing we're helping our country defend itself and its people,"" Grigorian told Reuters on Twitter.
He said Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey and its own oil wealth, had far more financial and military muscle than his homeland. 
Turkey's military exports to Azerbaijan have risen six-fold this year, while the country has financial firepower from a $43.2 billion sovereign wealth fund.
Hopes that a humanitarian ceasefire would end fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh have faded as the death toll continues to rise.
Although Nagorno-Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan under international law, it is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians. 
RUSSIA ROLE
Russia has a defence pact with Armenia but has so far sought a peacemaking role, even brokering last Saturday's ceasefire. 
Russia is also one of the largest sources of remittances to Armenia, with the Hayastan All-Armenian Fund's website showing a large number of recent individual donations originating there.
Although remittances to Armenia recovered slightly in the second quarter, there are still concerns about its foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $2.7 billion at the end of August.
That was barely above the recommended minimum level of three months of external payments cover, said Beth Morrissey, managing partner of emerging markets-focused Kleiman International Consultants. 
On the plus side, Armenia this year received a financial boost from the IMF, which in May raised its funding for the country under a stand-by arrangement to $280 million, and from the European Union.
""From a fiscal perspective, Armenia is not well equipped,"" said Morrissey.
""For this year they are fine, but if the NK conflict drags on and the world is still without a COVID vaccine, securing adequate financing may become difficult in 2021.""
Azerbaijan however is in better fiscal shape and not so reliant on remittances, which comprise less than 3% of is economic output. But Azeri expats are also trying to help.

""What I am doing now is to organise mental support for those who lost their families and soldiers who became handicapped,"" said London-based business analyst Jeyla Alizada, 28.
""I know that people are sending whatever they can within Azerbaijan like warm clothes (and) cigarettes.""

440,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>","Brexit brinkmanship: Johnson says prepare for no-deal, cancels trade talks","By Guy Faulconbridge and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday it was now time to prepare for a no-trade deal Brexit unless the European Union fundamentally changed course, bluntly telling Brussels that there was no point in talking any more.
A tumultuous ""no deal"" finale to the United Kingdom's five-year Brexit crisis would sow chaos through the delicate supply chains that stretch across Britain, the EU and beyond - just as the economic hit from the coronavirus pandemic worsens.
At what was supposed to be the ""Brexit summit"" on Thursday, the EU delivered an ultimatum: it said it was concerned by a lack of progress and called on London to yield on key sticking points or see a rupture of ties with the bloc from Jan. 1.
""I have concluded that we should get ready for January 1 with arrangements that are more like Australia's based on simple principles of global free trade,"" Johnson said.
""With high hearts and with complete confidence, we will prepare to embrace the alternative and we will prosper mightily as an independent free trading nation, controlling and setting our own laws,"" he added.
EU heads of government, concluding a summit in Brussels on Friday, rushed to say that they wanted a trade deal and that talks would continue, though not at any price.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe's most powerful leader, said it would be best to get a deal and that compromises on both sides would be needed. French President Emmanuel Macron said Britain needed a Brexit deal more than the 27-nation EU. 
Johnson's spokesman said talks were now over and there was no point in the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier coming to London next week barring a change in approach. [L8N2H747X]
""The trade talks are over: the EU have effectively ended them by saying that they do not want to change their negotiating position,"" Johnson's spokesman said.
The pound oscillated to Brexit news, dropping a cent against the U.S. dollar on Johnson's remarks but then rising before falling again on his spokesman's comments.
RHETORIC?
After demanding that London make further concessions for a deal, EU diplomats and officials cast Johnson's move as little more than rhetoric, portraying it as a frantic bid to secure concessions before a last-minute deal was done.
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he thought Johnson had signalled that London was ready to compromise.
While U.S. investment banks agree that a deal is the most likely ultimate outcome, the consensus was wrong on the 2016 Brexit referendum: when Britons voted by 52-48% to leave, markets tumbled and European leaders were shocked.
Asked if he was walking away from talks, Johnson said: ""If there's a fundamental change of approach, of course we are always willing to listen, but it didn't seem particularly encouraging from the summit in Brussels.
""Unless there is a fundamental change of approach, we're going to go for the Australia solution. And we should do it with great confidence,"" he said.
A so-called ""Australia deal"" means that the United Kingdom would trade on World Trade Organization terms: as a country without an EU trade agreement, like Australia, tariffs would be imposed under WTO rules, likely causing significant price rises. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she was keen for a deal, though Macron was more downbeat.
""The state of our talks is not that we are stumbling over the issue of fishing, which is the British's tactical argument, but we're stumbling over everything. Everything,"" Macron said.
""The remaining 27 leaders of the EU, who chose to remain in the EU, are not there simply to make the British prime minister happy,"" he added.
Merkel called for Britain to compromise. ""This of course means that we, too, will need to make compromises,"" she said.
WTO TERMS 
Britain formally left the EU on Jan. 31, but the two sides have been haggling over a deal that would govern trade in everything from car parts to medicines when informal membership known as the transition period ends Dec. 31. 
Johnson had repeatedly asserted that his preference is for a deal but that Britain could make a success of a no-deal scenario, which would throw $900 billion in annual bilateral trade into uncertainty and could snarl the border, turning the southeastern county of Kent into a vast truck park.
The EU's 27 members, whose combined $18.4 trillion economy dwarfs the United Kingdom's $3 trillion economy, says progress had been made over recent months though compromise is needed.

Main sticking points remain fishing and the so-called level playing field - rules aimed at stopping a country gaining a competitive advantage over a trade partner.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. national security adviser said on Friday that China was perpetrating ""something close to"" a genocide with its treatment of Muslims in its Xinjiang region.
""If not a genocide, something close to it going on in Xinjiang,"" Robert O'Brien told an online event hosted by the Aspen Institute, while highlighting other Chinese crackdowns including one on Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement.
The United States has denounced China's treatment of Uighur and other minority Muslims in Xinjiang and imposed sanctions on officials it blames for abuses. It has not, though, so far termed Beijing's actions genocide, a designation that would have significant legal implications and require stronger action against China.
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslims have been detained in Xinjiang and activists say crimes against humanity and genocide are taking place there. China has denied any abuses and says its camps in the region provide vocational training and help fight extremism.
O'Brien referred to seizures by U.S. customs of ""massive numbers"" of hair products made with human hair from Xinjiang.
""The Chinese are literally shaving the heads of Uighur women and making hair products and sending them to the United States,"" he said.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said in June it had detained a shipment originating in Xinjiang of hair products and accessories suspected of being forced-labor products made with human hair.
In June, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo labeled as ""shocking"" and ""disturbing"" reports that China was using forced sterilization, forced abortion and coercive family planning against Muslims in Xinjiang.

He said last month Washington was considering the language it would use to describe what is happening in the region but added: ""When the United States speaks about crimes against humanity or genocide ... we've got to be very careful and very precise because it carries an enormous weight.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai police fired stinging liquid from water cannon at thousands of Thai protesters on Friday in the most violent escalation of three months of demonstrations against the government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.
Protesters, defying a government ban on gatherings for a second day, pushed back against helmeted police who advanced with batons and riot shields.
Youth-led protests have grown into the biggest challenge in years to a political establishment dominated by military figures and the Royal Palace of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
""The dictatorial government is using violence to disperse the people's movement,"" said Tattep Ruangprapaikitseree, one of the protest leaders.
The king has made no direct comment on the protests, but in comments broadcast on state television, he said Thailand ""needs people who love the country and love the monarchy"".
Until now, police had not used major force to suppress peaceful protests that have drawn tens of thousands of people, although more than 40 demonstrators - including several leaders - have been arrested in the past week.
The government banned political gatherings of more than five people on Thursday. ""We've issued warnings against illegal acts,"" police spokesman Yingyot Thepchamnong told reporters.
Reuters journalists said water turned on the protesters contained chemicals making them sting. Organisers told protesters to disperse more than three hours after they gathered.
""I am not afraid for myself. I fear more for the future of the country,"" said one protester Poom, 31, who did not want to give his full name. 
'NOT QUITTING'
Prayuth first took power as army chief in a 2014 coup. Critics say he engineered a general election last year to keep hold of power as a civilian prime minister. 
He says the election was fair. 
Protesters also want a new constitution, to replace one drafted under military rule.
""I'm not quitting,"" Prayuth told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting, adding that emergency measures would be in force for up to 30 days. 
Calls have also built up among protesters for reforms to the monarchy, which is accused by protesters of helping to entrench decades of military influence in politics.
The only specific incident cited by the government for the imposition of emergency measures was one in which Queen Suthida's motorcade was jeered, but it also said protests were damaging the economy and national security.
Police said on Friday that two men would be charged with attempted violence against the queen, which carries a possible death sentence if her life is thought to have been threatened. Even if not, the charge can mean life in jail.
The office of the United Nations' High Commissioner said it was concerned about the situation in Thailand, especially the application of serious charges, including sedition, against people peacefully exercising their rights.
Thai parliamentary opposition parties condemned the emergency measures.

""Pheu Thai Party calls on General Prayuth Chan-ocha and the state officials to lift the emergency decree and to stop intimidating the people in all manners and to release those who were arrested immediately,"" said the party, which has the most seats in parliament.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Belarus said on Friday it was seeking the arrest of exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya for jeopardising national security, days after she called for a general strike if the president does not yield to protesters' demands to quit.
Ahead of the next big weekly protest on Sunday, a senior police official said on television that officers would use firearms if needed against demonstrators, raising the stakes in the standoff over a country closely allied with Russia.
""We will of course humanely use weapons against them, including firearms, and we will remove the most dangerous (ones) from the streets,"" said Nikolai Karpenkov, head of the police unit tasked with fighting organised crime and corruption.
Tsikhanouskaya fled to neighbouring Lithuania shortly after disputing the results of an Aug. 9 election which gave victory to longtime leader Alexander Lukashenko. She had challenged him at the ballot box in place of her husband after he was arrested.
While her supporters have continued holding mass protests despite crackdowns by police and thousands of arrests, she has been urging European political leaders to mediate.
On Tuesday, Tsikhanouskaya set an Oct. 25 deadline for Lukashenko to quit or face nationwide strikes that would paralyse the country after the security forces first threatened to use combat weapons in the streets.
The Belarus Investigative Committee, a law enforcement agency, said it had put Tsikhanouskaya on its wanted list for publicly calling for actions seeking to harm national security. 
Lithuanian President Gitanas Nausėda condemned the move and called on fellow members of the European Union to stand by her.
""Do hope that #EU countries will remain united & ignore this illegal warrant. #Tsikhanouskaya may be wanted in Belarus but #EU should keep all doors open for her,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Security forces have detained more than 13,000 people during a post-election crackdown, some of whom have been later freed. Lukashenko's key political opponents are either in jail or have fled abroad.
""This (move to put Tsikhanouskaya on the wanted list) doesn't surprise anyone. It's clear the regime has no legal ways of retaining power,"" said Anna Krasulina, a spokeswoman for the opposition leader.
Tsikhanouskaya met for talks in Vilnius on Friday with Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne. She also took to social media to urge Belarusians to vote against any proposals put forward by Lukashenko for constitutional reform. 

Lukashenko has proposed changing the constitution to resolve the political crisis in Belarus, an idea backed by Russia. But Lukashenko's critics see the proposals as part of a stalling tactic to take the sting out of their protests.

Vincenzo De Luca, the forthright head of the southern Campania region centred on Naples, said via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Friday that a shutdown would begin at 10 p.m. on that night.
""Halloween is this huge stupidity. A huge American stupidity which we have imported into our country,"" he posted. 
Nov. 1 is a holiday in Italy to mark All Saints Days and U.S.-style Halloween parties the night before have only recently become popular here.
Campania has seen a sharp spike in COVID-19 cases this month and De Luca, a centre-left politician, announced on Thursday he was closing schools in his region for two weeks.

Famous in Italy for his colourful comments, De Luca threatened to send police with flamethrowers to break up student parties as the initial epidemic raged in March. He was re-elected to his post in September with almost 70% of the vote.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - While China probably is not ready to invade Taiwan for now, the island needs to ""fortify itself"" against a future attack or any bid to isolate it through nonmilitary means, such as an embargo, the White House national security adviser said on Friday.
""I think Taiwan needs to start looking at some asymmetric and anti-access area denial strategies,"" Robert O'Brien told an online Aspen Institute forum. ""And really fortify itself in a manner that would deter the Chinese from any sort of amphibious invasion or even a gray zone operation against them.""
He described a gray zone operation as one that would involve isolating Taiwan by economic measures or some kind of embargo.
Rising tensions over Taiwan have led some analysts to speculate China might be tempted to take advantage of a possibly chaotic result of the hotly contested U.S. election to make good on a long-standing vow to reunite the island with the mainland, by force if necessary.
Asked if he was concerned that China could launch an amphibious invasion of Taiwan or employ nonmilitary means to subdue the island, O'Brien said he did not think ""the Chinese probably at this point want or likely are prepared for an amphibious landing.""
""It would be a hard operation for the Chinese to do"" and Beijing would have to consider how the United States would respond, he said. ""If we got involved, that can make that a very dangerous effort for the Chinese to engage in.""
China could use its massive missile force to ""annihilate"" Taiwan, ""but I don't know what they would gain from that,"" he said.
The ""entire free world"" and most of the Asia-Pacific region would be ""repelled"" if China employed an embargo or other ""gray zone"" methods to isolate Taiwan and the country would end up isolating itself internationally, he said.

SENEKAL, South Africa (Reuters) - White South African farmers and Black protesters hurled abuse and threats at each other on Friday during a court hearing in a murder case that has exposed still simmering racial tensions 26 years after the end of apartheid.
The killing of Brendan Horner, a white man whose body was found tied to a pole at his farm in Free State province, sparked riots at the start of this month, and prompted President Cyril Ramaphosa to make an appeal to South Africans to ""resist attempts... to mobilise communities along racial lines"".
The farmers outside the courthouse in the central town of Senekal accused the government of failing to protect them from violent crime, while their opponents, from the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), complained about what they see as the continued domination of South Africa's economy by whites.
""We are getting tired now of all the farm murders,"" said Geoffrey Marais, 30, a livestock trader from Delmas, where a woman was strangled to death two weeks ago.
""Enough is enough. They (the government) must start to prioritise these crimes.""
The EFF's firebrand leader Julius Malema sat inside the courtroom to show support for the two murder suspects who filed a request for bail during Friday's hearing. The judge adjourned the case until Oct. 20.
""I'm here because of white people... taking advantage of us,"" said EFF supporter Khaya Langile, who came from the Johannesburg township of Soweto to join the rally.
NO VIOLENCE
Police separated the two groups with razor wire in one street, but despite the noisy standoff there was no violence.
""There have been indications of tensions but by and large all of them (the rival groups) took a decision that they did not want to see violence. That is a good thing,"" State Security minister Ayanda Dlodlo said outside the court.
The farmers mostly wore khaki shirts and shorts, a few wore military outfits, and at least one was armed. A group on motorbikes sporting long beards drove through Senekal, a trading town surrounded by dry, hilly countryside, some waving flags emblazoned with crosses.
The supporters of the EFF, which represents poor Black South Africans who feel left out of the country's post-apartheid prosperity, wore their trademark red shirts and berets.
Murders of white farmers make up a tiny fraction of the total in South Africa, which has the world's fifth highest murder rate. In the 2019/20 financial year there were 21,325 murders across the country, of which 49 were white farmers, according to police statistics.
The farmers also feel threatened by a government plan to expropriate white-owned land without compensation as part of an effort to redress economic inequalities that remain stark a quarter of a century after the end of apartheid.

Roughly 70% of privately-owned farmland in South Africa is owned by whites, who make up less than 9% of the country's population of 58 million.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Hong Kong air traffic controllers told Taiwan there was danger until further notice on a flight path to Taiwanese-controlled islands in the South China Sea, Taipei said on Friday, a case that has raised fears Beijing may try and blockade the islets.
Tensions over the Pratas Islands, in the northern part of the contested South China Sea, have spiked in recent weeks, with China carrying out several military exercises near them. The Pratas are only lightly defended by Chinese-claimed Taiwan.
On Thursday, Taiwan said a regular civilian charter flight had to abandon its trip to the Pratas when Hong Kong air traffic controllers told the captain there were ""dangerous activities"" happening below 26,000 feet and the aircraft could not enter.
Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said they had told Taiwan air traffic controllers of the minimum safe altitude to be observed for the flight, and that Taiwan had then responded that they had cancelled the request to enter the Hong Kong flight information region.
But late on Friday Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration published a full transcript of the conversation between the air traffic controllers.
""The danger area is, eh, now on until further notice,"" the Hong Kong controller says, declining to answer a question on whether there were military exercises happening.
Asked whether there was a NOTAM, or ""notice to airmen"" filed to alert aircraft pilots of potential hazards, the Hong Kong controller responds: ""eh, no"".
Then asked whether to confirm they would not allow the flight in, the Hong Kong controller says: ""Affirmative, the altitude is not safe for danger after Hong Kong at this level"".
Finally, when asked when the flight could proceed to the Pratas Islands, the Hong Kong controller answers: ""OK, Hong Kong is not able to advise right now, we'll let you know"".
Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department said it had nothing to add beyond its initial statement.
The Pratas flights carry mainly Taiwan defence and coast guard personnel.
Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters on Friday they were trying to find out whether China was behind the move.
The Civil Aviation Administration of China did not answer questions submitted by Reuters. 
Johnny Chiang, leader of Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang party, asked on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page whether China had just dangerously ramped up the stakes.
""Does this mean that the Communist's military has already begun joint blockade war operations in addition to regular exercises and intrusions?""

DRAMA, Greece (Reuters) - A Greek university student with disabilities has achieved her lifelong ambition of reaching the summit of Mount Olympus, Greece's highest peak strapped to the back of a friend.
Eleftheria Tosiou, who has been wheelchair-bound all her life, was carried to the summit on Oct. 5 mainly by Marios Giannakou, a long-distance endurance runner who has already scaled the 2,917-metre high mountain about 50 times.
Two other friends helped carry Tosiou some of the way but Giannakou covered the most difficult stretches, including the final approach to the summit.
""The feelings were very intense,"" said Tosiou, 22, who is a biology student and a fan of extreme sports. ""I was happy, I was moved... In the end it was most intense when we came down, and realised what we had done,"" she said.
Tosiou and Giannakou, 28, both from the northern Greek town of Drama, met for the first time in September through a mutual friend and she told him of her dream.
With winter approaching, Giannakou, who has run ultramarathons and endurance races in places as diverse as the Arctic and the desert, had to move fast to assemble a small team before the onset of snow.
""There were many difficulties. It was a project that was taking place for the first time. We had to organise a big team of people,"" said Giannakou, who carried Tosiou in a modified backpack.
""But the most difficult part was the psychological one. A man lost his life there a day before.""
Scaling Mount Olympus, known in ancient Greece as the seat of the gods, is not for the faint-hearted. Its jagged peaks earned it the moniker 'the throne of Zeus', and those who make the climb speak of its very steep inclines and slippery rocks.
""There was some fear because there were cliffs to my front, and to my back, but there was not real fear that we couldn't make it,"" Tosiou said. 
The achievement drew the attention of Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis who congratulated both through a video call.

""I have never done something more beautiful,"" said Giannakou. ""I think it has completed me as a person.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain put more of northwest England into the highest COVID alert level on Friday in the face of rising case numbers as Prime Minister Boris Johnson bids to contain a second wave of infections through local measures.
Johnson will hold a news conference on the pandemic after the restrictions were announced for Lancashire but as other northern leaders resist extra lockdown measures without more financial support.
From Saturday, Lancashire will face the toughest restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, including the closure of pubs.
Cases have surged in the region that is home to towns such as Burnley, Blackburn, Blackpool and Preston, forcing Lancashire into the very high alert level of Tier 3, along with nearby Liverpool and Merseyside.
As a second wave of the pandemic mounts, Johnson's government has pursued a tiered approach to shut down local regions with surging cases, in the hope it can allow the least-affected areas to remain open to protect the economy.
That has sparked anger by some local leaders in northern England like Greater Manchester, who say the government has not offered enough financial support to businesses which are having to close.
On Friday, more data suggested that England was still seeing a sharp rise in cases. The Office for National Statistics' Infection Survey said there was an average of 27,900 new cases per day in the latest week.
The ONS said there had been a 50% increase in infections compared to the previous week and that infections in the North West continued to grow while cases in the North East were levelling off.

While infections in England are still rising sharply, the survey did imply a slowdown in the spread of the coronavirus compared to the previous week, which was backed up by an estimated growth rate of the pandemic published by the government.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Supporters of Pakistan opposition parties were converging on a stadium in the city of Gujwanwala on Friday to begin a countrywide protest campaign to oust Prime Minister Imran Khan, who they accuse of being installed by the military in a rigged 2018 election.
Nine major opposition parties formed a joint platform called the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) last month to begin a nationwide agitation against the government.
Khan, who came to power on an anti-graft platform and denies the army helped him win, said on Friday he wasn't afraid of the opposition's campaign, which was aimed at blackmailing him to drop corruption cases against their leaders.
""We have come out for the supremacy of the law,"" said Maryam Nawaz, the daughter and political heir of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, speaking from atop an SUV that was showered with rose petals as she left for Gujwanwala from nearby Lahore.
""Our struggle is against injustice, unemployment and all-time price hikes.""
Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) is the main opposition party.
Sharif, a long-standing critic of the military, was sacked by the Supreme Court in 2017 on corruption charges and left for London last November for medical treatment. He blames generals and judges for what he says were trumped up charges.
Pakistan's powerful military has repeatedly denied meddling in politics.
The protest campaign comes at a time when Pakistan is experiencing an economic crisis, with inflation touching double digits and negative growth. The next general election is scheduled for 2023.
""Go Imran go. Your time is up!"" shouted tens of thousands of the opposition supporters gathered at the Gujwanwala stadium hours before the leaders arrived. 
Bilawal Bhutto, the son of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto who heads her Pakistan People's Party (PPP), and a religious leader, Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman, were leading separate rallies to join the main gathering.
""The time has come for the puppet government to go,"" said Bhutto.

MANILA (Reuters) - Jailed Philippine activist Reina Mae Nasino wanted to hold her three-month-old daughter for the last time before she was laid to rest on Friday but she could not.
Heavily armed prison officials guarding her refused to uncuff her despite pleas from her family and human rights supporters, who have decried what they described as inhumane treatment of Nasino and other mothers in Philippine jails. 
""We were denied the chance to be together. I did not even see your laughter,"" said the 23-year-old Nasino, who was seen crying in front of her daughter River's tiny white coffin.
A local court granted Nasino a three-day furlough to attend the wake and funeral of her daughter.
Nasino, a member of the urban poverty group Kadamay, was arrested in November 2019 with two others for unlawful possession of firearms - charges she said were trumped up and part of a crackdown against left-leaning activists.
In April, she petitioned the Supreme Court to release her from jail on humanitarian grounds amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
Nasino gave birth while in jail in July, but her baby was removed from her care and brought to her mother in August. The following month, her baby became sick and was hospitalised, prompting calls for mother and child to be reunited. 
Wearing a full-body personal protective equipment suit while standing in the heat of the sun, Nasino told her baby: ""I hope we will be the last to experience this.""
The solemn occasion turned chaotic as police officers in camouflage uniforms dispersed the funeral procession and told the hearse carrying the coffin to speed up, forcing mourners to run after the vehicle.
""I thought we would have a proper burial with family and friends, but I was traumatised. My other daughter nearly fainted while chasing the car,"" said Nasino's mother, Marites. 

""I am so angry that we could not even give my grandchild a proper procession and we could not even play the music she liked.""

More than 150 people from Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and South Sudan, including 15 children under 18 years old, flew to Niger later on Thursday where they are now in quarantine, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) said. 
Both UNHCR and the U.N. migration agency IOM have called for Libya, torn apart by years of war and chaos, to be classed as an unsafe port for migrants. 
The country has long been a stepping stone for migrants seeking to make the often dangerous sea voyage to Europe. 
The UNHCR spokesman said at a weekly briefing that nearly all the migrants who were evacuated on Thursday had experienced arbitrary detention while in Libya. More than 3,400 migrants and asylum seekers remain in government detention centres at risk of abuse, he added.
The U.N.'s Libya mission on Thursday also welcomed the announcement by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) this week that it had detained an alleged people smuggler. [nL8N2H56BG]

453,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 08:30AM ET</span>",Factbox: Why are Nigerians protesting against police brutality?,"By Libby George
LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerians protesting police brutality have hit the streets across Africa's most populous nation for more than a week, and the hashtag #EndSARS trended on Twitter even after the police promised to dismantle the controversial unit on Oct. 11. What is SARS, what attempts have been made to address police abuses in Nigeria and what do protesters want? 
WHAT WAS 'SARS'?
* Police formed the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) in 1992 to tackle violent crime such as car-jackings, armed robbery and kidnapping. Because SARS was initially designed as a covert force, officers did not wear uniforms - a practice known locally as ""mufti"". 
* The unit developed a reputation for brutality, with Amnesty International https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/AFR4448682016ENGLISH.PDF accusing it of harassment, extortion, rape, extrajudicial killings and torture. Nigerians said it frequently targeted young men with tattoos, dreadlocks or expensive cars or phones. 
* The police force has repeatedly denied the accusations against SARS, though it said earlier this month that ""unruly and unprofessional"" officers had been arrested and were facing disciplinary actions. 
WHAT SPARKED THE CURRENT PROTESTS?
* A video allegedly showing SARS officers shooting a man in Delta state before driving off in his car began circulating in early October, sparking the current protests. Police denied the incident. 
* Police responded to protests with force initially, including tear gas, water cannons and live rounds. At least two were killed in Lagos and at least three killed in Oyo state https://twitter.com/seyiamakinde/status/1316087370689769472. Amnesty International has said at least 10 were killed nationwide. 
HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?
* Police initially banned SARS from routine patrols and ordered them to wear uniforms. After continued protests, police disbanded SARS with immediate effect on Oct. 11.
* President Muhammadu Buhari pledged police reform, and a federal council ordered states to set up compensation funds for victims of police brutality.
* On Oct. 13, police announced that a new Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team would ""fill the gaps arising from the dissolution of the defunct SARS"".
* Authorities in Abuja said protests were banned due to coronavirus concerns, and in Lagos, videos are circulating on Tiwtter of men armed with knives, clubs and other weapons attacking demonstrators. 
WHY ARE PROTESTERS SCEPTICAL
* The government has pledged to reform, disband or investigate SARS on multiple occasions, including a promised 2017 Senate investigation https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-police-idUSKBN1DZ2WE and a 2018 overhaul and investigation https://fr.reuters.com/article/us-nigeria-police-idUSKBN1KZ217. 
* Nigerians and observers say little changed. Protesters say SWAT teams could simply become SARS under a new name, and now they carry #EndSwat signs. 
WHAT DO PROTESTERS WANT
* Protesters have five main demands: 
* Immediate release of all arrested protesters; 
* ""Justice"" for those killed by police and compensation for their families; 
* An independent body to investigate and prosecute police misconduct within 10 days of a claim; 
* Independent psychological evaluation of disbanded SARS officers before they can be redeployed; 
* Increased salaries for police so they are ""adequately compensated"" for protecting lives and property.

CONAKRY (Reuters) - Armed men attacked a military base in western Guinea overnight, killing the camp's commander, the defence minister said on Friday, two days before the West African country votes in a bitterly-disputed presidential election. 
Defence Minister Mohamed Diané provided few details about the attack in the city of Kindia, about 85 km (53 miles) outside the capital Conakry, but said in a statement that the situation was now under control.
The timing of the incident is likely to raise alarm. Voters head to the polls on Sunday to decide whether to award President Alpha Conde a third term in office, following a campaign marred by violence and divisive appeals to ethnic identities.
Diané identified the commander who was killed as Mamady Condé, who led a battalion of commandos at the Somoreyah base. 
A security source, who asked not to be named, said the assailants were dressed in military attire and seized arms and vehicles before fleeing the scene. 
Kindia residents said a prison in the city was also attacked, wounding an official there and allowing several inmates to escape.
Conde's candidacy for a third term after 10 years in power has drawn fierce criticism from his opponents, who say it violates the constitution.
Conde, 82, says he has the right to run again under a new constitution approved by referendum in March, arguing that it resets the clock on the two-term limit. 
About 30 people were killed in protests before and after the referendum, and several people have been injured in clashes during the campaign between supporters of rival candidates. 
Two days before the March referendum, gunfire broke out on a military base in Conakry, but it did not affect the vote.
Guinea is Africa's top producer of bauxite, an aluminium ore, and export disruptions are likely around the election, said Eric Humphery-Smith, an analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft.

455,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 08:11AM ET</span>","For Iraq's persecuted Yazidis, return plan is fraught with risk","By Kawa Omar and Charlottle Bruneau
DOHUK, Iraq (Reuters) - The Yazidis of northern Iraq, an ancient religious minority brutally persecuted by Islamic State, want nothing more than peace, security and a better life in their home town of Sinjar - but they want it on their terms.
Many there distrust a new security and reconstruction plan unveiled this week by the Baghdad government and Kurdish regional authorities which hailed it as a ""historic"" agreement.
""The deal could pacify Sinjar - but it might also make the situation even worse,"" said Talal Saleh, a Yazidi in exile in nearby Kurdistan.
The Yazidis have suffered since IS marauded into Sinjar in 2014, one of the Sunni extremist group's conquests that shocked the West into military action to stop it.
IS viewed the Yazidis as devil worshippers for their faith that combines Zoroastrian, Christian, Manichean, Jewish and Muslim beliefs. 
It slaughtered more than 3,000 Yazidis, enslaved 7,000 women and girls and displaced most of its 550,000-strong community.
Since Islamic State was driven out of Sinjar by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces in 2015, the town and its surrounding areas are controlled by a patchwork of armed groups including the Iraqi army, Shi'ite Muslim militia, and Yazidi and Kurdish militants with different loyalties.
The government plan would enforce security and allow the return of tens of thousands of Yazidis afraid to go back because of a lack of security and basic services, according to the office of Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi.
But many Sinjar natives feel the plan is vague, dictated by Baghdad and the Kurdish capital of Erbil. They say it has not included them and entails security reforms that could mean more division and violence.
""The PKK and their Yazidi allies are not just going to leave Sinjar without a fight,"" Saleh said.
The security arrangements include booting out the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group that has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey and bases itself in northern Iraq.
It would also drive out PKK ""affiliates"", an apparent reference to a Yazidi force of hundreds of fighters.
ESCAPE
The PKK with Yazidi volunteers helped thousands of Yazidis escape the IS onslaught to Syria after the Iraqi army fled many areas of Nineveh province and Erbil's peshmerga forces retreated.
The peshmerga returned to help recapture Sinjar‮ ‬with U.S. air support.
The PKK is under attack by Turkish forces in Iraq and exists uneasily alongside the peshmerga and the Iraqi army.
The army and the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), Iraq's state paramilitary body dominated by Shi'ite militias, would oversee the ejection of the PKK, according to a copy the plan seen by Reuters.
Some locals fear this could split up families where siblings sometimes belong to different militias, forces and groups. The Yazidis also have their own force in the PMF, separate to the Yazidi PKK affiliate.
""There are about six political groups in Sinjar now. Brothers belonging to the same family each join different parties,"" said Akram Rasho, another displaced Yazidi in Kurdistan.
Baghdad and Erbil defend the plan.
""This is a good step to solve problems,"" said Kurdistan government spokesman Jotiar Adil.
Sinjar has also been caught up in a territorial dispute between Baghdad and Erbil since a failed Kurdish bid for full independence in 2017.
Under the plan for Sinjar, the Baghdad and Erbil governments would choose a new mayor and administrators and appoint 2,500 new local security personnel.
Supporters of the PKK suspect those would include returning Yazidis affiliated with the peshmerga.
At a demonstration against the deal in Sinjar on Sunday, Yazidi tribal leader Shamo Khadida shouted, ""Sinjar belongs to its people and we are the people.""
Others distance themselves from the politics and simply want to see delivery of services on the ground.

""If actual efforts are made to improve our situation, the people of Sinjar will find agreement,"" said Rasho.

The New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) accord, signed in 2010, limits the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers that Russia and the United States can deploy. [nL8N2H5387]
A failure to extend the pact would remove all constraints on U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, fueling a post-Cold War arms race and tensions between Moscow and Washington.
Putin, speaking at a meeting by video link with Russia's Security Council that was broadcast on state television, said the treaty had worked effectively until now and it would be ""extremely sad"" if it were to stop working. 
""In this regard, I propose... extending the current treaty without any conditions for at least a year so that meaningful negotiations can be conducted on all the parametres of the problems..."" he said.

Israel this week approved more than 1,300 new settler homes in the West Bank, bringing to a total of over 4,000 the number of such homes that are in the pipeline, according to an Israeli settlement watchdog.
""We are deeply concerned by the decision taken by the Israeli authorities to advance more than 4,900 settlement building units in the occupied West Bank,"" the joint statement said.
""The expansion of settlements violates international law and further imperils the viability of a two-state solution to bring about a just and lasting peace to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" it said.
Most countries view settlements Israel has built in territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal and as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. The United States and Israel dispute this.

The Palestinians hope to build part of a future state in the West Bank, while Israel cites historical and biblical links to the area and around 450,000 of its settlers live there, among 3 million Palestinians.

458,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 07:41AM ET</span>","Special Report: Why 4,998 died in U.S. jails without getting their day in court","By Peter Eisler, Linda So, Jason Szep, Grant Smith and Ned Parker
CANTON, Mississippi (Reuters) - Harvey Hill wouldn’t leave John Finnegan’s front yard. He stood in the pouring rain, laughing at the sky, alarming his former boss' wife. Finnegan dialed 911.
“He needs a mental evaluation,” the landscaper recalls telling the arriving officer. Instead, Hill was charged with trespassing and jailed on suspicion of a misdemeanor offense that could bring a $500 fine.
It was a death sentence.
The next day, May 6, 2018, Hill’s condition worsened. He flew into a rage at the Madison County Detention Center in Canton, Mississippi, throwing a checkerboard and striking a guard with a lunch tray.
Three guards tackled the 36-year-old, pepper sprayed him and kicked him repeatedly in the head. After handcuffing him, two guards slammed Hill into a concrete wall, previously unpublished jail surveillance video shows. They led him to a shower, away from the cameras, and beat him again, still handcuffed, a state investigation found. The guards said Hill was combative, exhibiting surprising strength that required force.
Video showed Hill writhing in pain in the infirmary, where he was assessed by a licensed practical nurse but not given medication. Mississippi law dictates that a doctor or higher credentialed nurse make decisions on medical interventions. But Hill was sent straight to an isolation cell, where a guard pinned him to the floor, removed his handcuffs, and left him lying on the cement. Hill crawled to the toilet. Then he stopped moving.
No one checked him for 46 minutes. When they did, he didn’t have a pulse. Within hours, he was dead. And he had a lot of company.
Hill’s is one of 7,571 inmate deaths Reuters documented in an unprecedented examination of mortality in more than 500 U.S. jails from 2008 to 2019. Death rates have soared in those lockups, rising 35% over the decade ending last year. Casualties like Hill are typical: held on minor charges and dying without ever getting their day in court. At least two-thirds of the dead inmates identified by Reuters, 4,998 people, were never convicted of the charges on which they were being held.
Unlike state and federal prisons, which hold people convicted of serious crimes, jails are locally run lockups meant to detain people awaiting arraignment or trial, or those serving short sentences. The toll of jail inmates who die without a case resolution subverts a fundamental tenet of the U.S. criminal justice system: innocent until proven guilty.
“A lot of people are dying and they've never been sentenced, and that's obviously a huge problem,” said Nils Melzer, the United Nations’ special rapporteur on torture and other inhuman punishment, after reviewing the Reuters findings. “You have to provide due process in all of these cases, you have to provide humane detention conditions in all of these cases and you have to provide medical care in all of these cases.”
The U.S. Constitution grants inmates core rights, but those provisions are hard to enforce. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees fair treatment to pre-trial detainees, but “fair” is open to interpretation by judges and juries. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel punishment forbids “deliberate indifference to serious medical needs of prisoners,” but proving deliberate negligence is difficult. The Sixth Amendment assures speedy trials, but does not define speedy.
The Reuters analysis revealed a confluence of factors that can turn short jail stays into death sentences. Many jails are not subject to any enforceable standards for their operation or the healthcare they provide. They typically get little if any oversight. And bail requirements trap poorer inmates in pre-trial detention for long periods. Meanwhile, inmate populations have grown sicker, more damaged by mental illness and plagued by addictions.
The 7,571 deaths identified by Reuters reflect those stresses. Most succumbed to illness, sometimes wanting for quality healthcare. More than 2,000 took their own lives amid mental breakdowns, including some 1,500 awaiting trial or indictment. A growing number – more than 1 in 10 last year – died from the acute effects of drugs and alcohol. Nearly 300 died after languishing behind bars, unconvicted, for a year or more.
As with much of the U.S. criminal justice system, the toll behind bars falls disproportionately on Black Americans, such as Hill. White inmates accounted for roughly half the fatalities. African Americans accounted for at least 28%, more than twice their share of the U.S. population, a disparity on par with the high incarceration rate of Blacks. Reuters was not able to identify the race of 9% of inmates who died.
Jail deaths typically draw attention locally but escape scrutiny from outside authorities, a gap in oversight that points to a national problem: America’s system for counting and monitoring jail deaths is broken.
A BROKEN SYSTEM OF FEDERAL OVERSIGHT
America’s 3,000-plus jails are typically run by county sheriffs or local police. They often are under-equipped and understaffed, starved for funds by local officials who see them as budgetary burdens. A rising share have contracted their healthcare to private companies.
Yet there are no enforceable national standards to ensure jails meet constitutional requirements for inmate health and safety. Only 28 states have adopted their own standards to fill the gap. And much of the oversight that does exist is limited by a curtain of secrecy.
The Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics has collected inmate mortality data for two decades – but statistics for individual jails are withheld from the public, government officials and oversight agencies under a 1984 law limiting the release of BJS data. Agency officials say that discretion is critical because it encourages sheriffs and police to report their deaths data each year.
The secrecy has a cost: Local policy makers can’t learn if their jails’ death rates are higher than those in similar communities. Groups that advocate for inmates’ rights can’t get jail-by-jail mortality data to support court cases. The Justice Department’s own lawyers, charged with taking legal action when corrections facilities violate constitutional standards, can’t readily identify jails where high death counts warrant federal investigation.
“If there’s a high death rate, that means there’s a problem,” said Julie Abbate, former deputy chief of the Justice Department’s Special Litigation Section, which enforces civil rights in jails. Publicizing those rates “would make it a lot harder to hide a bad jail.”
The Justice Department does issue broad statistical reports on statewide or national trends. But even those fatality numbers don’t always tell the full story.
Some jails fail to inform BJS of deaths. Some report them inaccurately, listing homicides or suicides as accidents or illnesses, Reuters found. Justice Department consultant Steve Martin, who has inspected more than 500 U.S. prisons and jails, said that in all the cases he's investigated, he recalls only one homicide being reported accurately. The others were categorized as “medical, respiratory failure, or whatever,” he said.
Other jails find other ways to keep deaths off the books, such as “releasing” inmates who have been hospitalized in grave condition, perhaps from a suicide attempt or a medical crisis, so they’re not on the jail’s roster when they die. Sheriffs sometimes characterize these as “compassionate releases” that allow inmates’ families a chance to spend their final hours together without law enforcement supervision.
In all, Reuters identified at least 59 cases across 39 jails in which inmate deaths were not reported to government agencies or included in tallies provided to the news organization.
The Justice Department has grown more secretive about the fatality data under the Trump administration. While BJS never has released jail-by-jail mortality figures, it traditionally has published aggregated statistics every two years or so. The 2016 report wasn't issued until this year.
And, a Justice spokesman said, there are “no plans” to issue any future reports containing even aggregated data on inmate deaths in jails or prisons.
The report delays are “an outrage,” said Representative Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat who co-authored the original reporting law in 2000 with a Republican colleague. Scott said secrecy was never the goal. He co-authored a 2014 update, which restricts federal grant money when jails don’t report deaths and shifts data collection to a different Justice Department agency that would not be restricted from releasing jail-by-jail data. The updated law has yet to be implemented.
“The whole point,” Scott said, “is we suspect a lot of the deaths are preventable with certain protocols – better suicide protocols, better healthcare, better guard-to-prisoner ratios. You’ve got to have information at the jail level. You have no way of really targeting corrective action if you don’t.”
Because the government won’t release jail-by-jail death data, Reuters compiled its own. The news organization tracked jail deaths over the dozen years from 2008 to 2019 to create the largest such database outside of the Justice Department. Reporters filed more than 1,500 records requests to obtain information about deaths in 523 U.S. jails – every jail with an average population of 750 or more inmates, and the 10 largest jails or jail systems in nearly every state. Together, those jails hold an average of some 450,000 inmates a day, or about three out of every five nationwide.
Reuters is making the full data it gathered available to the public https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-jails-graphic
One finding: Since the last Justice Department report, for 2016, the death rate in big jails has continued to climb, leaving it up 8% in 2019, the highest point in the 12-year period of 2008-2019 examined by Reuters. In that time, the suicide rate declined as many facilities launched suicide awareness and response initiatives. But the death rate from drug and alcohol overdoses rose about 72% amid the opioid epidemic.
The data also reveals scores of big jails with high death tolls, including two dozen with death rates double the national average.
Such data “would have actually been very helpful for enforcement purposes,” said Jonathan Smith, who ran the Justice Department’s Special Litigation Section from 2010 to 2015.
RARE SCRUTINY, REFORM
Detailed insight into jail deaths can save lives.
In 2016, the Justice Department began investigating the Hampton Roads Regional Jail in Portsmouth, Virginia, after state Attorney General Mark Herring and local civil rights groups called for a probe following several inmate deaths. Reuters found the jail, which serves five jurisdictions, averaged 3.5 deaths per thousand inmates over the years 2009 to 2019, more than double the national average of 1.5 deaths.
In December 2018, the Justice Department said the 900-bed jail violated inmates’ rights by failing to provide adequate medical and mental healthcare. The regional authority that manages the jail agreed to a “consent decree,” enforced by a federal judge, to ensure improved treatment of prisoners.
Inmate deaths dropped after the agreement, which required increased staffing, better training and enhanced medical services. The jail reported two fatalities in 2019 and one through this May, down from an average of five a year in the prior four years.
That was one of the Justice Department’s last jail investigations. From 2008 to 2018, the department opened 19 investigations into jails, three during President Trump’s tenure.
Yet since 2018, it hasn’t opened any. A memo circulated in November 2018 by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions put hurdles in the way of entering consent decrees for overhauling jails. In a telephone interview, Sessions told Reuters the policy he set forth adhered to Supreme Court standards on when consent decrees could be entered, allowing them when “appropriate” and “justified.”
In the absence of federal oversight, states have a patchwork of guidelines.
Seventeen states have no rules or oversight mechanisms for local jails, according to Reuters research and a pending study by Michele Deitch, a corrections specialist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. In five other low-population states, all detention facilities are run by state corrections agencies. The other 28 have some form of standards, such as assessing inmates’ health on arrival or checking on suicidal inmates at prescribed intervals. Yet those standards often are minimal, and in at least six of the states, the agencies that write them lack enforcement power or the authority to refer substandard jails for investigation.
Deitch said these gaps make comprehensive nationwide statistics all the more important. “You can’t have good policy without good data,” she said. “Data tells us what is going right and what’s going wrong.”
THE FOSSIL
Without jail-by-jail mortality data, even jails with extraordinary death rates can escape official intervention for years, and local officials can remain blind to the seriousness of problems their facilities face. One example is the Marion County Jail in Indiana, a decrepit 65-year-old facility nicknamed “The Fossil” within the sheriff’s department.
Overfilled and understaffed, the Marion County jail had at least 45 deaths from 2009-2019. Yet local officials rejected pleas from two consecutive sheriffs for additional funding to bolster staffing and build a new facility.
Reuters found that the jail is among the two dozen with an average death rate, 3.5 deaths per 1,000 inmates, at least double the national average from 2009 to 2019. And its record was troubling on one of the most challenging problems plaguing jails: suicide, which accounted for more than a quarter of all U.S. jail deaths.
Thomas Shane Miles, a married father of two, struggled for years with mental illness and opioid addiction when he was arrested in 2016 on a misdemeanor drug possession warrant. On his second day in jail, he flung himself down a stairway and swallowed the contents of a chemical ice pack.
Put on suicide watch, Miles was given a “suicide smock” – a heavy hospital-style gown closed with Velcro – and placed in a monitored cell. The jail’s policies, as well as American Bar Association guidelines, dictate that suicidal inmates be monitored continuously.
On Day 6, Miles was given a jail uniform for a hearing and escorted down an underground hallway to a holding cell below the adjacent court building – a cell with no video monitor or clear sightlines for deputies. Left alone, he tore a strip of cloth from the collar, looped it over a door hinge and hung himself. He was found unconscious 30 minutes after entering the cell. An internal inquiry said the supervising officer logged his rounds after the fact, leaving it unclear when Miles was checked.
In a wrongful death suit that settled this September, Miles’ family argued that despite being identified as a suicide risk, he was given the means and opportunity to kill himself. The sheriff’s office denied misconduct and said it admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement; details were not disclosed.
Miles’ suicide was the jail's seventh in just under 15 months. The Fossil’s suicide rate ranked it among the top 20 jails in the Reuters study.
In 2016, the sheriff called the suicide problem an “epidemic,” but county officials denied requests for more funding. While the county knew it had a suicide problem, there was no way to know how it compared. Like all other officials, Marion County’s leaders had no access to the Justice Department figures.
The sheriff’s jail-management mission often “came in second” in a budget system that pits it against the Indianapolis police department’s law enforcement duties, said Frank Mascari, who sits on the City-County Council. “We knew there were some deaths” at the jail, he said, “but we didn’t have the statistics” to know the rates were extraordinary.
From 2015 to 2017, the sheriff’s budget grew just over 1% a year, audit figures show. The inmate population rose 12% in that time, due to a rise in arrests and to state legislation dictating that some low-level felons serve their sentences in county jails, not state prisons.
The sheriff launched suicide-prevention efforts, hired social workers and trained deputies in spotting suicide warnings. From 2017 to 2019, the number of suicides dropped to two a year, but staffing remained critically low as deputies routinely left for better paying jail jobs in nearby suburbs.
Jail deaths remained stubbornly high despite the decline in suicides, reaching six last year, the heaviest toll in more than a decade, driven in part by drug and alcohol overdoses. Still, there has been no state or federal intervention.
In July 2018, Kyra Warner, 30, went quiet about 90 minutes after arriving at the jail. As her limbs twitched, cellmates called for help, telling nurses and deputies that Warner said she had been using methamphetamine and anti-anxiety drug Xanax.
Jail video shows Warner unable to walk on her own as deputies moved her to a monitored isolation cell, where they left her on the floor, still twitching. She lay unresponsive as they checked her periodically over two hours – until medical staff found no pulse. She died of an accidental overdose.
“The officers that are watching aren’t medically trained,” said Rich Waples, a lawyer handling the family’s ongoing wrongful death lawsuit against the sheriff and Wellpath, the company providing the jail’s healthcare. “If she’d gotten prompt care, they could have reversed the effects of those drugs.”
Jail officials denied wrongdoing and noted in their response to the suit that deputies checked on Warner numerous times, but added they are not medical professionals. Wellpath, also contesting the ongoing suit, denied any misconduct.
“We’re not built to be the largest mental health hospital in the state,” said Colonel James Martin, who oversees the jail. “We’re not built to be the largest detox facility in the state.” Yet the jail has “more detox beds than any single hospital in the state.”
The jail’s shortcomings have been documented, including a county-commissioned review in 2016 that found the Fossil “antiquated,” with inadequate staffing and design flaws that severely hamper inmate monitoring. In 2018, after another independent study highlighted the jail’s challenges, the county approved a new $580 million criminal justice complex, with dedicated facilities to treat mental illness and substance abuse. In 2022, the Fossil will be history.
Another flaw in the U.S. system for monitoring jail fatalities is misleading disclosure. The John E. Polk Correctional Facility in Florida's Seminole County reported one death to the Justice Department in 2019. But at least one other death at the jail was not reported in its official filings.
On June 2, 2019, Thomas Harry Brill, 56, was found hanging by a bed sheet in his cell. Staff tried but failed to resuscitate him, the jail said. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Sheriff’s spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said he “was released out of our custody” before he died. “Therefore, it would not technically be considered an in-custody death.”
Brill’s sister, Tracy, was shocked to learn his death was excluded from the jail’s official count. “They’re trying to avoid responsibility,” she told Reuters. “They’re playing with the numbers. That’s just wrong.”
Brill graduated from Eastern Michigan University with a mathematics degree and lived on a sailboat for years, she said. He had been wrestling with mental illness when he flew from his home in San Diego to look at a boat in Florida. Out of money, he was found in a stolen car and arrested, but couldn’t afford bail. He died unconvicted of the charge. “He needed $500 to get out,” she said. “It was an awful, ridiculous waste that he died.”
A DEATH IN MISSISSIPPI
The Reuters death database also points to another benefit of collecting and publishing jail mortality rates: It can identify an unusual number of fatalities at jails that typically have few. One is Mississippi’s Madison County Detention Center, where Harvey Hill died after being beaten by guards.
The jail had occasional deaths, and in several years reported none. Yet in 2018, it had two deaths, including an inmate who died of complications from an ectopic pregnancy. Few other jails its size had multiple deaths that year.
Hill grew up in the poorest county in the poorest state in America. West, his town of 185 people, is intersected by a four-lane highway in Mississippi’s rural Holmes County. He did landscaping work an hour’s drive south in Canton, a city of 13,000 in the state’s wealthiest county, where 19th Century antebellum shophouses packed with antiques line a postcard-perfect downtown square.
When he was 18, Hill was arrested on charges of sexual battery and robbery. He pleaded guilty and served 14 years in prison. Friends and family say he began piecing together his life after his 2015 release, taking landscaping jobs with business owner Finnegan. “He was an incredible worker,” said Finnegan.
Through the winter of 2017 into the spring, Hill showed signs of mental illness, displayed flashes of paranoia and complained of insomnia, said Finnegan. After he let him go in 2018, Hill started showing up at his home, claiming his old boss owed him millions of dollars. “Harvey, if I had taken your millions, I wouldn’t be landscaping. I would be on an island,” Finnegan recounts telling him.
Hill kept returning. In May 2018, Finnegan called the Madison Police Department. If he wanted Hill removed, he had to press charges, Finnegan said he was told, so he did. “That’s not something I really wanted to do,” he said. “Harvey needed to be in a mental hospital.”
At the station, Finnegan told the officer he’d drop the charges and take Hill to a mental health facility if they could find a room. Instead Hill was booked into Madison County’s jail that Friday morning. “I’ll pick you up on Monday,” said Finnegan. “And we’ll get you some help.”
The Madison Police Department said there were “no remarkable or extraordinary events related to his arrest.” Mississippi has no standards or oversight for jails.
In their response to a family lawsuit, the guards said their actions were proper under jail policy. Michael Wolf, an attorney for one of the guards, James Ingram, told Reuters that Hill bit and then tried to head butt an officer, “and continued to resist and exhibited unusual strength. The control techniques were consistent with the County use of force continuum.” The other guard named in litigation, James Buford, declined to comment.
The family believes the force was unjustified. “Harvey Hill was in handcuffs and beaten to death,” said Derek Sells, a lawyer representing the family. “Someone needs to be held responsible.”
Hill’s death was one of four Reuters identified at the jail over the 12-year period. After he died, the jail filled out a form for the BJS with Hill’s name and details including his race, age and charges. The box for “homicide” was left unchecked. Two years later, no “cause of death” has been sent to the BJS, the jail said, citing an ongoing investigation by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation. No one has been charged.
The family said the jail lied about his death. “They just told us that Harvey had passed and he had had a heart attack,” said Katrina Nettles, his younger sister. The jail did not respond to requests for comment. Its medical contractor, Quality Correctional Health Care, and the nurse who treated Hill denied wrongdoing in litigation.
An autopsy ruled Hill’s death a homicide, however. The report showed that abrasions speckled his head and chest. Severe internal bleeding swelled his neck. His liver had been lacerated.
The state medical examiner, citing a backlog, didn’t release the findings to the family until this June, 25 months after he died and 13 months after the statute of limitations had expired for litigation involving assault. The family filed its ongoing lawsuit last February, before receiving the autopsy.

Told by Reuters of the autopsy’s grim findings, Finnegan bent forward and choked back tears. “God Almighty,” he said, dragging a hand over his face. “Harvey was a friend.”

Somalia's state news agency Sonna said the military had killed about 50 fighters from the al Qaeda-allied Islamist group. No immediate account of the battle was available from the militants.
Hussein Ali, a farmer in the Afgoye area, told Reuters he and other civilians had been trapped in the crossfire during two nights of fighting.
""The Somali government transported dozens of dead bodies. Likewise, al Shabaab took dozens of their bodies. They both suffered blows,"" he said, adding he had counted at least 20 bodies on both sides.
Sonna, the state news agency, said that among the insurgents killed was a commander it identified as Osman il Fidow. ""Al Shabaab buried its dead bodies in another village called Bulo Yarey,"" it said. 
Neither the Somali military nor al Shabaab could be reached for comment. Both sides often give sharply different figures of fatalities in skirmishes.
Al Shabaab has been fighting for more than ten years to dislodge the country's central government and establish rule based on its strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.
The group frequently carries out gun assaults and bombings of both military and civilian targets and has also carried out attacks on regional targets, especially in neighbouring Kenya.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - As Bolivia readies to vote in a defining election, a number of key issues are on the table, including the country's huge lithium deposits, the role of unseated ex-leader Evo Morales, and policy on farming coca, the raw ingredient of cocaine.
The Oct. 18 presidential ballot is a delayed re-run of a fraught and later voided vote in 2019 that sparked off deadly protests and led to the resignation of leftist Morales after a near 14-year rule.
WHO ARE THE FRONT-RUNNERS?
The two front-runners this time are Luis Arce, the candidate for Morales' socialist MAS party, who would tilt the country back towards the left after a period of conservative interim government. Arce's main challenger is centrist ex-President Carlos Mesa, who led the country from 2003 to 2005, and came second in last year's vote.
Arce, a long-time economy minister under Morales, leads Mesa in opinion polls, though not by enough to win outright on Sunday. A candidate needs at least 40% of valid votes in the first round and a ten point lead to avoid a second round run-off.
A second round, if needed, would take place on Nov. 29, with polls indicating a potential narrow win for Mesa.
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO EVO?
Mesa and Arce would take very different paths over Morales, a divisive figure in Bolivia who is currently living in exile in Argentina. He is being investigated by state prosecutors in Bolivia over accusations of corruption, sexual abuse, and fraud, all of which he denies.
Mesa has said that in his government ""the crimes of Evo Morales would not go unpunished,"" while Arce has left the door open for him returning to politics, though said he would have to first resolve pending issues with judicial authorities.
COCA POLICY
MAS under Morales, a former coca growers union head, had strong support from farmers of the leaf, which is used medicinally in Bolivia but is also the raw material to make cocaine. He put a stop to U.S. drug enforcement operations in the country.
Both candidates say there must be a fight against drugs. Arce says traditional growing areas must be protected by law, while Mesa has said there needs to be a stronger line on controlling legal production.
U.S. TIES
Bolivia's relationship with the United States soured under Morales, though it has warmed under the interim government of President Jeanine Anez, who is not running in Sunday's election. There has been no U.S. ambassador in Bolivia since 2008.
Arce has pledged to ""work with everyone,"" though the close involvement of Morales in his campaign would likely hinder U.S. ties. Mesa, meanwhile, says there is no reason not to ""resume full ambassadorial-level relations"" with the United States.
'WHITE GOLD'
Any new government would need to tackle the question of lithium, the ultralight metal key to making batteries for electric vehicles. Bolivia has one of the world's largest reserves of the 'white gold', but it has been largely untapped.
""We intend to turn Bolivia into a competitive producer that fully develops the salt flats and ensures its participation in the global lithium value chain,"" Mesa has said.
Arce said he wants to create 130,000 new direct and indirect jobs by 2025 via the industrialization of lithium.
ECONOMIC REVIVAL
Mesa has pledged to spend over $6 billion in the first year of his administration to drive an economic recovery. Arce wants to reactive domestic industry and has proposed a two-year payment halt on around $1.6 billion in foreign debt.

Finland has adopted some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe, despite its low level of infections, meaning most foreigners cannot enter the country.
The northern part of Finland, where many businesses rely on tourists flying in to meet Santa Claus, see the Northern Lights or take a snowmobile safari, has seen visitor numbers plummet.
In August 2020, foreign tourist numbers were down 78% from a year earlier, according to travel industry data from Business Finland.
""For local businesses, definitely, Christmas is in danger,"" Sanna Karkkainen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi tourist board, said. ""Christmas itself will come, but how merry it will be, that's the question mark."" 
Finland escaped the worst effects of the pandemic in spring, opting for a strict lockdown, which included isolating the capital, Helsinki.
Now, as in much of Europe, infections are on the rise again, hitting a daily record earlier this month, and the government is considering new measures to contain the spread of the virus.
The country of 5.5 million people has reported nearly 13,000 COVID-19 infections in total so far, including 346 deaths.
With Santa greeting kids from behind a Plexiglas screen and elves wearing masks, Christmas cheer is already in short supply. 
At tour company Safarctica, which offers snowmobile tours and ice-swimming, sales director Antti Antikainen, reckons bookings are set to fall 50-80% this year, adding: ""I think it's closer to 80%.""
Tourism-oriented firms, which employ around 8% of people in the region, have already started laying off workers and many have little hope that the festive season can be saved, unless the government eases some of its travel restrictions soon. 
""At this very moment my answer would be that Christmas is cancelled,"" said Harri Mallinen, who runs the Apukka Resort in Rovaniemi.

A Saudi-led military coalition, which supports the internationally recognised Yemeni government, and Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement agreed last month in Switzerland to exchange 1,081 prisoners, including 15 Saudis, in the largest swap of its kind in the five-year-old conflict.
More than 700 prisoners were exchanged on Thursday as the operation started, said the International Committee of the Red Cross, which is managing the process. 
An ICRC plane took off on Friday morning from Aden city, the temporary capital of the Yemeni government, ferrying detainees to the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa, a Reuters witness and the ICRC said.
It was carrying 101 Houthi prisoners, an ICRC spokesperson said.
At the same time, an ICRC plane took off from Sanaa airport carrying 76 prisoners to Aden, the ICRC spokesperson said. Houthi-run al-Masirah TV said two planes would depart from Sanaa on Friday carrying around 150 prisoners in total.
Men descending from the plane when it landed in Aden prostrated and kissed the tarmac. Some embraced waiting friends and relatives. 
Around 355 prisoners are expected to be exchanged on Friday, Al Arabiya TV said. 
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said on Thursday the swap ""brings hope for peace-building"".
U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Thursday the swap was an ""airlift of hope"", adding that both parties remain in negotiations for a permanent ceasefire, which he hoped could be agreed by the end of the year.
The warring sides had agreed in 2018 to swap 15,000 detainees split between both sides to pave the way for political negotiations to end the conflict, but progress has been slow.

Yemen has been at war since the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene in 2015.

464,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 16, 2020 06:31AM ET</span>","A year on, Lebanon's protests have faded and life has got worse","By Samia Nakhoul and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - One year after Lebanese erupted in rage against politicians they blamed for economic collapse, squares once packed with angry demonstrators are empty and camps set up to shelter the protesters lie deserted.
While the anger has not gone away since mass protests swept the country late last year, there is little energy left as the pandemic spreads, unemployment rises and the capital city reels from a huge explosion in August that left thousands homeless.
Some of those who did demonstrate against the authorities in the aftermath of that accident were met with teargas and police batons.
Dany Mortada, a 28-year-old activist, was among hundreds of thousands people who marched through the streets of Beirut and other cities for weeks in 2019.
As he looked across a Beirut square at the centre of the uprising, he believes the spirit of protest lives on.
""The revolution still exists in the heart of many people,"" Mortada said from in front of the government headquarters, where he once camped out night after night.
Concrete blocks were installed there last year by security forces to keep protesters away. Dubbed ""the wall of shame"" by demonstrators, they have turned into a canvas for anti-government graffiti and slogans.
Lebanon still has no government to confront the worst emergency it has faced at least since the 1975-90 civil war, as rival political factions fail to agree on how to divide power.
Meanwhile, its cash reserves are running dangerously low, hunger stalks middle class families, the currency has collapsed and there is not enough money to clean up the devastation - human and material - left by the Aug. 4 port blast.
After that tragedy, which killed nearly 200 people and injured thousands, it fell to young volunteers to help clear the rubble and provide support to 300,000 people made homeless.
Those hit by joblessness, poverty and hunger rely on relief agencies, local philanthropy and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), with no way out of the crisis in sight.
THREE GENERATIONS
Maya Ibrahimchah founded Beit el Baraka, a local NGO, in 2018 to serve Beirut's poor, initially by finding homes for evicted tenants and opening a free supermarket.
But in the year since last October's uprising, the NGO has grown to help 220,000 people. Ibrahimchah quickly found that she was providing food and shelter to members of Lebanon's shrinking middle class.
""Now we're also fixing 3,011 homes in the devastated (blast) zones,"" Ibrahimchah says. ""We get 95% of our funding from Lebanese in the diaspora.""
One family she encountered in Mar Mikhael, a part of Beirut shattered by the blast, summed up how the crisis has hit the whole of society, not just the poor.
In the house live a grandmother, one of the first women to graduate from the American University of Beirut, her daughter, also a graduate from an elite university, the daughter's husband who lost his job in a pharmaceutical company and three children.
The kids, aged 7, 10 and 11, are losing their teeth because the family cannot afford dental care.
""It's three generations that portray what happened to us,"" Ibrahimchah said. ""When I got into this house, I cursed the governments and our officials.""
Rita Oghlo's husband, a mechanic by trade, lost his last job at a restaurant because of the financial crisis. After the coronavirus pandemic struck, he found it impossible to find work. His leg was badly injured in the port explosion, and the family's apartment was destroyed.
Struggling to get by on Rita's income as a beautician, the family depends on donations.
""Honestly, in the past year, our lives have been upended, not just me, everybody. Now it's just a catastrophe,"" she said. ""And nobody thinks about us, in the state, they don't care"".
It is little better for those with savings. Beirut's banks, paralysed after lending to the central bank and the state, have shut depositors out of their accounts for much of the past year.
""I have 12,000 families on the waiting list who need to buy laptops for their children"" to study online during the lockdown, says Ibrahimchah. ""How can the parents pay?""
'NEVER THIS BAD'
Mortada, the protester, has been unemployed since before last year's demonstrations began, but is going to stay in Lebanon where he wants to see people back on the streets, united in defiance against politicians they blame for Lebanon's crisis.
""Squares will be full again,"" he said.
Many do not expect that to happen, as the struggle to make ends meet takes over and people look for a better life elsewhere.
The annual Arab Youth Survey showed this month that whereas two out of five young Arabs are considering emigrating, that figure doubles to nearly four out of five in Lebanon.
According to the United Nations, 55% of the population lives below the poverty line, while the Beirut-based research firm InfoPro said a third of all private sector jobs have been lost.
""I think young people are trying to survive, that's why they're not going to the streets. I think they've been frightened because they've been threatened,"" said Nasser Saidi, a leading economist and former minister.

""We've never had anything this bad.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Greece and Cyprus pushed for a tougher European Union response to Turkey's natural gas exploration in contested Mediterranean waters at an EU summit on Friday, after Ankara restarted operations of a survey ship.
Two weeks after their last summit where leaders discussed economic sanctions, the EU has so far failed to persuade Ankara to stop exploring in waters disputed by Greece and Cyprus.
Turkey said on Wednesday it was restarting operations of a survey ship that it withdrew last month. [nL8N2H51P7]
""I sincerely hope that we will be able to strongly and unanimously support Greece and Cyprus against the newest provocations made by Turkey,"" Slovenian Prime Minister Janez Jansa told reporters as he arrived at the summit.
France and Germany said earlier this week that Turkey had only ""weeks"" to revise its stance and stop what they also said were provocations, but declined to give a strong ultimatum as Athens and Nicosia would like. 
EU leaders had agreed on Oct. 2 to give Turkey until early December before considering economic sanctions and Germany, which has so far led diplomatic talks with Ankara, wants to give dialogue a chance because of close EU-Turkey trade ties. 
""There will be an effort to give a strong warning (to Turkey),"" a senior EU diplomat said. 
Cyprus is frustrated that, in addition to the Turkish exploration ship off a Greek island, Turkey has sent another vessel to Cyprus's economic zone to conduct seismic surveys. 
EU member Cyprus is also furious that Turkish Cypriot authorities have partially reopened the beach town of Varosha, a former resort area fenced off and abandoned in no-man's land since a 1974 Turkish invasion that split the island.
""Turkey remains consistent in its provocative and aggressive behaviour,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Thursday in Brussels.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Nearly a decade after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan's government has decided to release over one million tonnes of contaminated water into the sea, media reports said on Friday, with a formal announcement expected to be made later this month.
The decision is expected to rankle neighbouring countries like South Korea, which has already stepped up radiation tests of food from Japan, and further devastate the fishing industry in Fukushima that has battled against such a move for years. 
The disposal of contaminated water at the Fukushima Daiichi plant has been a longstanding problem for Japan as it proceeds with an decades-long decommissioning project. Nearly 1.2 million tonnes of contaminated water are currently stored in huge tanks at the facility. 
The plant, run by Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings Inc (T:9501), suffered multiple nuclear meltdowns after a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. 
On Friday, Japan's industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said no decision had been made on the disposal of the water yet, but the government aims to make one quickly.
""To prevent any delays in the decommissioning process, we need to make a decision quickly,"" he told a news conference.
He did not give any further details, including a time-frame.
The Asahi newspaper reported that any such release is expected to take at around two years to prepare, as the site's irradiated water first needs to pass through a filtration process before it can be further diluted with seawater and finally released into the ocean.
In 2018, Tokyo Electric apologised after admitting its filtration systems had not removed all dangerous material from the water, collected from the cooling pipes used to keep fuel cores from melting when the plant was crippled.
It has said it plans to remove all radioactive particles from the water except tritium, an isotope of hydrogen that is hard to separate and is considered to be relatively harmless.
It is common practice for nuclear plants around the world to release water that contain traces of tritium into the ocean. 
In April, a team sent by the International Atomic Energy Agency to review contaminated water issues at the Fukushima site said the options for water disposal outlined by an advisory committee in Japan - vapour release and discharges to the sea – were both technically feasible. The IAEA said both options were used by operating nuclear plants.
Last week, Japanese fish industry representatives urged the government to not allow the release of contaminated water from the Fukushima plant into the sea, saying it would undo years of work to restore their reputation.
South Korea has retained a ban on imports of seafood from the Fukushima region that was imposed after the nuclear disaster and summoned a senior Japanese embassy official last year to explain how Tokyo planned to deal with the Fukushima water problem.
During Tokyo's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2013, then-prime minister Shinzo Abe told members of the International Olympic Committee that the Fukushima facility was ""under control"".
The Games have been delayed to 2021 because of the pandemic and some events are due to be held as close as 60 km (35 miles) from the wrecked plant.

As Queen Suthida's convoy passed a group of protesters on Wednesday, video footage shows they gave the three-finger salutes of opposition to the establishment and shouted ""our taxes"", a reference to complaints about palace spending. Police pushed protesters away from the queen's car. 
Bunkueanun ""Francis"" Paothong told Reuters he had been charged, after he was transported from Bangkok to a border patrol police base outside of the province. 
""I have been charged with violence against the queen,"" he said, declining to comment further. He earlier posted an online video proclaiming his innocence.
A police officer said Ekachai Hongkangwan would also be charged at the same police base, but Reuters was unable to contact him after he arrived. 
Thai Lawyers for Human Rights told Reuters that its lawyers were helping the two. They made no comment on the case.
Thailand's government cited the incident around Queen Suthida's convoy as a justification for imposing emergency measures on Thursday that include a ban on political gatherings of five or more people.
Protests have been growing for three months, with protesters seeking reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy as well as the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.
Section 110 of the Thai criminal code sets a sentence of 16 years to life imprisonment for anyone found guilty of violence or attempted violence against the queen, heir-apparent or regent - with a death sentence if an act is likely to endanger their life.

There was no sign of the queen being harmed during the incident. Video shows her smiling from the window of the car as it passed the protesters and she later went on to perform palace duties at a temple.

LOS ANGELES/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - U.S authorities detained the defense minister for Mexican ex-president Enrique Pena Nieto at Los Angeles airport on Thursday on a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) warrant, a DEA spokeswoman told Reuters.
As defense minister General Salvador Cienfuegos was a powerful figure in Mexico's drug war in which the army battled cartels across the country. Several of Mexico's former top-ranking 'drug war' officials have been implicated in narcotics.
The high-level arrest comes less than three weeks before the U.S. presidential election. President Donald Trump, seeking a second term, has made clamping down on cartel activity a major policy objective, though with little major progress since he took office in 2017.
Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter that he was informed of the detention of Cienfuegos by the U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
""The Consul in Los Angeles will be informing me of the charges in the next few hours. We will offer the consular assistance to which he is entitled. I will keep you posted,"" said Ebrard.
A Mexican diplomatic source said members of Cienfuegos' family, traveling with him at the time of the detention, have already been released.
The DEA spokeswoman told Reuters she did not have further details on the circumstances of the arrest, whether Cienfuegos was coming or going at the Los Angeles airport, or whether family or others were traveling with him.
The defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""This detention is going to have a powerful impact in Mexico,"" said military affairs analyst Raul Benitez.
Cienfuegos was Pena Nieto's defense minister until the end of the president's term.
Pena Nieto was in office for six years through December 2018. Several members of his cabinet and party have been implicated in high-level corruption cases, sometimes involving allegations of links to organized crime.
Under Cienfuegos the army was accused of extrajudicial killings, including the 2014 Tlatlaya massacre, where 22 drug gang members were executed. 
Arrest warrants were issued in Mexico last month for soldiers in connection with the kidnapping and presumed massacre of 43 students the same year in a town known for heroin trafficking.
The armed forces have taken an increasingly prominent role in fighting crime in Mexico, and generally are perceived as less prone to corruption than civilian police forces.
Elements of the Army in the northern state of Sinaloa have long been rumored to have had links to the cartel formerly headed by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, now in a U.S. prison. 
The detention of Cienfuegos comes on the heels of the arrest of ex-President Felipe Calderon's security minister, Genaro Garcia Luna. 
Garcia Luna is on trial in New York on suspicion of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from Guzman's Sinaloa cartel, which he was tasked with combating.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accuses his predecessors of rampant corruption. He has leant heavily on the armed forces in his efforts to end cartel violence in the country, which saw nearly 35,000 killings last year.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's Jacinda Ardern on Friday urged voters to deliver her a strong general election mandate, promising a swift recovery from the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
Ardern's decisive response to the crisis has left her well-placed for Saturday's vote, although recent polls have suggested her Labour Party may need support from the minor Greens Party to form government. 
""If you want pace and speed, give us a strong mandate,"" Ardern, 40, said in an interview on Radio New Zealand.
Labour has a comfortable double-digit lead over the main opposition centre-right National Party, while support for the Greens has been steady. The polls also predict the demise of the nationalist New Zealand First Party, Labour's current coalition partner led by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters.
If Labour wins outright, it will be the first party to govern alone since New Zealand switched to a mixed member proportional (MMP) system in 1996.
A coalition of Labour and the Greens would be the first left-leaning government in decades, a scenario that conservative National Party leader Judith Collins has warned would mean more taxes and an environment hostile to business.
Collins, 61, argues that she is best placed tackle the post-pandemic financial challenges.
Both leaders organised walkabouts on Friday to woo a undecided voter bloc of about 14%.
While life is back to normal in New Zealand, its borders are still shut, its tourism sector is bleeding, and economists are predicting a lasting recession.
The economy shrank 12.2% in the second quarter to its worst level since the Great Depression, and debt is expected to peak at 56%. 
Ardern has pledged to increase taxes for top earners, while Collins has promised short-term tax cuts, but they have otherwise shown few major differences on policy.
""The relative lack of policy differences mean that much of the debate has been about competence - which party and which leader can be trusted to 'get the job done',"" said Geoffrey Miller, analyst at political website Democracy Project.
Ardern has been fighting off criticism her government has failed on a promise to be transformational, despite a glowing global profile and popularity at home for her empathetic leadership during crises including the Christchurch mosque shootings and the White Island volcano explosion. 
""If we genuinely want to make sure what we are doing on child poverty and on climate change isn't just a three-year burst, I have to make sure it's sustained,"" Ardern said. ""It took decades to create, I need more than three years to fix it.""
CHALLENGE AHEAD
Both parties have similar views on monetary policy so the markets and the New Zealand dollar, the world's 11th most-traded currency, is likely to have a muted reaction to the outcome, said Brad Olsen, senior economist at Infometrics.
""The business community is likely to see the election as a continuation of current policies,"" said Olsen.
Business confidence, which hit historic lows in the early months of Ardern's government, has improved after her successes.
Ardern won global acclaim for her handling of last year's terror attack by a white supremacist against Muslims in Christchurch, with an inclusive ""be strong, be kind"" mantra and swift political action to ban guns. 
She burnished her reputation this year with her ""go hard, go early"" approach to the coronavirus, which has resulted in the national elimination of COVID-19.
She retains a solid international following as ""anti-Trump"", promoting issues such as woman's rights, social justice, and multilateralism.
Still, there has been criticism of her economic policies and a looming summer season with no international tourists will be a major test.
""She won't be able to ride this wave of personal popularity forever,"" said Miller. ""New Zealand has done well with management of COVID-19 but Chapter 2 of the story starts from Sunday.""
About 1.5 million of 3.5 million registered voters have already cast ballots. Polling closes at 7 p.m. (600 GMT) on Saturday, with a provisional result likely that night.
New Zealanders will vote simultaneously on referenda to legalise recreational cannabis and euthanasia. A vote in favour of the former would make New Zealand only the third country in the world to do so after Uruguay and Canada.

The king's comments come amid a power struggle over the premiership between Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, just seven months after another wrangle led to Muhyiddin forming the government. 
Anwar met the king this week to prove he has a majority to form a government with the help of defectors from the current administration. But further meetings at the palace were cancelled due to movement restrictions to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
The latest political struggles come as Malaysia grapples with an economy battered by the coronavirus and a new surge in infections.
In a statement, the palace advised lawmakers to display maturity in politics and to understand the concerns of the public.
""Regarding the latest developments in the country's political situation, His Majesty advised the people, especially politicians, to come together to ensure that the country is never again dragged into political uncertainty while we are all still faced with various problems and a difficult future due to the threat of the COVID-19 epidemic,"" the palace said.
He also urged them to resolve problems through negotiations and legal processes enshrined in the Federal Constitution.
The king plays a largely ceremonial role but he can appoint a prime minister who in his view is likely to command a majority. New governments are usually elected in Malaysia but the palace plays a role in certain instances.

The king appointed Muhyiddin as prime minister this year in one such case after the unexpected resignation of Mahathir Mohamad in February, whose government collapsed due to infighting.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. military will put nearly 9,000 South Korean workers on unpaid leave from April in the absence of an agreement on the sharing of costs of maintaining 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea, it has told the government.
The allies are at odds over how much of the cost South Korea should shoulder to accommodate U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Negotiations have made little progress even after the previous deal, the Special Measures Agreement (SMA), expired at the end of 2019. 
The workers, who are mostly employed at U.S. bases, were put on unpaid leave in April, which led to a temporary agreement in June to let South Korea fund some 4,000 of them.
USFK, in a Oct. 5 letter to the labour ministry seen by Reuters, said temporary funding would expire on Dec. 31 and it could only pay the workers until March.
""We still face a labour funding deficit for the rest of calendar year 2021,"" the U.S. military said.
""Absent a signed SMA or related bilateral agreement, USFK may need to furlough ... Korean national employees starting no earlier than April 1.""
President Donald Trump has said South Korea should pay more and the disagreement raised the prospect that he could push to withdraw at least some U.S. troops, as he has done elsewhere. 
Cost-sharing talks were a major sticking point during an annual security meeting this week between Defence Minister Suh Wook and U.S. Secretary of Defence Mark Esper in Washington.
They said in a statement they had agreed to finalise a deal, citing ""the impact of the lapse on the alliance"", but failed, for the first time since 2008, to stipulate pledges to ""maintain the current force level of USFK"".
A South Korean military official said Esper had expressed concern the absence of a deal could ""impact our joint readiness"".

""But they also reaffirmed 'unshakable commitment' to the combined defence in the statement, that's what we focus on instead of the mere number of troops."" said the official, who declined to be identified.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Hundreds of New Zealand plane passengers started arriving in Sydney on Friday as part of a new trans-Tasman travel bubble amid a rapidly falling growth rate in cases at the epicentre of Australia's coronavirus outbreak.
In a tentative re-opening to international tourism, travellers on the approved flights won't be required to quarantine in Sydney, authorities said.
The arrangements, however, are not yet reciprocal, with New Zealand requiring arrivals to be quarantined for two weeks under supervision at the cost of NZ$3,100 ($2,045) for the first person and more for additional family members.
Around 90 percent of those travelling on Friday with Air New Zealand are booked to travel one-way, the airline said.
New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she hoped New Zealand would loosen restrictions on people arriving from Australia shortly.
""It is an important first step in bringing back international travel and we hope that Prime Minister (Jacinda) Ardern returns the favour in the near future,"" said Berejiklian, referring to the New Zealand leader.
There was one new case of community transmission in New South Wales in the past 24 hours, Berejiklian said, while adding that she would like to announce a further easing of restrictions next week if the case count remains low.
While Australia has endured a second wave of infections, the case load is modest compared to outbreaks in much of Europe and North America. 
With the exception of those living in the south-eastern state of Victoria, most people in Australia are subject to only modest pandemic restrictions, with limits on gatherings the main disruption. 
In Victoria, the epicentre of the second wave of infections in Australia, authorities recorded just two new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, the lowest daily increase since early June.
Victoria, and in particular the state capital of Melbourne, have endured months of strict lock-down measures, although Premier Daniel Andrews is due to announce plans to ease some restrictions on Sunday.
Andrews said on Friday the state was ""well-placed to take significant steps"" to ease restrictions.
Travellers from New Zealand on 'no-quarantine' flights will be able to go to New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory without having to undergo quarantine upon arrival, authorities said.
The states of Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania have either closed borders or limited entry which can include quarantine periods, while Victorians are heavily restricted in where they can travel.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's new leader will aim to beef up security ties when he visits Vietnam and Indonesia next week amid concerns about Beijing's growing assertiveness, but he is likely to steer clear of the harsh anti-China rhetoric used by U.S. counterparts.
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, whose resume is scant on diplomatic experience, will follow in predecessor Shinzo Abe's footsteps by making the two Southeast Asian nations the destination for his first overseas trip since taking office in September.
""I think it is important to show ... we put more emphasis and importance on that region and we are interested in the security situation, especially in the South China Sea,"" said former diplomat Kunihiko Miyake, a special advisor to Suga.
Suga will visit Vietnam, chair of the 10-member ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations), and Indonesia, its biggest economy, on a four-day trip from Sunday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato announced on Friday.
Japan must balance its deep economic ties with China with security concerns, including Beijing's push to assert claims over disputed East China Sea isles [L4N2H62LS].
Abe oversaw an improvement in ties but some ruling party MPs want a tougher stance.
ASEAN members, many of which have territorial feuds with China in vital South China Sea waterways, are wary of alienating a big economic partner and reluctant to become entrapped in an intense confrontation between the United States and China.
Scott Harold, associate director at the Rand Corporation's Center for Asia-Pacific Policy, said Japan's approach is to be firm, calm and advance its interests without asking countries to explicitly push back against China.
Beefing up defence cooperation will be a ""key point"" of Suga's trip to Vietnam following last week's port call of three Japanese vessels at the country's Cam Ranh naval base, said Ha Hoang Hop of the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.
China claims swathes of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone as well as the Paracel and Spratly Islands while Indonesia has been angered by Chinese coast guard intrusions into its exclusive economic zone off its Natuna Islands.
Japan plans to sign an agreement with Vietnam to allow it to export defence equipment and technology to the country, the Nikkei newspaper reported this week. A Japanese official said Japan was talking about enhancing defense cooperation with both Hanoi and Jakarta but could not comment on the outcomes.
Suga's trip follows last week's Tokyo meeting of the ""Quad"", an informal grouping of India, Australia, Japan and the United States, which Washington sees as a bulwark against China. 
Beijing has denounced the Quad as a ""mini-NATO"" meant to contain China.
Hop said Vietnam could endorse the Quad as the group becomes more inclusive and as Beijing becomes more aggressive in South China Sea. Indonesia, however, is wary.
""Indonesia, which puts a high primacy on ASEAN's centrality, is going to be very ambivalent about the Quad because it undermines that whole principle … They are unlikely to jump on the quad bandwagon,"" said Euan Graham (NYSE:GHM) at the Singapore-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
Suga's visit also coincides with Japan's efforts to diversify its supply chains and reduce reliance on China by bringing production home or locating more in Southeast Asia. 
He will likely announce an expansion of Japan's subsidies for production in Southeast Asia on his trip, the Nikkei said.
Vietnam is a popular choice for Japanese firms. Half of the 30 Japanese firms that took advantage of a 23.5 billion yen ($223.28 million) government scheme to diversify supply chains in Southeast Asia targeted Vietnam, which has aggressively courted Japanese investment.
Only one opted for Indonesia, where Japanese firms complain about a sometimes arbitrary regulatory environment, prompting Tokyo to call for improvements.

DENVER (Reuters) - Stoked by high winds, a wildfire burning for two months in northern Colorado exploded in size this week to surpass 167,000 acres, making it the largest blaze in state history, officials said on Thursday.
The so-called Cameron Peak Fire in the Arapaho and Roosevelt National Forests has forced the evacuations of several mountain communities and campgrounds and has destroyed an unknown number of homes and other buildings, according to an interagency fire-tracking website.
The blaze erupted in mid-August and has raged through large stands of desiccated lodgepole pine trees killed by beetle infestation in mountainous terrain and through tinder-dry grasslands at lower elevations, fire managers said.
“High winds combined with critically dry fuels have been driving fire growth,” according to the InciWeb site.
No injuries or deaths have been reported, and the cause of the fire, which is 56% contained, is under investigation.
Winds gusting to more 70 miles per hour on Wednesday spread flames across 20,000 acres (8,100 hectares) in a single day. The city of Fort Collins, east of the blaze, has been enveloped in smoke from the fire.
Cooler weather and lighter winds helped slow the fire's growth on Thursday, but crews were bracing for a return of critical weather conditions on Friday, with higher winds and lower humidity expected, authorities said.
The entire state of Colorado has been gripped by some level of drought, according to figures released on Thursday by the U.S. Drought Monitor. 
The Cameron Peak Fire is, however, dwarfed by several monster-sized conflagrations that have raged in California this year, including the largest in that state's history, the August Complex, which has scorched well over 1 million acres since mid-August. 

The previous largest wildfire in Colorado, the Pine Gulch Fire, blackened 139,000 acres (56,000 hectares) this summer.

DENVER (Reuters) - A security guard hired to protect a Denver television news crew covering dueling rallies by right-wing and left-wing groups will be charged with second-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a protester, the city's top prosecutor said on Thursday.
Denver District Attorney Beth McCann said in a written statement that she will file the murder charge against Matthew Dolloff, 30, in the shooting death of Lee Keltner on Saturday. Dolloff has been held without bond in the Denver County jail since his arrest, jail records show.
A lawyer for the Dolloff family said he acted in self-defense, local media reported this week. The shooting erupted in a courtyard near an art museum in downtown Denver following a ""Patriot Rally"" and a counter-demonstration dubbed a ""BLM-Antifa Soup Drive."" 
Dolloff opened fire with a semiautomatic handgun after Keltner hit him in the face and sprayed him with a chemical agent following a ""verbal altercation"" between the two men, as demonstrators from both sides were dispersing, police said.
An image of the incident captured by a Denver Post photographer showed Keltner spraying the chemical at Dolloff, who was pointing a gun at Keltner.
Keltner, 49, died from a single gunshot wound, authorities said. Keltner's son told the Denver Post his father was not affiliated with any group, but was at the rally to support police.
Dolloff was hired through the Pinkerton agency to provide security for a crew from KUSA-TV, an NBC News affiliate, the station said in a statement, adding it requested that security personnel be unarmed.
Pinkerton said on Twitter that Dolloff was not an employee ""but rather a contractor agent from a long standing industry vendor.""

If convicted of second-degree murder, Dolloff faces a mandatory sentence of between 16 and 48 years in prison, McCann said.

480,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 09:18PM ET</span>","Thai Protesters Defy Emergency Decree, Plan to Keep Gathering","(Bloomberg) -- Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters staged a rally for a second straight day in Thailand’s capital, defying a state of emergency declared by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha to quell escalating demonstrations in support of monarchy reform and greater democracy.
Protesters shouting “Prayuth get out” gathered at Ratchaprasong intersection in the middle of Bangkok’s main shopping district and pushed police barricades, demanding the release of leaders arrested by the police in a morning raid. The crowds swelled throughout the evening before dispersing around 10 p.m. They vowed to return to the same spot on Friday evening.
The large crowd shows that the protests are unlikely to abate despite the arrest of key leaders and the government’s move to ban gatherings of five or more people. The mounting protests have weighed on the nation’s currency and stocks, with foreign investors turning net sellers of $10.6 billion so far this year. The baht fell Thursday while the benchmark SET Index of stocks closed 1.7% lower, extending losses this year to 21%.
“The situation is definitely less than ideal for investors especially if the protests escalate,” said Mingze Wu, a currency trader at StoneX Group in Singapore. “We’ll likely see an exodus of funds from Thailand into other similar countries in the region. The baht will definitely be weaker.”
The protests, led at first mostly by students, have broken taboos about publicly criticizing the royal family, which sits at the apex of power in Thailand. Demonstrators have questioned taxpayer funds that go toward royal affairs as well as laws that stifle discussion of the monarchy.
The demonstration Thursday night came a day after tens of thousands protesters broke through police lines in a march to Government House, Prayuth’s office, in an escalation of demonstrations that began in early July. Some protesters gave a three-finger salute -- a symbol of the demonstrations -- to a motorcade of Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana, who smiled and waved at them.
Those arrested included Arnon Nampa and Parit Chiwarak, according to the Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. Parit had written a statement calling for reform of the monarchy with 10 demands, including prohibiting the king from endorsing any coups and revoking laws that criminalize insults against King Maha Vajiralongkorn and top members of the royal family.
The protesters are also calling for the resignation of Prayuth, a former army chief who staged a coup in 2014. They are pushing to rewrite the constitution drafted by a military-appointed panel that helped him stay on following elections last year. The government has said it’s open to changes in some areas, but a process to rewrite the constitution has been delayed in parliament.
Prayuth said the government was ready to open public forums for the protesters “but everything has to be done under the law.” “The majority will have to listen to the minority, and the minority will have to respect different opinions too,” he said in a statement.
On Wednesday night, the government said legal actions would be taken against protesters who disrespected the monarchy -- one of the first official responses that directly referenced the criticisms of the palace. Prayuth also announced a so-called “Declaration of a Serious Emergency Situation in Bangkok,” which effectively banned protests as well as publication of news that could “harm national security” and “cause panic.”
A special cabinet meeting on Friday is expected to approve the emergency decree. The latest measures are in addition to a national emergency in place since the end of March to deal with the Covid-19 outbreak, which allows the government to enforce mandatory quarantines and streamline disease-control plans without multiple approvals.
The protests have now shifted to the heart of Bangkok. The location on Thursday night, in front of the Central World shopping mall, was the site of demonstrations in 2010 that ended with a clearance operation in which scores of people were killed.
The protests had gained momentum amid the worst economic crisis facing the tourism- and trade reliant nation, which has passed a $60 billion stimulus to battle the pandemic-triggered slump. The emergency may also hurt the government’s plan to gradually reopen tourism to foreign visitors from this month.
“The state of emergency will likely fuel the movement that’s already gaining momentum,” said Punchada Sirivunnabood, an associate professor of politics at Mahidol University near Bangkok. “The protesters will likely continue their movement because they’re upset that the government isn’t listening to their demand.”

BANGKOK (Reuters) - From shops, offices and schools they spilled onto a Bangkok street in their tens of thousands, voicing shock and anger and above all defiance.
Thailand's government had announced emergency measures to ban gatherings of five or more people to try to end three months of protests. The response was one of the biggest demonstrations so far, in the heart of the capital.
""I'm not afraid. Emergency or not, I have no freedom,"" said 26-year-old illustrator Thanatpohn Dejkunchorn, who left work early to attend the protest with friends. ""I want freedom to exist in this country. I want it to be free from this vicious cycle.""
Protests have built since mid-July in the biggest challenge in years to the political establishment - seeking the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
""We have to create understanding with the protesters,"" government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri told Reuters, complaining that protest leaders were not giving protesters ""complete information.""
Police said they would arrest all protesters, though they did not explain how they would charge tens of thousands of people.
The Royal Palace has declined all comment on the protesters or their demands.
Until Wednesday, the government had largely allowed demonstrations to happen, while making no sign of meeting protesters' demands.
But that changed after an incident in which protesters jeered Queen Suthida's motorcade as she and the king were paying a rare visit from Europe, where they spend most of their time.
The government cited that as well as the risks to national security and the economy from protests and the danger of spreading coronavirus as reasons for imposing emergency measures.
The government then launched a crackdown, sweeping away a camp set up outside Prayuth's office and arresting three protest leaders - among around 40 arrests in the past week.
""EXCESSIVE AND UNNECESSARY POWER""
""It's obvious that the state wants to exercise excessive and unnecessary power on people,"" said 22-year-old student Pattanun Arunpreechawat, who joined Thursday's protest after studies.
Protesters want to oust Prayuth, who first took power in a 2014 coup, saying he engineered election rules last year to keep his position - an accusation he denies. Breaking a longstanding taboo, protesters have also challenged the monarchy - saying it has helped entrench decades of military influence.
They gathered in the shadow of upmarket shopping malls and shiny tower blocks that are home to multinationals and other businesses in Southeast Asia's second biggest economy.
But the Ratchaprasong Intersection also has a historic resonance for protesters. In 2010, it was the scene of bloodshed as security forces cracked down on Red Shirts who battled pro-establishment Yellow Shirts during a decade of turmoil.
""I'm not afraid. I've been chased by guns,"" said beef noodle seller Thawat Kijkunasatien, 57, a veteran of the bloody crackdown a decade ago and another in 1992. 
""Wherever the kids go, I go,"" he said at the protest while sipping a can of beer.
One characteristic of the latest Thai protests has been the extent to which they are led by students and other young people. Most protest leaders are in their 20s, but an even younger generation is following.
From giving the three-finger salute of protest when the national anthem plays at school to tying white ribbons in their hair and on school bags as symbols of protest, high school students have rallied to the campaign.
Many left school to join Thursday's protest - among them 18-year-old Tan, who came along after finishing school exams. He declined to give his full name for fear of reprisals.

""I make sure I’m prepared for exams before I go to protests. I have to give importance to both things,"" he said. ""We can’t let it go on like this, or it will never end.""

LAGOS/ABUJA (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters marched to the gates of Nigeria's parliament on Thursday, hours after the army said it was ready to step in and restore order after more than a week of demonstrations against police brutality.
The protest defied a ban on mass rallies in the capital Abuja that the government said was imposed earlier on Thursday to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Chanting crowds also blocked roads and waved flags and banners in the commercial hub Lagos, where protesters reported clashing with unidentified men wielding weapons. 
Video on social media appeared to show men coming out of a bus and chasing protesters, though Reuters could not verify the footage.
""We have suffered enough. We youths want to stand - no more brutality,"" one demonstrator, Obinna Paul, said in another part of the city where crowds blocked a toll gate funnelling traffic to and from the main airport. 
Lagos state governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu said on Twitter he condemned the attacks on peaceful protesters ""by armed and unscrupulous elements trying to cause chaos"".
Lagos state set up a 200 million naira ($525,000) compensation fund for victims of police brutality, a core demand of protesters, and a presidential spokesman said on Twitter that the government had directed all governors to establish victim compensation funds. He also said judicial panels of inquiry would investigate police brutality.
Late on Wednesday, the military issued a statement titled ""Nigerian Army warns subversive elements and trouble makers"".
""The NA (Nigerian Army) is ready to fully support the civil authority in whatever capacity to maintain law and order and deal with any situation decisively,"" it said.
Protesters have staged daily marches since Wednesday last week, calling for an overhaul of police forces. 
Police had responded to the demonstrations with beatings, tear gas and gunfire, which human rights group Amnesty International said had killed at least 10 people. But the police agreed on Tuesday to stop using force against protesters.
In response to the protests, the head of Nigeria's police force on Sunday dissolved the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a unit that demonstrators have accused of beatings, killings and extortion.
Demonstrators have called for more meaningful reforms. Protesters say they fear a new unit, whose creation to ""fill the gaps"" left by SARS was announced on Tuesday, was just a rebranding of the squad.

This week, the Taliban launched a major offensive in Helmand, attempting to take the provincial capital and ensuing fighting had displaced thousands of civilians. 
U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter that he and General Scott Miller, the commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan, had held several meetings with the Taliban. 
""We agreed to re-set actions by strictly adhering to implementation of all elements of the U.S.-Taliban Agreement and all commitments made,"" he said. ""At present too many Afghans are dying. With the re-set, we expect that number to drop significantly.""
This week the United States took part in airstrikes against the Taliban at the start of the offensive in Helmand, during which Taliban forces took major checkpoints and closed in on the provincial capital.
A February deal between the United States and the Taliban said foreign forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government.
Diplomats and officials have warned that rising violence is sapping the trust required for successful peace talks in Doha.
In a sign that negotiations were continuing, a Taliban spokesman and an Afghan government negotiator said on Wednesday some of their negotiators had met after a pause to discuss disputed issues and ""present solutions"".
But a tweet last week by President Donald Trump calling for U.S. troops to be home by Christmas has given the Taliban the upper hand in negotiations, the top Afghanistan peace official told the Financial Times newspaper.
""Nobody has given any clarity,"" Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan's High Council for National Reconciliation, said in an interview published by the Financial Times on Thursday.
The Taliban ""might see it in their advantage"" and come back by force if the United States withdrew, he said. 
A senior Afghan government official who declined to be named said Trump's demands on Twitter were ""impractical"".

""(It) contradicts realities on the ground and it was purely for a U.S. audience and it does not reflect on overall U.S. policy for Afghanistan,"" he said.

Hundreds of firefighters including residents and students have been battling to extinguish the blaze.
Kilimanjaro rises to almost 6,000 metres (20,000 feet) above sea level and attracts about 50,000 climbers a year.
On Tuesday, Alex Kisingo, an official at a school near the mountain, said calmer weather was helping accelerate firefighters' efforts, giving hope that the inferno could be vanquished soon. But success has remained elusive.

Speaking to the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank, the Saudi foreign minister also said he hoped it may soon be possible to resolve a dispute that led Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to sever political, trade and transport ties with Qatar in mid-2017.
The four accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and cozying up to regional foe Iran. Doha denies the charges and says the embargo by its fellow Gulf Arabs aims to undermine its sovereignty.
""We hope ... that we are able to find a path forward to address the legitimate security concerns ... that drove us to take the decisions we took,"" he said. ""I think there is a path towards that and we are hoping that we can find that in the relatively near future.""

Asked when that might happen, he replied: ""Your guess is as good as mine.""

Data from the health ministry, which includes new cases and deaths in the past 24 hours and adds to the total retroactively, also showed the death toll rising by 140 to 33,553. 
Still, the number of daily infections in the pandemic's hotspot in Western Europe has come down somewhat from a peak of over 16,000 on Sept. 18, according to health ministry charts. 
""Spain is stabilising, but the territorial differences are important. We cannot let our guard down. In none of the regions we have the incidence indicators we'd like to have,"" health emergency coordinator Fernando Simon told a briefing.
Catalonia, which includes Spain's second-largest city of Barcelona, has ordered bars and restaurants to close for 15 days to try to curb a surge in coronavirus cases and the region's top court on Thursday gave its go-ahead to the new restrictions from 1 a.m. on Friday. 
Hospitality sector workers have called a protest rally for Friday.
The capital Madrid and nearby suburbs were put into partial lockdown last week, and residents feared any further drastic measures would kill off the economy.
""The economy will go backwards,"" health worker Victoria Maria told Reuters, expressing her fear of more restrictive measures. 

""They have to evaluate it and find solutions for all of us because if not we will be ruined, not only health-wise but also economically.""

489,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 01:09PM ET</span>",Ardern Set For Big Election Win as Voters Reward Covid Success,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern looks set for a resounding election victory on Saturday as voters applaud her masterful handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Ardern’s Labour Party had 46% support in the latest opinion poll while the main opposition National Party had 31%. With its ally the Green Party on 8%, Labour is on track for a comfortable majority in parliament.
New Zealand’s success in crushing community transmission of Covid-19 stands in stark contrast to countries like the U.K., U.S. and even neighboring Australia, where authorities are still battling to contain the virus. That hasn’t been lost on voters, who have mobbed Ardern on the campaign trail in a repeat of the “Jacinda-mania” that accompanied her rise to power three years ago.
“For so many voters it comes down to Ardern,” said Bryce Edwards, a political analyst at Victoria University in Wellington. “Her leadership during this crisis has led to what we’re seeing, which is a landslide for Labour.”
Polling stations in the nation of five million people close at 7 p.m. local time Saturday and a provisional result is due around midnight.
Jacinda-mania Is Back in New Zealand
Ardern, 40, has captured the hallowed center ground in New Zealand politics with a blend of empathetic leadership and skilled crisis management that has also won her fame abroad. The pandemic has given her a stage on which to display that leadership, drowning out criticism that she hasn’t delivered on some key promises during her first term in office.
Ardern has put the government’s pandemic response at the forefront of her bid for a second term, urging voters to trust it to keep the virus out and navigate an economic recovery.
Her opponent, National Party leader Judith Collins, has offered temporary tax cuts to spur growth while attacking Ardern for policy failures.
Both major parties are pledging massive spending on infrastructure to boost the economy. With government debt set to spiral, Labour would impose a higher tax rate on income over NZ$180,000 ($120,000) a year to raise more revenue.
The challenges ahead are enormous. The border remains closed to foreigners, crippling the key tourism industry, and unemployment is forecast to rise. But Collins, 61, hasn’t been able to gain traction with voters still focused on Ardern’s pandemic success.
The Woman Seeking to Dethrone Political Superstar Jacinda Ardern
In the battle against Covid-19, Ardern was alone among her western peers in pursuing an explicit elimination strategy and imposed one of the strictest nationwide lockdowns in the world.
The economy suffered its most severe contraction since the Great Depression, slumping 12.2% in the second quarter, but the lockdown wiped out community spread of the virus and restrictions were removed sooner than in many other countries. After more than 100 days without community transmission, an outbreak flared in largest city Auckland, but that was also quickly stamped out.
New Zealand has now gone three weeks without any cases in the community, with all new infections limited to returned overseas travelers undergoing mandatory quarantine. The nation has recorded just 25 coronavirus deaths.
Under Ardern, New Zealand has taken a nuanced foreign-policy stance toward China, trying not to antagonize its largest trading partner while staying in line with the U.S. and its other western allies in the Five Eyes alliance. This approach has so far helped it to avoid the souring of relations Australia is currently experiencing with Beijing.
Labour’s ascendancy under Ardern has overshadowed her current coalition partner New Zealand First, which at 3% is polling below the 5% it needs to be returned to parliament. The election may therefore bring the curtain down on the political career of its leader, Winston Peters, a maverick who’s often held the balance of power.
The libertarian ACT Party has seen its fortunes rise at the expense of both New Zealand First and National. ACT had 8% support in the latest poll.
Ardern’s Cabinet Set to Swing Left as Greens Eye Power
New Zealand’s proportional representation electoral system lends itself to coalitions, with no party managing to secure an outright majority since its introduction in 1996. Labour is expected to govern with the Greens, which may see the next administration address issues such as poverty and climate change more actively.
Ardern has been criticized for failing to deliver the transformational government she promised at the outset of her first term.
She ditched plans for a capital gains tax that might have addressed the widening gap between rich and poor. A program to build tens of thousands of new homes to help fix a housing crises fell well short of goals, and environmental groups say her climate-change policies are too tame.
“They have been timid in pushing things through on poverty and housing,” said Shamubeel Eaqub, an economist and public policy consultant at Sense Partners in Auckland. “But if you think there are risks on the horizon and there will be more crises to deal with, you want someone you think is going to be a good leader under pressure. I think Ardern has earned that trust and confidence.”

490,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 12:41PM ET</span>","Three years on, Malta awaits justice for slain journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia","By Crispian Balmer and Stephen Grey
VALLETTA (Reuters) - When a bomb exploded on the island of Malta three years ago, killing a campaigning journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, it sent a tremor across Europe, seeming to sum up a growing criminal threat to those who challenged corruption.
In the days after the Oct. 16, 2017, attack, family and friends questioned whether the murderers would ever be found. In the previous 15 years, there had been 27 other criminal explosions on Malta that had killed five people. Only two of the cases had been solved, police records show.
Fast forward three years, and, while no-one has been convicted, three men have been charged with planting and triggering the bomb, while one of the country's richest businessmen, Yorgen Fenech, is in jail accused of masterminding her death. They deny the charges.
In addition, a self-confessed ""middleman"" named Melvin Theuma has been given a presidential pardon in return for providing evidence, including hours of secret recordings of conversations between himself and Fenech.
Paul Caruana Galizia, one of Daphne's three sons, said the truth was emerging, albeit painfully slowly. ""Those who wanted to silence my mother made a terrible miscalculation,"" he said.
Still, evidence from preliminary hearings and a parallel public inquiry, set up by Malta's government, has done little to assuage concerns raised by Caruana Galizia's reporting that the smallest country in the European Union may be riddled with corruption.
Legal hearings since the arrest last November of Fenech have portrayed a police investigation bedeviled by leaks. Fenech is a 38-year-old multimillionaire with an array of holdings, including a stake in the country's main electricity generator, Electrogas Malta. Evidence presented by the prosecution and Fenech's defence team indicated that the accused men had access to inside knowledge throughout the police inquiry of Caruana Galizia's murder, including tip-offs about imminent arrests and surveillance. This inside knowledge, court evidence suggests, led the accused to use encryption for their phone calls and to wipe devices of data.
In court testimony, Theuma stated that most of the inside information was shared by Fenech, who was kept informed by Keith Schembri, the chief of staff of Malta's then prime minister, Joseph Muscat. In testimony to police, presented to court, Fenech said Schembri passed on ""a great deal of information"" about the investigation to him, including that Fenech's phone was tapped and a warning to be careful. Questioned under oath, Schembri denied leaking. He says he never discussed the case with Fenech, or with anyone not officially briefed by police.
Separately, the public inquiry, which is examining the background to Caruana Galizia's death, has heard that law enforcement authorities were reluctant to investigate her accusations of corruption, in particular those she raised against Schembri and the former energy minister, Konrad Mizzi. As previously reported https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-daphne-offshore-exclusive/exclusive-mystery-company-named-by-murdered-maltese-journalist-is-linked-to-power-station-developer-idUKKCN1NE196 by Reuters, Caruana Galizia accused Schembri and Mizzi of setting up offshore companies with the intention of accepting bribes. Caruana Galizia didn't provide proof, and both men deny the accusations.
Although no evidence has emerged that links Mizzi to the murder case, police have told the courts Schembri is a ""person of interest."" Schembri has been twice arrested and released without charge. The first arrest, in December 2019, was in connection with the murder; the most recent arrest, in September 2020, followed the freezing of his assets in a separate probe after a court found ""reasonable suspicion"" of money laundering.
Schembri denies any wrongdoing and any knowledge of the murder or its perpetrators.
Fenech denies the charges against him of complicity to murder. Instead, his lawyers have accused Schembri of instigating the murder. Under interrogation, according to police testimony, Fenech quoted Schembri as telling him: ""Find someone to kill Daphne."" Fenech, police testified, had told them the contract for the murder was 150,000 euros. Fenech didn't elaborate, police said.
Under the legal procedure, Fenech has not yet been required to file his defence or fully explain how he will contest the accusations. Wayne Jordash, a lawyer for Fenech, said the testimony of Theuma, the self-professed middleman in the plot, was ""replete with unreliable claims and unexplained contradictions."" Jordash said Fenech ""urges the most scrupulous of investigations to identify the perpetrators of this terrible crime. He is confident that such an investigation will demonstrate his innocence.""
The close friendship between Fenech and Schembri led, after Fenech's arrest, to the resignation of Prime Minister Muscat in December 2019. Muscat said he was stepping down to ""shoulder political responsibility."" Muscat, court evidence showed, was also an acquaintance of Fenech. They shared friendly WhatsApp messages, and Muscat invited Fenech to a birthday party in February 2019, even as Fenech was already under police suspicion of masterminding the killing.
Muscat, who was kept informed by police and the country's security service of the investigation's progress, said he had been told by the security service to act normally towards Fenech to avoid tipping him off.
CRUCIAL DECISIONS
In the hours after Caruana Galizia's killing, the most consequential decision made by Maltese authorities was to summon outside help, including from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and the European Union's law enforcement agency, Europol. Using technology the Maltese lacked, foreign experts quickly concluded how the bomb was detonated and traced the mobile phones involved.
By December 2017, the alleged triggermen were arrested. Four months later one of them, Vince Muscat, hoping for an official pardon, told police and told Reuters https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-daphne-confession-exclusive/exclusive-daphne-murder-accused-details-plot-to-kill-for-150000-euros-idUKKBN1Y21HL, via intermediaries, that Theuma, a taxi driver, had set up the hit. Separate investigations by local police and journalists showed that Theuma had written a will the day after the men were arrested, but police said in the months that followed they struggled to find firm evidence to arrest him.
Two senior political sources and two security officials involved in the case told Reuters that Europol grew frustrated at the failure by Malta to detain him and threatened to pull out of the investigation unless action was taken. A spokesman for the Hague-based Europol declined to comment, but said the organisation had ""dedicated hundreds of man-days in operational support"" to the case and was still actively involved.
Theuma was finally arrested in November 2019. He later testified he had been warned by Fenech to scrub his phone and devices, saying: ""Be 100% sure everywhere is clean."" The arrest took place two days earlier than Theuma expected and he was found holding a box of computer devices that contained conversations he said he had secretly recorded with Fenech.
Theuma asked for a pardon in return for the evidence, and this was rapidly given. On Nov. 19, Fenech was arrested on his yacht as he was sailing out of Malta. He has denied he was fleeing the country, but Maltese police official Inspector Kurt Zahra told a court in August there was a message on his phone asking relatives to take care of his children.
Under Maltese law, police must lay out all their evidence against a suspect before a magistrate, who then decides whether to sanction a trial. Anything prosecutors want to bring before an eventual jury must first be presented in the preliminary hearing.
This process has been completed for the suspected hitmen, and they could be put on trial in the first half of next year. It might take many months before Fenech is indicted.
Meanwhile, Malta Police maintain they are still working intensively on the case. Inspector Rodienne Haidon, a spokesperson, said ""investigations into the murder of Ms Caruana Galizia are still very active,"" with weekly coordination meetings held with Europol. Under a new commissioner, Angelo Gafa, appointed this year, the number of teams dedicated to fighting money laundering had been tripled, she said.
KILLED FOR FUTURE REVELATIONS?
Among the mysteries that remain: the motive for killing Caruana Galizia.
Caruana Galizia only mentioned Fenech once in the blog where she published many of her investigative reports. But she took repeated aim against Schembri, the former chief of staff to the prime minister, including in her very last post before her death. She also regularly wrote about Electrogas Malta, the power station company, which had received a 360 million euro loan guarantee from Muscat's administration. Caruana Galizia believed that a state power supply contract with Electrogas Malta was rigged in the company's favour and the loan guarantee was ""truly shocking."" Electrogas says an internal review found no signs of corruption.
Inspector Zahra testified that Caruana Galizia had received in 2017 a leaked cache of over 600,000 emails related to Electrogas. This was a year after Caruana Galizia's revelations that Schembri and Mizzi owned companies in Panama. She reported that through these entities, Schembri and Mizzi expected to receive 2 million euros a year from a mysterious company called 17 Black. The two men denied wrongdoing and said they had never received any money. An investigation https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-malta-daphne-offshore-exclusive/exclusive-mystery-company-named-by-murdered-maltese-journalist-is-linked-to-power-station-developer-idUKKCN1NE196 by Reuters and the Times of Malta in 2018, a year after Caruana Galizia's death, revealed that Fenech owned 17 Black.
Although no proof has emerged about the motive for the assassination, police told the court that Caruana Galizia was likely killed not for what she had written so far, but for what she was still investigating. ""That's why we believe that she was killed, because of something she was about to reveal,"" Zahra told the court.

491,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 12:32PM ET</span>",Italy condemns detention of fishermen seized off eastern Libya,"By Angelo Amante
ROME (Reuters) - Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio accused Khalifa Haftar's administration in eastern Libya of ""unacceptable"" behaviour on Thursday for detaining 18 sailors who were seized while fishing in the southern Mediterranean.
Libyan patrol boats detained two Sicilian fishing boats on Sept. 1 and brought the crews to Benghazi, where the military commander Haftar holds sway. The men were accused of operating in Libya's territorial waters -- a fact disputed by Italy.
Relatives of the sailors, who include Italians and Tunisians, have set up camp outside parliament to draw attention to the case amid reports that Haftar wants Italy to hand over four convicted human traffickers in return for freeing the fishermen.
""Detaining people who violate a self-proclaimed zone is unacceptable ... just as it would be unacceptable if someone were to tell us that they will release the Italians if we release their nationals,"" Di Maio told parliament.
Khaled al-Mahjoub, a spokesman for Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), said the fishermen had acted illegally. ""Entering regional economic waters is a crime,"" he told Reuters.
Rosetta Incargiola told Reuters her son Pietro Marrone was captain of one of the boats, the Medinea, which had been seeking highly prized red prawns in the Mediterranean.
""My son has called me just once, 16 days after his arrest. He told me he was fine, but he asked us to do everything to help them,"" Incargiola said outside parliament. ""The government must do something immediately. We are suffering a lot.""
The fishing grounds have been disputed since 2005, when Libya's then ruler, Muammar Gaddafi, unilaterally extended Libyan territorial waters to 74 nautical miles offshore from 12. Haftar, who controls eastern Libya, is trying to enforce this.
Rome has never recognised the revised boundary and the owner of the Medinea, Marco Marrone, said his boat was 40 miles north of Benghazi when it was seized.
Libya has been without strong central rule since Gaddafi was toppled in 2011 and rival camps have set up parallel administrations in the east and west since 2014. 
Italy has publicly backed the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and has had difficult relations with Haftar. It has sought to work with both administrations to try to slow the flow of illegal migrants to Italy.
Italian media reported that Haftar wanted the release of four Libyans who were arrested in Sicily in 2015 and subsequently sentenced to up to 30 years in jail for allegedly organising a crossing that resulted in the deaths of dozens of migrants.
The four men denied being people smugglers, saying they were soccer players looking to join European clubs.

Al-Mahjoub declined to comment on any possible exchange deal, but said the families of the imprisoned quartet had asked the Libyan authorities to intervene on their behalf.

The Suedkurier newspaper, citing several sources, reported that Navalny was staying in a holiday home in Ibach, a municipality in southwestern Germany, near the Swiss border.
The Ibach mayor wrote on the municipality's website: ""Since this week a guest, a person of public life and public interest, is staying with his family in Ibach. They require a very high level of personal protection.""
A Reuters witness said several police vehicles were parked on Thursday in the village of Oberibach, part of the district, and police had sealed off a section.
Navalny, 44, was flown to Berlin from Russia for treatment after he fell ill on a flight on Aug. 20. The global chemical weapons watchdog subsequently confirmed he was poisoned with a new, undeclared variant in the Novichok group of toxins.
Following his release from Berlin's Charite hospital, he vowed to return to Russia.
The European Union and Britain imposed sanctions on Russian officials over the poisoning on Thursday. 
The Kremlin condemned the sanctions as a deliberate and unfriendly step against Moscow and said it would retaliate.

Srinagar, INDIA (Reuters) - Kashmir’s main political parties announced a grand alliance on Thursday to seek a peaceful restoration of its autonomy after India's release of the last major Kashmiri political leader from lengthy detention. 
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government revoked the Muslim-majority region’s special status last year, cracked down on opposition and rounded up hundreds of people to forestall protests. 
On Tuesday, the government ordered the release of Mehbooba Mufti after a 14-month detention and she and other leaders promptly called for a campaign to restore Kashmir’s special rights.
""Our battle is a constitutional battle. We want the government of India to return to the people of the state (of Kashmir) the rights they held before 5th August, 2019,"" said former Kashmiri chief minister Farooq Abdullah. 
Modi’s government said at the time that ending Kashmir’s special status was necessary for closer integration of the Himalayan mountain territory into the rest of India.
After revoking Kashmir's autonomy, the New Delhi government imposed a communication blackout with mobiles phones, internet links and landlines cut as part of its crackdown.

Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, both former chief ministers, were released by authorities earlier this year.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's King Philippe has met his half-sister Delphine for the first time after she won a years-long legal battle to prove that they have the same father, earning recognition as a princess.
The two met last Friday at the palace in the Brussels suburb of Laeken, the royal household said on Thursday.
""It was a warm meeting. We had the chance to get to know each other during a long and rich exchange where we spoke about our respective lives and our common interests,"" the king and Delphine said in a joint statement.

Delphine, a Belgian artist, fought a seven-year legal battle to prove that former King Albert II, who abdicated in 2013, is her father. After a DNA test showed that the 86-year-old is, a court granted her the title of princess earlier this month.
She has since changed her surname from Boel to Saxe-Cobourg, her father's family name. 
Until then, she said her father and siblings, including King Philippe, had refused to communicate with her and she was not expecting anything from them.

""However if suddenly they showed signs of life I would never turn my back to them,"" she told a news conference last week.

Righteous Among the Nations is a title awarded by Israel's World Holocaust Remembrance Center (Yad Vashem) to non-Jews who risked their own lives to help rescue Jews during the Holocaust. 
The event, hosted at the House of Memory for Upper Silesian Jews in the town of Gliwice, was shrouded in secrecy to avoid any controversy or protests linked to Polanski, who has been sought by the United States for decades on rape charges. 
In 1943, Polanski, only 10 years old at the time, escaped the Krakow Ghetto where his family was stuck for much of World War Two. Stefania and Jan Buchala, poor farmers in the village of Wysoka, hid him from 1943 to the end of the war.
""Without thinking, but only from love for another person, Stefania risked her life, that of her husband and children, by hiding me in her house for almost two years,"" Polanski wrote in his request to Yad Vashem to have the couple honoured. 
""Despite their poverty and lack of food, she took care to hide and feed me,"" he wrote.
Polanski visited their village several times after the war in the hope of finding the Buchalas but without success. 
Polanski, now 87, presented the award to Stanislaw Buchala, the grandson of the Buchalas, who both died in 1953.
Sister Zofia Szczygielska, a Catholic nun who helped save many Jewish children, was also posthumously honoured at Thursday's ceremony.
Some 7,112 Poles have received the Righteous Among the Nations honour.
Polanski's mother, Bula Katz-Przedborska, was murdered at the Nazi death camp Auschwitz. His father, Maurice Liebling, was sent to the Mathausen concentration camp, which he survived. 
Polanski, who holds French and Polish citizenship, fled the United States in 1978 after being charged with the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl, and has never returned. Several other women have accused him in recent years of sexual misconduct, all of which he has denied.
Despite the allegations, Polanski won an Oscar in 2003 for directing World War Two drama ""The Pianist"" as well as a best director award at France's Cesar Awards in February that caused several women to walk out in protest.

The documentary ""is from the beginning to the end a fabricated film which aimed to cast a slur on the image of the DPRK,"" the North Korean Embassy in Stockholm said in a letter sent to Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet, using the country's official acronym.
When contacted by Reuters, an official at the embassy declined comment, referring only to the letter sent to Ekstra Bladet.
""The Mole"", by maverick filmmaker Mads Bruegger, charts what he said was a 10-year undercover operation by a retired Danish chef to infiltrate a network of sanctions-breakers linked to the head of the Korean Friendship Association (KFA), an international group that promotes friendly ties with Pyongyang.
In the documentary, the former chef, Ulrich Larsen, pretends to be a supporter of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and joins the Friendship Association, becoming a trusted member.
The film then shows him hiring a former French Foreign Legion soldier to play an arms trader and the two travelling to North Korea for meetings about possible arms deals, apparently winning the trust of North Korean officials.
No deals were consummated before the undercover operation ended. After the documentary was aired on Sunday evening, Bruegger said he was keen to show to interested authorities ""an enormous"" amount of material not included in the film.
The foreign ministers of Sweden and Denmark said they would raise the issue of sanctions busting at the United Nations and European Union.
The North Korean letter said the embassy was ""outraged"" by footage in the documentary that shows an embassy official appearing to get involved in illegal activities. 
A release of the full recording of the meeting will make it ""crystal clear who is telling lies,"" the letter said, urging Danish authorities to ""solve this issue"".
""(Larsen) is completely out of reach and has disappeared but he must be in Scandinavia or somewhere in Europe and it will be easy for Danish authorities to find him,"" the letter added.
The head of the Korean Friendship Association also denied any involvement in alleged sanctions-busting.

Earlier this year she started ""Metfasal Leek"" - Arabic for ""Tailored for you"" - a clothing line that she says is the first of its kind in Egypt.
Al-Abhar, 43, said after working with various companies on ways to cater for people with disabilities, she had noticed that they were not being served by clothing manufacturers.
""People with short stature would struggle to find their sizes in the market,"" she said.
She is using volunteers to test the clothes, giving them free samples, ahead of a planned commercial launch. 
One volunteer, Ziad Hamdy, struggles with a disability that prevents him from using his hands and fingers easily.

In the senate, Rodrigues represents the state of Roraima and has also been chosen as deputy leader for the agenda of the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who won the presidency campaigning heavily on ending the corruption of previous governments.
Rodrigues confirmed in a statement that his house was raided, without giving details. He denied wrongdoing and said he had been clean throughout his 30 years in politics.
His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cash allegedly found down his pants, an incident that was widely reported in major Brazilian newspapers, citing unnamed sources. 
The federal police declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of the investigation. In a statement on Wednesday, the police said they had carried out raids as part of an investigation into the possible misuse of congressional funding directed to the health secretary in Roraima to pay for the COVID-19 response.
On Thursday, Bolsonaro said the police raid was evidence that his government was fighting graft.
""There is no corruption in my government and we fight corruption, whoever it is,"" he told supporters outside his official residence.
Bolsonaro's anti-graft credentials have faltered since the presidential campaign. His former justice minister Sergio Moro, an immensely popular ex-judge who was known for his tough stance on corruption, resigned earlier this year, alleging Bolsonaro had sought to interfere in a police investigation for personal gain, an allegation Bolsonaro denies.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A mixed martial arts specialist is challenging a Pakistani ban on TikTok, the video sharing app on which he was pinning his hopes of gaining a mass audience and helping people get fit.
The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) last week blocked access to TikTok, which is owned by China-based ByteDance, citing unspecified public complaints about ""immoral and indecent content"".
Muhammad Ashfaq Jutt, 34, told Reuters he joined TikTok a year ago because it was becoming a popular platform and was cheaper than traditional advertising. 
""All kinds of people, from street sweepers to day labourers, have come to be world-famous using TikTok so I thought this was a good way to be known as well,"" Jutt said.
Jutt's petition, which he lodged on Wednesday and was seen by Reuters, calls for guidelines on exactly how content is declared objectionable and his lawyer Usama Khawar said he is hopeful the High Court in Islamabad will overturn the ban. 
""The judges asked rhetorically in court, if TikTok can be banned even though it has millions of videos because of a few offensive ones, why can't the whole internet be shut down?"" , Khawar said on Thursday.
TikTok has been downloaded more than 43 million times in Pakistan, analytics firm Sensor Tower said, while the PTA said it is the third most popular social media app after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and WhatsApp, with over 20 million active accounts.
Although he only has 209 followers so far, Jutt hoped to use TikTok to reach ordinary Pakistanis, joining a growing community of influencers in the country, some with millions of followers.
'INTO SHAPE'
Jutt, who has been practicing mixed martial arts for 26 years, is the Senior Vice President of the Pakistan Kickboxing Federation, and says he has won several international titles.
He runs three kickboxing centres in the eastern city of Lahore, including one teaching women self-defence, and his personal training clients include soldiers, police officers, and government officials.
His short-lived TikTok account featured clips of him doing jumping jacks and push-ups, and sparring with students.
""I thought this was a good way for me to help Pakistan, to help people get into shape,"" Jutt said, adding: ""It was going well but then the government decided to ban TikTok.""
Critics say the government's move against platforms such as TikTok is not only against freedom of expression, but has also hurt financially. 
PTA, which in September blocked five apps including Tinder and Grindr for disseminating ""immoral content"", said this week it had met with TikTok's senior management to discuss efforts to ""improve content moderation"". 

It also blocked the popular PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds game but reversed the ban after the Islamabad High Court struck it out. The same court is now hearing Jutt's petition challenging the TikTok ban, which is scheduled for next week.

SANAA/GENEVA (Reuters) - Planes carrying prisoners exchanged by the warring parties in Yemen took off from three airports on Thursday in an operation to return about 1,000 men home and help build the trust to enable fresh talks to end a devastating war.
The Saudi-led military coalition and Yemen's Houthi movement agreed last month in Switzerland to exchange 1,081 prisoners, including 15 Saudis, in the largest swap of its kind in the five-year-old conflict.
In an operation managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross, two airplanes carrying members of the coalition freed from detention took off from the airport in the Houthi-held capital, Sanaa, a Reuters witness said.
""This operation that means so much to so many families is under way,"" Fabrizio Carboni, ICRC regional director for the Middle East, told Reuters, speaking from Sanaa airport.
""It is quite remarkable because they are doing this while a conflict is still active.""
One of the airplanes was carrying Saudi and Sudanese detainees and flew to Saudi Arabia. The other plane flew to Sayoun airport in government-held Hadramout region.
An airplane carrying Houthis released from captivity by the coalition departed Sayoun, and a second arrived from Abha airport in Saudi Arabia, another Reuters witness and sources said.
The ICRC later said in Twitter posts that 484 prisoners had been exchanged via a total of five planes taking off from Sayoun, Sanaa and Abha. More flights are scheduled over the next two days, it added.
Under the deal, the Iran-aligned Houthi group is to release around 400 people while the coalition would free 681 Houthi fighters. 
TRUST-BUILDING
Houthi spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said the swap ""brings hope for peace-building"".
A coalition statement, which confirmed that the plane carrying 15 Saudis and four Sudanese had landed in an airbase in Riyadh, stressed the ""political and military leaderships’ keenness for the return of all POWs and detainees.""
The warring sides had agreed at peace talks in 2018 to swap some 15,000 detainees split between both sides as part of trust-building measures to pave the way for political negotiations to end the conflict, but there has been slow progress on the pact.
In a statement, U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths said he hoped the parties would soon reconvene under U.N. auspices to discuss the release of all war-related prisoners and detainees.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in Sanaa in late 2014, prompting the Western-backed coalition to intervene in March 2015.
The conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in military stalemate for years with the Houthis holding most big urban centres.
The war has killed more than 100,000 people and spawned what the United Nations says is the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
With the conflict's effects intensified by deadly outbreaks of cholera and now COVID-19, some 24 million Yemenis, 80% of the population, require aid, while 20 million lack sufficient food supplies and access to clean water, Carboni said.

ICRC, acting as a neutral intermediary, deployed more than 70 staff and volunteers who conducted medical checks - including providing protective equipment and other measures to guard against the risk of corornavirus infection - and held one-on-one interviews to ensure the detainees wanted to be sent home.​

Le Maire also said that companies in the beleaguered hospitality industry would be exempt from social charges if their revenues crashed by more than 50% as a result of the curfews.
The curfews are President Emmanuel Macron's response to a dilemma facing countries across Europe: how to keep the economy running and protect jobs while slowing the spread of infections and taking pressure off the creaking healthcare systems.
""The new measures will cost about 1 billion euros over the duration of the curfew,"" Le Maire told a news conference.
Le Maire also said he was asking banks to delay interest payments on state-guaranteed loans to struggling companies in the hotel, restaurant and events industries.
Prime Minister Jean Castex said people could break the curfew to travel to and from work, catch a train or plane, seek medical attention and even walk a dog - but an interior ministry exemption document would be needed in case of a police check.
France's interior minister said 12,000 police would enforce the curfews in Paris, Toulouse, Marseille, Montpellier, Grenoble, Rouen, Lille, Lyon and Saint-Etienne. In all, the curfew order covers about 20 million people, almost a third of France's population. 
Anyone breaking the curfew will be fined 135 euros

Sweden, which is not a member of NATO but enjoys close ties with the bloc, ran down its military after the end of the Cold War to save money. 
""We have a situation where the Russian side is willing to use military means to achieve political goals,"" Defence Minister Peter Hultqvist told reporters. ""Based on that, we have a new geo-political security situation to deal with.""
Hultqvist said the new proposals would mean an increase in the military budget of 27.5 billion Swedish crowns ($3.10 billion) by 2025.
Increased Russian activity in the Baltic Sea region has pushed Sweden into a hasty programme of rearmament, including the purchase of Patriot missiles from the United States. 
Last month, Sweden protested to Moscow after two warships entered its territorial waters without permission and has repeatedly complained about Russian military planes flying too close to its own aircraft and violating Swedish airspace.
The government said the military budget would be increased successively between 2021 and 2025, and would fund an expansion of military personnel to around 90,000 from the current 60,000, including a new mechanised brigade with updated artillery.
The navy will get an extra submarine, increasing the number to five, and the corvette fleet will be updated, while both the army and air force will get upgraded weapons systems.
In addition, the draft will be expanded to 8,000 a year by 2025, up from 4,000 in 2019. Sweden ended conscription in 2010, but reintroduced compulsory military service for a limited number of men and women in 2017.

The incident, which comes at a time of rising regional tensions, occurred as a UNI Air charter flight from southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung to the Pratas Islands was approaching Hong Kong's flight information region, Taiwan's Civil Aeronautics Administration said.
Hong Kong air traffic controllers told the captain there were ""dangerous activities"" happening below 26,000 feet and the aircraft could not enter, so for safety reasons he decided to turn back, the administration said in a statement.
Hong Kong had not issued a prior notice warning of activities that could affect flights, it added.
Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The weekly charter flights to the Pratas mostly carry Taiwan government and coastguard personnel and are not open for ordinary travellers to book.
The Pratas lie southeast of Hong Kong at the northern end of the South China Sea, and normally get far less attention than the more contested waters further south near the Paracel and Spratly Islands.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up military activities near Taiwan, including drills and regular air force missions close to the Pratas, which are only lightly defended by Taiwan.
The Pratas, the closest Taiwan-controlled territory to Hong Kong, have taken on extra significance since anti-government protests began in the Chinese-run city.
Taiwan has intercepted at least one boat close to the Pratas carrying people fleeing from Hong Kong trying to make their way to Taiwan.
Some Taiwanese officials have expressed concerns that China could seize the Pratas, in a drastic escalation of tensions that could lead to a war.

Turnover at his Parisian pizza restaurant was hammered by a three-month coronavirus lockdown in the spring, then came early closing, and now a nightly curfew.
All of which leaves him asking: ""What help are we going to get for our fixed expenses?""
President Emmanuel Macron ordered the nightly curfew in Paris and the surrounding area, as well as eight other cities, from Saturday to tackle the surging rate of infection in coronavirus hotspots. The curfew will run from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.
With more than 20,000 new infections daily and hospitals once again creaking under pressure, now was not the time for conviviality, the president said. 
The curfews are expected to be in place until Dec. 1. 
Jespas said the dinner sitting represented nearly two-thirds of his diner's daily receipts, and that on a typical night his restaurant only started filling up around 8 p.m. 
""So you can see that we'll lose at least 70% of what we make in the evening, and that's being optimistic,"" he said.
Macron said the curfew would mean no meals in restaurants, no parties, no cinema trips after 9 p.m. Private gatherings should be limited to six people.
French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire promised more government help for companies in the hospitality industry to get through the curfew. He said companies would be exempt from their social charges if revenues were down more than 50%. 
The head of the Paris regional health authority on Thursday described the infection curve as ""vertical"" and said intensive care units would come under heavy pressure in the next 10 days. 
Even so, the new restrictions split opinion amongst young people.

Nathanael Koffi, 25, said the measures would prove worthwhile if the spread slowed dramatically as a result.
""A month of sacrifice is not awful,"" he said.

Helicopters, military vehicles, search dogs and more than 600 soldiers have been deployed to hunt for signs of life after two mudslides on Monday in the central province of Thua Thien Hue, which trapped 17 construction workers and 13 troops sent to rescue them.
The authorities ""will mobilise all possible forces and equipment to search for all the remainder while maintaining safety for the rescuers and the equipment,"" Deputy Minister of Defense Phan Van Giang said a statement.
Intense rains since early October have caused floods and mudslides that have killed at least 49 people in central Vietnam, while more heavy rainfall is expected until early next week on several fronts.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia accused Turkey on Thursday of blocking flights carrying emergency aid from using its airspace, and new fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave threatened to pitch the region into a humanitarian crisis.
Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of violating a ceasefire brokered less than a week ago to enable the sides to swap detainees and the bodies of those killed in the clashes, which erupted on Sept.27.
The flare-up is the deadliest since the 1990s, when 30,000 people were killed in a war over Nagorno-Karabakh https://tmsnrt.rs/30GEXJd, a territory that is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but governed by ethnic Armenians.
(Graphic: Ethnic tensions in Nagorno-Karabakh, https://graphics.reuters.com/ARMENIA-AZERBAIJAN/xklpyqoddpg/armenia-azerbaijan-2020_ethnic.jpg)
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said on Twitter Armenia should ""halt attempts to capture liberated territories back,"" and warned of ""new victims and new bloodshed"".
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said its army had retained an ""operational advantage"" along the line of contact with Nagorno-Karabakh, but that the situation in the Aghdere-Aghdam and Fizuli-Hadrut-Jabrail directions remained tense.
The Azeri prosecutor's office said two civilians were wounded by shelling in Aghdam.
Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan accused the Azeri armed forces of artillery fire from the north and south-east, but said Nagorno-Karabakh's forces were taking ""appropriate counter-measures against the attacks"".
The Armenian prosecutor-general's office said Azeri drones had killed two soldiers in the Armenian region of Vardenis on Wednesday, raising the military death toll since Sept. 27 to five. The personnel were not involved in military action, it said.
Reuters could not independently verify the reports. 
HUMANITARIAN AID 
International organisations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, have warned that the conflict, coming on top of the COVID-19 pandemic, could leave tens of thousands of people in need of aid over coming months.
Zareh Sinanyan, Armenian High Commissioner for Diaspora Affairs, said the delivery of 100 tonnes of aid from the United States was being delayed as Turkey had prohibited Armenia-bound humanitarian aid flights over its airspace.
Armenia's civil aviation committee was told on Wednesday the Qatar Airways flight from Los Angeles was cancelled but gave no reasons, its head, Tatevik Revazyan, told Reuters. 
""We have grounds to claim that Turkey closed the air route deliberately,"" Revazyan said, adding that Armenia was seeking an alternative route over Russia or Georgia.
Turkey's foreign ministry, which handles airspace issues, was not immediately available to comment.
Aside from humanitarian concerns, fears are growing of Russia and Turkey being sucked in. Turkey's military exports to its Azeri ally have risen six-fold this year, data shows, and Armenia has a defence pact with Russia.
In a phone call on Wednesday with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, Russian leader Vladimir Putin expressed concerns about the participation of Middle East fighters in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, though Turkey and Azerbaijan deny the presence of such fighters.
The fighting is not far from Azeri pipelines which carry natural gas and oil to international markets. Aliyev accused Armenia on Wednesday of trying to attack the pipelines, a charge that Armenia denied.. 

Nagorno-Karabakh authorities say 604 defence personnel have been killed since Sept. 27. Azerbaijan said on Wednesday 43 civilians had been killed but has not disclosed military casualties.

512,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",WHO vaccine drive bedevilled by familiar question: who pays if things go wrong?,"By Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Who foots the bill if people in poor countries fall sick with unexpected side-effects from coronavirus vaccines? It's not clear and that's a big problem in the battle to beat COVID-19.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has so far left the question of financial claims unresolved as it seeks to ensure shots are fairly distributed around the world, according to confidential documents reviewed by Reuters and six people familiar with discussions.
A similar situation emerged during the H1N1 swine flu pandemic in 2009-10. Back then, fears about potential compensation costs stymied the WHO's efforts to get vaccines to low-income countries. Some health experts fear the U.N. body risks making the same mistake.
Under the WHO's COVID-19 vaccine plans, known as COVAX, 92 poor countries are eligible to access vaccines at lower or no costs until the end of 2021, but liability conditions remain vague.
Without clearly stated terms, governments of poor states may be on the hook for potential compensation claims, which could put them off participating in the WHO-led scheme and risk prolonging the pandemic in places ill-equipped to cope, health experts say. 
WHO and GAVI, a vaccine alliance which co-leads COVAX, said in a joint statement to Reuters that the scheme will try to solve liability and indemnification issues ""while addressing the financial obligations this may impose on AMC-eligible economies,"" referring to the group of 92 poorer states which includes most African and South-East Asian countries.
Vietnam, which is eligible for free or cheaper COVAX vaccines, is unlikely to use shots provided by the global facility, a Vietnamese health official told Reuters, saying supply deals it negotiated bilaterally with pharmaceutical companies were more transparent than COVAX's terms. 
Kenya, which is also eligible, said it was premature to say who should carry the liability for potential adverse effects but expected the vaccine makers to bear some of the responsibility, according to Rashid Aman, chief administrative secretary at the ministry of health.
Vastly underfunded -- COVAX has received about a quarter of the $16 billion the WHO and GAVI say it needs by the end of next year -- the scheme has left richer countries to fend for themselves when it comes to vaccine liability.
""Participants will be responsible for deployment and use of approved vaccines within their territories and assuming any liability associated with such use and deployment,"" according to a COVAX document seen by Reuters detailing the terms for countries that must pay to join.
The group includes European Union nations, China and also middle-income states, such as Argentina, Iran, Iraq, South Africa and Mexico.
""The consequence of this arrangement is that these countries may end up being liable to pay a very high hidden price if something goes wrong,"" a European Union senior official involved in talks with COVAX told Reuters.
This is one of the reasons why the EU has decided not to take delivery of vaccines through COVAX even though the 27-nation bloc has pledged money to the facility, the official said, noting that deals the EU is separately negotiating with vaccine companies involve clauses that make firms liable for potential compensation.
The United States has refused to fund COVAX and has instead sealed its own deals with drug companies, including offering a blanket legal immunity to COVID-19 vaccine makers in a bid to spur their investments in jabs.
China announced last week it would buy COVAX vaccines for 1% of its population.
A BARRIER FOR ACCESS?
There is no internationally approved COVID-19 vaccine, but the WHO estimates the first shot could be ready this year.
Adverse effects after a vaccine gets regulatory approval are rare but the speed at which COVID-19 shots are being pursued increases the risks of unforeseen conditions - and of large litigation costs.
During the H1N1 flu pandemic, the WHO struggled to get vaccines to dozens of poor countries partly because it had agreed with pharmaceutical companies that poorer nations would be on the hook for compensation claims just like richer countries, the organisation acknowledged in a 2011 report.
""Some recipient countries felt WHO did not adequately explain that liability provisions included in the recipient agreement were the same as the liability provisions accepted by purchasing countries,"" concluded the report of the WHO committee that reviewed the handling of the H1N1 flu pandemic.
Most of the estimated half million people who died from H1N1 were in poorer countries.
COVID-19 has so far infected nearly 38 million people and killed at least a million.
There are nearly 200 coronavirus vaccines in development and many governments acknowledge that drugmakers are taking big financial risks in developing and manufacturing at an unprecedented speed -- it usually takes 10-15 years to bring a vaccine to market -- shots that may not be successful.
There is broad consensus that some of these costs should be covered by taxpayers and many rich countries already have public or private funds that could pay indemnities to victims. 
But many poorer countries that have agreed to get vaccines through COVAX do not have such compensation schemes nor the financial resources to fund them. 
This means that they could either face costs for which they have no insurance, or that potential victims there might not be compensated at all.
""We are concerned how such arrangements could be a barrier for access to COVID-19 vaccines in lower and middle income countries that cannot or do not want to take on liability for the vaccines,"" Dimitri Eynikel of Doctors Without Borders, a medical non-governmental organisation, told Reuters. 
The Gates Foundation, one of WHO's largest funders, raised similar concerns in a meeting with health experts in September, a person who attended the meeting said.
""It is a high-priority for the foundation that (..)distribution issues are resolved to ensure that decisions impacting delivery are as effective as possible,"" a spokeswoman for the Gates Foundation told Reuters, adding that work was being done to address those issues.
In addition to potential compensation costs, the poorest countries that qualify for free or cheaper vaccines, are also required to chip in to buy vaccines with up to $2 billion by the end of 2021, a confidential GAVI document shows. 
Those unable to pay could be exempted next year, but later on they ""will be expected to co-finance COVID-19 vaccines with tiered contributions that reflect economies' ability to pay,"" according to the document, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.

Contributions from the poorest, which could be financed through loans and grants from international donors such as the World Bank, are expected to help plug the funding gap and achieve COVAX's goal of buying at least 2 billion shots by the end of next year from a dozen vaccine makers.

Some government bodies had since temporarily shut down internet services as a precaution, Abolghasem Sadeghi, from the government's Information Technology Organization, told state TV.
""The cyber attacks which happened on Monday and Tuesday are under investigation,"" Sadeghi said. They were ""important and on a large scale,"" he added.
Iran says it is on high alert for online assaults, which it has blamed in the past on the United States and other foreign states.
U.S. officials said in October 2019 that the United States had carried out a cyber attack on Iran after drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities, which Washington and Riyadh blamed on Tehran. Iran denied involvement in the attacks, which were claimed by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement. 
The United States and other Western powers have also accused Iran of trying to disrupt and break into their networks.
Sources told Reuters this April that hackers working in Iran's interests had targeted the personal email accounts of staff at the World Health Organization during the coronavirus outbreak. Tehran denied any involvement.

Tensions between Tehran and Washington have escalated since 2018 when U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.

In a direct message to Macron, who announced nightly curfews in virus hotspots on Wednesday, the protesters wrote on one banner: ""Hire more. Train more. We're exhausted.""
Macron said the curfews in the Paris region and eight other cities would drastically reduce the number of daily new coronavirus cases from the current 20,000 and ease the strain on intensive care units, without shutting down the economy.
COVID-19 patients now occupy nearly half of all intensive care beds in the greater Paris region, the head of the regional health authority said. Hospitals in the capital were being told to cancel a third of non-COVID procedures, Aurelien Rousseau told France Inter radio.
Healthcare workers are due to protest in Paris, Nantes and several other locations later on Thursday. Unions said there would be no major disruptions to hospital services.

515,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>",Greece blames Turkey for holding up foreign minister's plane,"ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece accused Turkey on Thursday of deliberately holding up a government aircraft carrying its foreign minister home from Iraq, leaving it circling for 20 minutes before granting it permission to cross Turkish airspace.
Turkey denied the accusation, saying the aircraft had taken off from Iraq without a flight plan but had been allowed to pass once one was procured.
Tensions between the two NATO allies, locked in a dispute over maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, have been simmering amid claims and counter-claims to marine areas thought to be rich in natural gas.
""It is one more provocation in Turkey's series of provocations,"" Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. ""I hope the incident is not repeated in the future.""
He said Greece's foreign ministry had complained to the Turkish authorities.
Turkish foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy dismissed the suggestion that the plane carrying Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias had been deliberately held up as a provocation to Athens.
""The plane in question took off from Iraq without presenting a flight plan. When the plane entered our air space, a flight plan was urgently requested from Iraqi authorities, and the flight was safely carried out after the plan was received,"" he said.
He said Turkey had granted permission to a Greek request for the minister's plane to pass over its air space en route to Iraq on October 14.
After that plane malfunctioned in Iraq, Greece sent a second aircraft which was also granted permission to fly through Turkish air space, ""with the same flight permission number, without any delay"", Aksoy said.
Separately on Thursday, France and Germany accused Turkey of continuing to provoke the European Union with its actions in the eastern Mediterranean, and gave it a week to clarify its positions.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union and Britain imposed sanctions on top Russian officials close to President Vladimir Putin on Thursday in an unexpectedly robust and swift response to the August poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.
Pushed by France and Germany, where Navalny was treated after collapsing on a flight from Siberia, the EU and Britain targeted six Russians and a state scientific research centre.
The Kremlin condemned the sanctions as a deliberate and unfriendly step against Moscow and promised retaliation.
Unlike the poisoning of a former Russian spy in Britain in 2018, when the EU took almost a year to sanction military intelligence agents, the bloc targeted officials it believes planned and helped carry out the poisoning. 
Despite Britain's departure from the EU, London is still coordinating some sanctions with the bloc, in part to avoid allowing those targeted to move their assets, diplomats say.
Andrei Yarin, head of the presidential policy directorate, Sergei Kiriyenko, Putin's first deputy chief of staff, Sergei Menyaylo, Putin's envoy to Siberia, Alexander Bortnikov, the director of Russia's Federal Security Service and two deputy defence ministers were targeted.
TRAVEL BANS AND ASSET FREEZES
The State Scientific Research Institute for Organic Chemistry and Technology was also sanctioned. 
""The deployment of a toxic nerve agent of the Novichok group would ... only be possible due to the failure of the Institute to carry out its responsibility to destroy the stockpiles of chemical weapons,"" the Official Journal said.
Moscow has rejected accusations that Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in an attempt to murder him and has said there were no grounds for sanctions.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said there was no logic to the decision and the sanctions had harmed relations.
Russian businessman Evgeny Prigozhin, who has been indicted in the United States for interfering with the 2016 U.S. elections, was also separately sanctioned by the EU, accused of breaking a United Nations arms embargo on Libya.
The travel bans and asset freezes confirmed a Reuters report on Wednesday. 
Paris and Berlin say they have not had a credible explanation from Moscow for what the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said was Novichok in Navalny's body.
In the 2018 British case of the poisoning of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter, traces of Novichok were also found.

Navalny is recovering in Germany.

PARIS (Reuters) - France and Germany accused Turkey on Thursday of continuing to provoke the European Union with its actions in the eastern Mediterranean, and gave it a week to clarify its positions. 
Despite an EU summit deal on Oct. 2 aimed at persuading Ankara to stop exploring for natural gas in waters disputed by Greece and Cyprus, Turkey said on Wednesday it was restarting operations of a survey ship.
Turkey withdrew the vessel last month, just before the EU summit, at which economic sanctions were discussed, only to redeploy it on Monday.
The bloc said it would review the possibility of sanctions on Turkey at a European summit in December.
""It's clear to us that Turkey is permanently carrying out provocative acts which are unacceptable,"" France's Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a news conference alongside his German and Polish counterparts. 
He said the ball was in Ankara's court, but that the European Union was ready to change the balance of power if Turkey didn't return to dialogue. 
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said Turkey's decision to send the vessel back to the Mediterranean was ""inadmissible"".
Asked about the possibility of bringing forward EU sanctions, he said the bloc would wait a week to decide how to react. 
""It's been twice that expected discussions have not taken place and we don't know when they will happen,"" he said. ""We must wait to see if there is progress in a week and then we'll see what attitude needs to be adopted by the EU.""
Le Drian criticised Turkey's role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, where it supports Azerbaijan against ethnic Armenians.

""There will not be a military victory on this issue so the ceasefire must be implemented,"" he said. ""What we can see today is the only country which isn't calling for respect of the ceasefire is Turkey and that's damaging.""

518,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Turkey clears way to test Russian S-400 defence system this week,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey has issued notices restricting air space and waters off its Black Sea coast to allow firing tests apparently on Friday involving its Russian-made S-400 missile defence units, a week after they were transported to the area.
While Turkey already tested the surface-to-air weapons last year, further exercises could stoke tensions with NATO ally the United States, which sharply opposed the purchase from Moscow on grounds the S-400s compromise NATO defence systems. 
Washington reacted last year by expelling Turkey from its F-35 jet programme and has threatened sanctions. The lira has remained near all-time lows since videos in local press last week showed the S-400s being hauled north from near Ankara. 
Turkey's air space notice, or NOTAM, restricts an area near the coastal city of Sinop for a radar test and possibly live-fire for six hours on Oct. 16. It advised aircraft to avoid the area to a height of 200,000 feet (61,000 metres). 
Earlier this week, Turkey issued a maritime notice for shooting training and two others for military training. The so-called NAVTEX notices said shooting training would be held Oct. 16-17. 
The S-400 surface-to-air defence system is one of the most advanced in the world with a medium to long-range radar that can spot and track incoming aircraft, directing a barrage of missiles at their targets to a range of 400 km (249 miles).
Turkey signed the S-400 deal with Russia in 2017. Deliveries of the first four missile batteries, worth $2.5 billion, began in July last year. Ankara has carried out radar tests previously but the shooting test will be a first.

Last week - after videos of the S-400 videos emerged and reports of the planned tests circulated - two U.S. senators called again for President Donald Trump's administration to impose sanctions on Turkey.

LHASA, China (Reuters) - Top officials in Chinese-administered Tibet on Thursday defended a vocational training program that some critics have called coercive, and urged Tibetans not to ""overdo"" religion, during a briefing with foreign journalists on a rare visit to the region.
The transfer program, which involves government-set quotas for labourers and includes a focus on ideological training, has riled rights groups and Tibetan activists outside China, who say it is coercive - an assertion China rejects. 
The program, aimed at lifting skills and incomes, has involved about 15 percent of Tibet's population of 3.51 million. China is embarked on a multi-year plan to eradicate deep poverty by the end of 2020.
""There is no element of coercion,"" Che Dhala, Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said in response to a question on whether nomads are forced to participate in the training programs, adding that people are trained in skills they want, such as driving or welding.
Che also said that Tibetans should not ""overdo"" religious consumption, and should follow the country's ruling Party for a ""happy life"".
Religion is a highly sensitive topic in Tibet, where the leader of Tibetan Buddhism, the Dalai Lama, fled following a failed uprising against the Chinese administration in 1959.
""As long as they work hard to get rich, listen to the party, follow the party, and get down to doing things, their future will be more beautiful,"" Che said during the briefing, where officials outlined poverty alleviation efforts.
""This kind of beautiful life needs to be achieved by correctly and rationally understanding religion. We hope that people will not overdo it, that is, religious consumption that exceeds the family's capacity,"" he said.
By the end of 2019, all 628,000 registered poor living in Tibet had been lifted out of poverty and their average annual income had risen to 9,328 yuan ($1,388), local officials said on Thursday. That compares with an average monthly salary of 10,000 yuan in Beijing.
Tibet is one of the most restricted and politically sensitive regions in the country, and foreign journalist visits are tightly controlled.
Asked about restrictions that bar foreigners from going to Tibet outside of government tours, Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region, said officials believed the region's environment was too dangerous for foreigners to travel independently.

LONDON (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth on Thursday was carrying out her first major engagement since a coronavirus lockdown in March, visiting the Porton Down military research facility which was involved in dealing with a 2018 Novichok nerve agent attack.
The 94-year-old monarch, who spent Britain's national lockdown at Windsor Castle, has carried out her official duties remotely by video or telephone, or at her palace, since social restrictions were introduced. For her first public outing, she was joined by her grandson Prince William.
The top secret Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (NYSE:LH), in Porton Down in southwest England, identified the nerve agent used to attack Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal in the nearby town of Salisbury two years ago.
Britain has accused two Russian agents backed by Moscow of carrying out the attack, a charge the Kremlin has rejected.
During their trip, the royals were due to meet the Porton Down staff and other military personnel who were involved in the Novichok clear-up operation along with scientists helping the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The formal purpose of the trip was to open the lab's new Energetics Analysis Centre, where the queen and the prince will be given a demonstration of a forensics explosives investigation.
They were also due to tour the lab's Energetic Enclosure to see a display of weaponry and tactics used in counter intelligence. 
Porton Down was founded in 1916 as Britain's chemical and biological weapons laboratory, where defence ministry scientists carried out secret experiments involving some 20,000 servicemen, leading to the death of one from exposure to sarin nerve gas.
Since the 1960s, it has focused on developing countermeasures and defence and security technology, although its secret structure has always led to speculation about its activities.
""No aliens, either alive or dead have ever been taken to Porton Down,"" the government's website says.
Since March, the monarch's only public appearances have been at Windsor for a military ceremony in June to mark her birthday, and for a ceremony to knight record-breaking charity fundraiser, 100-year-old Captain Tom Moore. 

She has also paid private visits to Balmoral Castle in Scotland and Sandringham in eastern England, her private residences.

521,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>",Kyrgyzstan president Jeenbekov resigns after unrest,"By Olga Dzyubenko and Mariya Gordeyeva
BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov resigned on Thursday after days of unrest following a disputed election, saying he wanted to prevent clashes between security forces and protesters who have demanded his removal from office.
He becomes the third president of the small Central Asian nation since 2005 to be toppled in a popular uprising.
Kyrgyzstan, a Russian ally that borders China, has been in turmoil since the Oct. 4 parliamentary election, which the opposition rejected after Jeenbekov's allies were declared the winners.
In a statement, Jeenbekov said he feared violence might break out if protesters carry out a threat to march on his compound.
""The military and security forces will be obliged to use their weapons to protect the state residence. Blood will be inevitably shed. I urge both sides not to fall for provocations,"" he said.
""I do not want to go down in Kyrgyzstan's history as a president who shed blood and shot at his own citizens.""
After the election, opposition supporters took to the streets and seized government buildings, prompting the authorities to annul the vote. Jeenbekov announced last week that he would resign, but this week he delayed his exit, saying he would stay in office until a new election was held.
On Wednesday, Jeenbekov accepted parliament's choice of Sadyr Japarov, a nationalist whose supporters freed him from prison last week, to be prime minister. Japarov and his followers have demanded Jeenbekov leave office.
""NO SPIRIT""
Following Jeenbekov's resignation, parliament speaker Kanatbek Isayev would assume presidential powers. Should he also resign, the powers would pass to Japarov.
Hundreds of Japarov's supporters were rallying some 700 metres away from the presidential residence. As news of Jeenbekov's resignation reached them, they started chanting ""Parliament must go!"" and ""Isayev must go!"".
The prime minister's spokesman declined to comment on whether Japarov would now press the speaker to stand down.
Dastan Bekeshev, a lawmaker who supports neither Jeenbekov nor Japarov, told Reuters by telephone: ""The president couldn't hold out. He's very weak. No spirit. It's not clear what happens next, nobody can tell what is going to happen.""
Kyrgyzstan hosts both a Russian military base and a large Canadian-owned gold mine. Moscow, which considers the former Soviet space to be its sphere of influence, had said it would be responsible for ensuring stability in Kyrgyzstan and warned that it could slide into chaos.

Russia is also dealing with instability in three other ex-Soviet states: Belarus, where a disputed election has triggered protests against President Alexander Lukashenko, and Armenia and Azerbaijan, which are fighting over control of an enclave.

Faruk Satar, a district head in the northern province of Nampula, told the TV station on Wednesday that the miners had drowned after waters surged down a normally dry river bed, flooding the nearby mining field. 
Thirteen bodies were recovered then but Miramar said on Thursday rescuers had since found another three, taking the total death toll to 16 with dozens more still unaccounted for. 
It said a further eight people had died earlier in the week in the central province of Manica.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has turned one Japanese theme park into a new workplace for teleworkers, with a haunted house for the bargain. 
On Thursday, Yomiuriland, an amusement park in Tokyo, launched an ""amusement workation"" package to include a working booth next to its pool, and a ride on its observation ferris wheel with a portable WiFi router.
""I love working outside. This is a good plan, and it feels great,"" said Tatsuki Yamamoto, 47, president of a IT solutions firm FLEQ, sitting on a white pool chair with his laptop.
Employees at his company are also working remotely, Yamamoto said.
A third of Japanese firms are reassessing using offices as 65% of firms allowed or encouraged employees to work from home due to the pandemic, a Reuters poll showed in August.
Many workers in Japan, and globally, began telecommuting as the coronavirus spread and governments imposed strict restrictions to contain it.
Several tourists attractions in Japan have been hit by the pandemic, and some amusement parks have explored other ways to lure visitors. 
The Yomiuriland theme park sells day passes for 1,900 yen ($18.05) per person on weekdays, and 2,000 yen for weekends and holidays, including a workspace rental on the pool side, and a ride on the giant ferris wheel, as well as after-work free golf balls at a driving range inside the park.
About ten customers including Yamamoto used the park with roller coasters and a haunted house as their alternative office on Thursday.
On the slowly moving ferris wheel, Yamamoto dialled into an online conference call and showed off the height to his co-workers through a camera on his laptop.
However, it was hard to focus in the air, he said.
""I don't know whether to enjoy the view or do the work.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's prime ministerial hopefuls clashed on Thursday in their last debate before a general election that Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said if she does not win, she will resign from the leadership of her Labour Party.
An opinion poll on Thursday showed Ardern, 40, had a comfortable two-digit lead over her main rival, National Party leader Judith Collins, and was on course to win Saturday's election on the back of her success in tackling the novel coronavirus in New Zealand.
In addition to her pandemic response, Ardern has won support at home and global admiration for her response to last year's attack by a white supremacist on two mosques and a fatal volcanic eruption.
The closely watched 1News-Colmar Brunton poll on Thursday showed support for Ardern's party slipped 1 percentage point to 46% from the previous poll on Oct. 8 but maintained a 15-point lead over the National Party, which slipped a point to 31%.
This means Labour would have 59 seats in parliament, just short of the 61 needed to form a government on its own.
Labour's likely coalition partner, the Green Party, bounced back to its highest level since 2017 with a support of 8%, which would give it 11 seats.
If the parties join hands that would produce the country's first pure left-leaning government since 1999. 
Labour's other current coalition partner, the nationalist New Zealand First, led by Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, got an uptick to 3% but that still leaves it on course to exit parliament with no seats. 
""I will make whatever New Zealand voters deliver, work,"" Ardern said in the debate when asked if she would work with Greens or NZ First.
""What I am very clear on is that we will get things done faster, with a strong mandate and that's what I'm asking for Labour.""
Ardern said Collins' assertion that child poverty had become worse was ""factually incorrect"" and said she was spreading misinformation by saying Labour would introduce a wealth tax.
Ardern also declared if her party loses, she will not stick on as leader of opposition. 
""My message would that be if people don't want to see me resign, then vote for Labour,"" she told media after the debate.
Despite her success in handling crises, questions have been asked of Labour's credentials to tackle the looming economic crisis. 
Collins has focussed her campaign on the financial challenges ahead as unemployment rises, recession looms and the government's coronavirus support packages expire. 
The 61-year-old conservative has warned a left-leaning coalition would mean more taxes and a business-unfriendly environment.
""We are moving into very difficult economic times. We need a party that understands business and makes decisive decisions about what happens in our economy. So our plan is all focused on the economy,"" Collins said.

Ardern's popularity as preferred prime minister has jumped to 55%, leaving Collins behind at 20%, the polls showed.

""They just wanted to get something to go against me,"" Lai said outside a court, where he went for a hearing over unlawful assembly charges related to this year's June 4 commemoration of China's bloody 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.

Lai was arrested in August on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces as around 200 police searched the offices of his Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily anti-government tabloid, published by Next Digital Ltd. Police later also searched his yacht.
He has not been charged.
Lai had been a frequent visitor to Washington, where he has met officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, to rally support for Hong Kong democracy, prompting Beijing to label him a ""traitor"".
The security law was introduced on June 30 and punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.

Critics say it crushes freedoms, while supporters say it will bring stability after prolonged anti-China, pro-democracy protests last year.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Bombing of civilians by Syrian and Russian armed forces during a campaign against the last rebel bastion in northwest Syria may amount to crimes against humanity, U.S.-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a report on Thursday.
The global rights group said it investigated dozens of ""unlawful"" air and ground strikes on civilian targets in the region around the city of Idlib between April 2019 and March 2020 that killed hundreds of civilians and displaced over 1.4 million people.
HRW said its 167-page report, ""Targeting Life in Idlib"" used hundreds of photos and satellite imagery as well as flight spotter logs to examine 46 bombing incidents, a fraction of the air strikes and shelling that took place.
The attacks involved repeated violations that were ""apparent war crimes, and may amount to crimes against humanity"", the report said.
""They hit hospitals, schools, markets, residential areas. Not just inadvertently, not while they were trying to target the so-called terrorist, but deliberately,"" Kenneth Roth, the organisation's global head, told Reuters TV.
The aim of the 11-month military campaign ""was to drive out civilians and make their lives unlivable in the hope that it then will be easier for Russian and Syrian armed forces to recapture the territory,"" Roth said.
Moscow and Damascus deny accusations of indiscriminate bombing of civilians in an area where three million people have found refuge during the nearly 10-year old conflict. The two allies say they only target radical militants who hold sway in the region.
HRW said it had received no response to a summary of findings and questions to the Syrian and Russian governments.
The campaign ended after a ceasefire last March between Turkey and Russia, which support opposing sides in the conflict. 
The HRW report named 10 senior Russian and Syrian officials including Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russian President Vladimir Putin and their top military commanders who it said were ""command responsible"" and should be held responsible. 
""It's really only by following up and ensuring that these people who have overseen these war crimes, do not get away with impunity, that there are consequences for pursuing this war crime strategy,"" Roth said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Ongoing illness after infection with COVID-19, sometimes called ""long COVID"", may not be one syndrome but possibly up to four causing a rollercoaster of symptoms affecting all parts of the body and mind, doctors said on Thursday. 
In an initial report about long-term COVID-19, Britain's National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) said one common theme among ongoing COVID patients - some of whom are seven months or more into their illness - is that symptoms appear in one physiological area, such as the heart or lungs, only to abate and then arise again in a different area.
""This review highlights the detrimental physical and psychological impact that ongoing COVID is having on many people's lives,"" said Dr Elaine Maxwell, who led the report. 
Many thousands of people worldwide have linked up on social media platforms and online forums to share their experiences of ongoing COVID-19 symptoms. Some call themselves ""long haulers"" while others have named their condition ""long COVID"".
According to UK-based patient group LongCovidSOS, data from a King’s College London-devised symptom tracker app shows that 10% of COVID-19 patients remain unwell after three weeks, and up to 5% may continue to be sick for months.
Maxwell, who presented the findings of the ""Living with COVID"" report in an online media briefing, said health services are already struggling ""to manage these new and fluctuating patterns of symptoms and problems"". 
She and her co-authors urged patients and doctors to log and track symptoms so that health researchers can learn more about the condition and how to ease it as swiftly as possible.
""Despite the uncertainties, people need help now,"" she said. ""We need to collect more data.""
For this initial report, Maxwell's team held a focus group with 14 members of a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group called Long COVID. 
Their testimony suggested ongoing COVID can be cyclical, Maxwell said, with symptoms fluctuating in severity and moving around the body including around the respiratory system, the brain, cardiovascular system and heart, the kidneys, the gut, the liver and the skin.
""There are powerful stories that ongoing COVID symptoms are experienced by people of all ages, and people from all backgrounds,"" the report said. 
Maxwell said an urgent priority is to establish a working diagnosis recognised by healthcare services, employers and government agencies to help patients get support.

""While this is a new disease and we are learning more about its impact..., services will need to be better equipped to support people with ongoing COVID, as emerging evidence is showing there are significant psychological and social impacts that will have long term consequences,"" the report said.

""We killed four militants and chased al Shabaab,"" Ali said late on Wednesday. ""Most of the military came back and we left two dozen soldiers there. Then, this evening, al Shabaab attacked our few soldiers and killed 13.""
Al Shabaab, which launches regular attacks in a bid to undermine Somalia's central government, which is backed by the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping troops, claimed responsibility.
""We killed 24 soldiers and the rest escaped and ran away,"" said Abdiasis Abu Musab, the group's military operations spokesman.
Somalia's government and al Shabaab often give differing figures of casualties after attacks.
Deadly violence has engulfed Somalia since 1991, when clan warlords deposed leader Siad Barre and then turned on each other.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 01:50AM ET</span>",Explainer: What's behind Thailand's protests?,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's government banned gatherings of more than five people on Thursday in the face of three months of escalating demonstrations that have targeted King Maha Vajiralongkorn as well as Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
HOW DID THE PROTESTS START?
Anti-government protests emerged last year after courts banned the most vocal party opposing the government of former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha.
After a pause during measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus, protests resumed in mid-July - pushing for Prayuth's removal, a new constitution and an end to the harassment of activists.
Some protesters went further with a list of 10 demands to reform the monarchy - demands that were cheered by tens of thousands of people at a demonstration in September.
Protesters say they do not seek to end the monarchy, only reform it, but conservatives are horrified by such attacks on an institution the constitution says is ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"".
WHAT IS THE GOVERNMENT DOING?
Until Thursday, the government had said protests would be tolerated but that they must keep within the law.
That changed suddenly after it accused jeering protesters of obstructing Queen Suthida's motorcade and as thousands gathered at Government House to demand the removal of Prayuth.
It imposed emergency measures banning gatherings of more than five people in Bangkok, forbid publication of news or online information that could harm national security and freed up police to arrest anyone linked to the protests.
Soon after the measures were imposed, riot police cleared protesters from Government House and at least three protest leaders were arrested.
WHAT DOES THE PALACE SAY?
The Royal Palace has made no comment on the protests and the demands for reform despite repeated requests.
WHO ARE THE PROTESTERS?
Most are students and young people and there is no overall leader.
Key groups include the Free Youth Movement, which was behind the first major protest in July and the United Front of Thammasat and Demonstration, a student group from Bangkok's Thammasat University, which has championed calls for monarchy reform.
Then there is the Bad Student movement of high schoolers, which also seeks education reform.
Most protest leaders are in their 20s although one of the most prominent figures, human rights lawyer Arnon Nampa, is 36.
WHAT ROYAL REFORMS DO THE PROTESTERS WANT?
Protesters want to reverse a 2017 increase in the king's constitutional powers, made the year after he succeeded his widely revered late father King Bhumibol Adulyadej. 
Pro-democracy activists say Thailand is backtracking on the constitutional monarchy established when absolute royal rule ended in 1932. They say the monarchy is too close to the army and argue that this has undermined democracy.
Protesters also seek the scrapping of lese majeste laws against insulting the king. They want the king to relinquish the personal control he took over a palace fortune estimated in the tens of billions of dollars, and some units of the army.
WHY ELSE ARE THEY UNHAPPY?
Protesters complain that the king endorsed Prayuth's premiership after elections last year that opposition figures say were engineered to keep his hands on power. Prayuth, who as army chief led a 2014 coup, says the election was fair.
Protesters have voiced anger that the king spends much of his time in Europe.
They have also challenged the spending of the Palace and lifestyle of the king, who has been married four times and last year took a royal consort.
WHAT DO THE LESE MAJESTE LAWS MEAN?
The monarchy is protected by Section 112 of the Penal Code, which says whoever defames, insults or threatens the king, queen, heir-apparent or regent shall be jailed for three to 15 years.
In June, Prayuth said the law was no longer being applied because of ""His Majesty's mercy"". The Royal Palace has never commented on this. 
Rights groups say opponents of the government - including more than a dozen of the protest leaders - have recently been charged under other laws such as those against sedition and computer crimes.

The government has said it does not target opponents but it is the responsibility of police to uphold the law.

534,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 15, 2020 01:45AM ET</span>",India Hopes Digital Health ID Can Help Spur Economy,"(Bloomberg) -- A $23-million program offering a digital health ID to every citizen could bolster India’s economic growth amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to the head of the country’s health authority.
The National Digital Health Mission, which aims to create a repository of doctors and health facilities across India -- in addition to digitizing citizens’ health records -- will lead to cost savings and better economic outcomes, Indu Bhushan, chief executive officer of the National Health Authority, said in an interview.
Analysis of Big Data on health “will lead to better planning, budgeting and implementation for states and health programs, which should be a big cost optimizer,” said Bhushan, who compared the gains produced by the “new digital highway” to those from building physical infrastructure such as roads.
India is Asia’s third-largest economy but its total spending on health care is only about 3.5% of gross domestic product -- among the lowest rates in the world, according to World Bank data. Efforts to contain the world’s second-highest tally of Covid-19 infections are straining government coffers, while the economy heads for its first full-year contraction in four decades.
Implementation of the digital health plan will boost productivity and lead to an additional benefit of as much as $250 billion to India’s GDP over the next 10 years, according to a recent report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and Boston Consulting Group.
About 60 million Indians are pushed into poverty every year because of health expenses, 60% of which are borne out-of-pocket. This places “substantial constraints on individual welfare and the nation’s economic growth,” said Bhushan, a bureaucrat turned economist who had stints at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
He expects that number to decline with the implementation of digital services, which can help in early diagnosis of conditions and weeding out of unqualified health-care workers.
Connectivity and Privacy
India’s government is among the world’s most aggressive in digitizing the identities of its citizens, hoping to reduce crippling inefficiencies and pave the way for future digital innovation. But privacy advocates have warned of the dangers of potential leaks of sensitive information, and linking and uploading health records in particular comes with significant risks.
The program, announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in August, is voluntary and for now being tested in six federally administered regions. However, with only about half of India’s 1.3 billion population on the Internet and users often encountering poor connectivity, a nationwide rollout could be challenging. Internet or computers would be a luxury in many rural health centers that lack electricity, running water and toilets.
Aware of such impediments, the government is designing off-line systems to reach out to the unconnected and “digitally illiterate” in remote areas, Bhushan said. On concerns about privacy and state surveillance, Bhushan said data would be securely stored in the government community cloud, “with strong checks and balances to prevent any misuse.”
The digitization push builds on Modi’s national health insurance program, launched in 2018 to give basic coverage for the first time to 500 million of India’s poorest citizens. But the pandemic has exposed the nation’s creaky health infrastructure.
The outbreak makes it “all the more important to have digital systems in place to augment and improve health care,” Bhushan said. “There could have been invaluable implications for identifying hot spots, tracing, treatment, identifying pre-existing conditions and risks, and research that could have fundamentally impacted our response to the pandemic.”

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police have summoned opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim to assist investigations into a viral list of federal lawmakers allegedly backing his bid to claim the premiership, a senior police official said on Thursday.
The opposition leader on Tuesday met with King Al-Sultan Abdullah in a bid to prove he has a ""convincing"" parliamentary majority to replace Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and form a government.
Anwar had been asked to give a statement on Friday over complaints filed with the police about a list of 121 lawmakers said to be backing his bid for the premiership, which had gone viral on social media, criminal investigation department director Huzir Mohamed said in a statement.
""To date, a total of 113 police reports have been received,"" Huzir said.
Police did not detail any of the complaints, but Huzir said investigations were guided by provisions under the penal code and a separate multimedia law covering statements that could cause public mischief or harassment.
Punishment for such offences include a jail term of up to two years and fines.
Anwar's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On Tuesday, Anwar said he had submitted documents to the king to back his claim to the premiership, but the palace later said he only provided the number of lawmakers who he said backed his bid and not their identities.
Anwar's claim to the premiership has triggered a fresh bout of political wrangling in Malaysia, which is grappling with a recent spike in coronavirus cases and it's worst recession since the global financial crisis.

Should Anwar succeed in securing the post, it would be the culmination of a 22-year long quest, which included nearly 10 years in jail on sodomy charges he denied. It would also mean Malaysia would have its third prime minister this year.

Zhang Chunhui, spokesman for China's eastern theatre command, said in a statement that the Chinese military followed and monitored the USS Barry when the destroyer made what the U.S. Navy called a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" on Wednesday. 
China considers Taiwan a wayward province that needs to be reunited with the mainland, by force if needed. The United States government, on the other hand, has stepped up support for the island recently to support what it considers an important democratic outpost. 
Beijing has accused Washington and Taipei of ""collusion"" towards the island declaring formal independence and recently ramped up air force activity near Taiwan in a show of force.
The White House is pushing forward to sell to Taiwan sophisticated military equipment including MQ-9 drones and a coastal defensive missile system, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday, fuelling further tensions in what is already an increasingly adversarial Sino-U.S. relations. 
Zhang said the United States should stop its provocative words and actions in the Taiwan Strait, adding the Chinese military will resolutely defend the country's territorial integrity and maintain peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.
Taiwan's defence ministry said in a separate statement that the USS Barry sailed in a northerly direction through the strait and that its forces also monitored the warship, adding that the situation was as normal.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited construction sites for new homes that are part of a ""grandiose plan"" to rebuild towns hit hard by typhoons and summer floods, state news media reported on Thursday.
The visit was the latest by Kim to typhoon-hit areas of the country after he had promised this week to build at least 25,000 homes over the next five years as citizens begin an 80-day campaign to achieve economic goals.
The state newspaper Rodong Sinmun featured Kim's tour of newly built dwellings in the eastern areas of Sinpho City and Hongwon County on the front page on Thursday, displaying the leader smiling in front of lines of houses with red and cyan roofs and white walls.
The houses were built by members of the military and the ruling Workers' Party.
""He said that they built the houses flawlessly as well as professional builders, noting with great satisfaction that those houses are a crystal of the loyalty of Party members,"" KCNA said.

North Korea was hit by ""disastrous meteorological phenomena"" this summer with heavy rains and typhoons, bringing the second highest rainfall in the past 25 years. The storms had paralysed the transportation system and destroyed thousands of houses.

The declaration, which bans gatherings of five or more people and allows for the arrest of anyone violating the rules, goes into immediate effect, according to a notification in the Royal Gazette.
Thousands of mostly student-led protesters marched to Government House, the office of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha on Wednesday in the latest in a series of anti-government demonstrations which began in early July.
The protesters are calling for the resignation of Prayuth, a former army chief who staged a coup in 2014, and a rewriting of the constitution drafted by a military-appointed panel that helped him stay on following elections last year. They also want curbs on the monarchy, such as prohibiting the king from endorsing any coups and revoking laws that criminalize insults against King Maha Vajiralongkorn and top members of the royal family.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's government banned gatherings of five or more people and the publication of news or online messages that could harm national security early on Thursday under an emergency decree to end Bangkok street protests.
Protests have escalated for three months and protesters set up camp outside Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's offices to demand his resignation late on Wednesday. The government said it also acted after demonstrators obstructed a royal motorcade.
""It is extremely necessary to introduce an urgent measure to end this situation effectively and promptly to maintain peace and order,"" state television announced.
It was accompanied by a document setting out measures that took effect from 4 a.m. local time (2100 GMT) to ban big gatherings and allowing authorities to ban people from entering any area they designation.
It also prohibits: ""publication of news, other media, and electronic information that contains messages that could create fear or intentionally distort information, creating misunderstanding that will affect national security or peace and order.""
Tens of thousands of protesters marched in Bangkok on Wednesday.
The protest movement aims to remove Prayuth, who took power in a 2014 coup that was meant to end a decade of violence between supporters and opponents of the country's establishment.
Those marching on the streets also want a new constitution and have called for a reduction in the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn - breaking a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy.

Protesters shouted at the king's motorcade in Bangkok on Tuesday after the arrest of 21 protesters. On Wednesday, some protesters slowed a convoy carrying Queen Suthida, giving the three-finger salute and chanted ""get out"" at police protecting the vehicle.

542,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 06:10PM ET</span>",Jacinda Ardern eyes historic election win in COVID-free New Zealand,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is widely expected to win a second term this weekend, buoyed by a decisive yet compassionate leadership style under crisis, with polls showing her centre-left Labour Party comfortably in front.
Ardern's globally lauded responses to the country's worst mass shooting and the coronavirus pandemic were also well received at home, although questions have been asked of Labour's credentials to tackle the looming economic crisis.
While it was initially thought Ardern could lead Labour to the country's first outright majority government since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996, more recent polls have indicated she may need to lean on support from the minor Green Party.
That would produce the country's first pure left-leaning government since 1999. Current coalition partner, nationalist New Zealand First, led by deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters, is likely to exit parliament, according to the polls. 
""It is hard to see an election outcome which does not return Jacinda Ardern as Prime Minister,"" said former Prime Minister Helen Clark and co-chair of a World Health Organization (WHO) panel looking at the global coronavirus response.
""The election occurs in the context of the pandemic, and her response to it has been highly rated,"" said Clark. Ardern, 40, worked a researcher in Clark's office shortly after graduating university.
Ardern removed all coronavirus restrictions last week after a second series of lockdowns and social distancing measures to eliminate COVID-19 transmission in the country of 5 million.
She this week joined 31,000 rugby fans at a Wellington stadium to watch the All Blacks take on the Australian Wallabies, becoming one of the first international sporting events to allow spectators.
""I say to the world ... welcome to paradise,"" one fan was captured shouting to television cameras broadcasting the game. Ardern herself is often mobbed at public events by fans bearing selfie sticks. 
Still, National leader Judith Collins has clawed back some support for her party by focusing on the tough financial challenge ahead as unemployment rises, recession looms and government coronavirus support packages expire. Collins has warned a left-leaning coalition would mean more taxes and a business-unfriendly environment. 
Ardern has long had a small but vocal band of critics at home. Early in her leadership she was labelled 'Stardust' and 'part-time PM' by her critics for turning up more often on the cover of the Vogue magazine than in the corridors of parliament.
Some critics suggest the extraordinary events that have shaped her first term - the pandemic, the Christchurch mosque shootings and the White Island volcano explosion - have masked some shortcomings.
A flagship affordable housing building programme was set back by embarrassing blunders, economic growth has flattened, and her government fell embarrassingly short of its aspirational goals of reducing child poverty and inequality.
MAORI CONCERNS
Thousands of indigenous Maori - traditionally a key part of Labour's support base - took to the streets last year over land and civil rights. Those protests were viewed as a proxy for a wider disenchantment within the indigenous community over inequalities that leave Maori lagging on social indicators like housing, education and health.
""Jacinda Ardern's Labour-led government ushered in an impressive number of Māori MPs – in fact, a record number. It sounds good but something has been missing. None of them have been a staunch enough voice for Māori,"" Leigh-Marama McLachlan, a communications leader for her Maori tribe, wrote in an opinion piece in The Guardian this week. 
Still, Ardern retains a solid international following as an 'anti-Trump', promoting issues such as social justice, multilateralism, environmental protection and equality in high-profile international forums including the United Nations.
""In a world where the news cycle focuses a lot on the latest utterances of the world’s populist and authoritarian leaders, Jacinda Ardern represents a refreshing and sharp point of difference,"" said Clark.

The challenge for Ardern will be to redirect some of her international shine homeward while tackling an unprecedented economic crisis.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron ordered a third of France's population be put under nightly curfew on Wednesday to tackle a surging second wave of the coronavirus, saying now was not the time for conviviality.
The virus was spreading at parties and private gatherings, the president said, and action was needed now in Paris and eight other big French cities to slow the rate of infection or else hospitals risked being overwhelmed.
Macron said the curfews were to put a temporary halt to ""the parties, the moments of conviviality where there are 50 or 60 people, festive evenings because, unfortunately, these are vectors for the acceleration of the disease.""
Macron announced the curfews, which will take effect from Saturday and run nightly from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. the following morning, hours after the government declared a new state of emergency.
The curfews will last an initial four weeks, but Macron said the government would seek a two-week extension from parliament, meaning the measures will be in place until Dec. 1.
""It means that we won't go to restaurants after 9 p.m., we won't go round to a friend's place, we won't go out partying,"" the president said in an interview on national television.
France, like other European countries, is grappling with how to slow the virus’ spread and ease pressure on a once-again strained healthcare system while keeping its 2.3 trillion euro ($2.71 trillion) economy open and protecting jobs.
On Wednesday it reported 22,591 new cases, the third time in six days the daily COVID tally has gone beyond the 20,000 threshold. The virus has killed more than 32,000 in France.
The curfew applies to the Paris region, Marseille, Toulouse, Grenoble, Montpellier, Rouen, Lyon, Saint-Etienne and Lille. The cities have a combined population of about 20 million people. 
""WELL GET THROUGH THIS""
Macron said France faced a worrying situation.
""We have to adopt stricter measures in order to completely restore control,"" the president continued.
Essential trips during curfew would still be allowed, Macron said. There would be no restrictions on public transport, and people would still be able to travel between regions without restrictions.
Anyone violating the curfews will be fined 135 euros ($159).
Macron said the goal was to reduce the current rate of 20,000 new cases per day to around 3,000 and to sharply reduce the burden on intensive care units in hospitals.
The French government previously declared a state of emergency in March, when hospitalisations caused by the pandemic were near their peak. That time, the authorities used their extra powers to put France under lockdown except for essential work, buying food or taking one hour of daily exercise.
Another national lockdown was not envisaged, said Macron.
""We'll get through this if we stick together,"" the president said.
But the move is likely to infuriate France's already-battered hospitality industry, reeling from the three-month spring confinement and a more recent government-ordered shutdown of bars in virus hotspots.
Brasserie manager Steve Dervechian said his turnover was down more than half over the summer and even more during lockdown. Depriving him of a dinner crowd would be a disaster, he said hours before Macron spoke.

""A curfew will not stop the virus. People congregate in public transport, at work, in schools,"" he said. It's not in places like ours where people gather in big crowds.""

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that Robert Destro, Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, would assume the additional post, which has been vacant since the start of President Donald Trump's term in 2017.
Destro ""will lead U.S. efforts to promote dialogue between the People’s Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his representatives; protect the unique religious, cultural, and linguistic identity of Tibetans; and press for their human rights to be respected,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
China has consistently refused to deal with the U.S. coordinator, seeing it as interference in its internal affairs.
The appointment comes at a time when U.S.-China relations have sunk to the lowest point in decades over a range of issues, including trade, Taiwan, human rights, the South China Sea and the coronavirus.
China seized control over Tibet in 1950 in what it describes as a ""peaceful liberation"" that helped the remote Himalayan region throw off its ""feudalist"" past. But critics, led by exiled spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, say Beijing's rule amounts to ""cultural genocide.""
""The United States remains concerned with the PRC’s repression of the Tibetan community,"" Pompeo said.
In July, Pompeo said the United States would restrict visas for some Chinese officials involved in blocking diplomatic access to Tibet and engaging in ""human rights abuses,"" adding that Washington supported ""meaningful autonomy"" for Tibet.
Despite that, Trump - unlike his White House predecessor, Barack Obama - has never met the Dalai Lama during his presidency.

The ministry said it had detained Milad at the request of the U.N. Security Council and that it had referred the case to the public prosecutor to take legal measures against him. 
Milad heads a coastguard unit in Zawiya, just west of Tripoli, and was one of six people sanctioned by the U.N. for involvement in people trafficking or smuggling in Libya two years ago. 
Migrants had testified that they had been taken to a detention centre on one of the ships used by Milad and were then held in brutal conditions and beaten. He denied any wrongdoing or involvement in smuggling in a phone call to Reuters in 2018.
Smugglers have been able to make vast profits by exploiting a security vacuum in Libya since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and left many state institutions under the control of armed groups. 
Libya has been divided since 2014 between the GNA in Tripoli and the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar. 
There are more than half a million migrants in Libya, a major launching point for journeys across the Mediterranean to Europe, according to the U.N., which says it is not a safe port for migrants to be returned to. 
On Saturday, the medical charity Doctors Without Borders said 60 migrants were being held in captivity by an armed group in Sabratah in western Libya.

Aoun had been due to hold the consultations on Thursday and was expected to assess whether Sunni Muslim leader Saad al-Hariri could rally support of a majority of parliamentarians to try to form a new government. 
However two prominent Christian politicians had indicated in the last 24 hours that they had reservations about nominating Hariri, who resigned as prime minister a year ago after mass protests. 
The country has plunged into financial turmoil and seen the value of the Lebanese pound collapse. The COVID-19 pandemic and a huge explosion at Beirut's port two months ago compounded the crisis and pushed many Lebanese into poverty.
French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed a roadmap that could unlock billions of dollars of international aid, conditional on major reforms which Hariri pledged to support.
The Lebanese presidency said Aoun was delaying the planned consultations on nominating a new premier until Oct. 22, citing requests ""from some parliamentary blocs due to difficulties emerging that need to be solved"".
However, the head of the Shi'ite Amal party and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri opposes any delay in the consultations, his office said in a statement released minutes after the presidency's announcement.
Earlier on Wednesday Samir Geagea, whose Lebanese Forces party has the second biggest Christian bloc in parliament, said the party would not nominate anyone to be the new prime minister at official consultations to fill the post.

On Tuesday Gebran Bassil, who heads the country's largest Christian bloc, the Free Patriotic Movement and its allies, criticised Hariri for seeking to form a government pledged to implement Macron's plan.

Militant attacks in Cabo Delgado province date to 2017 but the violence has gathered pace this year, with insurgents seizing important towns for brief periods and hitting military and other key targets.
Mozambique wrote to the EU in September to ask for help in training its armed forces to battle the insurgency.
The EU delegation statement said the bloc would grant Mozambique's request for help with ""logistics for training and technical training in several and specific areas, as well as assistance in addressing humanitarian challenges, including medical services"" dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.
The U.N. World Food Programme says more than 300,000 people have fled the violence in Cabo Delgado. 
Zenaida Machado, a researcher at global rights group Human Rights Watch, said in a note that the EU ambassador to Mozambique, Antonio Sanchez-Benedito Gaspar, had ruled out sending in European troops.
Machado said the EU would require ""verifiable commitments from the Mozambican security forces to respect human rights in its operations and hold violators accountable"" before providing military support.
Mozambique last month denied accusations by rights group Amnesty International that soldiers had committed atrocities, saying the acts were carried out by Islamist insurgents impersonating troops.
If it happens, the EU security assistance would be the first official international intervention specifically aimed at assisting Maputo fight insugents in Cabo Delgado, according to the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED).

The now famous incident erupted when Cooper took her dog to New York's Central Park, and a birdwatcher, Christian Cooper (no relation) asked her to follow park rules and put the dog on a leash.
""I'm going to call the cops,"" Amy Cooper tells Christian Cooper on a video. ""I'm going to tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life."" 
The video of the May 25 incident, which was viewed more than 30 million times by the next day, drew outrage, coming on the heels of several other widely seen incidents of white people calling police on Black people without cause. 
It also occurred the same day George Floyd, a Black man, died on a Minneapolis street while his neck was under the knee of a white police officer for more than eight minutes.
Cooper apologized and was later fired by her employer, global investment firm Franklin Templeton.
Manhattan prosecutors brought the charge on July 6.
Cooper's attorney, Robert Barnes, said in an email that he had no comment on the newly disclosed allegedly false assault claim.
Officer Francisco Tejada, who responded to Cooper's call, said in a statement that when he asked her if the man had tried to ""assault or touch her in any way,"" she said no, prosecutors said.
Cooper's next court date was set for Nov. 17.

The appearance of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) during a weekend parade in North Korea captivated many Western analysts. But officials in South Korea were far more concerned by the display of new multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and fast, maneuverable short-range missiles that would be ideal for striking targets in the South.
Speaking before the start of a meeting with his South Korean counterpart at the Pentagon, Esper said; ""We agree that North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs remain a serious threat to the security and stability of the region and the world.""
""The United States remains committed to the security of the Republic of Korea,"" Esper said. 
He added, however, that South Korea and the United States must find a more equitable way of sharing defense costs so it ""doesn't fall unequally on the American taxpayers.""
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has touted his relationship with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has repeatedly said Seoul should pay for a larger share of the cost of U.S. military forces deployed in the South.
Some 28,500 American troops are deployed in South Korea, in what is seen as a deterrent to Pyongyang that also sends a message to China about U.S. influence and capability in Asia.

Separately, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, citing a lack of ICBM tests by Pyongyang last year, told reporters on Wednesday there was a reduced risk to the United States from North Korea due to Trump's policy of engagement.

Prime Minister Abdallah Hamdok had on Tuesday relieved Salih Amar, the governor of Kassala State, of his duties following strong opposition to his appointment and protests by the powerful Hadandawa tribe. However the move was rejected by Amar's Beni Amer tribe in the Red Sea State, which includes the cities of Port Sudan and Suakin. 
Members of both tribes live in both states.
Authorities imposed a curfew in Port Sudan and Suakin, some 60 kilometres away, from 12pm until 4am starting Wednesday and shut the roads leading to the two cities, state news agency SUNA reported. 
Fighting between the Beni Amer and Hadandawa had previously broken out in 2019 and leaders from the two tribes signed a peace agreement to stem the violence.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian protesters demanding an end to police brutality returned to the streets on Wednesday, saying they were unconvinced by the creation of a new police unit and a pledge not to use violence against demonstrators.
Protesters have staged daily marches nationwide for a week, calling for an overhaul of police forces. Police have responded to the demonstrations with beatings, tear gas and gunfire, which human rights group Amnesty International said had killed at least 10 people. 
The protests have prompted a raft of announcements. The Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS), a police unit that demonstrators have long accused of beatings, killings and extortion, was officially disbanded on Sunday.
On Tuesday, police agreed to stop using force against protesters. They also announced the formation of a new unit, the Special Weapons and Tactics team (SWAT), to ""fill the gaps"" left by the disbanded SARS.
But protesters said on Wednesday they feared the new unit will simply be a rebranded version of SARS.
Hundreds gathered on Wednesday in the capital Abuja, as well as megacity Lagos and Warri - both in the south - to press their calls for police reforms.
""What they do is... give them new uniforms, call them a different name, but they are still the same people in these police forces,"" said blogger Folu Oyefeso, in Lagos.
Demonstrators in Lagos, who gathered despite heavy rain, sang, danced and chanted. Many held placards, including one that read ""Stop killing our dreamers. #EndSARS now"". 
Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, in a statement on Wednesday, urged protesters to wind down demonstrations, saying that the gridlock caused in recent days had disrupted businesses still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. 

""People are just coming back to businesses. It would be unfair for those businesses not to be able to get back on their feet again,"" he said.

(Reuters) - A rare 1623 book that brought together William Shakespeare's plays for the first time sold for a record $9.97 million at auction on Wednesday, Christie's in New York said.
The First Folio containing 36 of Shakespeare's plays, one of only six known complete copies in private hands, was bought by American private collector Stephan Loewentheil, founder of the 19th Century Rare Book and Photograph Shop on the U.S. east coast. 
Wednesday's auction price also marked a new world auction record for any printed work of literature, and smashed the previous high of $6.16 million for a Shakespeare First Folio that was set in 2001, auction company Christie's said.
""Comedies, Histories and Tragedies"" was compiled by friends of the English playwright seven years after his death. It includes 18 plays that had never been published before and might have been lost, including ""Macbeth"" and ""Julius Caesar."" 
""It is an honor to purchase one of only a handful of complete copies of this epochal volume. It will ultimately serve as a centerpiece of a great collection of intellectual achievements of man,"" Loewentheil said in a statement.
The First Folio marked the first time that Shakespeare's plays had been organized as comedies, tragedies and histories. The book's large size - previously reserved for law books and works of theology - helped raise Shakespeare's status in future years, Christie's books experts said.
Without the First Folio some of Shakespeare's most famous lines would likely have been lost, including classics like ""Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears,"" from ""Julius Caesar,"" and ""If music be the food of love, play on,"" from ""Twelfth Night.""

Wednesday's sale was the first time in nearly 20 years that a complete copy of the First Folio had come to auction. It was put up for auction by Mills College, a private liberal arts college in Oakland, California.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett said on Wednesday she was open to at least one sweeping change for the nation's top judicial body - allowing cameras into the chamber for the first time in its 230-year history.
""I would certainly keep an open mind about allowing cameras in the Supreme Court,"" Barrett said during her Senate confirmation hearing under questioning by Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, who has long advocated such a step.
""Many of us believe that allowing cameras in the courtroom would open the courts to the public and bring a better understanding of the judiciary,"" Grassley said.
Advocates of cameras in the courtroom argue that it is an important step to allow transparency in the judicial process. Some U.S. state and local courts permit cameras and allow live TV broadcasts of certain proceedings, but federal courts largely do not.
Grassley has been pushing for the introduction of cameras to the Supreme Court for at least 15 years and has introduced legislation that would allow video coverage of court proceedings.
Neither video nor still cameras are allowed in the Supreme Court chamber. But the court, in a break with precedent, allowed live audio of its oral arguments at the end of its most recent term and during its current term as it hears cases by teleconference due to the coronavirus pandemic.
During the hearing, Republican Senator Ben Sasse told Barrett he opposes cameras in the courtroom because it would lead to ""theatrics.""
""I think we'd get a lot more Michael Avenatti nonsense, if we had cameras in the court,"" Sasse said, referring to the convicted lawyer who represented adult-film actress Stormy Daniels in litigation against Trump.
While Supreme Court nominees have expressed openness to cameras before, sitting justices have been opposed. They argue that allowing video coverage would make it difficult to conduct arguments effectively and would encourage theatrics by attorneys arguing before them.
In 1996, former Justice David Souter, now 81 and retired from the high court, drew a hard line on the matter: ""The day you see a camera come into our courtroom, it's going to roll over my dead body.""

Grassley, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, acknowledged the difficulty. He noted Souter's comment, and invoked his own mortality by calling his push for cameras ""another interest of mine that at 87 years of age I won't live long enough to see done.""

The pups were found at Pelican Point peninsula, a tourist destination known for its colony of seals and school of dolphins.
Drone footage taken by Ocean Conservation Namibia (OCN) shows the coast dotted with more than 5,000 dead seal pups, the group said.
""We are sitting at the cusp of a catastrophe. There are literally thousands of seal pups being born prematurely and dying almost immediately,"" it said in an Instagram post.
It said previously some female seals had been observed to abort their foetus when they felt there was not enough food available. ""This happens every year to a few individuals, but never on this scale!""
The Ministry of Fisheries said researchers had noticed higher than normal numbers of seal abortions at Pelican Point but could not establish a reason or give numbers.
""We cannot attach a number to it as we are still gathering data,"" Graça D'Almeida, Director of Resources Management at the ministry, said.
But OCN says starvation is the most probable cause as fish, the seals' main source of food, have moved from Pelican Point.
It said other reasons could be toxins or diseases but nothing could be confirmed without proper study.
OCN is working with the fisheries ministry to conduct biopsies and tests.
A similar tragedy occurred in 1994 when starvation led to the loss of about a third of the seal population at Pelican Point, OCN said.

The New START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) accord, signed in 2010, limits the numbers of strategic nuclear warheads, missiles and bombers that Russia and the United States can deploy. It expires in February. 
A failure to extend the pact would remove all constraints on U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear weapons and their delivery systems, fueling a post-Cold War arms race and tensions between Moscow and Washington.
U.S. officials have indicated that an agreement to extend it has been reached in principle. 
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday that no deal had yet been reached despite what the Kremlin hoped was a joint understanding that the pact did need to be extended.
""As for the understanding for the need to extent the START treaty, we hope we are on the same track in this regard,"" Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. ""We understand that it needs to be extended, that this is in the interest of our two countries and the strategic security of the whole world.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comment when asked to elaborate on the agreement in principle that the top U.S. arms control negotiator, Marshall Billingslea, on Tuesday said had been reached ""at the highest levels.""
""We would welcome the opportunity to complete an agreement based on understandings that were achieved over the last couple of weeks about what that range of possibilities look like for an extension of New START,"" Pompeo told a State Department news conference.
He said the United States would continue the talks on the treaty, which can be extended for up to five years with the agreement of both presidents.
""I am hopeful that the Russians will find a way to agree to an outcome that frankly I think is in their best interest and in our best interest,"" he said.
Pompeo reiterated a call for China to join the United States and Russia in talks on a trilateral nuclear arms control accord. China, whose nuclear arsenal is much smaller than the U.S. and Russian stockpiles, repeatedly has rejected the proposal.
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said earlier on Wednesday Moscow did not see prospects for extending the new START arms control treaty with Washington but planned to continue talks nonetheless.
New START is a successor to the original agreement signed in 1991 between the then-Soviet Union and the United States.

Arms deals between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the 1980s, and their successors George H.W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin in the 1990s, underscored growing trust between the superpowers and contributed to ending the Cold War.

Diyabanza, who has lived in France for 20 years, belongs to a pan-African movement that is pressing France to return thousands of art works removed from its African colonies and make reparations for acts of slavery.
He told Reuters he would lodge an appeal.
""It's a big joke from French justice"", Diyabanza said.

With an associate, Diyabanza prised the carved wooden ornament from its stand in the Quai Branly museum as a third man live-streamed the act on social media. 
He was then stopped by a security guard as he made for the exit.
The museum holds some 70,000 African objects, French art historian Benedicte Savoy told Reuters in 2018.
Diyabanza faces a second theft charge for removing an artifact from a Marseille museum. He says his actions are politically justified.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday the United States was pleased that the Iraqi government was doing more to protect the U.S. embassy in Baghdad from Iran-backed Shiite Muslim militias but declined to provide an update on whether Washington was still considering to shut down its embassy.
""We are happy that the Iraqis are doing more to provide increased security for our team on the ground there,"" Pompeo told a State Department news conference.
Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened last month to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias that have attacked U.S. interests with rockets and roadside bombs.
A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq, on Sunday said it has suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq's government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops.
Asked if the United States saw the announcement as progress and whether it would still follow through on its threat to shut down the embassy, Pompeo did not specifically answer but sounded doubtful about the militia's ceasefire declaration.
""We have a rogue set of militias who have now promised not to violate the Iraqi people's sovereignty and to take aim at the U.S. diplomats serving there that are designed to help the Iraqi people,"" he said.
The U.S. warning caused alarm in Iraq, where it was seen as a step toward air strikes, potentially turning Iraq into a battleground in a proxy war between the United States and Iran. A broad array of politicians called on the militia to stop provoking the Americans.

The decision drew an angry response from Palestinians, who seek to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem.
""We urge the international community to intervene immediately to stop this settlement madness, which destroys any chance for a genuine peace process,"" said Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas.
The construction could help mute criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from settler leaders, who are traditional allies.
They had bristled at the annexation suspension that helped pave the way for last month's deals to forge diplomatic ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.
Israel's West Bank Civil Administration planning committee gave final approval for building 1,313 housing units in several settlements, it said in a statement. Plans for another 853 units were advanced but have not yet been given final approval. 
A statement from Beit El settlement said 350 new housing units would be built there. It hailed the committee's decision as ""a tremendous achievement for Beit El"".
The forum, which last held such a hearing eight months ago, was due to reconvene on Thursday to advance additional projects in settlements, its publicly available agenda showed.
Peace Now, an Israeli settlement watchdog, said that in total the committee was set to move forward with projects comprising more than 4,000 new settler homes.
Most countries view settlements Israel has built in territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war as illegal and as an obstacle to peace with the Palestinians. The United States and Israel dispute this. 

Israel cites historical and biblical links to the West Bank and around 450,000 of its settlers live there, among 3 million Palestinians.

NAQOURA, Lebanon (Reuters) - Long-time foes Lebanon and Israel launched talks on Wednesday over their disputed sea border in a brief meeting which the lead Lebanese negotiator described as ""the first step on a thousand-mile journey."" 
The talks were mediated by the United States, which has pushed for years for negotiations to resolve the dispute and brokered deals last month for two Gulf Arab states to establish full ties with Israel, in a major Middle East realignment.
Both Lebanon and Israel had played down expectations for Wednesday's meeting which was held outdoors under blue canvas covers near the two countries' land border. 
The talks, the first to be held over the disputed sea boundary, broke up after barely an hour and both sides agreed to meet again in two weeks. 
The United States and United Nations, which hosted the meeting, described it as productive, while Israel's Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said the Israeli delegation would push ahead with the talks ""to give the process a chance"". 
Agreement to hold the talks was announced weeks after the United States stepped up pressure on allies of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah, imposing sanctions on a senior politician from its main Shi'ite ally, the Amal party.
Hezbollah, which fought a month-long war with Israel in 2006, says the talks are not a sign of peace-making with its long-time enemy.

""Our meeting today will launch the train of technical, indirect negotiations, and represents the first step on a thousand-mile journey for demarcating the southern borders,"" the Lebanese army quoted delegation head Brigadier General Bassam Yassin as saying.
""We look forward...to achieving this file within a reasonable timeframe."" 
GAS-RICH WATERS?
Disagreement over the sea border had discouraged oil and gas exploration near the disputed line.
Israel already pumps gas from huge offshore fields but Lebanon, which has yet to find commercial gas reserves in its own waters, is desperate for cash from foreign donors as it faces the worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. 
The financial meltdown has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and by an explosion that wrecked a swathe of Beirut in August, killing nearly 200 people.
Wednesday's meeting was hosted by the United Nations, which has monitored the land boundary since Israel withdrew from south Lebanon in 2000 at the end of a 22-year occupation. 
Lebanese sources originally said the next talks will be held on Oct 28, but a statement from President Michel Aoun's office said they would take place two days earlier on Oct. 26.
Hours before the meeting, Hezbollah and Amal called for changes to the Lebanese negotiating team to ensure it included only military officials. The Lebanese presidency has said the talks would be purely technical.

The talks come after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain agreed to establish full relations with Israel, under U.S.-brokered deals which realign some of Washington's closest Middle East allies against Iran.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a U.N Food and Agriculture (FAO) conference that due to the pandemic he expected a 14% rise in cases of severe child malnutrition this year - or 6.7 million more people - mostly in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. 
""We cannot accept a world where the rich have access to healthy diets while the poor are left behind... the rich can afford to stay home, the poor must go out to work,"" he said.
After the economic devastation of the pandemic, governments must work with the private sector and civil society to support sustainable food systems and end subsidies for producers of unhealthy foods, the WHO director general added.
Millions of lives could be saved if countries expanded childhood feeding programmes, reduced marketing of unhealthy foods and used fiscal policies to drive better food choices amongst consumers, he said.
""COVID has reminded us that life is fragile, health is precious, and healthy diets are not just for the wealthy, they're a human right,"" he said.

""The pandemic has caused serious disruptions to essential services, immunisation, maternal services, child nutrition, family planning and more.""

Pompeo said he raised the so-called Abraham Accords, a U.S.-brokered agreement to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel, with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud at a meeting at the U.S. State Department.
""We hope Saudi Arabia will consider normalizing its relationships as well, and we want to thank them for the assistance they've had in the success of the Abraham Accords so far,"" Pompeo said, adding that he hopes the nation will encourage Palestinian leaders or the Palestinian Authority to return to negotiations with Israel. 
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain last month signed agreements toward normalizing relations with Israel in a strategic realignment of Middle Eastern countries against Iran.
""They reflect a changing dynamic in the region, in which countries rightly recognize the need for regional cooperation to counter Iranian influence and generate prosperity,"" Pompeo said.
The United States is trying to persuade more Gulf countries to strike similar accords with Israel, as the UAE and Bahrain did at the Sept. 15 ceremony in Washington. 
Riyadh has quietly acquiesced to the UAE and Bahrain deals – though it has stopped short of endorsing them – and has signaled it is not ready to take action itself.
Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and site of its holiest shrines, drew up a 2002 initiative under which Arab nations offered to normalize ties with Israel in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967.

His broadside against the Turkish Medical Association (TTB) came after months of warnings by the group that official figures underplay the true scale of the pandemic, especially Ankara's decision to report only symptomatic cases of COVID-19. 
The TTB has called for more transparency and coordination from the government, as well as more aggressive measures to contain the outbreak and protect medical workers. 
The government has defended its response and said the public sees the key case figures. 
In a speech to members of his AK Party, Erdogan said the TTB and other professional associations ""are clearly acting in a way that is against the constitution"" and the matter has ""reached an unbearable level"". 
He proposed a regulatory change similar to one in July that allowed multiple bar associations in a single city. Lawyers criticised the move as the latest in a series of steps to erode the judiciary's independence.
Erdogan said on Wednesday the regulatory change would allow better representation of doctors than through solely the TTB, and should be enacted swiftly as a top priority for parliament. 
His AK Party has a majority with the support of the nationalist MHP whose leader, Devlet Bahceli, last month accused the TTB of treachery and called for it to be shut down.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have criticised what they see as increasing authoritarianism and threats to the rule of law under Erdogan, especially since a 2016 coup attempt that prompted sweeping crackdowns on his perceived opponents in public services, the military and elsewhere.

Turkish authorities have rejected the accusations, saying the measures were necessary for national security.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - (Graphic content in paragraph 6)
A Vatican court heard graphic descriptions of sexual abuse on Wednesday as two priests went on trial, one charged with repeatedly raping an altar boy in a youth seminary and the other of covering up the attacks.
The first hearing lasted only eight minutes as charges were read to Father Gabriele Martinelli, 28, who was a minor for most of the time of the alleged abuse, and Father Enrico Radice, 72, who was rector.
Neither of the two defendants has responded publicly to the accusations and the defence has not yet entered a formal plea.
The abuse took place between 2007 and 2012 in the Pius X Pre-Seminary, which houses altar boys who serve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, sometimes for the pope, and are thinking of becoming priests.
Martinelli later went on to become a priest and the prosecution says Radice did not block the ordination even though he knew about the abuse.
A clerk read out charges including how Martinelli allegedly forced a boy known by his initials LG ""to undergo carnal acts, acts of sodomy, masturbation on himself and on the boy, at different times and in different places inside Vatican City"".
The trial in the Vatican's tiny courtroom is the first concerning abuse committed inside the city state's walls.
The alleged abuse began when LG was 13, and Martinelli continued the abuse of LG for about a year after he turned 18, the prosecution says.
The court charged Radice with cover-up, including writing letters to Italian church officials trying to divert investigations. Radice had given Martinelli supervisory responsibilities over the other altar boys, the court was told.
The case exploded in 2017 when Italian journalists reported that a whistleblower who was a roommate of LG reported the abuse but was later expelled from the pre-seminary. A Vatican inquiry began that year and indictments were issued in 2019.

Court President Giuseppe Pignatone, a former Italian anti-mafia magistrate, gave the defence until Friday to present more documentation. The trial resumes on Oct. 27.

The WHO's annual TB report found that tuberculosis killed some 1.4 million people in 2019, little changed from the 1.5 million deaths it caused in 2018. It warned that many countries are not on track to meet targets for successfully diagnosing and treating cases to try to stop the disease's spread.
Disruptions in services caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have led to major setbacks to TB programmes, the report found. In many countries, human, financial and other resources have been reallocated from TB to the COVID-19 response.
""Accelerated action is urgently needed worldwide if we are to meet our targets,"" the WHO's director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement with the report.
Sharonann Lynch, a TB policy expert at the global health charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), said progress against the killer disease had been ""dismally slow.""

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan professionals from biologists to lawyers have turned to making food and face masks or selling cleaning products as the coronavirus quarantine further weakens an economy already struggling under a six-year recession. 
Facing annual inflation above 3,000% and the coronavirus-related shutdown of most businesses and state institutions, Venezuelans who spent years studying to become professionals have reinvented themselves as entrepreneurs who sell products - often for hard currency - to make ends meet in an increasingly dollarized economy.
""I had to do something to cover living expenses,"" said Jose Ibarra, who started delivering cleaning products to homes because his salary as a social work professor is only around $4 a month. 
""With some clients, I even schedule sales because some of them buy on the day they have water,"" he said, referring to water rationing that affects most Venezuelans.

But in Venezuela the situation has been exacerbated by the country's economic crisis, which has seen nine out of ten middle class families fall into poverty over the last decade, and reduced the middle class to just 5.3% of the population, according to local firm Anova Policy Research. 
U.S. sanctions are piling pressure on an economy reeling from mismanagement and hyperinflation, threatening to worsen a regional humanitarian crisis.
Alfonso Toro spent years writing music for television commercials and doing other jobs in advertising, but feels the industry has died. 
He now makes face masks printed with the image of Indominus Rex, a fictional genetically modified dinosaur featured in the 2015 film ""Jurassic World."" 
""I think the time for entrepreneurship has come,"" said Toro, whose home-made masks have gotten a warm reception on Twitter. ""All my life I wanted to make toys, but I did not have time."" 
REINVENTING YOURSELF TO STAY ALIVE
Some 43% of Venezuelan households have seen their incomes decline due to the effects of COVID-19 on the economy, according to the National Survey of Living Conditions, a study carried out by several Venezuelan universities.
""Some people, without leaving their jobs, looked for other sources of income, even though they have to overcome obstacles such as the lack of gasoline, transportation limitations or finding cash,"" said sociologist Lissette Gonzalez, a professor at the Andres Bello Catholic University.
""While many have reinvented themselves, others have not been able to, and it makes them more vulnerable.""
Ruben Benitez, a lawyer with 13 years of experience who saw his income drop due to months of closure of the courts, started baking cakes to sell in stores.
""For many professionals, it is difficult to work in our areas. It has been difficult for us and the situation leads you to have to look after yourself,"" said Benitez. ""My livelihood now comes from cake sales.""
Lisbeth Lopez closed a small store that sold sweets in a shopping center in Ciudad Guayana in southern Venezuela due to the quarantine. 
She started making and selling carpaccio - an appetizer of thinly sliced fish or meat - from lau lau, a fish native to the Orinoco river.
""If you have family, you cannot afford to get depressed... you have to reinvent yourself,"" said Lopez, who uses the money from the carpaccio sales to pay school fees for her two children.
Julia Vizcaya, like Lopez, turned to the kitchen to survive the quarantine. For about four months she has been making and selling homemade ice cream. 
She is an employee of a hotel that is closed due to the pandemic and still receives a minimum monthly salary, equivalent to $2. She gets by on deliveries of fruit ice cream and yogurt that she sells on social media. 

""The income from the ice creams has been a relief,"" she said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - A United Nations team will have to wait several weeks to access a deteriorating tanker off Yemen's shore that is threatening to spill 1.1 million barrels of crude oil in the Red Sea, two U.N. sources told Reuters.
The United Nations has warned that the Safer, stranded since 2015, could spill four times as much oil as the 1989 Exxon (NYSE:XOM) Valdez disaster near Alaska, but access to the vessel has been complicated by the war in Yemen.
Yemen's Houthi movement, which controls the area where the tanker is moored and the national oil firm that owns it, agreed in July to allow a technical team to assess the ship and conduct whatever repairs may be feasible.
But the two sources said that it could take another seven weeks to finalise details of the agreement and logistics, with the coronavirus pandemic further complicating planning.
The deal includes the eventual sale of the oil on board with proceeds divided between Houthi authorities and Yemen's internationally recognised government, which the movement ousted from the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. 
Some diplomats say there are still doubts about the mission as Houthi officials had last year reneged on granting access.
The Safer, built in 1974, is moored off the Ras Issa oil terminal, 60 km (40 miles) north of the port of Hodeidah. 
The area is held by the Houthis, but the high seas are controlled by a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the movement and has prevented it from selling oil.
U.N. and Houthi officials say water has entered the Safer's engine room at least twice since 2015. The latest leak in May was plugged by Safer Corp divers and Houthi naval units. 
While the Houthis can fix small leaks it remains unclear how long such repairs can hold, U.N. officials and experts said.
Last month, Riyadh warned that an ""oil spot"" was seen in a shipping transit area 31 miles (50 km) west of the tanker.
The United Nations says a major rupture could severely harm Red Sea ecosystems and shut Hodeidah port, Yemen's main entry point for imports and aid.

Eighty seafarers were taken in the Gulf of Guinea, a 2.3 million sq km (888,000 sq m) area bordering more than a dozen countries, sharply up from the same period in 2019, and the pirates are attacking further out to sea than before, the IMB said. 
Pirates armed with guns and knives attack everything from oil platforms to fishing vessels and refrigerated cargo ships. In one attack 95 nautical miles off the coast, the furthest offshore attack reported in the region, pirates took 13 crew hostage, which the IMB said illustrated ""how well-organized and far-reaching"" the pirates are. 
Experts say the bulk of the attackers come from Nigeria's Niger Delta, which produces most of the petroleum from the country, Africa's largest oil exporter, but the restive region has an underdeveloped economy and limited jobs for locals. 
In 2019, Nigeria enacted a standalone law against piracy, and in August, a court in the oil hub of Port Harcourt made the first convictions under the legislation.

In a tweet Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, said the security personnel had also taken away other unnamed items. 
""The military and police just raided our head office in Kamwokya. They have broken into offices and taken away valuable documents and other items. Some comrades have been injured. The partisanship of security agencies ahead of the election is stinking,"" he said.

His youthful age and music has earned him a large following in the relatively young country of 42 million, rattling the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party and drawing a security crackdown on his supporters. 
Since expressing his presidential ambition, police and the military have repeatedly dispersed his rallies, beaten and detained his supporters.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government on Wednesday resisted a short lockdown for all of England, despite calls from the opposition to shut the country down for two weeks as a ""circuit breaker"", a step which a new scientific study said could save thousands of lives.
With cases rapidly rising, the British government opted this week for a three-tier system of local measures. The Liverpool area became the first part of the country in the highest category, requiring bars, gyms and other businesses to shut, perhaps for months.
On Wednesday, British-ruled Northern Ireland, which is outside the tier system, announced the toughest UK coronavirus measures since the pre-summer peak, shutting restaurants and suspending schools. 
The British government's critics say a short, sharp nationwide lockdown could be more effective than local measures, and would spread the economic burden more fairly.
Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer called on Tuesday for a 2-3 week lockdown. His call was backed up on Wednesday by a study from some of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's scientific advisers.
According to the study, if daily deaths reach 200 by Oct. 24, as many as 80,000 more people in Britain could die by the end of the year. A two-week lockdown could save half of them. Even in less extreme scenarios it could save thousands of lives.
""The optimal time for a break is always now; there are no good epidemiological reasons to delay the break,"" said the paper, co-authored by Graham (NYSE:GHM) Medley, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, and Matt Keeling of the government's pandemic modelling subgroup.
Work and Pensions Minister Thérèse Coffey said on Wednesday the new three-tier system should be given a chance to work.

""I do not believe that the prime minister wants to set off on a national lockdown, but as ever he is advised by scientists - he takes that decision,"" Coffey told Sky.

Parliament had earlier confirmed nationalist Japarov as premier for the second time, after Jeenbekov vetoed its previous decision on Oct. 10 because of proxy voting by some legislators.
The president signed off on the appointment shortly after the second vote. Jeenbekov said last week he was ready to resign once a new cabinet was installed, but it was unclear if he planned to do so imminently.
""The president's resignation is what people are demanding,"" Japarov told a briefing after the vote in parliament. ""I will go to the president today and we will resolve this issue.""
He also reaffirmed his commitment to maintain a strategic partnership with Russia and said he had no plans to change the terms of Russian military presence in the mountainous country of 6.5 million which borders China. 
Both sides had held talks this week with a senior official from Russia, Kyrgyzstan's closest ally.
Russia has expressed concerns that the former Soviet republic, home to a Russian military air base and a large Canadian-owned gold mining operation, could slide into complete chaos and said it had a duty to prevent that.
Japarov's supporters freed him from prison last week amid unrest after the parliamentary election which official results said was a landslide victory for allies of Jeenbekov. The result was annulled after protesters seized government buildings on Oct. 6.
Japarov had been serving a lengthy sentence on charges of taking a senior public servant hostage during a protest in 2013. Last week a court reviewed his case and quashed the verdict.

Kyrgyzstan's capital Bishkek is currently under a state of emergency, but a few hundred Japarov supporters demonstrated in centre of the city, defying a ban on rallies, to demand that the president resign and parliament dissolve itself.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's latest strategy to defuse tensions with Turkey is unravelling, two weeks after it was sealed, raising the risk of conflict in the Eastern Mediterranean, diplomats, officials and experts said. 
Despite an EU summit deal in the early hours of Oct. 2 aimed at persuading Ankara to stop exploring for natural gas in waters disputed by Greece and Cyprus, Turkey said on Wednesday it was restarting operations of a survey ship.
Turkey had withdrawn the vessel last month, just before the EU summit, at which economic sanctions were discussed, only to redeploy it on Monday. Three European diplomats said this gave the impression that Ankara was toying with Brussels.
The EU leaders left themselves exposed because they failed to come up with a solution to the gas dispute, instead proposing a ""carrot-and-stick"" approach - offering multiple benefits but also threatening sanctions - that appears to have failed, the diplomats and one EU official said.
""EU leaders kicked the can down the road by saying they would come back to the issue in December. Now it is coming back with a vengeance,"" one diplomat said, referring to reports of Turkish and Greek navy exercises planned for late October.
A NATO ally and a candidate to join the EU, Turkey has challenged European foreign policy in Syria, Libya and Russia in recent months. But Europe is eager to keep Ankara close to the West despite its authoritarian president, Tayyip Erdogan, who is intent on forging an independent path as a regional power.
Erdogan aide Fahrettin Altun said on Twitter that Turkey was committed to diplomacy but ""there can be no negotiations if you say 'what's mine is mine and what's yours is negotiable.'""
MONEY, TRADE
Greece and Cyprus will raise the gas dispute again when EU leaders meet on Thursday and Friday even though Turkey is not on their summit agenda, arguing that the latest escalation has demonstrated the need for more urgent action, diplomats said.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas cancelled a trip to Ankara this week in protest at the deployment of the Turkish exploration ship Oruc Reis, but diplomats said Berlin is so far not considering further measures. 
The EU, Turkey's largest trading partner and foreign investor, had hoped that by renewing an offer of an expanded trade deal, ending visa requirements for Turkish citizens and proposing more money for Syrian refugees in Turkey - as well as threatening sanctions - it would persuade Erdogan to start talks to clarify offshore hydrocarbon rights.
The Oct. 2 summit statement did not go into details.

""What's failed is the credibility of the EU's offer, it was not concrete enough,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat at Carnegie Europe, based in Istanbul.

575,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 14, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Mexican president's anti-corruption drive buffeted by scandals,"By Diego Oré
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Three months after taking charge of a new office created by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to compensate Mexicans for years of public sector embezzlement, its director quit, complaining the organization was tainted by corruption.
The blow to the Institute for Returning to the People What Was Stolen (INDEP) is one of several recent cases to blot Lopez Obrador's image and undercut the message that his December 2018 investiture marked a sea change for a country awash in graft.
On Sept. 22, INDEP director Jaime Cardenas submitted his letter of resignation, raising concerns over alleged misuse of proceeds from auctions of stolen assets, and the suspected theft of diamonds, emeralds and sapphires from the institute.
To critics, the exit of his ally Cardenas is a symbol of Lopez Obrador's failure to deliver on his anti-corruption pledge.
""Lopez Obrador's anti-corruption drive is much ado about nothing,"" said Emilio Alvarez Icaza, an independent opposition senator. ""It's a great story, and a poor reality.""
Downplaying news which could embarrass him, Lopez Obrador routinely dismisses criticism as sour grapes from corrupt opponents, and points to landmark legislation he has passed that strips public servants of prosecutorial immunity.
Opinion polls show he has made up ground he lost early in the coronavirus pandemic, lifted by his anti-corruption drive.
Some give him an approval rating of over 60% as he gears up for national, state and municipal elections next June that will determine whether he can keep control of Congress.
Under Lopez Obrador, Mexico has moved up eight places in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index to rank 130 out of 198 countries. Still, in 2019, the number of Mexicans who personally experienced public sector corruption rose 7%, according to the national statistics agency.
Cynicism over politicians is deeply entrenched in Mexico, where an old joke still makes the rounds that Alvaro Obregon, who ruled from 1920-1924, was the country's least corrupt president because he only had one arm with which to steal.
'NOT ENOUGH'
Scandals have also embroiled the families of some of Lopez Obrador's closest allies, including the son of a veteran politician who heads the state-run electricity company.
The son, who denies wrongdoing, was in July barred from doing business with the government for overcharging state health authorities for ventilators to battle COVID-19.
In August, videos surfaced of a brother of the president receiving cash in 2015 from a political operator who later won a post in Lopez Obrador's administration.
Then, in September, a sister-in-law of Lopez Obrador, along with other local officials, resigned from the city hall of his hometown of Macuspana in Tabasco state amid what the opposition allege is a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal.
""If the president thinks it's enough for him to be honest to end corruption, that's wrong,"" said Eduardo Bohorquez, director of the Mexican arm of Transparency International.
In each case, Lopez Obrador, who promised to show family and friends no quarter over corruption, said the revelations had been exploited by hostile media and adversaries to hurt him.
On INDEP, Lopez Obrador vowed to look into any complaints. But he called the resignation of Cardenas a political matter, and said there was ""nothing to worry about.""
He vowed to have the footage of his brother Pio investigated, though no formal proceedings have begun. The cash handovers, Lopez Obrador said, were ""contributions"" to his political cause and not comparable with previous corruption.
No proceedings have been brought against his sister-in-law Concepcion Falcon, who cited the ""ungovernability"" of Macuspana in quitting with her fellow councillors. Lopez Obrador verbally attacked the newspaper, Reforma, which publicized the case.
Lopez Obrador argues that high-profile prosecutions of ex-officials for corruption show he is ""moralizing"" public life.
One such prosecution involves Rosario Robles, a former ally accused of misuse of public funds in the last government. Another centers on a former head of state oil firm Pemex, Emilio Lozoya. Robles denies wrongdoing. Lozoya struck a plea bargain and accused his bosses of ordering him to channel bribes to politicians.
Lozoya's revelations have kept the spotlight on alleged past misdeeds by top officials and encouraged Lopez Obrador to press for a public vote on putting his predecessors on trial.
Despite concerns that such a referendum risks politicizing the normal passage of justice given that former presidents can already face prosecution, the Supreme Court this month declared it to be constitutional.
Lopez Obrador wants the referendum held the day of June's mid-term elections. Even if that is not possible, his agitation over the issue may prove significant.

""Keeping the corruption issue alive is politically beneficial for him,"" said Carlos Petersen, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. ""Lopez Obrador will use (the referendum) to score points before the 2021 elections.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thousands of Thai anti-government protesters and royalist supporters of King Maha Vajiralongkorn staged rival shows of force on Wednesday with political tension growing after three months of demonstrations.
Anti-government demonstrators set off from the Democracy Monument for the government's official compound, known as Government House, to demand the departure of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution. They have also called for reform of the monarchy.
Just metres away, were a mixture of security forces, state employees and royalists who had all dressed in the royal yellow colour before a royal motorcade was due to pass along the road.
Despite some brief scuffles, the two sides largely kept apart, but the standoff revived fears of trouble in a country that suffered a decade of street violence between supporters and opponents of the establishment before a 2014 coup.
""Have faith in democracy. We cannot fall back,"" protest leader Parit “Penguin” Chirawat, told protesters.
While thousands of yellow-clad people lined the streets as the protesters passed, it was not clear how many were there from conviction. One gave the three-fingered salute of the anti-government protesters, who rushed to shake his hand.
Royalist leader Buddha Issara said the protesters could demand democracy, but must not call for reforms of the monarchy, as some have done.
""They must not touch on the institution,"" he told reporters.
Protesters made a rare direct challenge to the king on Tuesday, chanting at his passing convoy after 21 activists were arrested during scuffles with police. Police said detainees would be charged with public order offences on Wednesday.
The protests have become the greatest challenge in years to a ruling establishment dominated by the army and the palace.
'DANGEROUS GAME'
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said police had been told to avoid needless confrontation. Police said nearly 15,000 officers had been deployed to keep order.
Police did not intervene as protesters removed potted plants they said authorities had put at Democracy Monument to stop them from reaching what has become a focus of the protests. The plants were all placed neatly on the road. 
The royal palace has not responded to any requests for comment on the protests or the protesters' demands.
Pro-royalist demonstrations have been small, compared with the tens of thousands who joined the biggest anti-government demonstration in September, but Wednesday's gathering of royalists was much bigger.
""The establishment in Thailand plays a very dangerous game, mobilizing state security forces and ultra-royalist groups to confront with the pro-democracy demonstrators,"" said Prajak Kongkirati, a professor at Thammasat University. 
Among the anti-government protesters' demands are for curbs on the constitutional powers of the king and for him to transfer back the personal control he took of some army units and a palace fortune valued in the tens of billions of dollars.
They say Prayuth, who took power in a 2014 coup, manipulated elections last year to ensure the army's continued grip. He says the elections were fair.
""Things shouldn’t be like this,"" said one 17-year-old student at the protest who gave her name only as Foil. “We have to take back our future.""

Lawyers for the 55-year-old blogger will visit him in detention on Thursday in Beijing to describe the charge and the sentence that he might face, friends said.

China's foreign ministry was approached for comment.
On Monday the ministry said the case was being heard in the Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court.
Yang was detained in January 2019 after arriving at Guangzhou Airport and had received no family visits and only limited access to legal representation, Payne said.
""This falls short of basic standards of justice and procedural fairness, and is not compatible with international norms.""

The fighting in the province, where U.S. and British troops for years fought to clear Taliban from a string of poppy-growing districts, comes as Afghan government negotiators and the Taliban try to push forward power-sharing talks in Qatar.
In another blow for the embattled government, two defence force helicopters setting off for a military mission in Helmand crashed into each other early on Wednesday killing nine people on board, the Ministry of Defence said in a statement.
Acting Defence Minister Assadullah Khalid arrived in Helmand's capital, Lashkar Gah, to assess the situation and support the forces facing the major insurgent offensive that has overshadowed the peace talks and brought U.S. air strikes. 
The Taliban have seized several checkpoints and closed in on Lashkar Gah but officials said the security forces had repelled overnight Taliban attacks in the districts of Nawa and Nad Ali, with casualties on both sides.
They declined to say how many.
The Taliban assault in Helmand is testing the resolve of the government and casting doubt over the talks to end the 19 years of war since the Taliban were ousted.
The violence could also throw into question President Donald Trump's pledge last week to bring home the remaining U.S. troops by Christmas.
Thousands of civilians have been caught up in the fighting, with more than 5,000 families displaced.

NEW YORK/NAIROBI (Reuters) - Somalia's Islamist insurgents are moving millions of dollars through the formal bank system and appear to be investing in businesses and real estate, according to a United Nations report offering a rare glimpse into their finances.
Al Shabaab has for years been battling Somalia's internationally-backed government to impose strict Islamic law in the anarchic Horn of Africa nation. 
""Al Shabaab remains in a strong financial position and is generating a significant budgetary surplus, some of which is invested in property purchases and businesses in Mogadishu,"" said the report by the U.N. sanctions panel on Somalia. 
The report by the group, which monitors compliance with an arms embargo on Somalia, is due to be published this week.
The al Qaeda-linked Somali militants carry out frequent bombings and attacks at home and have also killed hundreds of civilians in Kenya and Uganda. Earlier this year, al Shabaab killed three Americans at a U.S. military base in Kenya. 
The U.N. report included details on two bank accounts held at Salaam Somali Bank, founded in 2009 as part of the Hormuud group of companies, raising questions about Somalia's capacity to enforce a 2016 law aimed at curbing terrorist financing. 
The bank did not respond to requests for comment.
Somalia's Financial Reporting Center, which oversees compliance laws against money laundering and terror financing, said it is investigating the allegations against Salaam. 
Nearly $1.7 million moved through one of the accounts during a 10-week period until mid-July this year, the report said, noting the account appeared set up to receive Islamic tax called zakat. 
'SUPER EFFICIENT SHABAAB'
With around 5,000 fighters, al Shabaab controls towns and countryside in southern Somalia, but its spies and assassins operate nationwide. Its estimated expenditure last year was around $21 million, with about a quarter of that going to the Amniyat intelligence arm. 
Al Shabaab also runs its own courts. One businessman told investigators that the courts had summoned him this year and ordered him to pay more than $100,000 in zakat based on a review of his business, which they had assessed before he arrived. 
The businessman, who was not named, provided a banking deposit slip and a receipt from al Shabaab to investigators as proof of payment. ""Al Shabaab maintains a registry of citizens, which includes financial assessments on individuals and businesses,"" the report said.
Another account, which appeared to handle fees levied on businessmen usng Mogadishu port, had $1.1 million moved through it from mid-Febuary until the end of June this year, the report said. It included a cash deposit of $25,000 by someone calling himself ""A B C"" on documentation.
In total, the two accounts made more than 128 transactions exceeding the $10,000 threshold that should trigger automatic reporting to the Financial Reporting Centre.
When asked if the accounts had been shut down, Amina Ali, head of the centre, told Reuters: ""All the necessary steps have been taken."" 
The report also examined a single al Shabaab road checkpoint - one of dozens - that former al Shabaab tax officials told investigators made between $1.8 million-$2.4 million per year. 
In the government-controlled southern port of Kismayo, businesses are forced to pay the insurgency between $300-$600 monthly depending on their size, which could earn them nearly $6 million a year from Kismayo alone, the report said. 
Businessmen are afraid to refuse al Shabaab for fear of being killed, said Hussein Sheikh Ali, a former Somali national security advisor and founder of the Mogadishu-based Hiraal Institute thinktank. Their own report on al Shabaab finances is due out this month.
U.S.-supported Somali special forces sometimes attack al Shabaab checkpoints to cut their revenues, he said.
""Shabaab is super efficient in terms of collecting money throughout industries and the country,"" he said. 

""We know they have surplus money... and we believe they may send some money to al Qaeda.""

Underscoring the growing problem, the Vatican said on Monday that four members of the Swiss Guards, the elite and colourfully dressed corps that protects the pope, had tested positive for COVID-19.
The pope, who does not wear a mask at the audiences, had part of one lung removed during an illness when he was a young man in his native Argentina.
He sometimes breathes heavily after climbing steps and some Vatican officials have speculated that difficulty breathing may be a reason he does not wear a mask in large spaces.
Instead of arriving from the door at the back of the hall and making his way through the crowds, the pope walked through the stage door and smiled and waved to the faithful from a distance. They stood and applauded him.

""Sorry if today I greet you from far away, but I believe that if everybody, as good citizens, follows the regulations of the authorities, it will help to handle the pandemic. Thank you,"" he said.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam deployed helicopters and soldiers on Wednesday to search for dozens of people feared dead in two catastrophic landslides near a hydropower dam, triggered by adverse weather that aid groups warned could overwhelm the most resilient communities.
The first of hundreds of rescuers with boats and army vehicles battled through blocked roads to reach the dam site in the remote mountainous area of central Vietnam early on Wednesday, hoping to find survivors among at least 30 people missing after Monday's mudslides. 
Intense rains since early October have caused floods and mudslides that have killed at least 39 people in central Vietnam, while more heavy rainfall is expected until early next week on several fronts, including from tropical storm Nangka, which made landfall earlier on Wednesday. 
""The search and rescue work is being conducted in a rapid manner, with a target of bringing the victims out within today,"" the government said in a statement. 
Among those are 13 members of a rescue team hit by a second landslide while trying to reach the trapped construction workers at the Rao Trang 3 hydropower dam in Thua Thien Hue province. Three workers were killed and 17 were missing. 
Local television showed troops arriving in trucks along narrow tracks and an air force helicopter flying above the mountains to deliver supplies to rescuers, passing over fast-flowing streams of muddy brown water.
The International Federation of the Red Cross (IFRC) said nearly one million people in central Vietnam would be severely affected by floods, with grave fears those would worsen and deprive huge numbers of people of emergency help.
""Multiple storm fronts will overwhelm even the most prepared and resilient communities,"" said Hung Ha Nguyen, IFRC programme coordinator.

Tropical storm Nangka will cause heavy rain in northern and central Vietnam until Friday but will weaken as it travels further inland on Wednesday, the weather agency said.

In a move reviving tensions with Greece, Ankara sent the Oruc Reis vessel to a disputed area near the Greek island of Kastellorizo off Turkey's coast on Monday. Greece said it was a ""major escalation"" of their dispute over maritime rights and claims to hydrocarbon resources in the region.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China has opened a new front in its pressure campaign against Taiwan with a series of spying allegations and confessions aired on state television, denounced on the democratic island as entrapment and another reason for people to fear visiting China.
China views Taiwan as its sovereign territory and has stepped up a campaign to assert its claim, including sending fighter jets near the island.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen says the island will not provoke but will defend itself.
Starting on Sunday evening, Chinese state television has been showing what it says are detained Taiwanese spies who have been operating in China, and confessing to their crimes.
China, under its Thunder-2020 campaign, has cracked hundreds of cases orchestrated by Taiwan's intelligence forces to ""infiltrate and damage"" and set up a network of spies, state television said.
The Global Times, a widely read Chinese tabloid run by the Communist Party's official People's Daily, said on Wednesday the revelations were a warning to ""Taiwan separatist forces"".
Taiwan says China is framing and entrapping people, and that putting people on television to confess crimes before going to trial is a serious breach of proper legal process, something rights groups have long criticised Beijing for doing.
Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said China was spreading slander and ""creating terror"".
Asked about Taiwan's spying in China - both sides have long accused each other of running espionage networks - Su said Taiwan did not do that anymore and did not need to.
""China is an authoritarian country, and always does this kind of infiltration and damage, so it thinks others do it too. They don't know that Taiwan has been democratic and open for ages.""
Taiwan has taken particular umbrage at what it says are obvious inaccuracies in some of China's accusations, including that one of the accused spies previously worked for a former chairman of the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), Cho Jung-tai. Cho says he did not know the man.
It has not been possible to reach any of the suspected spies for comment, though Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said they had been provided with lawyers and investigations carried out in accordance with the law.
The DPP had ""stepped up their collusion with external anti-China forces, frequently creating incidents"", she added, calling on it to stop ""harming the overall interests of the Chinese people"".
The arrests have raised concerns in Taiwan about safety of its people in China.
""Think of the risks,"" said Wang Ting-yu, a senior DPP lawmaker who sits on parliament's foreign affairs and defence committee. 

""Any Taiwanese person, no matter their political positions of beliefs or party background, is simply a tool for the Chinese Communists.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's royal palace postponed from Wednesday all meetings for two weeks because of new coronavirus curbs, a palace official said, likely putting off a decision on a bid by opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim to form a new government.
Anwar had on Tuesday met King Al-Sultan Abdullah to try to prove he had a ""convincing"" parliamentary majority to form a government, sparking a fresh bout of political wrangling just months after Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin took office.
The king was scheduled to meet leaders of main political parties to verify Anwar's claim but a two-week partial lockdown took effect from Wednesday in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, and neighbouring state of Selangor.
""Yes, due to the CMCO and the implementation of National Palace lockdown,"" palace comptroller Ahmad Fadil Shamsuddin told Reuters, referring to a so-called conditional movement control order as coronavirus cases spike.
The palace will set new dates for the meetings with party leaders after the curbs were lifted, Ahmad Fadil said.
Should Anwar succeed in his bid to become prime minister, it would be the culmination of a 22-year long quest, which included nearly 10 years in jail on sodomy charges he denied. It would also mean Malaysia would have its third prime minister this year.
Anwar told a news conference on Monday he had presented documents to the king to prove he had the support of more than 120 members of the 222-seat parliament.
The palace later said Anwar had submitted the number of lawmakers that he said supported him but had not identified them.
The king plays a largely ceremonial role but he can appoint a prime minister who in his view is likely to command a majority.
In February, at the height of wrangling that saw the collapse of the administration of veteran leader Mahathir Mohamad, the king appointed Muhyiddin prime minister after consulting every member of parliament.
Muhyiddin has a two-seat parliamentary majority and critics say he came to power through shifting alliances and not earning it at the ballot box.

Malaysia reported 660 new coronavirus cases and four deaths on Tuesday, raising its tally to 16,880 cases and 163 fatalities.

Formally still at war after decades of conflict, Lebanon and Israel agreed to launch talks via U.S. mediation over a maritime border running through potentially gas-rich Mediterranean waters.
This follows three years of diplomacy by Washington and comes weeks after it stepped up sanctions on political allies of Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon, a country deep in financial crisis.
In an overnight statement, Hezbollah and Amal, Lebanon's two main Shi'ite parties, said the negotiating team must include only military officials, without any civilians or politicians. 
""The two demand immediately rowing back from this decision and re-forming the delegation in line with the framework agreement,"" it said.
There was no immediate comment from the office of President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah political ally, which took charge of forming the team. The presidency said on Tuesday the negotiations would be exclusively technical. 
Hezbollah has said the talks did not signal peace-making with long-time enemy Israel. The two last fought a deadly month-long war in 2006.

Wednesday's meeting is due to be hosted by the U.N. peacekeeping force that has monitored the also contested land border since Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon in 2000, ending a 22-year occupation.

589,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 11:35PM ET</span>",Anti-migrant sentiment fanned on Facebook in Malaysia,"By Rozanna Latiff and A. Ananthalakshmi
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - As coronavirus infections surged in Malaysia this year, a wave of hate speech and misinformation aimed at Rohingya Muslim refugees from Myanmar began appearing on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Alarmed rights groups reported the material to Facebook.
But six months later, many posts targeting the Rohingya in Malaysia remain on the platform, including pages such as ""Anti Rohingya Club"" and ""Foreigners Mar Malaysia's Image"", although those two pages were removed after Reuters flagged them to Facebook recently.
Comments still online in one private group with nearly 100,000 members included ""Hope they all die, this cursed pig ethnic group"".
Facebook acknowledged in 2018 that its platform was used to incite violence against the Rohingya in Myanmar, and last year spent more than $3.7 billion on safety and security on its platform. 
But the surge of anti-Rohingya comment in Malaysia shows how xenophobic speech nonetheless persists.
""Assertions that Facebook is uncommitted to addressing safety and security are inaccurate and do not reflect the significant investment we've made to address harmful content on our platform,"" a company spokeswoman told Reuters. 
Reuters found more than three dozen pages and groups, including accounts run by former and serving Malaysian security officials, that featured discriminatory language about Rohingya refugees and undocumented migrants.
Dozens of comments encouraged violence.
Reuters found some of the strongest comments in closed private groups, which people have to ask to join. Such groups have been a hotbed for hate speech and misinformation in other parts of the world.
Facebook removed 12 of the 36 pages and groups flagged by Reuters, and several posts. Five other pages with anti-migrant content seen by Reuters in the last month were removed before Reuters queries. 
""We do not allow people to post hate speech or threats of violence on Facebook and we will remove this content as soon as we become aware of it,"" Facebook said. 
Some of the pages that remain online contain comments comparing Rohingya to dogs and parasites. Some disclosed where Rohingya had been spotted and encouraged authorities and the public to take action against them.
WIDESPREAD HATE SPEECH
""This kind of hate speech can lead to physical violence and persecution of a whole group. We saw this in Myanmar,"" said John Quinley, senior human rights specialist at Fortify Rights, an independent group focused on Southeast Asia. 
""It would be irresponsible to not actively take down anti-refugee and anti-Rohingya Facebook groups and pages.""
Muslim-majority Malaysia was long friendly to the Rohingya, a minority fleeing persecution in largely Buddhist Myanmar, and more than 100,000 Rohingya refugees live in Malaysia, even though it doesn't officially recognise them as refugees.
But sentiment turned in April, with the Rohingya being accused of spreading the coronavirus. Hate speech circulated widely, including on Facebook – a platform used by nearly 70% of Malaysia's 32 million people.
Rights groups and refugees said comments on Facebook helped escalate xenophobia in Malaysia.
""Malaysians who have lived with Rohingya refugees for years have started calling the cops on us, some have lost jobs. We are in fear all the time,"" said Abu, a Rohingya refugee who did not want to give his full name fearing repercussions.
Another refugee who declined to be identified said he deactivated his Facebook account after his details were posted and Malaysians messaged him telling him to go back to Myanmar - from where he fled five years ago.
""Facebook has failed, they don't understand how dangerous such comments can be,"" he said, referring to posts he had seen supporting action in Myanmar against Rohingya.
'ABSENT'
Rights groups said the government of Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin had failed to do enough to curb xenophobia as it rounded up thousands of undocumented migrants and said it would no longer accept Rohingya refugees.
""The Malaysian government was completely absent from any sort of effort to try to curtail this wave of hate speech,"" said Human Rights Watch deputy Asia director Phil Robertson.
Muhyiddin's office did not respond to requests for comment.
Reuters found four pages with links to security and enforcement agencies voicing anti-immigrant sentiment. 
""Let us not suffer the cancer of this ethnic (group),"" administrators of a group called ""Friends of Immigration"" posted. The group says it is run by current and former immigration officials. 
That post from April was removed this month after Reuters queries to Facebook.
The immigration department did not respond to Reuters queries. The communications and home ministries also did not respond to queries on hate speech in social media. 
Among the earliest posts to draw comments calling for Rohingya to be shot was one from the Malaysian Armed Forces Headquarters asking the public to be its ""ears and eyes"" and report undocumented migrants. A military spokesman confirmed the authenticity of the page.
Another post that was shared more than 26,000 times was from a page calling itself the Military Royal Intelligence Corps that said undocumented migrants ""will bring problems to all of us"".
Reuters was unable to contact the administrator of the page. The military said it had nothing to do with the page and it was run by a former member of the intelligence unit.

Facebook removed both posts after Reuters queries. The Intelligence Corps page was also taken down.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un promised to help typhoon-hit areas recover and to build at least 25,000 houses over the next five years, state media said on Wednesday.
Visiting one of the worst-hit areas of North Korea, Kim expressed regret over the more than 50-year-old houses in which people have been living and urged the military to embark on a more ambitious construction plan, KCNA said. 
The visit came after Kim appeared to shed tears at the weekend as he thanked citizens for their sacrifices, in the most striking demonstration yet of how he is relying on his ""man-of- the-people"" persona to tackle his country's deepening crises.
The military has reached a construction level of 60% for at least 2,300 houses in the Komdok area in South Hamgyong province, northeast of the capital, Pyongyang, the state media said.
Kim said new houses were now only built when the old ones were brought down by natural disasters, and called for a ""revolution"" in construction plans, starting with building 25,000 houses during his five-year plan set to be unveiled in January. 
Last week, Kim called on his country to embark on an 80-day ""speed battle"" - to attain economic goals before a congress in January to decide the new five-year plan. 
North Korea has had a tough year because of the impact of anti-coronavirus measures, international sanctions and several typhoons that battered towns.

591,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 07:11PM ET</span>",How poor regions lose out because of U.S. census undercounts,"By Nick Brown
ESPANOLA, New Mexico (Reuters) - Getting an accurate count of America’s population has proven difficult in the 2020 Census as the coronavirus pandemic has hampered voluntary responses and forced officials to scale back door-knocking efforts.
The administration of President Donald Trump has placed other hurdles on the path to an accurate count. Its attempt to add a question about citizenship to the census earlier this year likely discouraged undocumented immigrants from filling out the survey, even though the administration's effort failed, demographics experts say. Local officials nationwide worry about the impact of undercounts on their communities.
""This is going to be the worst response rate we’ve ever had,"" said Lauren Reichelt, Health and Human Services Director for Rio Arriba County, New Mexico.
Rio Arriba is typical of other regions across the United States that are hardest to count - and have the most to lose from an undercount. It's poor, rural and home to many undocumented immigrants. Low population tallies can rob such areas of badly needed federal dollars for affordable housing and child care, for instance, or resources to fight America’s opioid epidemic, according to local officials in some of the most undercounted regions in the last census, taken in 2010.
On Tuesday, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to wind down the census a month earlier than originally planned - a blow to civil rights groups concerned about undercounts, particularly of racial minorities. (See full story https://reut.rs/3iWUMkU )
The justices put on hold a lower court ruling that had ordered the Census Bureau to continue the population count until Oct. 31. The lawsuit - filed by major cities and counties, along with civil rights groups - argued that the “rushed” schedule would lead to “a massive undercount of the country’s communities of color.”
This year, as in the past, high-poverty communities are among the hardest to count, said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a consultant on census and statistical issues and former congressional staffer overseeing census matters.
""Persistent undercounting in communities that would benefit most from targeted public and private investment makes it harder to address the very barriers that contribute to a less accurate census,"" Lowenthal said.
The Census Bureau and the White House declined to comment for this story.
The census guides the allocation of $1.5 trillion a year in federal aid. The census is also a linchpin of American democracy because the population counts are used to determine the number of Congressional representatives assigned to a state and to draw maps of electoral districts.
Some of the hardest-to-count regions in the last census might be even harder to survey this year as the country reels from the coronavirus pandemic, according to a Reuters analysis of Census data. They include border areas in Texas, the lowlands of Mississippi and the northern plains of New Mexico.
'I ALWAYS RELAPSE'
Rio Arriba officials estimated they were undercounted by 4% in 2010, after only 42% of households mailed back their census forms voluntarily. That compared to 66.5% of households that responded by mail nationally, according to Census data.
The bureau sent door-knockers to get more responses, but still had to use a Census process called imputation to estimate residency for 9.6% of Rio Arriba's count, a far larger proportion than the national average.
Officials in the county say an accurate count would have helped narrow funding gaps that leave it without enough medicine, detox clinics, housing and other support to fight one of the community's biggest problems: an opioid epidemic that kills people at a rate more than four times the U.S. average, according to government data.
The current U.S. Census shows no signs of reversing the trend. Rio Arriba’s voluntary response rate is running at 32%, 10 points below its 2010 rate and less than half the overall U.S. rate of 67%.
It is impossible to know exactly how much funding is lost due to an undercount, says George Washington University professor Andrew Reamer, the nation’s foremost expert on the relationship between the census and federal spending. That would require knowing exactly how many people were missed and which government programs would have served them.
Officials in Rio Arriba agree they were entitled to more federal funds for programs to address a local opioid crisis.
“A lot of the funding for my department is federal, so we end up being entitled to a lot less than we should when there’s an undercount,” said Reichelt.
The $3.4 million her department received in 2020 to fight addiction is spread thin, and even a relatively modest increase could make a big difference. The county can’t afford to build a detox center, and patients wait for weeks to get suboxone, a drug that reduces withdrawal symptoms, Reichelt said.
The Rio Arriba County Housing Authority, meanwhile, manages 54 public housing units, and assists another 25 families with rent vouchers. But the wait lists can be as long as five years, according to Reichelt.
Joey Garcia, a 32-year-old heroin addict who has been in and out of jail on drug charges, said he has struggled to get straight while on waiting lists for both subsidized housing and suboxone treatment. 
“Somehow,” Garcia said, “I always relapse.”
NERVOUS TO ANSWER
The Rio Grande Valley in south Texas is a political netherworld. North of the border but south of immigration checkpoints, its four counties - Hidalgo, Cameron, Starr and Willacy - include informal communities known as colonias, often heavily populated with undocumented immigrants.
In Hidalgo, officials estimate they were undercounted by at least 10% in 2010, after just 56% of the population responded voluntarily. The Census Bureau estimated a more modest 5.4% undercount.
Either way, the undercounts reduced funding to the area’s Head Start and Low Income Heating and Energy Assistance (LIHEAP) programs, which cover only a fraction of eligible residents.
In Pueblo de Palmas, a colonia in Hidalgo County, Cristina, 35, qualifies for government-funded Head Start childcare for her four children, but only one was admitted. She asked that only her first name be used because she is an undocumented immigrant.
Both LIHEAP and Head Start are underfunded in the county. The former has a budget of $6 million, enough to serve 3-4% of qualifying households, says Jaime Longoria, the region’s community services director.
Head Start, which relies on population data to decide where to expand programs, can serve 3,700 kids in Hidalgo out of 22,000 who qualify, said Teresa Flores, the local Head Start director. An accurate count would help cover some of that gap, she said.
Cristina and her neighbor, Maria - also undocumented - both said they couldn't remember filling out a census form in 2010 and that they were afraid to do so this year.
“I’m nervous someone will come to my house and take me away,” Maria said.
'WE’RE BROKE'
In central Mississippi, voluntary participation in the 2010 census ranged between 45% and 60%. The rate in these areas so far this year is similar, according to Census data.
Lower funding from census undercounts has affected a crucial childcare program for low-income mothers in the nation's poorest state, program officials said.
More than 112,000 Mississippi families are poor enough to qualify, but the program only has enough money to grant 20,000 to 25,000 vouchers, said Carol Burnett, who runs the nonprofit Mississippi Low Income Childcare Initiative.
Mississippi’s allotment under the Child Care and Development Block Grant that funds the program was $91.8 million in fiscal year 2019. An extra 1% of that total statewide - about $918,000 - could potentially serve hundreds more parents across the state, Burnett said, as the vouchers cover around $5,700 a year in expenses.
Tanisha Womack, 35, runs three daycare centers in Simpson and Smith counties, two of several counties in Mississippi that were among the hardest to count nationwide in 2010, according to the Reuters data.
Womack is certified to care for 152 children, but has just 72 children enrolled, she said, because many qualifying parents have been denied vouchers.

“We’re broke,” Womack said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China and Russia were elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday, but support for Beijing dropped by more than 20 percent compared with a 2016 vote and Saudi Arabia failed in its bid to win a seat on the Geneva-based body. 
The 193-member U.N. General Assembly also elected Ivory Coast, Gabon, Malawi, Cuba, Bolivia, Uzbekistan, France and Britain to the 47-member council. Senegal, Nepal, Pakistan, Ukraine and Mexico were re-elected for a second three-year term. Council members cannot serve more than two consecutive terms.
Candidates are elected by secret ballot in geographical groups to ensure even representation. The Asia-Pacific group, which included Saudi Arabia, was the only competitive race on Tuesday with five candidates vying for four seats. The new members will begin their term on Jan. 1, 2021. 
""Saudi Arabia's failure to win a seat on the Human Rights Council is a welcome reminder of the need for more competition in U.N. elections. Had there been additional candidates, China, Cuba and Russia might have lost too,"" said Human Rights Watch U.N. director Louis Charbonneau. 
Saudi Arabia received 152 votes when it was last elected in 2016 to be a council member from 2017 to 2019, but on Tuesday only 90 states voted for Riyadh - a 40 percent drop. While China was elected on Tuesday with 139 votes, its support fell more than 20 percent compared to the last time it won a seat in 2016.
Both countries have been criticized internationally for their human rights records. Most recently China has been condemned by Western countries for its treatment of Uighur Muslims in the country's Xinjiang region and handling of pro-democracy protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration quit the Human Rights Council in 2018 - half way through its term - over what it called chronic bias against Israel and a lack of reform. 
""The U.N. General Assembly once again elected countries with abhorrent human rights records,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday.

Russia was elected on Tuesday four years after it was surprisingly ousted after one term, losing by two votes. Former U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power, under President Barack Obama, revealed last year in her memoir that she had been directed by Washington to vote for Russia in the secret ballot, but did not.

Lopez Obrador wants to celebrate Mexico's Aztec past in 2021 to mark the 500th anniversary of the fall of Aztec capital Tenochtitlan to conquistador Hernan Cortes, an event which ushered in three centuries of Spanish domination.
The leftist president, who has asked European powers to apologize for colonial-era abuses in Mexico, urged Austria to lend the delicate, brightly-colored headdress said to have been worn by Aztec emperor Moctezuma before he was toppled by Cortes.
""The Austrians have completely taken control of the headdress,"" he told a news conference. 
Likening it to a ""mission impossible"", Lopez Obrador asked his wife Beatriz Gutierrez to appeal to Austria on a visit to Vienna during a European tour where she has made loan requests for various artifacts his government wants to exhibit.
""Next year will be dedicated to this because the colonialists have narrated history at their convenience,"" Lopez Obrador said. ""It's always the same, those who conquer or invade have to justify their meddling, stealing and atrocities with the aid of their supposed superiority.""
Spanish forces largely destroyed Tenochtitlan after a siege in 1521, building Mexico City on the ruins. 
The famous headdress is nearly a yard (meter) wide and made from more than 450 elegant, vivid green feathers of the quetzal bird mounted in a jewel and gold encrusted crown.
It is believed to have arrived in Europe in the 16th century, and according to Vienna's Museum of Ethnology, which houses the headdress, it later fell into the hands of Austria's Archduke Ferdinand of Tyrol.
Over the years, it has been subject to repeated Mexican requests for its return.

Vienna's Museum of Ethnology did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Jean Castex refused to rule out local lockdowns while French media reported that curfews in COVID hotspots were under consideration.
France's five largest cities - Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse and Lille - are among nine metropolitan areas already on maximum alert, meaning bars and gyms are closed and restaurants operate under strict sanitary conditions.
French health authorities reported 12,993 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours, up on Monday's 8,505, but down from Saturday's record of 26,896 and Sunday's 16,101.
But the seven-day moving average of new infections, which averages out weekly data reporting irregularities, stood above the record 17,000 level for the second day running, at 17,816.
The cumulative number of cases now totals 756,472.
The number of people in France who have died from COVID-19 infections rose by 117 to 32,942, versus 95 on Monday and a seven-day moving average of 82, a level not seen since May.
The number of people in hospital for the respiratory disease increased by 257, at 8,949, a post-June 25 high. That is still less than a third of the peak of 32,292 reached on April 14, but almost twice as high as the 4,530 on Aug. 29.

France imposed one of Europe's strictest lockdowns to limit coronavirus contagion between March 17 and May 11 to avoid overwhelming the hospital system.

Suzanne  Eaton  (NYSE:ETN), 60, a molecular biologist at the Max Planck Institute in Dresden, Germany, was found dead in a disused military bunker in July of last year, around a week after she went missing after going out for a jog.
A 28-year-old man from Crete, identified as Ioannis Paraskakis, initially told Greek police he had killed Eaton. He later said his confession was made under duress and that his involvement in her disappearance was an accident.
A court in the town of Chania sentenced Paraskakis to life imprisonment for manslaughter, 13 years for rape and four months for the possession of firearms, the semi-official Athens News Agency reported.
Eaton had been in Crete for a science conference. 
The accused was charged with knocking her down with his car, then dragging her to another area where he raped her. 
Eaton's colleagues raised the alarm on the day of her disappearance, triggering a massive search. It is believed she died on the day of her disappearance, on July 2, 2019. 
Her body was found by cavers in a bunker, a system of man-made caves used by the Nazis during the occupation of Crete in World War Two.

In Canada as in the United States, Halloween brings armies of children dressed in spooky costumes out onto the streets in search of candy and maybe a fright or two.
For parents, this year's Halloween is truly a scary prospect, however, as coronavirus case numbers climb. Canada recorded 975 new infections on Monday, and the prime minister warned last week that the country is at a ""tipping point"" in its battle against a second surge.
""We can have Halloween... It's possible to give and receive candy safely,"" Dr. Howard Njoo, Canada's deputy chief public health officer, told a news conference on Tuesday.
""There are some really interesting ideas where people are handing out treats on the end of a hockey stick,"" added Dr. Theresa Tam, chief medical officer. ""Pre-packaging your treats so people are not rummaging in a bowl of candies is actually important.""
More tips, like equipping the kids with small bottles of hand sanitizer, will be posted on the Health Ministry's website, she said.
Health experts agree it is important to have ""some degree of normality"" during the pandemic, Tam said, but added that staying outdoors, physical distancing and wearing masks that ""could turn into part of your costume"" are necessary.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The spectacular rescue a decade ago of 33 miners trapped for two months underground in Chile´s far-flung Atacama desert made headlines around the world.
One of the survivors recalled in an interview with Reuters on Monday the drama of the last few moments before his escape, when rescuers threaded him through a narrow gap in the rock in a capsule designed for the purpose.
Mario Sepúlveda, the group's leader and the second man to be rescued, remembered his fear as the capsule hauled him upwards out of the darkness, not knowing if the plan would work. 
""On the way out, it was terrible, terrible,"" Sepúlveda said. ""I screamed. I just wanted to get out, to see the light.""
He and other miners were trapped by a mine collapse on Aug. 5, 2010 at the San José mine, a small deposit nestled among dusty, desert hills near the city of Copiapó, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) north of Santiago.
No one knew whether the miners, far beneath the surface, were alive or dead until they were able to convey a note to the surface in a probe sent down by authorities on Aug. 22. ""We are fine in the shelter, the 33 of us,"" said the note, written in red ink. 
The final rescue, broadcast live around the globe, took place on Oct. 13 of that year with each man emerging alive.
The miners have since become stars. Their story prompted a movie, with Spaniard Antonio Banderas starring as Mario Sepúlveda.
On Tuesday, Chilean President Sebastián Piñera, whose first government oversaw the rescue operations, led a commemoration ceremony at the La Moneda presidential palace.

""We should remember and learn the lessons of the miracle of the San Jose Mine, to confront with the same willpower, faith, unity and strength...the great new challenges of coronavirus before us,"" Pinera said in a televised speech.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer called on Tuesday for a two to three week ""circuit breaker"" lockdown, piling pressure on Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is struggling to sell his own plan to tackle COVID-19.
Dropping what his party has described as its ""constructive opposition"" towards government attempts to flatten a growing number of new coronavirus cases, Starmer said ""there's no longer time to give this prime minister the benefit of the doubt"".
""The government's plan simply isn't working. Another course is needed. That's why I'm calling for a two to three week circuit break in England,"" he told a news conference.
Starmer said his proposal, which he urged the government to adopt, would not mean schools closing. Instead the temporary lockdown could be timed to take place at the same time as an approaching school holiday.
Describing his plan as meaning ""significant sacrifices across the country"", he proposed allowing only essential work and travel, restricting household mixing and the closure of all pubs, bars and restaurants, but with compensation.
Johnson wants to avoid a full national lockdown, saying he is trying to balance public health and the economy, but Starmer said the economy would suffer more in the long-run without a 'circuit breaker' to stem the spread of the virus.
With the number of COVID cases and associated deaths rising across Britain, particularly in the north of England, Johnson has introduced a tiered system to try to better coordinate a response which, for many, had become difficult to understand.
But his adoption of a 10 p.m. curfew for bars and restaurants has raised tempers in his Conservative Party, with dozens of lawmakers rebelling during a parliamentary vote which approved the measures on Tuesday.
Earlier, Johnson urged his lawmakers to back his new tiered system, which classifies all English regions as medium, high or very high risk and determines restrictions accordingly. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have responsibility for their own health policy.
Addressing a private meeting of Conservative Party lawmakers virtually, Johnson defended his system, saying a localised response was needed, a lawmaker present said.

Johnson acknowledged that while any restrictions went against his instincts, action was necessary, the lawmaker said, adding that the prime minister received a sympathetic hearing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is moving forward with more sales of sophisticated military equipment to Taiwan, telling Congress on Tuesday that it will seek to sell MQ-9 drones and a coastal defensive missile system, five sources familiar with the situation said.
These possible sales follow three other notifications first reported by Reuters on Monday that drew China's ire in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
China considers Taiwan a wayward province that it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary.
Reuters broke the news in September that as many as seven major weapons systems were making their way through the U.S. export process as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China.
The pre-notification to Congress for the MQ-9 drone case is the first after President Donald Trump's administration moved ahead with its plan to sell more drones to more countries by reinterpreting an international arms control agreement called the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).
Tuesday's other congressional pre-notification was for land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles, made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co, to serve as a coastal defense against cruise missiles.
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees have the right to review, and block, weapons sales under an informal review process before the State Department sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.
Leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees were notified that the planned weapons sales had been approved by the U.S. State Department which oversees foreign military sales, said the sources, who are familiar with the situation but declined to be identified.
Reuters reported on Monday that informal notifications had been sent to Congress for a truck-based rocket launcher made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), long-range air-to-ground missiles made by Boeing called SLAM-ER, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets that allow the real-time transmission of imagery and data from the aircraft back to ground stations.

Representatives for the U.S. State Department and China did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian authorities released a top Kashmiri politician late on Tuesday, the last major leader held since August last year when the federal government withdrew the troubled region’s autonomy and arrested politicians.
Mehbooba Mufti, a former Chief Minister of the state, was released late on Tuesday, government spokesperson Rohit Kansal said on Twitter. He did not give a reason for her release. 
A government order seen by Reuters said Mufti's detention under the Public Safety Act, which allows for detention without trial for up to two years, was being revoked with immediate effect. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government said at the time that ending Kashmir’s special status was necessary for closer integration of the Muslim majority territory into the rest of India.
The government imposed a communication blackout with mobiles phones, internet links and landlines down and detained scores of people including Mufti to prevent large scale protests from erupting over the loss of autonomy for Kashmir.
Top politicians Farooq Abdullah and his son Omar Abdullah, both former Chief Ministers of the state, were released earlier this year.
Mufti's daughter had filed a habeas corpus petition in the country's Supreme Court, challenging her mother’s detention under the Public Safety Act. The case is scheduled to come up for hearing on Thursday.

""The Mole"", by maverick filmmaker Mads Bruegger, charts what he says was a 10-year undercover operation by a retired Copenhagen chef to infiltrate a network of sanctions-breakers linked to the head of the Korean Friendship Association (KFA), an international group that promotes friendly ties with Pyongyang.
""The material we have is huge,"" Bruegger told Reuters on Tuesday, two days after his documentary aired on Danish TV. ""I would like to meet with the U.N.'s North Korea expert panel to start a dialogue about what they would be interested in.""
A spokesman at the North Korean Embassy in Stockholm declined to comment. The head of the KFA denied any involvement in attempts to violate the arms embargo against Pyongyang.
In the documentary, the former chef - who has long been fascinated with communist dictatorships - pretends to be a supporter of North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and joins the Friendship Association. 
After becoming a trusted member, he hires a former French Foreign Legion soldier to play an arms trader and the two travel to North Korea for meetings about possible arms deals, apparently winning the trust of North Korean officials. 
They also agree a deal with the North Korean regime to build an underground factory in Uganda to produce weapons and drugs.
The documentary names certain key North Korean officials and shows entire catalogues of North Korean weapons for sale, including tanks, medium-range ballistic missiles and thermobaric explosives.
""If the film in any way can help to slow down North Korea's tenacity in terms of breaking sanctions and spreading their weapons across in the world, then I would be very happy about that,"" Bruegger said.
None of the deals mooted in the film are consummated and eventually, as partners start to demand money, Bruegger makes the ex-legionnaire playing the arms dealer disappear. The filmmakers say their evidence has been presented to the North Korean Embassy in Stockholm, but there has been no response.
The foreign ministers of Sweden and Denmark said following the airing of the film that they would raise the issue of sanctions busting at the United Nations and European Union.
North Korea has been subject since 2006 to U.N. sanctions, which have been strengthened by the Security Council over the years in efforts to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear arms and ballistic missile programmes.

The documentary, filmed over the course of a decade, is a co-production between public broadcasters in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Britain.

Hariri has begun consultations with the president, parliamentary speaker and Lebanese political blocs about forming a government that would implement President Emmanuel Macron's roadmap for reforms and unlock international aid.
He has said his mission was to form a six-month government of technocrats to rapidly carry out the reform plan set out in Macron's initiative. 
""We were not aware, and nobody informed us, that President Macron had appointed a high commissioner... to Lebanon, and made a prefect for us to oversee his initiative and the extent of its implementation,"" Bassil said in a speech to supporters. 
""Whoever wants to head a government of technocrats has to be a technocrat himself,"" said Bassil, who heads Lebanon's biggest Christian bloc, the Free Patriotic Movement. A former foreign minister, Bassil is also President Michel Aoun's son-in-law.
Aoun will hold formal consultations on Thursday about nominating a prime minister to form a new government to replace Hassan Diab's cabinet, which resigned two months ago after a powerful explosion damaged much of Beirut and killed 200 people. 
Diab's nominated replacement has been unable to form a government after the powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its political allies insisted on nominating the finance minister.

Lebanon is suffering its worst financial collapse since a 1975-1990 civil war. Foreign donors have made clear there will be no fresh aid unless Lebanese leaders launch reforms to tackle graft and improve governance, and engage in IMF negotiations.

BEIRUT/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Lebanon and Israel, formally still at war after decades of conflict, launch talks on Wednesday to address a long-running dispute over their maritime border running through potentially gas-rich Mediterranean waters.
The U.S.-mediated talks follow three years of diplomacy by Washington and were announced weeks after it stepped up pressure on allies of Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah.
They also come after the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain agreed to establish full relations with Israel, under U.S.-brokered deals which realign some of Washington's closest Middle East allies against Iran.
Hezbollah, which last fought a war with Israel in 2006, says the talks are not a sign of peace-making with its long-time enemy. Israel's energy minister also said expectations should be realistic.
""We are not talking about negotiations for peace and normalization, rather an attempt to solve a technical, economic dispute that for 10 years has delayed the development of offshore natural resources,"" minister Yuval Steinitz tweeted.
Still, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has described the decision to go ahead with the talks as historic, and said Washington looked forward to separate talks later over disagreements on the land border. 
Wednesday's meeting will be hosted by the United Nations peacekeeping force UNIFIL, which has monitored the land boundary since Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon in 2000, ending a 22-year occupation. 
A Lebanese security source says the two sides will meet in the same room in UNIFIL's base in south Lebanon, but will direct their talks through a mediator. 
LEBANON CRISIS 
Disagreement over the sea border had discouraged oil and gas exploration near the disputed line. 
That may be a minor irritation for Israel, which already pumps gas from huge offshore fields. For Lebanon, yet to find commercial reserves in its own waters, the issue is more pressing. 
Lebanon is desperate for cash from foreign donors as it faces the worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. The financial meltdown has been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic and by an explosion that wrecked a swathe of Beirut in August, killing nearly 200 people.
Struggling to form a new government to tackle the multiple crises, some Lebanese politicians even argued this week over the formation of their negotiating team, with the prime minister's office complaining it was not consulted by the presidency. 
""The Lebanese negotiator will be much fiercer than you can imagine because we have nothing to lose,"" caretaker Foreign Minister Charbel Wehbe said. 
Hezbollah's political ally, the Amal party, has also come under pressure. Last month the United States sanctioned Amal leader Nabih Berri's top aide for corruption and financially enabling Hezbollah, which it deems a terrorist organisation.
David Schenker, the U.S. assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, who landed in Beirut on Tuesday, has said more sanctions remained in play.
For Hezbollah and Amal, the decision to start the border talks is a ""tactical decision to neutralize the tensions and the prospect of sanctions ahead of the U.S. elections,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.
Berri, a Shi'ite leader who led the border file, has denied being pushed into the talks. 

In 2018 Beirut licensed a group of Italy's Eni, France's Total and Russia's Novatek to carry out long-delayed offshore energy exploration in two blocks. One of them contains disputed waters.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Hundreds of Thai protesters scuffled with police and threw blue paint at them on Tuesday and, after 21 of them were arrested, chanted ""release our friends!"" as the royal motorcade of King Maha Vajiralongkorn swept past.
Among those taken away were Jatupat Boonpattararaksa, a protest leader, and Chaiamorn Kaewwiboonpan, a singer. People who were detained would be charged appropriately, police said.
""The protesters may not have observed the law today so police had to act to bring order and didn't act disproportionately,"" government spokesperson Anucha Burapachai told Reuters.
Such open dissent towards the monarchy has no recent precedent in Thailand, and came on the eve of the latest planned anti-government demonstrations.
The protests, which have persisted for three months, present the biggest challenge in years to a political establishment dominated by the army and the palace.
Protesters are calling for a new constitution and the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.
They have also called for curbs on the powers of the monarchy, breaking a longstanding taboo against criticising the royal family which many people still revere.
The Royal Palace has given no response to requests for comment on the protests or demands for royal reform.
In a sign of the monarch's ongoing popularity among many Thais, the king and queen left the palace late on Tuesday, smiling broadly as they greeted thousands of cheering supporters who waited in the rain on the anniversary of his father's death.
Earlier in the day, hours before the royal motorcade was due to pass Bangkok's Democracy Monument, protesters had pushed up against a police line and some threw blue paint.
Police demolished a tent set up for the protest and dragged some demonstrators into police vehicles.
THREE-FINGERED SALUTE
After the trouble, the royal motorcade passed by on the other side of the street. Protesters raised their hands in the three-fingered salute of anti-government campaigners and demanded the release of those detained.
""This is the ugliness of feudalism, where one person can do anything and the majority of the people have to accept it unconditionally,"" Parit ""Penguin"" Chirawat, a student leader, said on Twitter.
The top trending hashtag on the social media platform in Thailand, used more than 1.5 million times, insulted the king.
Insults to the monarchy are punishable by up to 15 years in prison under Thailand's lese majeste laws, but the prime minister said earlier this year that the king requested that they not be used for now.
Protesters have said they do not seek the abolition of the monarchy, but to reduce the king's powers under the constitution and to reverse an order to put the palace fortune and some army units under his control.
""The monarchy has to be under the constitution, that is how it supposed to be,"" said 21-year-old protester Waranya Siripanya.
In the evening, the demonstrators moved to the police station where the detainees were being held, pressing against the gates to demand their release.
Tuesday was a public holiday to mark four years since the death of the king's widely respected father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who reigned for seven decades.
Vajiralongkorn, who spends much of his time in Germany, made a rare visit to Thailand for the occasion.
Thousands of royalists gathered to pay their respects, bearing the late king's picture and flowers and wearing yellow shirts, the colour associated with him.
Many royalists were critical of the protesters.

""They may have been taught and told that the monarchy doesn't have any value to the nation,"" said Narongsak Poomsisa-ard, 67. ""But I want to remind them that our nation exists until today, because we have the strong institution.""

Street protests are frequent in Tunisia, where a popular uprising toppled autocratic rule nearly a decade ago and ushered in democracy but little economic progress, with living standards for many still low, unemployment high and corruption rife.
In the town of Sbeitla, the site of an ancient Roman city in Tunisia's hilly, impoverished interior, residents blocked roads with burning tyres and threw stones at police, who chased, witnesses said. 
Soldiers were then deployed to protect government buildings in Sbeitla.
Local officials and witnesses said a cigarette vendor was sleeping inside his kiosk in Tuesday's pre-dawn hours when municipal police arrived with a bulldozer and flattened the structure, killing him under the rubble.
After the man's death was confirmed by local authorities, Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi dismissed the governor of Kasserine province, where Sbeitla is located, and three local security officials in an effort to defuse local anger. 
The overnight bulldozing of the kiosk inflamed the nearby community where many have long complained about police heavy-handedness in dealing with poor, marginalized people.
Sbeitla is near some of Tunisia's most deprived cities including Sidi Bouzid, where the 2011 revolution began after a street vendor immolated himself in protest at harassment and confiscations of his wares by police.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Tuesday of violating a ceasefire agreed three days ago to quell fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, drawing warnings from international groups of a humanitarian crisis in the region.
The Russia-brokered truce is buckling despite mounting calls from world powers to halt the fighting, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Minsk Group security watchdog among those urging greater commitment to the ceasefire terms.
A Reuters cameraman witnessed shelling in the town of Martuni in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians. 
A Reuters television crew in Terter in Azerbaijan also said the city centre was being shelled earlier on Tuesday.
Azerbaijan accused Armenian forces of ""grossly violating the humanitarian truce"", which was agreed on Saturday to allow the sides to swap prisoners and bodies of those killed..
Defence ministry spokesman Vagif Dargiahly said Armenia was shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy and Aghdam, as well as Terter. Azeri forces were not violating the truce, he added.
Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan denied the accusation. She said Azeri forces had resumed military operations after an overnight lull, ""supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions"".
The fighting which erupted on Sept. 27, is the worst since a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh that killed about 30,000.
It is being closely watched abroad, not only due to its proximity to Azeri energy pipelines to Europe but also because of fears that Russia and Turkey could be drawn in. 
Russia has a defence pact with Armenia and Turkey is allied with Azerbaijan.
""CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES""
The Minsk Group called on the Armenian and Azeri leaders to immediately implement the ceasefire to prevent ""catastrophic consequences for the region"".
The 11-member group includes both Russia and Turkey, but the latter is not involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu suggested holding talks that would include Turkey.
Ceasefire demands were ""reasonable"", according to Cavusoglu, but he said the international community should ask Armenia to withdraw from Azeri territory. 
""Sadly no such call is being made,"" he told reporters.
Influential Turkish politician Devlet Bahceli, whose party supports President Erdogan's AKP in parliament, took a more belligerent note, telling Azerbaijan to secure Nagorno-Karabakh by ""hitting Armenia over the head over and over again"".
While Turkey denies military involvement in Nagorno-Karabakh, Armenian President Armen Sarkissian told Germany's Bild newspaper Ankara's behaviour was worrying. 
""I worry because, firstly, there is a third party involved. If it were only about Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan, I would be much more hopeful that the conflict can be contained,"" he said.
DEAD AND WOUNDED
The death toll has risen further, meanwhile. Nagorno-Karabakh officials said 542 servicemen had been killed so far, up 17 from Monday. 
Azerbaijan has reported 42 Azeri civilian deaths and 206 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed military casualties. 
Martin Schuepp, Eurasia regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said his organisation was in ""continuous discussions"" to facilitate the handover of detainees or bodies of those killed. 
But the security situation meant ""it has not been possible for us to access all locations that might have been affected,"" Schuepp said. 
The conflict is also worsening the spread of COVID-19, World Health Organisation spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a United Nations briefing in Geneva.
Armenia's new cases had doubled over the past 14 days as of Monday, while new infections were up approximately 80% over the past week in Azerbaijan, Jasarevic said. He warned of ""direct disruption to health care and a further burden on health systems that are already stretched during the COVID pandemic.""

With tens of thousands of people potentially needing help in coming months, the ICRC is appealing for another 9.2 million Swiss francs ($10.10 million) to fund its humanitarian efforts in the region, Schuepp said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday slammed Turkey's renewed push to send a vessel to carry out seismic surveys in the eastern Mediterranean, accusing Ankara of unilaterally stoking tensions and ""deliberately"" complicating the resumption of talks with Greece.
""The United States deplores Turkey’s October 11 announcement of renewed Turkish survey activity in areas over which Greece asserts jurisdiction in the Eastern Mediterranean,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement while urging Ankara to cease its survey activities.
""Coercion, threats, intimidation, and military activity will not resolve tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean. We urge Turkey to end this calculated provocation and immediately begin exploratory talks with Greece,"" she said.
Tensions in the eastern Mediterranean have risen over claims and counter claims pitting Turkey against Greece and Cyprus to maritime areas thought to be rich in natural gas. Both Turkey and Greece are NATO allies.
On Monday, Turkish ship Oruc Reis set sail to carry out seismic surveys in the eastern Mediterranean, prompting Greece to issue a furious new demand for European Union sanctions on Ankara in a row over offshore exploration rights. 
France also expressed its concern after Oruc Reis began its voyage. Greece's foreign ministry described the move as a ""major escalation"" and a ""direct threat to peace in the region"". Turkey, meanwhile, accused Athens of fuelling tensions.
The Oruc Reis intends to carry out work south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo, which is close to Turkey's coast.
Last month U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo visited Cyprus and Greece, including the island of Crete in the eastern Mediterranean, as Washington lifted a 33-year embargo on “non lethal defence articles” applied on Cyprus in 1987, deepening its security cooperation with Nicosia. The move prompted an angry response from Turkey at the time.

The move could be a formality but, if the vote fails, it could further deepen the political crisis in a strategically located country which also enjoys close ties with China and hosts a large Canadian-owned gold mining operation.
President Sooronbai Jeenbekov's office gave no details of the talks with Dmitry Kozak, deputy head of Russian President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin administration, but said he had visited Kyrgyzstan on Monday. 
Sadyr Japarov, a nationalist politician who has been named prime minister by parliament but has not yet been confirmed in office by Jeenbekov, also attended the meeting, it said.
Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted last week to name Japarov as prime minister after he was freed from prison by supporters during the unrest, but he cannot take office until Jeenbekov has confirmed his appointment.
In a separate statement, Jeenbekov's office said he had met Japarov one-on-one and told him he would ask parliament to vote again after some parliamentary deputies and activists criticised Saturday's decision as illegal because of proxy voting by some deputies.
The United States embassy to Bishkek on Tuesday also criticised the Saturday vote over ""irregularities"".
""It is clear that one of the obstacles towards democratic process is the attempt by organised crime groups to exert influence over politics and elections,"" it said in a statement, urging Jeenbekov and other players to uphold the rule of law.
Kyrgyzstan hosts a Russian military airbase and has close economic ties with Moscow, which dominated the former Soviet republic of 6.5 million for decades. 
Moscow described the situation in Kyrgyzstan as a mess and chaos after street protests broke out over a parliamentary election on Oct. 4 which handed victory to two establishment parties, one of them closely allied with Jeenbekov.
Jeenbekov has halted the protests and clashes by declaring a state of emergency and deploying troops in the capital, Bishkek. But the government has been toppled and the president said last week he was ready to resign once a new prime minister was named.

Parliament convened late on Tuesday and confirmed Jeenbekov's emergency declaration and elected a new speaker, Kanat Isayev, who could take over in case of the president's resignation. But it was unclear if it planned to hold a repeat vote for prime minister at the same session.

Kenneth Walker was with Taylor, a Black emergency medical technician, when police burst into her home in the early hours of March 13 in Louisville, Kentucky. Walker fired once, at what he said he believed were criminal intruders, wounding one officer.
Three police officers responded with 32 shots, six of which struck Taylor, killing her and fueling national protests about racism and police use of force against Blacks and minorities.
Police said they repeatedly identified themselves while executing a search warrant in relation to a drug investigation focused on Taylor's ex-boyfriend. No drugs were found in her apartment.
""I'm a million percent sure that nobody identified themselves,"" Walker told CBS in an interview to be aired on Wednesday. Excerpts were released on Tuesday.
Walker, who had a license to carry a gun, said he ""didn't have a clue"" who was at the door.
""That's why grabbed the gun,"" he said. 
Officers said they banged on the door and identified themselves for an estimated 30 to 90 seconds. But they also described a confused and chaotic scene with one officer who opened fire mistakenly, fearing his colleagues were being shot at with an AR-15, according to recordings of their interviews with investigators.
A grand jury investigation cleared them of homicide charges, though one officer was indicted for wanton endangerment.
Asked if it ever crossed his mind the police might be knocking, Walker said no, ""because why would the police be coming here?""
Walker said both he and Taylor asked ""several times"" who was knocking and got no response.

""So the next thing I know the door is flying open,"" Walker said.

LASHKAR GAH, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghan security forces launched a counter offensive in the south against Taliban fighters, officials said on Tuesday, as fighting raged for a third straight day in a major insurgent offensive that has overshadowed peace talks.
The Taliban assault on Helmand Province tests the resolve of the government at the start of talks to end the 19-year war, and could complicate President Donald Trump's pre-election pledge last week to bring home the remaining U.S. troops by Christmas.
It is the first big Taliban offensive since talks between the government and the Taliban opened last month, and one of the biggest since the fighters committed to a ceasefire as part of a deal agreed with Washington in February to withdraw U.S. troops.
The United States confirmed on Monday it had launched air strikes against Taliban fighters to push back the Helmand assault. U.S. air strikes have been comparatively rare since February when Washington agreed to pull its troops out to end the longest war in U.S. history.
Since Sunday, insurgents have seized military bases in Helmand and closed in on the provincial capital, Lashkar Gah.
The Helmand governor's media office said on Tuesday Afghan special forces, aided by air strikes from the country's air force, had managed to take back five checkpoints from Taliban control, killing 23 of the group's fighters.
Jets and helicopters continued to circle Lashkar Gah through the night on Monday and on Tuesday, attacking the Taliban's positions. The U.S. military did not immediately say whether its forces or warplanes were involved.
Around 5,100 families have been displaced by the fighting, the head of the refugee and repatriation department, Sayed Mohammad Amin, said, adding that there was an urgent need for food and shelter.
Trump, lagging in the polls ahead of an election in three weeks, has long promised to withdraw U.S. forces from Afghanistan. The Taliban welcomed his tweet last week that the troops should be ""home by Christmas"".
However, the withdrawal agreement requires the fighters to halt attacks on urban areas before U.S. troops leave. In an interview with NPR on Sunday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley stressed that the withdrawal was conditions-based.
""We're monitoring all of those conditions closely. And we're, we the military, are giving our best military advice on those conditions so that the president can make an informed, deliberate, responsible decision."" 
The talks between the government and Taliban in Qatar have moved slowly and are still in early stages. Both sides said on Monday that their contact groups had met.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A second suspect was remanded in custody on Tuesday after being detained by police in Pakistan following the gang rape of a woman that has led to protests across the country.
The woman's rape last month, beside a major road after her car ran out of fuel while she was driving her two children, has also led to new calls for tougher punishment for sexual assaults against women and children across the region.
One suspect was arrested last month. The second was arrested on Monday when he tried to contact his family after a manhunt.
A judge ordered the second suspect be kept in custody when he appeared in an Anti-Terrorism Court in the eastern city of Lahore.
Police will now draw up charges against both the suspects. They could include robbery, rape and terrorism charges that could carry a death sentence.
Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh are considering harsher punishments for sexual offences following public indignation over high=profile cases. 
In February, Pakistani lawmakers considered introducing public hanging of those convicted of the sexual abuse and murder of children. 
Last month, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the proposal had been dropped because it could have meant Pakistan would lose preferential trade status with the European Union. Instead, he said he would propose chemical castration of those convicted in the most brutal rape cases.
Following protests over a series of rape cases, Bangladesh on Tuesday increased the maximum punishment for rape to death. It had been life imprisonment.
""The rapists are beasts as they exhibit their inhumane nature affecting our girls,"" Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said.
Fewer than 3 percent of sexual assault or rape cases result in a conviction in Pakistan, according to the Karachi-based group War Against Rape. 
Statistics across countries were difficult to compare, Heather Barr, Interim Co-director of the Women's Rights Division at Human Rights Watch told Reuters. 
“But we can comfortably say most victims don’t report the crime, and when they do it rarely leads to a conviction,” she said.

She expressed concern that Pakistan, India and Bangladesh were turning to the death penalty for rape cases despite the practice having no proven effect as a deterrent and the risk of convicting innocent individuals.

LONDON (Reuters) - The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) will need to raise$6.8 billion over the next six months to avert famine amid the COVID-19 crisis, the agency said on Tuesday.
The WFP, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last week for its efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict, said it had so far raised $1.6 billion.
""We've got a lot more money to raise to make certain we avert famine,"" David Beasley, executive director of the WFP, said at a conference organised by the U.N's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
Beaseley noted that 7 million people had died from hunger this year as the COVID-19 pandemic, which could double hunger worldwide, claimed a further 1 million lives.
""If we don't sort out COVID, (the) hunger death rate could be 3, 4, 5 times that,"" said Beaseley. 
The Rome-based WFP says it helps some 97 million people in about 88 countries each year, and that one in nine people worldwide still do not have enough to eat.
After declining for several decades, world hunger has been on the rise again since 2016, driven by the twin scourges of conflict and climate change.
""If you think about the wealth on Earth today we shouldn't see one single child (go) hungry or die from starvation,"" said Beaseley.
The WFP has dispatched medical cargoes to over 120 countries during the pandemic, and provided passenger services to ferry humanitarian workers where commercial flights were unavailable.

The agency, the world's largest humanitarian organisation, is funded entirely by donations. It provides school meals to 17.3 million children globally and delivered 4.2 million tonnes of food to regions or countries in need in 2019.

LISBON (Reuters) - For businesses dependent on Portugal's most celebrated place of pilgrimage, Tuesday was supposed to be the busiest day of the year - and then the pandemic intervened.
Every October 13, huge crowds converge on the Fatima shrine to mark the anniversary of the date in 1917 when the third and final vision of the Virgin Mary authenticated by the Catholic Church took place.
But coronavirus-related restrictions meant just 4,500 attended this year's celebration compared to 100,000 in 2019, and the donations on which the sanctuary depends have all but dried up, said its spokeswoman Carmo Rodeira.
""The sanctuary exists to welcome pilgrims ... but the biggest impact is on the way we celebrate faith and this is the biggest challenge that the pandemic has brought to the Church,"" she said.
Meanwhile restaurants stand empty in the religious tourism-dependent town and hotel takings are down by up to 90%, according to official data. 
""The international guests simply disappeared,"" said Alexandre Marto, director of Fatima Hotels, a group of 10 establishments sharing the same booking platform. 
""The situation ... becomes even more difficult because we don't know how long it (the COVID curbs) will last,"" said Purificacao Reis, president of local business association ACISO. 
Around the sanctuary, shopkeepers at most of the dozens of stores selling religious items are all but empty, and even those with customers are struggling.
""The foreigners stopped coming and now it is only the Portuguese, who have little money - just like myself,"" said Ana Maria, 60, while standing outside her tiny but packed shop. 
Unsure how long she will able to stay in business, she prays for better days. 
For some, however, the crisis has created opportunities. 
Ana Paula Reis decided to move her restaurant to a less touristy location, allowing her local customers to enjoy her traditional recipes in greater comfort.
""On tourist streets, ...hotels are closed, shops are closed. It's scary,"" she said. ""The pandemic brought me the chance to grow.""

621,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 13, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Ghislaine Maxwell to urge U.S. appeals court to keep damaging deposition secret,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, will urge a federal appeals court on Tuesday to overturn a ruling she says jeopardizes her ability to defend against criminal charges she enabled Epstein's sexual abuse of girls.
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will review a judge's order to unseal sworn testimony related to Epstein, including a April 2016 deposition from Maxwell and a deposition by an Epstein accuser.
Maxwell, 58, has said negative publicity from the disclosure of ""intimate, sensitive, and personal"" information from her deposition would violate her right against self-incrimination, and imperil a fair trial because jurors might hold it against her.
The British socialite has pleaded not guilty to charges she helped Epstein recruit and groom underage girls as young as 14 years old to engage in illegal sexual acts in the mid-1990s, and not guilty to perjury for having denied involvement under oath.
Maxwell was arrested on July 2 in New Hampshire, where prosecutors said she had been hiding out.
She has been locked up in a Brooklyn jail after U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan, who oversees the criminal case, called her an unacceptable flight risk. Maxwell's trial is scheduled for July 2021.
Epstein, a registered sex offender, killed himself at age 66 in August 2019 at a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. 
Maxwell's request to keep the deposition under wraps is opposed by Virginia Giuffre, who has said Epstein kept her as a ""sex slave"" with Maxwell's help, and that Maxwell could have invoked her right to remain silent while being deposed.
Giuffre is one of Epstein's most visible public accusers, and believes the public has a right to see Maxwell's deposition, which came from Giuffre's civil defamation lawsuit against her.
That case settled in 2017, and U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska ordered the deposition unsealed in July. 
Tuesday's hearing will also address a second Maxwell appeal, from Nathan's refusal to modify a protective order and let her access confidential materials produced by the government.
Maxwell's lawyers hope to use those materials to convince Preska not to unseal the deposition, saying the judge deserved to know ""just how prosecutors obtained the deposition material and who turned it over to them.""

Prosecutors countered that Maxwell has shown no need for the materials, and that her appeal was a ""thinly veiled attempt"" to have the appeals court declare they gathered evidence illegally.

GAZA/REHOVOT, Israel (Reuters) - Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups voiced concern on Tuesday over the condition of a Palestinian who began a hunger strike 79 days ago against his detention without charge by Israel.
Maher Al-Akhras, 49, is now in an Israeli hospital suffering from heart pain and convulsions and has slipped occasionally into a coma, his wife said.
A resident of the city of Jenin in the north of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Akhras was taken into custody in July under an Israeli ""administrative detention"" order.
Israel's Shin Bet internal security agency said Akhras was detained after it received information that he was an operative of the Islamic Jihad militant group, an allegation his wife denied.
He was moved three weeks ago to Kaplan hospital in the Israeli city of Rehovot, where he has been drinking water but refusing solid food, according to his family.
At the hospital, Akhras's wife Taghreed told Reuters that he would continue the hunger strike for his immediate release despite a decision on Monday by Israel's Supreme Court not to extend his four-month detention term beyond Nov. 26.
""The responsibility for what happens next lies with those who can prevent his further deterioration and even death,"" the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem, which is monitoring the case, said in statement. ""They can still stop this from happening.""
Ahkras's wife said her husband, too weak to leave his bed, was not handcuffed in the hospital, and there were no guards visible near his room.
The Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights called on international rights groups to intervene immediately to ""save the life of Akhras before it is too late.""
There are around 5,000 Palestinians in Israeli jails, 350 of them under administrative detention, Palestinian officials said. Israeli officials say detention without trial is sometimes necessary to protect the identities of undercover operatives.

In Gaza, activists linked to Islamic Jihad said they had resumed launching incendiary balloons into Israel. A poster with Akhras's picture and the words ""our patience is running out"" were attached.

YENAGOA, Nigeria (Reuters) - Nigerian protests seeking an end to alleged police brutality were held nationwide on Tuesday, spreading to southern oil city Port Harcourt a day after police opened live fire on protesters in Lagos where an official said two people were killed. 
Protesters have over the last week called for an overhaul of policing to end misconduct. The calls have continued despite President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday vowing ""extensive police reforms"". On Sunday authorities said the Special Anti-Robbery Squad police unit, known as SARS, would be disbanded. 
The unit was the target of demonstrators who accuse it of beating up and killing Nigerians, and extorting money from them. 
Hundreds attended a protest march on Tuesday in the southern oil city of Port Harcourt, defying an order by Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike who said on Twitter that such demonstrations were ""prohibited"". 
The governor's spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment after demonstrators took the streets.
Protests were also staged in parts of Lagos on Tuesday, a day after police in the megacity opened fire with live ammunition against demonstrators. Lagos Police did not comment on whether officers fired live rounds, but said ""unscrupulous elements"" among protesters had killed a bystander and a police officer.
Demonstrations were also held in the capital, Abuja, the southeastern state of Enugu and Oyo state in the southwest. 
Cheta Nwanze of SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based risk advisory firm, said the protest were continuing because people felt the disbanding of SARS was ""cosmetic"" as similar announcements had been made in the past. He said protesters want ""real change"".

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least 12 people were killed in the Metakal zone of Ethiopia’s Benishangul-Gumuz region, regional government spokesman Melese Beyene told Reuters on Tuesday.
The killings, which happened on Monday night, followed two attacks in the same zone last month when 45 people lost their lives, and Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed’s government is faced with rising insecurity in many parts of the country. 
The killings started as revenge following the assassination of the brother of a local official, the spokesman said. 
Victims included women and children as young as six months, and many were slaughtered in their homes, according to a senior member of new political party the National Movement of Amhara (NAMA) and a local survivor who requested anonymity for fear of repercussions.
""I saw a six-month-old girl who had been slaughtered at home and her little body thrown in a field,"" the survivor told Reuters by phone. ""I participated in the funeral of 13 people who were killed."" 
Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen called on people in the Metakal zone to get armed to defend themselves and told the state-run Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation that the security situation in the region was ""heartbreaking"". 
Benishangul-Gumuz is a region bordering Sudan.
The Ethiopian Human Rights Commission said last month that hundreds of civilians were displaced as a result of the violence and asked regional authorities to launch an investigation.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian and Chinese military commanders held ""positive, constructive"" discussions on disengaging troops locked in a months-long standoff at their disputed Himalayan border, the two sides said in a joint statement on Tuesday.
Diplomats and military officials have held several rounds of talks to pull back from the brink after a clash erupted between border troops in June in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.
On Monday, senior commanders held a seventh round of talks at Chushul in the western Himalayas that went on for more than 10 hours, officials said. 
""The two sides had a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of India-China border areas,"" the statement released by the Indian government said.
""They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other’s positions,"" the joint statement said. 
The Line of Actual Control is the de facto border where troops are ranged against each other.
The trouble began early in April when New Delhi says Chinese troops intruded deep into India's side of the LAC in the Ladakh sector which adjoins the Tibetan plateau. 
Beijing claimed the area to be its territory and blamed Indian road construction activity in the area for destabilising the situation.
So far there has been no sign of a troop pullback even though winter is approaching and the area is considered uninhabitable. 
""Both sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels, and arrive at a mutually acceptable solution for disengagement as early as possible,"" the two sides said in the joint statement.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The Chinese government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, on Tuesday urged Asian countries to remain ""vigilant"" over the risk of U.S. strategy stoking geopolitical competition in the South China Sea and other parts of the region. 
Beijing and members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) should work together to remove ""external disruption"" in the South China Sea, Wang said during a joint news conference with Malaysia's foreign minister. 
""We (China and Malaysia) are both of the view that the South China Sea should not be a ground for major power wrestling teeming with warships,"" said Wang, who is on a short Southeast Asian tour. 
""China and ASEAN have full capacity and wisdom, as well as responsibility, to maintain peace and tranquillity in (the) South China Sea."" 
Malaysia's Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said maritime disputes should be resolved peacefully through regional dialogue.
China has in recent months held military exercises in disputed parts of the strategic waterway, while Washington has accused Beijing of attempting to build a ""maritime empire"" in the area. 
Wang described Washington's ""Indo-Pacific"" strategy, which aims to cast the United States as a trustworthy partner in the region, as a ""security risk"" for East Asia. 
""What it pursues is to trumpet the old-fashioned cold war mentality and start up confrontation among different groups and blocks, and stoke geopolitical competition,"" he said. 
""I believe all parties sees this clearly and will stay vigilant against it.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has previously said Washington wants a ""free and open"" Asia not dominated by any one country.
The Philippines' top military commander said the U.S.-China rivalry meant the situation at sea had become ""very tense"". 
General Gilbert Gapay told foreign media in Manila that the United States had stepped up naval patrols and China's coastguard had been very active, while its maritime militia were ""practically swarming most areas"" of the Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone. 

During Tuesday's joint briefing, Malaysia's Hishammuddin said China had committed to purchase 1.7 million tonnes of palm oil until 2023 and pledged to encourage increased shipments of sustainably produced Malaysian palm oil.

""We can repair fins, make an underwater gun, but there are things we can't (obtain) such as fins, suits, goggles and oxygen,"" he said.
He says Gaza has around 250 men who fish with spears and some 4,000 who use boats and nets, among a population of two million.

The first death occurred on Friday in the western province of Izmir, where 18 people have died, and state broadcaster TRT said bootleg alcohol consumption had claimed lives in at least seven other provinces across Turkey.
Police said they had detained 58 people over the last four days for producing and selling bootleg alcohol. Of those detained, seven have been jailed pending trial.
The interior ministry said at the weekend that police suspected some victims of using alcohol-based cleaners to brew homemade drinks.
Turkey's Islamist-rooted ruling AK Party has imposed high taxes on alcohol. The tax on the national favourite raki, an anise-flavored spirit, has leapt by 443% in the past decade and the tax on beer by 365%. A 70 cc bottle of raki costs around 170 lira ($22), taxed 234% over the original price.
The government raised taxes on alcoholic beverages again in July by a further 6.9%. They are expected to account this year for 2.7% of total tax revenues, up from 1.6% a decade ago, finance ministry data showed.
Ozan Bingol, a taxation expert at Baskent University, said excessive alcohol taxes would encourage citizens to consume counterfeit products, causing an increase in the state's health expenses and causing many preventable deaths.
""Contrary to general belief, the state's tax revenues will not increase but decrease,"" Bingol said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Wearing white Islamic garb and waving red and white Indonesian flags, more than 1,000 protesters from Islamic and student groups gathered in the world's most populous Muslim nation on Tuesday to show discontent over a divisive new jobs law.
Conservative Islamic groups are among the latest to join the volatile street demonstrations, during which police fired tear gas on Tuesday to try to break up crowds, as pressure mounts on the government to repeal a law they say undermines labour rights and environmental protections.
The country's largest Islamic organisation, Nahdlatul Ulama, is among its opponents and says it favours conglomerates while ""trampling"" on the rights of working-class Indonesians.
Hamdan, a 53-year-old teacher who goes by one name, said he would keep protesting until the law was repealed.
""People can't go out, some people can't even eat and unemployment is still high,"" he told Reuters in Jakarta. ""Even my son still can't find a job.""
Protests against the so-called omnibus law took place in multiple locations involving thousands of Indonesians last week, some of which saw streets blocked, tyres burned and rocks hurled, leading to more than 6,000 people being detained. 
""The bill will definitely affect myself, my job, my relatives, my friends and everything,"" said engineer Rafi Zakaria, 30.
""It doesn't only affect labourers. Our students here joined the protest because they're concerned about their parents' jobs."" 
The law, designed to reduce red tape and attract investors, has yet to be published and the unofficial versions circulating in the media and online have led to speculation and confusion. 
Deputy house speaker Azis Syamsyuddin told Reuters the law would be sent to the president and made public on Wednesday. 
The government is standing by the legislation and President Joko Widodo has blamed the public outcry on disinformation. Indonesia's defence minister has blamed the demonstrations on ""foreign interference"".
""There are those who do not want to see Indonesia as conducive to investors, and want to always benefit from that,"" the ministry spokesperson, Dahnil Anzar Simanjuntak, said, without elaborating.

The National Anti-Terrorism Committee had reported the incident earlier, saying the militants had been planning to launch unspecified attacks.
The committee was cited by Russian news agencies as saying that police had surrounded the militants, who were holed up in a house in Grozny, and asked them to surrender. The militants opened fire in response, it said. All four militants inside were killed in the ensuing shootout. 
The mainly Muslim region of Chechnya has been dogged by attacks and a simmering insurgency since Moscow fought two wars with separatists there following the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union.
Kadyrov, a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, on Tuesday insisted that Chechnya had dealt with its terrorism threat, but said the four dead militants had been planning a number of attacks. 
""Law enforcement agencies had information in advance that members of an illegal armed group had arrived in the region from abroad,"" Kadyrov wrote on his Telegram channel. 
The Anti-Terrorism Committee says 60 militants have been killed in the wider North Caucasus region since last year and that 19 attacks have been prevented, the RIA news agency reported. 
The two officers killed in action were from Russia's National Guard, Rosgvardiya, RIA said. Another officer, who some Russian news agencies had earlier suggested had been killed, had been wounded and was receiving medical care, it said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian politician who was in a secret relationship with the premier of the country's biggest state economy sought to broker deals and set up government meetings for Chinese businessmen wanting to establish a casino and businesses in the Pacific islands, a corruption inquiry was told on Tuesday.
Daryl Maguire, offered to set up meetings with the Prime Ministers of Papua New Guinea and Samoa for the head of a Shenzhen business association, according to telephone intercepts and messages shown in the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) inquiry.
The former chairman of the New South Wales (NSW) state Parliament Asia Pacific Friendship Group travelled to Samoa, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea to pursue Chinese business deals in 2017, the inquiry heard.
He also hosted meetings with Pacific Island consuls at the NSW Parliament that were attended by Chinese businessmen.
On Monday, the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian revealed to the inquiry she had been in a secret personal relationship with Maguire since 2015, prompting calls from the Opposition Labor party for her to resign.
Berejiklian told the media the relationship was a mistake and she wouldn't resign ""because I haven't done anything wrong"".
Maguire was forced to resign from parliament in August 2018, after an earlier corruption inquiry heard evidence he sought to broker Sydney property deals for Chinese companies.
When news of Maguire's involvement in the 2018 corruption inquiry was made public, his business associate Maggie Wang was called in China by a mutual friend, Du Wei, and told to delete phone messages and emails from Maguire, Wang told the inquiry.
Du Wei was Chinese vice consul in Sydney from 2002 to 2005.
He is a Chinese diplomat who lives in Beijing and had been a family friend for 30 years, Wang told the inquiry.
The Chinese foreign ministry has been approached for comment.
Maguire had rung Du Wei in China to request she delete the messages, Wang said. ""I just comply with what he said.""
The latest inquiry is investigating whether Maguire sought to monetise his position as a politician in breach of rules.
Email evidence to the inquiry shows Maguire first approached Wang, an Australian citizen, to work with him on business deals between Australia and China on September 7, 2012, at the suggestion of Du Wei.
A resume seen by Reuters shows Du Wei previously worked at the Chinese embassy in Washington in 1994 ""lobbying the U.S. Congress for China's Most Favoured Nation"" trade status.
He later worked for the foreign ministry in Beijing ""overlooking U.S. congressional affairs"", according to a resume submitted to the Australia-China Chamber of Commerce in 2004.
Wang told the inquiry she and Maguire planned to share profits from business deals, including an immigration scheme in which cash was offered to Australian businesses to falsify the employment of Chinese nationals seeking visas.
Other email evidence showed a consultancy business in which Maguire was a silent director listed Du Wei as its representative in Beijing.
Wang told the inquiry she had previously given false evidence, and asked other witnesses not to tell ICAC about cash payments involved in the visa scheme.
Asked why she had decided to tell the truth, Wang replied: ""I can't keep going any more. Its too hard.""
Maguire will give evidence on Wednesday.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on Tuesday met the country's king and said he submitted documents proving his ""strong and convincing"" parliamentary support to form government and that Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin should resign. 
Anwar said he had the support of over 120 lawmakers in the 222-strong parliament, disclosing his numbers for the first time since his announcement last month he had secured a majority from federal lawmakers to form a new government.
Anwar said it was now up to King Al-Sultan Abdullah to decide on the next step, but added Muhyiddin had lost his majority and should resign.
""I urge all parties to give space to the king to carry out his responsibilities under the constitution, and to go through the documents and call party leaders to confirm and receive their input and views,"" Anwar told reporters.
The king plays a largely ceremonial role but he can appoint a prime minister who in his view is likely to command a majority. The king could also dissolve parliament and trigger elections on the prime minister's advice. 
In March, the king appointed Muhyiddin as the prime minister after the unexpected resignation of Mahathir Mohamad, saying he believed Muhyiddin commanded majority support in parliament. 
The power struggle comes as Malaysia, already grappling with an economy battered by the novel coronavirus, faces a renewed surge in infections.
Should Anwar succeed in securing the post, it would be the culmination of a 22-year long quest, which included nearly 10 years in jail on charges he denied. It would also mean Malaysia would have its third prime minister this year. 
But scepticism over Anwar's challenge remains as no major party has offered a clear declaration of support. One party, which is a member of the ruling coalition, has said some of its lawmakers supported Anwar. 
""Should the meeting fail to translate into an actionable outcome, his credibility will be affected and this may push the opposition bloc to find another PM candidate,"" said Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, senior associate at political consultancy Vriens & Partners.
Muhyiddin, whose seven-month-old administration has survived on a razor-thin parliamentary majority, had earlier dismissed Anwar's claims as a ""mere allegation"" and told him to prove his majority through a constitutional process.
Leaders in Muhyiddin's Perikatan Nasional coalition issued a statement on Monday declaring full support for Muhyiddin.

The office will serve to support Cambodian police in efforts to arrest American fugitives and to fight terrorism, police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun said on Tuesday. 
""Before, we cooperated on a case-by-case basis and now we are having an office to work with the objective to work fast,"" Chhay Kim Khoeun told Reuters. 
Chhay Kim Khoeun said he did not know about the timeframe for when the office would be established. 
In an email statement to Reuters, the U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh declined to comment on the FBI office but said the two institutions had an established relationship. 
""A joint FBI-Cambodian National Police task force established to fight crimes against children, money laundering, and financial crime is now operational. Our law enforcement cooperation makes both our countries safer,"" it said.
An agreement was made last year to create the task force, which would also address organised crime, money laundering and locate international fugitives, the embassy said. 
Ties with the United States have been frosty in recent years, with Cambodia's government angered by Washington's criticism of the dissolution of the main opposition party and arrest of rival politicians and activists.
Last week, the Pentagon expressed concern about the razing of a U.S.-funded Cambodian navy tactical headquarters, which Prime Minister Hun Sen said was for renovations.
Cambodia has repeatedly denied reports there was a secret deal with China, its biggest economic and diplomatic ally, to place forces at the base.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House is moving forward with three sales of advanced weaponry to Taiwan, sending in recent days a notification of the deals to Congress for approval, five sources familiar with the situation said on Monday.
The move in the run-up to the Nov. 3 U.S. election, first reported by Reuters, is likely to anger China, which considers Taiwan a wayward province that it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. 
Reuters broke the news in September that as many as seven major weapons systems were making their way through the U.S. export process as the Trump administration ramps up pressure on China.
Asked for a response to Monday's news, the Chinese embassy urged Washington in an emailed statement to stop arms sales to and military ties with Taiwan, ""lest it should gravely harm China-US relations and cross-Strait peace and stability.""
In the emailed statement, an embassy representative said: ""China consistently and firmly opposes US arms sales to Taiwan and has firm resolve in upholding its sovereignty and security.""
Leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees were notified that three of the planned weapons sales had been approved by the U.S. State Department which oversees Foreign Military Sales, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The informal notifications were for a truck-based rocket launcher made by  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), long-range air-to-ground missiles made by Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co called SLAM-ER, and external sensor pods for F-16 jets that allow the real-time transmission of imagery and data from the aircraft back to ground stations.
Notifications for the sale of other weapons systems, including large, sophisticated aerial drones, land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles and underwater mines, to deter amphibious landings, have yet to reach Capitol Hill, but these were expected soon, the sources said.
A State Department spokesman said: ""As a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.""
CONGRESSIONAL BACKING FOR TAIWAN
The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations and House of Representatives Foreign Affairs committees have the right to review, and block, weapons sales under an informal review process before the State Department sends its formal notification to the legislative branch.
Lawmakers, who are generally wary of what they perceive as Chinese aggression and supportive of Taiwan, were not expected to object to the Taiwan sales. 
Taiwan's representative office in Washington said it had no comment. Taiwan's Defense Ministry declined to comment.
News that new arms sales were moving forward came after senior U.S. officials last week repeated calls for Taiwan to spend more on its own defense and to carry out military reforms to make clear to China the risks of attempting to invade.
It comes at a time when China has significantly stepped up military activity near Taiwan and as U.S.-China relations have plunged to the lowest point in decades as the U.S. election nears. President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, have both sought to appear tough in their approach to Beijing.
Speaking on Wednesday, the U.S. national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, warned against any attempt to retake Taiwan by force, saying amphibious landings were notoriously difficult and there was a lot of ambiguity about how the United States would respond. 
The United States is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but it has not made clear whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack, something that would likely lead to a much broader conflict with Beijing.

O'Brien said Taiwan needed to invest in capabilities including more coastal defense cruise missiles, naval mines, fast-attack craft, mobile artillery and advanced surveillance assets.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appeared to shed tears at the weekend as he thanked citizens for their sacrifices, in the most striking demonstration yet of how he is relying on his ""man of the people"" persona to tackle his country's deepening crises.
Though the young leader has consolidated his rule over the isolated nation with ruthless purges, North Korea watchers say he has also sought to portray himself as a more traditional political leader than his eccentric father, Kim Jong Il.
Speaking at a military parade on Saturday, Kim became emotional as he paid tribute to troops for their response to national disasters and preventing a coronavirus outbreak and apologised to citizens for failing to raise living standards.
""Kim's modesty and candour, and his tears and choking, were all highly unusual, even for someone who publicly acknowledges shortcomings and has an established pattern of being expressive,"" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an independent researcher and former open-source North Korea analyst for the U.S. government.
The speech, which was clearly carefully designed to resonate with the domestic audience, likely cemented Kim's image as a competent, charismatic leader who also has a human side to him, she said.
'I AM SORRY'
Kim - who broke into wide smiles when huge new ballistic missiles were displayed in the parade - blamed North Korea's continuing economic hardships on international sanctions, the coronavirus crisis and a series of damaging typhoons and floods.
Since succeeding his father in 2011, Kim has made economic progress a cornerstone of his agenda. He also met with U.S. President Donald Trump, forming an unprecedented personal relationship that included flowery letters.
But ambitious plans for international trade, construction projects, and other economic measures have stalled in the face of sanctions imposed over his nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.
The economy took a further hit when North Korea closed its borders to nearly all traffic due to the pandemic, and summer typhoons caused flooding that further threatened food supplies.
""Our people have placed trust, as high as sky and as deep as sea, on me, but I have failed to always live up to it satisfactorily,"" Kim said, at one point appearing to choke up. ""I am really sorry for that.""
Kim said the country's success in preventing a coronavirus outbreak and overcoming other challenges was a ""great victory achieved"" by the citizens.
""Our people have always been grateful to our Party, but it is none other than themselves who surely deserve a bow of gratitude,"" he said.
So much focus on citizens was a major departure for such events, where speeches are usually filled with more ideological themes and lauding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, said Lee.
""The speech was clearly intended to be for and about the people,"" she said.
PERSONAL APPROACH
In contrast to his remote father, Kim has taken his wife to political summits with foreign leaders, often stoops to hug children and mingles with workers at public appearances.
Some of this folksy approach has shaped his public response to the country's economic challenges, said Benjamin Katzeff Silberstein, a North Korean economy expert at the U.S-based Stimson Center think-tank.
""Kim has been more personally present and visible at disaster reconstruction sites and the like, and he's prioritised a lot of the symbolic construction projects designed to show economic progress,"" he said.
But despite some early moves towards embracing markets, Kim is not an out-an-out reformer and his policy prescriptions have tended to draw on the North Korea playbook honed by his father and grandfather, state founder Kim Il Sung, Silberstein said.
The United Nations says that, under Kim, North Korea has continued to quash basic freedoms, maintaining political prison camps and strict surveillance of its citizens. Kim had his uncle executed, according to state media, and the United States accused his government of using the chemical warfare agent VX assassinate his half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, in 2017, an allegation Pyongyang has denied.
Last week Kim called on his country to embark on an 80-day ""speed battle"" - a campaign to attain economic goals before a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan.
Such campaigns, which involve citizens performing ""voluntary"" extra labour, have been described by some residents as ""one of the most exhausting, irritating parts of everyday life"", Silberstein said.

""Kim's essentially left with tears, apologies, speed battles and squeezing out funds wherever they can be found,"" he said.

The detentions were the latest in a four-year-old crackdown targeting the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen. He denies involvement in the July 2016 putsch, in which some 250 people were killed.
Authorities launched an operation from the coastal province of Izmir in search of 110 suspects, including 16 pilots, colonels, and lieutenant colonels, across 26 provinces, broadcaster TRT Haber said. It said 89 suspects had been detained.
In a separate operation targeting Gulen's followers, police sought 57 other suspects across 15 provinces, the state-owned Anadolu news agency said, adding that 32 people had been detained.
Police spokesmen were not immediately available for comment.
Since the abortive putsch, some 80,000 people have been held pending trial and about 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended. More than 20,000 people had been expelled from the Turkish military.
Rights groups and Turkey's Western allies have criticised the scale of the crackdown, saying the government was using it as a pretext to quash dissent. 

The government has denied the accusation, saying the measures are necessary for national security.

Ties between the two Asian neighbours soured after South Korea's Supreme Court in 2018 ordered a Japanese steelmaker to pay compensation for forced labour, which prompted Japan to impose export curbs on some key high-tech materials.
South Korea is set to host the trilateral summit, held roughly once a year, but Kyodo news agency quoted diplomatic sources as saying it would be ""impossible"" for new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to visit unless Japan's concerns over the issue were addressed.
This view had been conveyed to South Korea, Kyodo said.
Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi did confirm or deny the report but pointed out that the meeting itself had not been scheduled.
""When it comes to the Japan-China-South Korea summit, nothing has been decided at the moment including concrete dates,"" Motegi said, when asked about the report at a regular news conference. 
The South Korean Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that Nippon Steel Corp should pay compensation to four South Koreans for forced labour during World War Two, and a lower court in 2019 approved the seizure of part of the assets of the company.
Nippon Steel filed an appeal against the ruling in August. 
Japan argues the ruling violates international law because all claims for compensation rising from Japan's 1910-1945 colonisation of the Korean peninsula were settled under a 1965 treaty. 
Suga, who took office last month, called for both countries to repair their frayed ties in his first conversation with South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

But Suga also later said Japan would ""continue to firmly seek appropriate action from South Korea"". He did not elaborate.

646,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>",EU Leaders to Discuss Contingency Plan for Failure of U.K. Talks,"(Bloomberg) -- European Union leaders will discuss preparations for the potential collapse of trade talks with the U.K. when they hold a summit later this week after France dug in, questioning whether it could hold Boris Johnson’s government to any agreement.
The bloc’s 27 national leaders will assemble in Brussels on Thursday -- the same day the prime minister has threatened to walk away if he considers a deal to be unlikely. With an accord hanging in the balance, the chiefs will review their contingency plans, according to officials in Brussels.
They will also consider the need for stringent, legally binding dispute-resolution mechanisms in any deal after being stung by the U.K.’s announcement last month that it would unilaterally rewrite parts of the Brexit divorce agreement. The move has stoked distrust of Johnson in EU capitals, adding a further obstacle to any accord.
“We do want to trust the U.K., but what we have seen in the last weeks regarding the Withdrawal Agreement is extremely worrying,” French European Affairs Minister Clement Beaune told reporters on Monday. “It’s a matter of how the U.K. is a partner of trust in the years to come.”
With talks continuing in the Belgian capital this week, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will on Tuesday update all 27 European affairs ministers on the state of the deliberations. While the U.K. is pushing the bloc to soften its demands on fishing, the EU is demanding concessions from Britain, including limits on what state aid it will be allowed to provide to businesses.
Negotiating Tactic?
The discussions about contingency planning are, to a certain extent, a negotiating tactic to lower expectations and put pressure on both sides to reach an accord, a senior EU diplomat with knowledge of the talks said. However, he added that governments are now getting nervous about the possibility of failure, and want the European Commission to bring forward contingency measures soon.
Britain’s chief negotiator, David Frost, said last week his team would still need to go on negotiating with the EU even if they fail to reach a free-trade agreement. Speaking to a committee of lawmakers in London, he said the two sides would have to come to arrangements in areas including flights and road haulage.
But the EU is unlikely to agree to a series of such sector-by-sector mini-deals, an EU official said. If talks collapse, the bloc would focus on striking agreements with the U.K. only where it sees an urgent need and where failing to do so would damage its economy.
Johnson held talks with French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel over the weekend in an attempt to break the deadlock. A spokesman for the prime minister said on Monday that time is short, but the government is committed to working hard to bridge its differences with the bloc this week.
No Concessions
France, though, hasn’t yet signaled it is prepared to offer any concessions over fisheries that would unlock a deal, and has so far rebuffed attempts by Barnier and other EU countries to make compromises, a second EU official said.
Fish is “a big priority,” Beaune said. “It’s important for the U.K., and we do respect it. But the U.K. should respect and understand it is crucial for France and for all the EU,” he added. “We will defend our interests.”
France wants EU boats to enjoy the same access to British waters they have under the bloc’s Common Fisheries Policy. But the U.K. wants to use a different method of calculating quotas that would leave its fleet with a far greater share of catches. It also wants to make access to its waters subject to annual negotiations.

While being held at the Irwin center in Georgia, one Mexican woman was reportedly subject to gynecological surgery without her approval and without receiving post-operative care, the ministry said in a weekend statement.
The ministry said its findings were based on actions taken by consular staff and interviews Mexican officials conducted at the center.
Officials were also verifying the case of a second woman who may have been subject to surgical intervention ""without her full consent,"" without receiving an explanation in Spanish of the procedure, or her medical diagnosis, it added.
It did not name the women. The ministry last month said it had identified a woman possibly subjected to surgery in the center, but did not specify whether she had given her consent. 
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) agency did not respond to a request for comment.
The ministry also said it is in touch with a lawyer about a possible class action lawsuit by Mexican women who have been detained at the facility.
In September, a complaint by a whistleblower nurse alleged medical abuse within the Georgia detention center, including unauthorized hysterectomies, a surgery to remove the uterus.
Reuters could not independently confirm those claims. In its statement, the Mexican foreign ministry said the first woman it referred to was not subject to a hysterectomy. It gave no further details on the second.
ICE Health Service Corps said in September that since 2018 only two people at the center were referred for hysterectomies, based on approved recommendations by specialists.

The contractor that runs the facility has said it strongly refutes the allegations and any implications of misconduct.

648,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",Taiwan says new China spy accusation is fake news,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has labelled new spying accusations by China as fake news after Chinese state television aired a programme showing a Taiwanese academic arrested in China on national security grounds at a time of heightened Taipei-Beijing tensions.
China claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, and has in recent weeks stepped up military activity near the island, including flying fighter jets over the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait.
Late Monday, for the second night in a row, Chinese state television showed a Taiwanese person they said had confessed to spying, an academic called Cheng Yu-chin who had previously taught in the Czech Republic.
The report said Cheng had formerly worked as an assistant to Cho Jung-tai, once chairman of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), and showed Cheng on camera admitting that he knew his actions were ""harmful"" to China.
Cheng was arrested in China in April of last year, the report added.
However both Cho and the DPP said Cheng had never worked for him. Cho, in a statement on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, said he didn't even know Cheng.
""This news is obviously wrong reporting,"" Cho added.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a separate statement that neither they nor the Straits Exchange Foundation, a semi-official body that handles some relations with China, had been approached by any family members to request help.
The council condemned China for putting Cheng on television to make a confession, and said China was playing politics by trying to frame people for spying.
It was not possible to reach Cheng for comment or determine whether he has been allowed to engage legal representation.
Rights groups and Western governments have expressed anger at China for previous instances where suspects have been put on state television to confess before their trials. 
Late Sunday, Chinese state television aired another supposed confession by what they said was a Taiwanese spy who had gone to Hong Kong to support anti-government protesters and secretly filmed Chinese security forces across the border.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 09:01PM ET</span>",Keeping the faith: Thousands pray in Portugal's main Catholic site for end to pandemic,"FATIMA, Portugal (Reuters) - Standing in circles marked to keep social distance, thousands of faithful gathered and held candles at one of Catholicism's most famous sanctuaries in Portugal on Monday evening, with many praying for the end of the coronavirus pandemic.
Every October, around 100,000 people head to the Fatima Sanctuary - many of them by foot - to mark the third and last reported vision of the Virgin Mary more than 100 years ago. But, this year, only 6,000 people were allowed in the massive outdoor venue because of coronavirus restrictions.      
Many of the faithful, all wearing masks, took the opportunity to pray for those affected by the outbreak.
""We need living in community - the pandemic ruined this,"" said Francisco Simoes, who walked more than 120 kilometres (74.56 miles) to the Catholic event. ""We ask our Virgin Mary to free us from this damn pandemic and to help those who are sick, who have suffered and lost loved ones.""    
The Catholic Church teaches the Virgin Mary appeared to three Portuguese children in 1917 in Fatima, which was then an impoverished farming village. It believes the Virgin Mary gave the children three messages, the so-called secrets of Fatima.
Pope Francis made two of the shepherd children saints in 2017. 
Among the crowd, 60-year-old Antonio Manuel stood next to a small statue of the Virgin Mary he carried all the way from Valongo, a town in the Portugal's northern region, around 200 kilometres north of Fatima . 
""This year I pray for doctors, nurses, security forces, for  journalists, who are also fighting,"" Manuel said. ""And I ask for all who work against the coronavirus.""
Though Portugal only has 87,913 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,094 deaths, the pandemic is set to leave long lasting scars on the country's tourism-dependent economy, including in places like Fatima, where businesses are highly dependent on foreign visitors to survive. 

""It is a very difficult period for everyone,"" said Jose Fernando as he waited for the mass to kick off.

650,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>","Roberta McCain, mother of late 'maverick' Senator John McCain, dies at 108","By Bill Trott
(Reuters) - Roberta McCain, whose irrepressible spirit and energy helped shape the maverick tendencies of her older son, the late U.S. Senator John McCain, died on Monday at the age of 108, her daughter-in-law said.
""It is with great sadness that I announce the death of my wonderful Mother In-law, Roberta McCain,"" Cindy McCain wrote on Twitter. ""I couldn’t have asked for a better role model or a better friend. She joins her husband Jack, her son John and daughter Sandy.""
She did not provide further details on the circumstances of her mother-in-law's death.
McCain, who lived in Washington, was cherished by her late son, who represented Arizona as a Republican U.S. representative and senator for 35 years. She called him ""Johnny"" until his death from cancer at age 81 on Aug. 25, 2018.
Roberta McCain's vibrance, charm and penchant for speaking her mind made her a popular attraction during her son's unsuccessful 2008 campaign for the presidency.
""I want to correct you when you start telling all those big lies,"" she told him during a joint interview.
McCain had taken his mother on the trail as a living response to those who thought that at age 71 he was too old to be president. She was 95 at the time, proving that longevity was a family trait, he said.
McCain also liked telling the story about his mother being turned down for a car by a rental agency on a trip to France because she was 93. Her solution was to buy a car and tour France as she had intended. Afterward, she had the car shipped to the U.S. East Coast and drove it across the country.
She also was known for getting speeding tickets, including one for driving 112 miles per hour (180 kph) on a straightaway in Arizona. 
Her son, John III, had a distinguished Navy career like her husband, John McCain Jr.; and father-in-law, John McCain Sr., with the two elder Johns reaching the rank of admiral.
Roberta Wright and her identical twin, Rowena, were born Feb. 7, 1912, in Muskogee, Oklahoma, the daughters of a wealthy oilman, who taught them to love travel by taking them and their three siblings to sites of interest throughout the United States.
Roberta later would take her own three children on similar long educational road trips, as well as regularly touring the world with Rowena while they continued a gin rummy game that reportedly lasted for decades.
ELOPING WITH THE ENSIGN
Roberta had been a student at the University of Southern California when she met John McCain Jr., then an ensign stationed nearby. Her family did not approve of their relationship, so they eloped to Tijuana, Mexico, in 1933. 
As John Jr., who commanded submarines during World War Two, rose in rank, the Navy sent them around the world, including postings in London, Honolulu, Connecticut, Washington and Panama, where their son John was born.
McCain and her husband were preparing to attend a dinner party in London in 1967 when they got a phone call saying John III's fighter jet had been shot down in North Vietnam. It was assumed he had been killed, but the couple decided to go to the dinner and say nothing.
A few days later, they learned their son had survived but been captured.
""Can you believe that's the best news I ever heard in my life?"" Roberta said in a 2008 interview with C-SPAN.
John III was beaten and tortured by the North Vietnamese during his 5-1/2 years as a prisoner of war.
""From both my parents I learned to persevere,"" McCain wrote in his 1999 book ""Faith of My Fathers."" ""But my mother's extraordinary resilience made her the stronger of the two."" 
During his years in Congress, John McCain developed a reputation as a maverick who did not always follow Republican gospel and was willing to work across the aisle with his Democratic colleagues. 
""I've inherited modest measures of her qualities, sufficient to give me the energy for a busy life and the enthusiasm for it. I'm the son and grandson of admirals,"" he wrote in ""The Restless Wave,"" which was published a few months before his death. ""But I am my mother's son. I always have been. Thank you, mother, thank you."" 
Motherhood was a role to which Roberta McCain clung. After reading an excerpt of his book in which he used a string of profanities on his Vietnamese captors, she told her son she was going to wash his mouth out with soap.
""He better never speak like that again or I'll smack him bald-headed,"" she told Time magazine. ""Of course, he almost already is.""
The Washington Post reported that McCain flew a Taiwanese flag outside her Washington apartment, which was located near the Chinese Embassy, on the 50th anniversary of the Communist Party's takeover in China.

McCain was survived by her son Joseph. Her husband died in 1981 after 48 years of marriage, and her daughter, Jean Alexandra ""Sandy"" McCain Morgan, died in 2019.

PARIS (Reuters) - The number of people being treated in French intensive care units for COVID-19 exceeded 1,500 on Monday for the first time since May 27, authorities said, raising fears of local lockdowns being imposed across the country.
The new figure of 1,539 is still almost five times lower than an April 8 high of 7,148 but also four times higher than a July 31 low of 371.
And as there are normally more people hospitalised with varios illnesses in the autumn than in the spring, health experts fear the hospital system will be quickly overwhelmed if nothing is done to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
Earlier, Prime Minister Jean Castex said France was facing a ""strong"" second wave of COVID-19 infections and that he could not rule out local lockdowns.
President Emmanuel Macron is due to speak about the public health situation in television interviews on Wednesday evening.
There were 8,505 new COVID-19 infections over the past 24 hours in France, data showed, sharply down from Saturday's record of 26,896 and Sunday's 16,101.

But the Monday figure tends to dip as fewer tests are conducted on Sundays. The seven-day moving average of new infections, which averages out weekly data reporting irregularities, stood at 17,029, above the 17,000 level for the first time since the start of the pandemic in March.
The cumulative number of cases now totals 743,479.
The number of people in France who have died from COVID-19 infections rose by 95 to 32,825, versus 46 on Sunday and a seven-day moving average of 75.

Jesse Takayama's entry into the ruins came thanks to a special request he submitted while stranded since mid-March in the town of Aguas Calientes, on the slopes of the mountains near the site, said Minister of Culture Alejandro Neyra on Monday.
""He had come to Peru with the dream of being able to enter,"" Neyra said in a virtual press conference. ""The Japanese citizen has entered together with our head of the park so that he can do this before returning to his country.""
Takayama, his entry ticket on hand since March, entered the ruins of the citadel built more than 500 years ago on Saturday, and became the first visitor in seven months to be able to walk through the world heritage site. His original plan had been to spend only a few days in Peru to take in Machu Picchu.
""This is so amazing! Thank you!"" said Takayama in a video recorded on the top of Machu Picchu mountain.
Minister Neyra said that in November the stone ruins of Machu Picchu will be reopened for national and foreign tourists, without specifying the date. The site will permit 30% of its normal capacity of 675 people per day.
""We are still in the middle of a pandemic,"" Neyra said. ""It will be done with all the necessary care.""

Oliver Ivanovic was gunned down in front of his party office in the ethnically divided town of Mitrovica, a predominantly Serb area of mainly ethnic Albanian Kosovo.
Among those braving cold weather to light candles at St Marko church was Dragan Djilas, head of Serbia's opposition centre-left Party of Freedom and Justice (SSP).
Djilas said Ivanovic had been ready ""to fight for Serbia's interests but also to communicate with Kosovo Albanians"". 
""It is a disgrace that authorities in Kosovo and authorities in Serbia and the international community know nothing concrete 1,000 days after that politically-motivated murder,"" Djilas told Reuters.
After a lengthy investigation, Kosovo authorities have indicted six people in connection with Ivanovic's killing, but Kosovo's Appellate Court ordered a retrial.
More than a decade since Kosovo proclaimed independence, around 40,000 Serbs in northern Kosovo refuse to recognise Pristina institutions and see Belgrade as their capital. 
Normalisation of tense ties with Kosovo, which declared independence from Serbia in 2008, is a key condition for Serbia's entry into the European Union. 

Last month, Belgrade and Pristina agreed to take steps towards economic cooperation in agreements signed at the White House.

""Fascists,"" the protesters chanted in a tense standoff with security forces personnel wearing balaclavas who responded with flare guns and an unidentified spray, according to video clips circulating on social media.
The sound of a blast could be heard as plumes of grey smoke filled the air at the scene. There were no immediate reports of injuries or arrests.
A spokesman for the Interior Ministry later confirmed that police had used flare guns and tear gas to disperse an unauthorised rally.
""The protests, which have shifted largely to Minsk, have become organised and extremely radical,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
""In this regard, the Interior Ministry's employees and internal troops will not leave the streets and, if necessary, will use special equipment and military weapons,"" it said.
Tens of thousands of Belarusians have demonstrated every weekend since the election, in which Lukashenko was declared the winner. His opponents say the vote was rigged, a charge denied by Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years and has now turned to Russia for financial and other support to keep power.
Monday's clashes occurred after thousands of people took part in a ""march of pensioners"" in the capital Minsk. The protesters chanted ""Go away"" and waved white flags with a red stripe, a symbol of the Belarusian opposition.
On Sunday, when 713 people were detained for taking part in mass protests, security forces used water cannon and batons to break up crowds demanding a new presidential election.
European Union foreign ministers agreed on Monday to sanction Lukashenko and other senior officials over what they said was a rigged election and worsening police violence against protesters. 
Lukashenko was not on an earlier EU sanctions list agreed on Oct. 2 that targeted 40 names, but the bloc now says his refusal to consider new elections as a way out of the crisis leaves it with no choice.

The removed statue of the 15th century Italian navigator, along with four Catholic friars, towered over one of the Mexico City's main traffic circles for decades.
Authorities said it was taken away for restoration work on Saturday but added that it was also time for reflection about Columbus's legacy, triggering speculation in Mexican media that the statue may not be returned. 
Several statues of the explorer, whose Spanish-funded expeditions opened the door to the European conquest of the Americas, have been removed in U.S. cities in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests and the resulting global re-examination of colonization and slavery. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the capital's Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum both suggested the measures were taken in part to avoid the statues being vandalized or removed by protesters.
""It is best to resolve these differences peacefully, not retaliate against statues or sculptures,"" said Lopez Obrador. 
Mexico does not celebrate Oct. 12 as Columbus Day, and it is not a national holiday. Instead, the day is used to celebrate Mexico's indigenous cultures and mixed race, or mestizo, population, often marked by large protest marches. 
Protesters have called for more attention to the genocide and centuries of colonial oppression that followed Columbus' voyages.
Lopez Obrador has insisted that the Spanish monarchy and Catholic Church should formally apologize for the atrocities committed during the 16th century European invasion of Mexico. 
Sheinbaum encouraged all to peacefully reflect on the legacy of Columbus, adding that she would not make any unilateral decision on whether the statue would return to its pedestal, according to daily newspaper El Universal.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces accused each other on Monday of launching new attacks in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, increasing strains on a two-day-old humanitarian ceasefire intended to end heavy fighting over the mountain enclave.
Russia, which brokered the ceasefire, appealed for both sides to respect it and Luxembourg reiterated European Union calls for Turkey, an ally of Azerbaijan, to do more to secure an end to hostilities that have killed hundreds of people.
The fighting, the deadliest over Nagorno-Karabakh in over 25 years, is being watched closely abroad partly because of its proximity to Azeri gas and oil pipelines and the risk of regional powers Turkey and Russia being dragged in. https://tmsnrt.rs/2SLS5ID
Both Ankara and Moscow are under growing pressure to use their influence in the region to end the fighting.
The ceasefire is meant to allow ethnic Armenian forces and Azerbaijan to swap prisoners and bodies of people killed in two weeks of fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians.
But the ceasefire has frayed quickly. Azerbaijan said on Sunday it had launched air strikes against an Armenian regiment, following what it said was an Armenian rocket attack on an apartment building in the country's second biggest city of Ganja. Armenia denied carrying out such an attack. 
On Monday, Azerbaijan's defence ministry said Armenian forces had tried to attack its positions around the Aghdere-Aghdam and Fizuli-Jabrail regions, and were shelling territories in the Goranboy and Terter regions inside Azerbaijan. 
Nagorno-Karabakh said its forces had inflicted losses on Azeri forces and that large-scale military operations were continuing in the Hadrut area of the enclave.
Reuters could not independently verify the reports.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, was monitoring the events and asked Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces to respect the ceasefire. 
Turkey said in a statement its defence minister, Hulusi Akar, had told Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu by telephone that Armenian forces must be removed from Azeri territory.
Turkey supports Azerbaijan's offensive to ""retake its occupied lands"", the statement said, adding that Baku ""would not wait another 30 years"" for a solution.

APPEALS TO TURKEY
Zohrab Mnatsakanyan, Armenia's foreign minister, met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. He accused Azerbaijan of acting to expand Turkey's influence in the region and of using pro-Turkish mercenaries - charges both Ankara and Baku deny.
Accusing Azerbaijan of ceasefire violations, Mnatsakanyan said: ""We want the ceasefire, we want verification mechanisms on the ground, which will indicate the perpetrator, which will demonstrate the party that is not faithful to this ceasefire."" 
Speaking before a meeting of EU foreign ministers, Luxembourg's foreign minister, Jean Asselborn, urged Turkey to do more to end the latest flare-up of the decades-old conflict. 
""Turkey has not called for a truce yet, and I believe they are completely wrong with this position,"" Asselborn said. 
""I think the message from Luxembourg will be a call on Turkey, a NATO member, to help arrange a ceasefire quickly.""
While mediation has for years been led by France, Russia and the United States, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev repeated calls for Turkey to be involved.
""Even if many Western countries do not want to accept it, Turkey's word is big, it's fully independent,"" he said.
But Russia's Lavrov said there was no plan to change the talks format to include Turkey. 
The fighting is the worst since a 1994 ceasefire ended a war over Nagorno-Karabakh that killed at least 30,000. https://tmsnrt.rs/30GEXJd
Azerbaijan said 41 Azeri civilians had been killed and 207 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed information about military casualties.
Nagorno-Karabakh said its military death toll since Sept 27 had reached 525, while at least 25 civilians had been killed.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An informal grouping bringing together India, Australia and Japan with the United States could be opened to other countries that support a ""free and open Indo-Pacific region"", U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Beigun said on Monday.
Washington has been pushing for closer collaboration among the members of the so-called Quad grouping as a bulwark against China's growing regional influence. 
""The Quad is a partnership driven by shared interests, not binding obligations, and is not intended to be an exclusive grouping,"" Beigun said in remarks prepared for delivery at an India-U.S. forum in Delhi, where he was beginning a three-day visit. ""Any country that seeks a free and open Indo-Pacific and is willing to take steps to ensure that, should be welcome to work with us."" 
The Quad partners could deepen engagement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries and cooperate in defending freedom of the seas, he said.
China has denounced the Quad as an attempt to contain its development and urged the United States to drop its ""Cold War mentality"".
Beigun is holding talks with Indian government leaders to lay the ground for an annual dialogue between the two countries' top diplomats and defence leaders expected later this month.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark Esper will likely fly to Delhi for the ""2 plus 2"" dialogue with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, a government source in Delhi said. 
U.S. calls for deeper engagement come at a time when India is locked in a military stand-off with China along their disputed Himalayan border. At least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash in June and the two sides have since mobilised thousands of troops in close proximity, raising fears of a wider conflict over a region where they fought a brief but bloody war in 1962.
New Delhi, wary of further antagonising China, has been careful to avoid being drawn into U.S.-led alliances. But Beigun said the United States had no plans to impinge on India's strategic autonomy, but to forge a relationship based on shared interests.
""We do not seek to change India's traditions. Rather we want to explore how to empower them and India's ability to defend its own sovereignty and democracy and to advance Indian interests, across the Indo-Pacific region,"" he said.

The United States has over the past decade or two emerged as one of India's top arms suppliers, replacing Russia.

France expressed its concern after the Turkish vessel, the Oruc Reis, began its voyage. It said Turkey must stick to commitments it has made in the dispute, refrain from provocative actions and show good faith.
Greece's foreign ministry described the new voyage as a ""major escalation"" and a ""direct threat to peace in the region"". Turkey accused Athens of fuelling tensions.
The Oruc Reis intends to carry out work south of the Greek island of Kastellorizo, which is close to Turkey's coast.
Ankara had withdrawn the vessel from contested waters in the eastern Mediterranean last month to ""allow for diplomacy"" before an EU summit at which Cyprus sought sanctions against Turkey.
""Turkey has proven it lacks credibility. All those who believed Turkey meant all it said before the European summit of Oct. 1-2 now stand corrected,"" Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas said on Monday.
At the summit, the EU said it would punish Turkey if it continued operations in the region and that sanctions could be imposed as soon as December. 
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said Ankara's operations were within its continental shelf and it expected Greece to refrain from steps escalating tensions.
""They are doing everything to escalate tensions,"" Akar said. ""The Navy will provide the necessary escort and protection to our vessels as needed."" 
Energy Minister Fatih Donmez wrote on Twitter said Turkey would ""continue to explore, dig and protect our rights.""
Relations between Greece and Turkey are complicated by a range of disputes, from jurisdiction in the Mediterranean to ethnically split Cyprus.
Greek government spokesman Petsas said Turkey had done the opposite of what it should have, and the EU did not need to wait two months before taking action. 
""So the only issue here is to activate more drastic solutions, for Turkey to feel more stick and less carrot this time,"" Petsas said.
French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in Paris: ""We expect Turkey to meet its commitments, abstain from new provocations and show concrete evidence of good faith.""

Berlin and Paris made their proposal at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg. They say they have not had a credible explanation from Moscow for what the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said was the presence of the banned Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok in Navalny's body.
The speed with which the EU's two main powers have agreed to push ahead with sanctions suggests a hardening of the bloc's stance towards Moscow. It took almost a year for the EU to agree sanctions against Russians after a nerve agent attack in 2018 on a former Russian spy in Britain.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told reporters as he arrived at the meeting earlier on Monday that Navalny's poisoning could not ""remain without consequences"".
""France and Germany propose imposing sanctions on certain people that caught our eye in this respect,"" Maas said, without giving any details.
EU diplomats told Reuters there was broad support among the 27 foreign ministers for asset freezes and travel bans on several Russian GRU military intelligence officials.
Moscow denies any involvement in Navalny's poisoning. 
Senior Russian lawmaker Vladimir Dzhabarov said on Monday that Russia may respond to the EU sanctions symmetrically and repeated Moscow's line that there was no concrete evidence behind the accusations, Interfax news agency reported.
The sanctions are not expected to be approved immediately as legal texts must be prepared and cleared by experts from the 27 EU states.
Navalny fell ill on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20 and was subsequently airlifted to Berlin for treatment. Blood samples taken from him confirmed the presence of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family, the OPCW said last week. 
Western governments and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation have said that Russia must help in investigations or face consequences. 

Austria's foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, whose country has tended to favour closer ties with Russia, said there could not be a ""return to business as usual"" and that Moscow had failed to help clear up doubts about the poisoning.

The strikes, carried out over the last two days, mark a rare military intervention by the United States since it signed an agreement on troop withdrawal with the Taliban in February.
The deal provides for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Afghanistan in exchange for security guarantees from the insurgent group, and a pledge to sit down with the Kabul administration to find a peaceful settlement to decades of war.
Fighting has continued despite several rounds of peace talks between the Taliban and Afghan government negotiators in the Qatari capital of Doha over the past month.
In the last two days, hundreds of Taliban fighters have stormed security checkpoints in Helmand, taking over key areas on the outskirts of the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah.
U.S. military spokesman Col. Sonny Leggett said on Twitter that the U.S. air strikes were ""consistent with the United States-Taliban agreement"", and that Afghan security forces would continue to be provided with defensive cover.
Leggett quoted Gen. Scott Miller, the commander of foreign forces in Afghanistan, calling on the Taliban to immediately stop their offensive in Helmand, which he said was ""not consistent with the U.S.-Taliban agreement and undermines the ongoing Afghan Peace Talks"". 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the areas taken over by the group had been wrested from their control a few months earlier. ""No new changes have occurred,"" he said on Twitter. 
Helmand's police chief General Khalil-ur-Rahman Jawad told reporters that ""tactical measures have been taken to prevent casualties, but security will soon be restored to restore order"".

LIVERPOOL, England (Reuters) - The last pints could be pulled in pubs across northern England this week as furious bosses warn new coronavirus restrictions will wipe out their businesses which are already reeling from a national lockdown earlier this year.
With cases of COVID-19 surging and hospital admissions rocketing, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday unveiled a new three-tier lockdown local system to curb its spread, with pubs and bars closed down in ""very high"" alert areas.
Liverpool, birthplace of the Beatles and famed for its soccer team, the current Premier League champions, and its surrounding region will be the first to be placed into the highest alert tier, meaning its drinking establishments face closure from Wednesday. 
Pub managers there reacted with disbelief and anger that their city and their businesses were being singled out.
""My biggest worry as a boss and a licensee is my business will have to close again and we may very well not come open next time because there's no funds in the pot from last time,"" said Francis Burleigh, landlady of The Beehive pub in Liverpool city centre.
""The last lockdown I lost 6,500 pounds on beer alone and 3,500 on food and I'll not survive that this time,"" she added.

The infection rate in northwest England has been soaring in recent weeks, and in Liverpool stands at just under 600 cases per 100,000 people. Health chiefs say action is vital now to prevent the hospitals being overrun and a rise in deaths.

URACHICHE, Venezuela (Reuters) - In the Venezuelan town of Urachiche, long a bastion of support for President Nicolas Maduro's ruling Socialist Party, a radio station broadcast messages in September calling for a protest over decaying public services and chronic fuel shortages.
The man driving the rally was an activist named Edito Hidalgo of the Tupamaro party, which is closely allied with Maduro - a stark contrast from typical Venezuelan street agitators who are fiercely anti-government.
""Our people have the right to live. We want efficiency in public services,"" Hidalgo said at the municipal headquarters of the town of 20,000 during a Sept. 22 march, flanked by dozens of others demanding improved access to water, electricity and fuel.
The march ended peacefully. But by the next day, nearby towns in the agricultural state of Yaracuy were convulsed with protests that troops broke up with tear gas and rubber bullets. 
Within a week, hundreds of similar protests broke out across the South American nation, from the western Zulia state, which has been prone to black outs, to the isolated Caribbean shores of Sucre in the east, before a deployment of troops halted the demonstrations. 
The unrest revealed how Venezuela's agricultural heartland remains a tinder box for social unrest and how even Socialist Party stalwarts are losing patience with the privations caused by a crippling six-year economic crisis that has been accelerated by a six-month coronavirus quarantine. 
In interviews with a dozen people in Urachiche and the nearby towns of Yaritagua and Chivacoa, residents described anger and weariness at the struggles of making do without basic services. 
Nearly all asked not to be identified, citing possible reprisals and intimidation by security forces. 
During a visit to four cities in Yaracuy in early October, protests had died down. Troops and military vehicles remained stationed on the streets.
Hidalgo, in a telephone interview, said the march he led was unrelated to the demonstrations that followed, and said citizens are angry at the lack of basic services and difficulty obtaining food. 
""Our march was totally peaceful,"" he said. ""The people are walking around with their eyes sunken because they can't get any protein.""
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to requests for comment. 
Socialist Party officials say the problems with public services are the result of U.S. sanctions meant to force Maduro from office, and frequently accuse opposition leaders of orchestrating street violence.
MULES BECOME MEALS
Rural Venezuela has been a Socialist Party stronghold for more than a decade, largely because government institutions are usually the only ones that can help isolated communities that struggle to find work, housing and medical attention.
Urachiche, around 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Caracas, was so devoted to late socialist leader Hugo Chavez that it once created a barter currency as part of an experiment in socialist economics. https://reut.rs/3j052cx
Yet the lives of small farmers in the hills around Urachiche who grow beans, corn and coffee have steadily worsened during Venezuela's economic crisis.
Carlos Pineda, 30, used to transport his wares to market on his truck, but fuel shortages now force him to walk for hours to town carrying 50 kilo (110 pound) sacks on his back. 
Mules are also sometimes available to transport goods but residents battling hunger have in many cases been forced to eat the animals.
""Some people do it on mules, but there aren't many animals left: they've eaten them,"" said Pineda, sitting in Urachiche's main plaza as he prepared to sell a sack of black beans he had hauled down from the mountains.
Access to electricity, running water and fuel have steadily deteriorated in rural Venezuela in recent years as the government prioritizes urban areas such as Caracas, the capital, particularly after a massive weeks-long blackout in 2019.
""They've forgotten about us. No gas, water, food and now no power either,"" said Maria Mendoza, 38, a merchant, who said she no longer plans to vote for ""the process"" - a catch phrase sometimes used to describe the Socialist Party.
The Sept. 22 march organized by Hidalgo, the Urachiche activist, went largely unnoticed in a country accustomed to seeing angry citizens in the streets. 
But within days, videos on social media showed clashes between security forces in nearby towns, some of which featured what appeared to be gunshots as well as demonstrators bloodied by repeated volleys of rubber bullets.
From Sept. 22 to Sept. 30, 701 protests broke out across the country, non-profit group Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict said in a report released last week.
Authorities responded by arresting 35 people in Yaracuy and at least 50 nationwide, according to rights groups.
Police arrested Dagni Salcedo, 19, a motorcycle delivery man in the town of Yaritagua, according to his mother Sullehil Rodriguez, who says they grabbed him as he was finishing a delivery, put a hood over his head and threatened to shoot him. 
""My son is beaten. He's a worker - you can ask any of the neighbors,"" Rodriguez said outside the police compound where he is being held. She travels 58 km (36 miles) each day to take meals to her son, who recently recovered from COVID-19.

""It's no secret that there's no gas, water, food or power.""

Lukashenko, who has been in power for 26 years, was not on the EU's sanctions list of 40 names agreed on Oct. 2, but the bloc now says his refusal to consider new elections as a way out of the crisis leaves it with no choice.
""This is an answer to the evolving situation in Belarus,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, who chaired the EU ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, told reporters. 
""There has not been any kind of signal from the Belarus authorities to engage in any kind of conversation,"" he said, citing a ""complete lack of will"" from Lukashenko to consider talks on holding a free and fair presidential election.
The latest round of sanctions is likely to take several days to prepare, but envoys said the travel bans and asset freezes were no longer conditional on the situation in Belarus, which ministers said was dramatically worsening.
Police said they had detained 713 people at mass protests on Sunday in which security forces used water cannon and batons to break up crowds demanding a new presidential election.

Belarus announced retaliatory sanctions against the EU earlier this month.

Dubbed the ""earthquake"" bomb, the Tallboy bomb was used by Britain's Royal Air Force (RAF) and weighs nearly 5,400 kg, including 2,400 kg of explosive, the Navy said on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
The bomb was found in the Piast Canal which connects the Baltic Sea with the Oder River, and was dropped by the RAF in 1945 in an attack on the German cruiser Lutzow.
The site is near the town of Swinoujscie in northwest Poland where a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal was opened in 2016.
""There will be no deliveries while the bomb is being neutralised,"" a spokeswoman at site operator Gaz-System said, adding the timing of the defusing of the bomb had been agreed between the firm, the Navy and local authorities.
""We dug up the moving part of the bomb, the middle part the bomb was left, as planned, so that the debris around it would keep the bomb in a fixed place, so that it would not move and the fuses would not be triggered,"" Michal Jodloski from the 12th Minesweeper Squadron of the 8th Coastal Defense Flotilla told private broadcaster TVN 24.
On Monday 751 people had to be evacuated from the area, local media reported.
""We are leaving for this week. We are afraid. The children should go to school and they would have to go past it every day, so there is a bit of fear,"" a local resident named Radoslaw told TVN24.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un became visibly emotional during a speech at a military parade over the weekend as he thanked troops for their sacrifices and apologised to citizens for failing to improve their lives.
At a speech on Saturday during celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers’ Party, Kim thanked thousands of gathered troops for responding to recent damaging storms, and for helping to prevent a coronavirus outbreak in the country.
In video footage edited and released by the state television station, Kim appeared tearful and at one point seemed to choke up.
Kim said he was grateful that not a single North Korean had been infected with the virus, a claim that U.S. and South Korean officials have previously cast doubts on.
The impact of anti-coronavirus measures, international sanctions, and several typhoons combined to prevent the government from following through on promises to improve citizens' lives, Kim said.
""My efforts and sincerity have not been sufficient enough to rid our people of the difficulties in their life,"" he said. ""Our people, however, have always believed and absolutely trusted me, and supported my choice and determination, whatever it is.""
North Korea's economy, already severely restricted by international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, took a further hit as the country shut down nearly all border traffic in an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak.
The United Nations has said that as much as 40 percent of the population faces food shortages, which may have been exacerbated by severe summer floods and typhoons.

In a scene common to many such events in North Korean, most people in the audience also had tears streaming down their faces.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Extreme weather events have increased dramatically in the past 20 years, taking a heavy human and economic toll worldwide, and are likely to wreak further havoc, the United Nations said on Monday.
Heatwaves and droughts will pose the greatest threat in the next decade, as temperatures continue to rise due to heat-trapping gases, experts said.
China (577) and the United States (467) recorded the highest number of disaster events from 2000 to 2019, followed by India (321), the Philippines (304) and Indonesia (278), the U.N. said in a report issued the day before the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction. Eight of the top 10 countries are in Asia.
Some 7,348 major disaster events were recorded globally, claiming 1.23 million lives, affecting 4.2 billion people and causing $2.97 trillion in economic losses during the two-decade period. 
Drought, floods, earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires and extreme temperature events caused major damage.
""The good news is that more lives have been saved but the bad news is that more people are being affected by the expanding climate emergency,"" Mami Mizutori, the U.N. Secretary-General’s Special Representative for Disaster Risk Reduction, told a news briefing.
She called for governments to invest in early warning systems and implement disaster risk reduction strategies.
Debarati Guha-Sapir of the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters at the University of Louvain, Belgium, which provided data for the report, said: ""If this level of growth in extreme weather events continues over the next twenty years, the future of mankind looks very bleak indeed.
""Heatwaves are going to be our biggest challenge in the next 10 years, especially in the poor countries,"" she said.
Last month was the world's hottest September on record, with unusually high temperatures recorded off Siberia, in the Middle East, and in parts of South America and Australia, the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service said. 

Global temperatures will continue to warm over the next five years, and may even temporarily rise to more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said in July. Scientists have set 1.5C (2.7 Fahrenheit) as the ceiling for avoiding catastrophic climate change.

669,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 12, 2020 09:53AM ET</span>",Analysis: South Korea sees hope and threat in mixed message from North's Kim,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean officials have seized on conciliatory comments by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on the weekend as a sign that tension could be easing but also worry the huge number of rockets he showcased is evidence that peace may be elusive.
Kim sent mixed signals as he addressed an unprecedented night-time military parade early on Saturday, wishing the neighbouring Koreas would ""hold hands"" again after the novel coronavirus pandemic is over.
While much of the world was captivated by the appearance of a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), officials in South Korea were far more concerned by the display of new multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) and fast, manoeuvrable short-range missiles that would be ideal for striking targets in the South.
""The parade revealed not only an advanced ICBM but also MLRS that pose a direct threat to South Korea,"" said South Korean opposition leader Kim Chong-in.
""They've not changed, their threats have grown even bigger."" 
South Korean ruling party leader and former prime minister Lee Nak-yon said he took hope from Kim's overture to the South as a ""positive sign"" but worried about what the display of new weapons said about North Korea's intentions.
""North Korea showed advanced weapons including a new ICBM, which indicated it has not abandoned its resolve to develop weapons of mass destruction, and those weapons can threaten peace on the Korean peninsula,"" Lee told a party meeting.
November's U.S. election is compounding the uncertainty especially as the tone of ties between the two Koreas is often set by the state of North Korea's relations with its old enemy the United States.
When a landmark summit between Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 brought an unprecedented easing of tension between those two countries, North Korea's dealings with South Korea also saw a remarkable thaw.
But relations on the peninsula have been tense since a second summit between Kim and Trump collapsed last year, and they took another blow last month when North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official detained at sea.
'CROCODILE TEARS'
Shin Beom-chul, a senior fellow at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul, said despite Kim's conciliatory comments towards South Korea, his main message on Saturday was aimed at the United States.
""By showing a new ICBM, the North suggested they can test it any time if things don't go well after the election. Inter-Korean ties don't count to them,"" Shin said.
The South Korean government said Kim's speech would foster better ties but it urged North Korea to stick to agreements preventing armed clashes and accept a request for a joint investigation into the shooting of the fisheries official. 
South Korean opposition leader Kim derided a teary display by Kim as he spoke of the sacrifices made by North Korea's armed forces.
""It was appalling to see him shed crocodile tears after shooting our citizen to death,"" he said.
Former South Korean nuclear negotiator Chun Yung-woo, pointing to North Korea's extensive testing of MLRS and short-range missiles over the past year, while sticking to a moratorium on ICBM testing, said South Korea must not get carried away by hope for peace.
""All the media attention is on North Korea's new strategic weapons but the most serious threat to our security is solid-fuel, short-range tactical missiles and MLRS that they've been madly testing over the past year,"" Chun said.

""North Korea showed how it has focused on developing its capability to attack the South while our people have been absorbed in a peace campaign,"" he said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's cabinet approved a normalisation deal with the United Arab Emirates on Monday and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and Abu Dhabi's crown prince had spoken and agreed to meet soon.
The U.S.-brokered ""treaty of peace"" establishing full relations with the Gulf Arab country broke new diplomatic ground in the region, where concern over Iran is high, even as Palestinians condemned the pact as betrayal of their quest for statehood in Israeli-occupied land.
Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the UAE's de facto leader, tweeted on Monday that he and Netanyahu had discussed strengthening bilateral ties and the prospects for peace in the area.
In an official statement that coincided with an Israeli cabinet vote approving the Sept. 15 agreement with the UAE, Netanyahu said he and Sheikh Mohammed would meet soon, without specifying a date.
""At the weekend, I spoke with my friend, the crown prince ... and invited him to visit Israel,"" Netanyahu said. ""He invited me to visit Abu Dhabi. But first, we will see a UAE delegation here and another one of our delegations will go there.""
A source familiar with plans for the delegations' visits said Israeli representatives accompanied by U.S. officials will fly to Bahrain on Oct. 18 and travel on to the UAE the next day before returning to Israel with a UAE team on Oct. 20.
Commenting on his conversation with Sheikh Mohammed, Netanyahu said: ""We spoke about cooperation that we are promoting in investment, tourism, energy, technology and other spheres"".
In a sign of burgeoning Israel-UAE cooperation, a ship from the UAE docked on Monday at Israel's port of Haifa, carrying a cargo of 15 containers along a shipping line between India, the UAE, Israel and the United States.
While the normalisation accord has already inspired commercial deal-making with the Gulf's trade, finance, tourism and travel hub, Israeli officials have objected to the UAE's potential purchase of U.S.-made F-35 stealth fighter jets in a separate side deal.
Israel is the only Middle East country flying the advanced warplane and has voiced concern its supply to other nations in the region could jeopardise its military edge.
Israel has also said it would oppose any sale of the plane to Qatar, whose Iran links trouble Israel, after a Reuters report that Doha had submitted a formal request to Washington to buy the  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT). stealth jet. [nL8N2H206N]
Israeli cabinet approval of the accord with the UAE opened the way for Israel's parliament to ratify it, in a vote likely to be held later this week.
Israel and Bahrain, which signed a ""declaration of peace"" at the White House ceremony last month, are still discussing details of a full accord.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari promised on Monday that the government would bring police officers responsible for misconduct to justice, after nearly a week of protests against police brutality that were met by a harsh response.
At least one person has been killed since the demonstrations began. Police have opened fire with guns at marchers, as well as using water canons and tear gas to disperse them. More than a thousand demonstrators returned to streets around Nigeria on Monday.
On Sunday, authorities announced they were disbanding the Special Anti-Robbery Squad police unit, known as SARS, the target of demonstrators who accuse it of beating up and killing Nigerians and extorting from them.
Rights groups and protesters said they were unconvinced by the promise to disband the SARS force, saying the authorities had pledged to dissolve or reform the unit in the past with little change.
In a statement on Monday, Buhari promised ""extensive police reforms"", acknowledging ""genuine concerns and agitations by Nigerians about the excessive use of force and in some cases extra-judicial killings and wrongful conduct of the men of the Nigerian Police Force.""

With the number of cases surging unhindered across the North African country schools have tried different tactics from opening outside to seeking donations for extra disinfectants and facemasks to allow teaching indoors. 
However, even those who have had no teaching for six months, or much prospect of it during the rest of this year, will have to pass an exam in order to progress to the next grade, the authorities have said. 
""Students did not study anything. We did not teach anything for the students to learn. This is not a solution,"" said teacher Amal Qleiwan, who is also the mother of a 10-year old. 
""The decisions by the ministry of education are random and are not studied well.""
University professor, Ahmed Falaq, is home schooling his two children, aged 10 and 8, and his two nephews, aged 12 and 10. 
""What will students do if there is a new wave of coronavirus? They will miss two years of their education. This is a big problem for parents and the students. We will have a generation of students with weak education,"" he explained.
Libya now has more than 41,000 cases of the coronavirus, though with war-related chaos across much of the country officials admit there are probably many more going undetected. The United Nations has said it is ""spiralling out of control"". 
Meanwhile, according to U.N. estimates, the fighting in Libya had already displaced more than 150,000 people, 90,000 of whom are children and closed 200 schools, depriving more than 200,000 children of their schooling.
As the pandemic started to rage through Libya since August, medics working in the war-ravaged country's few functioning hospitals faced their nightmare scenario - a surge in cases and dwindling resources.

Officers gathered outside the headquarters of Paris Police, holding banners that read ""Police under attack, citizens in danger"". In the low-income Champigny neighbourhood, where Saturday's night's unrest occurred, police carried the slogan: ""Your security has a price. We want protection and recognition.""
French police are under pressure after a series of media reports this summer revealed endemic racism and far right sentiments among its ranks. 
President Emmanuel Macron's government has a fraught relationship with the police, which accuse it of scapegoating law enforcement agencies during protests against racism and police brutality earlier this year. 
The protests, part of a global wave of demonstrations triggered by the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis in May, focused on the death of a young Black man in police custody in 2016 in similar circumstances to Floyd.
Macron is due to meet police unions on Thursday in an attempt to quell the simmering discontent. 
Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has said the government wants to amend a security bill defining fireworks as a type of arm and ban their sale, including on the internet. Police unions have denounced it as an inadequate gesture and say more officers are needed on the streets.
The Champigny police station is located in a housing estate which the police say is a hub for drug trafficking. 
Police officers have also been the targets of attacks Islamist militants or individuals with suspected Islamist sympathies, including one which saw a police IT worker kill four colleagues in a knife rampage last year.

The result comes amid a controversy over Suga's rejection of six scholars for membership in a science advisory body set up after World War Two, a move critics say violates the constitution's principle of academic freedom.
Suga has said the decision was appropriate, but 47% said they were not very convinced or not convinced at all by his explanation, according to the poll, which was based on responses from 1,284 people.
Regarding the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, 54% had a positive view against 40% who had a negative view. 
But 59% said a decision to gradually relax restrictions on entry to the country by foreigners with long-term visas from Oct. 1 was too soon, NHK said.

Suga took office after Shinzo Abe resigned last month citing ill health. Abe had come under fire for what critics called a slow and clumsy response to the COVID-19 outbreak, although Japan has not seen the sort of explosive outbreak suffered in many other places overseas.

""Viva España! Government resign!"", cried hundreds of supporters as they filled Madrid's main thoroughfare and the party staged smaller demonstrations in Barcelona and Seville. 
Sunday's protest escalated a standoff between Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the conservative-led Madrid regional government, on which Vox holds 12 of 132 seats, and which argues that the government's curbs are illegal and excessive and will spell disaster for the local economy. 
""I have come to protest because I am fed up with the management of the pandemic, not only with health but with the economy. I am not a Vox supporter, but we have to protest somehow,"" said Lola Abad, 55, an administrator who attended the Madrid demonstration.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s cabinet on Monday approved the death penalty for rapists amid nationwide protests in the wake of a series of gang rapes and sexual assaults.
Bangladesh has seen a surge of sexual crimes in recent years, with nearly 1,000 incidents reported between January and September, more than a fifth of them gang rapes, according to human rights group Ain-o-Salish Kendra.
Experts, however, said tougher penalties would not be enough to tackle the problem and authorities needed to immediately address systemic problems in rape trials and the extremely low conviction rates.
Rights activists blame the increasing number of assaults on a culture of impunity and protection of suspects by influential individuals for political reasons.
The cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, approved the proposal to make the death penalty the highest punishment for rape, Law Minister Anisul Huq told Reuters. 
""The law needed to be amended quickly...(Cabinet) has decided an ordinance will be promulgated tomorrow, with the approval of the president, as the parliament is not holding sessions currently,"" he said.
The latest outpouring of national anger was sparked by a video of a group of men stripping and attacking a woman for almost half an hour in the southeastern district of Noakhali.
An investigation by an autonomous state body, the National Human Rights Commission, found the woman in the video had been raped repeatedly and terrorised with weapons by one of the group over the last year.
""No mercy to rapists"" shouted protesters gathered in the capital Dhaka and elsewhere, hundreds of women and students among them. Many carried placards bearing messages such as ""Stop rape culture.""
""Every day, newspapers carry fresh stories of sexual violence against women,"" said Sahana Islam, a university student, who joined the protests.
""I fear I am next. I want death penalty for the rapists so that the rest of the inhuman creeps can learn what will happen to them if they ever dare to do it.""
When survivors file a complaint for sexual assault in Bangladesh prosecution is very rare and takes years to complete, and the conviction rate in trials that do go to court is very low.
In addition, many rapes go unreported because women fear being stigmatised.
A 2013 survey conducted by the United Nations found that, among men in Bangladesh who admitted to committing rape, 88% of rural respondents and 95% of urban respondents said they faced no legal consequences.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis met on Monday with Australian Cardinal George Pell, the Vatican's former economy minister who has returned to Rome after the firing of an Italian cardinal whom Pell had accused of obstructing financial reform.
Pell was cleared earlier this year of sexual abuse charges in Australia after spending 13 months in prison, and it remains unclear whether he will take up another role in the Vatican.
The Vatican announced the meeting between Pell and Pope Francis in a statement on the pope's daily private audiences, but gave no details. ""It went very well,"" Pell told reporters in front of his residence just outside the Vatican walls.
Pell returned to Rome on Sept. 30, just days after the pope fired Pell's nemesis, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, who was accused of embezzlement and nepotism. Becciu has denied all wrongdoing.
While Becciu was number two in the Vatican's Secretariat of State and Pell was economy minister, the two had a very stormy relationship.
Becciu told reporters the day after he was sacked about a meeting between Pell, the pope and Becciu where Pell told Becciu, ""You are dishonest"", and Becciu replied: ""How dare you!""
After Becciu was sacked, Pell said: ""The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances. He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments.""
Pell said he hoped the ""cleaning of the stables"" would continue.
Becciu's lawyer has denied Italian media reports that his client sent money to Australia to help Pell's ""enemies"" while he was facing the sexual abuse charges.
Through his lawyer, the Australian man who accused Pell of sexually abusing him two decades ago denied Italian reports speculating that he may have been bribed to testify.
Pell's Australian lawyer, Robert Richter, called for an investigation ""to track the money trail"". He said it should include Italian and Australian investigators.

""If one is to give any credence to what has been alleged, then it is critical that all proper money-tracing exercises be undertaken,"" Richter told Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Asia-Pacific countries including Singapore, Australia and Japan are gradually easing some international travel restrictions as coronavirus cases slow, in hopes of helping to revive their economies. 
International travel in Asia has collapsed during the pandemic due to border closures, with passenger numbers down 97% in August, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines.
Although European countries that had been more open add fresh travel restrictions as cases rise, in Asia the trend is toward easing, though not always on a bilateral basis.
For now, few people are likely to travel because of testing and insurance requirements, and in some cases the need to quarantine upon return home, meaning the deals offer limited hope for airlines and the tourism industry.
A Singapore-Indonesia deal announced on Monday for essential business and official travel will require an application and COVID-19 swab tests both before and after travel.
Singapore had established similar agreements with China, South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, and opened unilaterally to general visitors from New Zealand, Brunei, Vietnam and most of Australia.
But Singapore transport minister Ong Ye Kung said in parliament this month that the number of travellers remained small, with the country's main airport serving 1.5% of its usual passenger volume.
New Zealanders will be able to travel to some parts of Australia starting Friday without quarantining, including to New South Wales, Canberra and the Northern Territory.
However, New Zealanders who return from Australia must quarantine for two weeks under government supervision at the cost of NZ$3100 ($2,064.91) for the first person and more for additional family members.
New Zealand, due to hold an election on Oct. 17, has said it does not plan open its borders to Australians for now. 
Australia is also in talks with Japan, South Korea, Singapore and South Pacific nations on reopening travel as coronavirus infections ease, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday.
Japan and Vietnam will allow short-term business travel with each other, the Yomiuri daily said on Saturday. 
The pact, which will take effect by the end of October at the earliest, follows similar steps to ease business travel restrictions to Singapore and South Korea, the paper added.
Japan is also planning to remove a ban on overseas travel to China and 11 other countries and regions including Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam and Malaysia next month, the Yomiuri said, though it would still advise against non-essential travel. 
Asked about the report, immigration official Seiji Matano said that no decision had been made, but that the government would consider how to reopen traffic in a way that prevents infection.
Many of the countries to which Japan will reportedly allow travel ban most non-citizens and non-residents from entering.

Japan allows citizens, residents, and visa holders to reenter the country after testing negative for COVID-19 at the airport, with a capacity of about 10,000 per day.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Ethiopia has raised its health budget by 46% this year after the coronavirus crisis exposed the need for more equipment, facilities and personnel, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Monday.
The populous Horn of Africa nation has typically been spending twice its annual health budget servicing its external debt, he said, but it was now shifting priorities. 
""In many African countries, healthcare is a neglected sector. This pandemic has exposed our dark underbelly,"" Abiy told the FT Africa conference, which was held virtually.
The extra spending has made the health sector the fourth biggest in terms of budgetary allocations, he said, without giving any detailed numbers.
Sub-Saharan Africa appears to have so far escaped the worst of the pandemic, accounting for only 3.4% of global infections and 2.5% of deaths, but Abiy said the region's economies have taken a heavy toll.
He urged governments in the region to emulate Ethiopia's focus on climate change mitigation, through planting of trees and investing in renewable energy sources, as they try to revive growth.
""A green recovery can also be a jobs-rich recovery,"" he said.
Abiy, who took the helm in 2018, said his government was committed to opening up key sectors of the economy to foreign capital.
Officials have been cutting regulations for businesses and trying to improve the investment climate through initiatives such as a new arbitration law for dispute resolution.
The liberalisation of the telecoms sector, one of the most keenly watched, has elicited interest from some of the most recognisable global operators, Abiy said, without giving details. 

""We intend to deliver a transparent licensing process... before the end of the calendar year,"" he said.

DENVER (Reuters) - A security guard hired to protect a Denver television news crew covering opposing rallies of right-wing and left-wing political activists is being held in custody on suspicion of first-degree murder in the fatal shooting of a protester, police said on Sunday.
The deadly gunfire erupted on Saturday following a ""verbal altercation"" between the suspect and victim just as a ""Patriot Rally"" and a counter-demonstration dubbed a ""BLM-Antifa Soup Drive"" was drawing to a close, Denver Police division chief Joe Montoya said.
The suspected gunman, identified by police as Matthew Dolloff, 30, was arrested just after the shooting, which occurred in a courtyard outside an art museum, but he has not been formally charged, Montoya said.
The man shot to death was not immediately named by authorities, but the Denver Post identified him, according to the victim's son, as Lee Keltner, 49, a Navy veteran who ran a hat-making business in the Denver area for many years.
""He wasn't a part of any group,"" the son, Johnathon Keltner, told the Post. ""He was there to rally for the police department, and he'd been down there before rallying for the police department.""
Denver station KUSA-TV, an NBC affiliate, said in its own account posted online that Dolloff was contracted by KUSA through the Pinkerton security agency, and that one of the station's news producers was with Dolloff during the altercation.
Pinkerton did not immediately respond to an email request for comment.
Denver police tweeted on Sunday they are unaware if Dolloff was affiliated with any political group but said he was not a protest participant.
An image of the incident captured by Denver Post photographer Helen Richardson showed a man spraying a chemical agent at another man pointing a handgun in his direction. Montoya said two guns were recovered from the scene.
Richardson said on Instagram that the shooting victim, who she said was with the patriot rally, and the other man “exchanged heated words” before violence ensued.
The ""patriot hit the man in the face, then backed up to spray what looked like pepper spray at him,” Richardson wrote. “Literally in that split second the man who had gotten hit by the patriot pulled out a gun from his waistband and shot the patriot.”
By all accounts, nobody from the side of the Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist counter-rally was directly involved in the deadly confrontation. 

Dolloff made his first court appearance on Sunday, where a magistrate judge ordered the arrest warrant affidavit sealed and ruled that the suspect be held without bond, local media reported.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The Thai government said on Monday it was not concerned about a student-led demonstration on Wednesday as protest leaders sought to escalate their push to demand a new constitution and oust Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.
During three months of protests, anti-government activists have also broken a taboo by calling for reforms of the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, who is ""enthroned in a position of revered worship"" according to the constitution.
Protesters, who drew tens of thousands of people to a demonstration last month, said they planned to gather on Wednesday at Bangkok's Democracy Monument before moving to Government House and would camp there overnight.
Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters that he did not expect huge turnout.
""We're prepared and not worried,"" he said. ""I think we can handle it.""
The protest leaders, organising under the new banner of the People's Movement, said their focus would be a call for constitutional changes before a parliament sitting on Nov. 1.
""We also want to oust Prayuth,"" said Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul, one of the leaders, adding that she expected even more people than at last month's protest in Bangkok.
Protesters say the constitution was engineered to ensure that Prayuth, who first seized power in a 2014 coup, continued in office after an election last year. He says the election was fair.
Some protesters also want a reduction in the king's powers to reflect Thailand's status as a constitutional monarchy.
Raising the prospect of an encounter between the king and the protesters, his motorcade is due to pass Democracy Monument on Wednesday as he presides over a ceremony at a royal temple during a rare visit to Thailand.
Police said they would urge protesters to choose another location or at least clear the way for the motorcade.

Arnon Nampa, another of the protest leaders, said last week that demonstrators would not obstruct the motorcade but would show a three-finger salute - a symbol of resistance - if it passed by.

Police in a statement said they had received unspecified complaints over a widely circulated list of 121 federal lawmakers who supposedly were backing Anwar's bid.

""The police will not hesitate to take action against those who spread news that is false, unverified and misleading.""
Huzir said they had initially asked Anwar to give his statement on Monday morning, but due to scheduling conflicts they will set a new date for their meeting.
Anwar said members of his People's Justice Party have been instructed not to hold any gatherings while he attends his audience with the king.

""I also call upon all Malaysians to keep calm as this audience session takes place, and to remain calm for any subsequent process that takes place thereafter,"" Anwar said.

YANGON (Reuters) - Defying the threat of contracting coronavirus and a citywide lockdown, Myanmar taxi driver Ko Naing, 50, still travels each day to pray outside the sacred Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon, the country’s holiest Buddhist site. 
“I’m not scared of the virus because I feel protected by my religion and regular praying at the pagoda,” he told Reuters, kneeling at the front gate of the pagoda.
The number of COVID-19 infections in Myanmar, which has one of the world’s weakest health systems, has surged from a few hundred in mid-August to more than 27,000 cases and 646 deaths as of Monday. 
The country of 53 million people has locked down its biggest city, Yangon, and imposed a broad stay-at-home order across the whole city to stop the virus from spreading.
The glittering Shwedagon pagoda, which has cast its golden light over the city for centuries, shut its doors in April for the first time in recorded history, disrupting a long tradition of regular pilgrimages by devotees.
Yet while many are making do with broadcasts by the pagoda’s monks on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Ko Naing rises at dawn each morning to stand outside its locked gates, lighting incense sticks and risking penalties for breaching the COVID lockdown.
“Other people get in trouble but I don’t. Why? Because I believe in my religion and Buddha,’ he said.
The Southeast Asian nation is housing more than 45,000 people, including COVID-19 patients as well as those yet to be tested, their close contacts and returning migrant workers, in buildings from schools and monasteries to government offices and tower blocks, mostly run by volunteers.

Suu Kyi has also said Myanmar's general election, due on Nov. 8, must go ahead and is ""more important than COVID”.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers riding motorbikes and waving flags held a rally in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Monday, as protests calling on President Joko Widodo to repeal a controversial new jobs law entered a second week. 
Designed to boost investment and cut red tape, the so-called 'omnibus' law has sparked widespread outcry across Indonesia, with protesters saying the law undermines labour rights and weakens environmental protections. 
Demonstrations erupted in industrial areas and cities across the archipelago last week after the bill's passage with chaotic scenes in some areas, public property torched, and almost 6,000 people were arrested. 
On Monday, a union official estimated about 1,000 workers had gathered in central Jakarta to hold another protest against the law.
""We want the omnibus law to be revoked, and the government to issue a presidential decree to replace it,"" Ema Liliefna of the Confederation of All Indonesia Trade Unions (KSBSI) told Reuters.
Widodo has defended the law, saying demonstrators were motivated by ""disinformation"" and urging critics to challenge the law in courts instead.
The new law, which revises more than 70 existing laws and regulations, has been met with cautious optimism from markets and the business community, but critics say the changes were rushed through and undermine existing labour laws, including on severance pay and work hours.
Protesters held rallies in other major Indonesian cities on Monday, including in Bandung and Medan, according to media reports. 
Despite the president's assurances president that the law is needed to help create jobs as Southeast Asia’s pandemic-hit economy veers toward a recession, several groups, including Indonesia’s largest Islamic association, Nahdatul Ulama, have pledged to lodge a judicial review.
Separately, an alliance of conservative Islamic organisations, including the Islamic Defender’s Front and Alumni 212 movement, plan to protest against the law outside the state palace on Tuesday, according to a statement.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Over 40% of Spaniards support establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former king Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandals, according to a poll published on Monday.
The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.
Some 40.9% of respondents said they preferred a republic, while 34.9% said they supported the royal family, and 24.2% said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.
The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48% want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25% were opposed and 16.1% did not know. 
A poll published in August meant for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5% favouring a republic and 56% the monarchy, while 6% did not know and 4.1% were indifferent.
While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a 6.7-billion-euro ($7.92 billion), high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.
Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan Carlos.
The former king has not commented publicly but his lawyer Javier Sanchez has said he is at the disposition of prosecutors if necessary.
The latest survey, published on the National Day public holiday when King Felipe will lead a reduced celebration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was commissioned after the government Centre for Sociological Investigations declined to question Spaniards about the monarchy in its most recent poll. 
Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the monarchy was an “essential part of the constitutional pact”, speaking in an interview published on Monday in ABC. 

Nobel laureate Maria Vargas Llosa was among 183 high-profile supporters of the monarchy who posted a video on You Tube on Sunday in support of King Felipe.

Pro-Russian leader Jeenbekov appears to have quelled what Moscow last week described as chaos in the Central Asian nation, which hosts a Russian military airbase and is a hub for trade with neighbouring China.
But his office said Almazbek Orozaliyev, who was appointed to take charge of security in Bishkek during the state of emergency, had asked for the emergency measures to be extended beyond Oct. 21 to further stabilise the capital.
Orozaliyev made the request during talks with Jeenbekov that also involved two other senior security officials, the president's office said in a statement.
Opposition supporters seized government buildings and said they briefly had control of government and security forces last week before clashing with each other. 
Jeenbekov ordered troops deployed in Bishkek last week and had his fiercest foes detained.
Jeenbekov has yet to confirm a decision by parliament to name a new prime minister but has said he will resign after he does so.
Parliament is yet to confirm his declaration of a state of emergency though he prolonged it to prevent it expiring.
Protests broke out in the former Soviet republic of 6.5 million after the Oct.4 parliamentary election, which handed victory to two establishment parties, one of them closely allied with Jeenbekov.

Kyrgyzstan's central election commission annulled the vote two days later and is due to call a new one within weeks.

BUNIA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Friends of 18-year-old Muno Lembissa said he died in prison from sorrow. The jail's director said malnutrition contributed to his demise, because he did not have visitors to bring in meals to feed him.
The teenager is one of dozens of inmates to die this year in the main prison in Bunia, in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where, like the rest of the country, conditions are overcrowded and there is not enough food to go around.
Lembissa had been convicted of rape and sentenced to a year in jail.
""The sentence really upset him and as a consequence he started to lose weight,"" said David Ilopa, Lembissa's friend and fellow inmate.
""The worry and the hunger were hurting him,"" said another inmate, Detsuvi Elie.
Authorities monitored the Reuters interviews with both men, and it was not clear whether they felt able to speak freely about conditions in the jail.
But Camille Nzonzi Mokonyo, director of Bunia Central Prison, conceded that the lack of food was a factor.
""It wasn't only the punishment that tormented him, but also the malnutrition which led to his death,"" he told Reuters. ""People who don't have visitors only eat what is available at the prison.""
Built to house around 250 inmates, the grey concrete walls of the jail hold more than five times that number.
Meals are budgeted according to a prison's capacity rather than its population, so detainees like Lembissa, who have no family nearby to bring them food, rarely get more than one meal a day and have to rely on outside help.
""It is an undeniable fact that there is a need to put better effort in the management of prisons in our country,"" said Congo's human rights minister Andre Lite.
More than 50 prisoners have died of malnutrition at Bunia Central Prison since the start of 2020, according to the United Nations. 

""Malnutrition is rife in prisons across Congo,"" said Thomas Fessy from Human Rights Watch. ""If it wasn't for aid coming from local aid groups and charities and churches, most detainees wouldn't be fed at present.""

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania's main centre-right opposition party led the first round of a parliamentary vote, election commission data showed on Monday, as high unemployment and rising debt hurt the ruling coalition.
The Homeland Union, which has roots in the 1980s anti-Soviet independence movement, led the vote with 24.8% compared with 17.5% for the Farmers and Greens party (LVZS), an agrarian group that leads the coalition of Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis.
Although a second round of voting could shift the balance again, the leader of LVZS acknowledged his party might be heading out of government as none of his coalition partners reached the 5% of votes needed to secure seats in parliament.
""Working in opposition could be easier than in the government, and the salary is same either way,"" Ramunas Karbauskis told reporters on Monday, a day after the vote.
Lithuania's economy has fared better than some European Union states in the coronavirus crisis, but the prime minister has faced criticism for failing reduce unemployment, mounting debt and not doing enough to prevent a new surge in coronavirus infections.
Four other parties collected more than 5% of the vote, securing seats and opening the way for new coalition talks.
Under Lithuania's election system, half of the 141-member parliament was elected on Sunday in a proportional vote. Remaining lawmakers are elected in constituencies, with a run-off vote for the top two candidates in each held on Oct. 25.
Election officials asked voters to mark ballots with their own pens to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Lithuania has reported 8,899 coronavirus infections, including a record 205 new cases on Saturday, and 103 deaths.
Many in the Baltic Sea state of less than 3 million people voiced frustration during the campaign that income inequality has persisted despite brisk economic growth since Lithuania joined the EU in 2004 and unemployment running at 8.5%.
A fifth of people were at risk of poverty in 2019, mostly the elderly, unchanged from a decade ago, state figures show.
Lithuania's relative resistance to the economic impact of coronavirus curbs helped the government recover some ground after a slump in the wake of corruption allegations. The economy shrank 4% in second quarter, the second best result in the EU.

Lam said she would go to Beijing this month and aimed to hold her policy address by the end of November.
She said she would discuss wide-ranging measures with the central government, including some related to the Greater Bay area - a region that includes Hong Kong, Macao and nine cities in China's Guangdong province - the finance sector and tech innovation, without giving details.
""It is not a matter of waiting for directions,"" Lam told a news conference on Monday when asked about the postponement of her address.
""It is a matter of responding to a positive indication from the central government that they want to take into account the chief executive's recommendations, that they really want to facilitate those policy measures so that Hong Kong people have more confidence that the economy will bounce back.""
The central government's role in the semi-autonomous former British colony has been in the spotlight, in particular with the imposition in June of a security law after months of pro-democracy protests - the most intense in decades - last year.
The protests were triggered in part by fears in Hong Kong that the central government was whittling away the freedoms granted when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula.
The protests and later the novel coronavirus have battered the city's economy with full year gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to contract 6% to 8%.
Lam said the central government had asked her to make the trip to Beijing. 
Last year, Lam delivered her policy speech on video after being heckled by pro-democracy lawmakers.
Lam also said she will visit the neighbouring city of Shenzhen for this week's anniversary of the establishment of China's first special economic zone there 40 years ago.

President Xi Jinping is due to deliver a speech in Shenzhen on Wednesday but Lam said she had not scheduled a meeting with him there.

Addressing media after the hearing, Berejiklian said she had ""made a mistake in my personal life"" with a relationship she did not even disclose to her family or closest friends, but would continue to serve as premier because she had ""not done anything wrong"".
""People may have tried to influence me... but they failed,"" she said.
Berejiklian had earlier told the ICAC she was ""beyond shocked, disgusted"" by evidence put before the inquiry that the former MP for the town of Wagga Wagga, Daryl Maguire, was allegedly involved in a ""cash for visas scheme"" for Chinese nationals involving falsified employment.
Maguire could not be reached for comment and will appear before the inquiry later in the week.
Maguire was forced to resign from the NSW Parliament, and his position as chairman of the NSW Parliament Asia Pacific Friendship Group, after a 2018 investigation heard he had sought to act for Chinese property developers in land deals. 
Berejiklian said she had been in a relationship with Maguire since 2015, and had once called him her ""numero uno"", but demanded Maguire's resignation after the 2018 ICAC revelations. 
She said she ceased contact with him in September 2020 after being privately interviewed by corruption investigators.
A new ICAC inquiry is investigating Maguire's pursuit of business deals between 2012 and 2018 which commonly involved an ""association with China"". 
ICAC telephone intercepts played to the inquiry showed Maguire discussed his financial problems, including debts of $1.5 million, with Berejiklian, as well as the potential for him to gain financially from an airport land deal.
Maguire wanted to resolve his debts before resigning from politics at the 2019 election, the inquiry heard.
If Maguire left politics, Berejiklian would have been willing to make their relationship public, she recalled.
She told the inquiry she was ""an independent woman with my own finances"", adding she would ""never turn a blind eye"" to inappropriate behaviour.
""I am very clear of my public responsibilities and the distinction between my private life and public responsibilities.""
The inquiry was played a September 2017 telephone intercept where Maguire talks about concluding a land deal, and Berejiklian responds, ""I don't need to know about that bit"".
Berejiklian said Maguire was ""a big talker"" and she would often dismiss his talk of deals as fanciful.
Maguire boasted in one telephone intercept that he had met Chinese President Xi Jinping, an encounter which Berejiklian explained to the inquiry was among a group of 15 NSW politicians who lined up to greet Xi on his visit to Sydney in 2014.
In 2017, Maguire wrote to the board of China's biggest food producers, Bright Foods, to complain a delay in a deal with an Australian agribusiness UWE was ""causing loss of face for my political leaders"". 
Berejiklian said she had no knowledge of the letter and it was ""highly inappropriate"".

Maguire had sought to join a NSW government trade delegation to China in 2017 to lobby for the project, but had been rebuffed by Berejiklian's office, and told the delay would be raised in meetings.

China, which claims democratically ruled Taiwan as its own territory, has repeatedly denounced Taipei for offering support to Chinese-administered Hong Kong's protest movement, saying the forces of Taiwan and Hong Kong independence are colluding.
Taiwan says it has a duty to stand up for democracy and human rights. 
Late Sunday, Chinese state television showed a documentary detailing what it said was a confession by Morrison Lee, who was arrested by police in Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, last year, on suspicion of breaching national security laws.
State television said Lee had gone to Hong Kong to support the protesters, and had then gone to Shenzhen to secretly film Chinese paramilitary police. 
""I'm very sorry. I did many bad, wrong things in the past, perhaps harming the motherland and the country,"" Lee told the programme, dressed in prison garb. 
In Taipei, the Mainland Affairs Council labelled the show ""complete nonsense"".
""This is malicious political hyping up by the other side, entrapping one of our people into engaging in spying activities, deliberately damaging relations across the Taiwan Strait,"" it said.
China should stop trying to frame Taiwanese citizens, the council added, saying putting Lee on television was contrary to the legal process.
Rights groups and Western governments have expressed anger at China for previous instances where suspects have been put on state television to confess before their trials.
The spying accusations come as relations between Taipei and Beijing continue to nosedive, with China stepping up military drills near the island in recent weeks.

Taiwan says it will not provoke China or seek war, but that it will defend itself and stand up for its democratic way of life.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un watched tens of thousands of dancers, gymnasts and other performers in a large-scale celebration on Sunday of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party.
The party's newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, on Monday published a photograph of Kim, flanked by top aides at a long banqueting table, waving to the audience. 
State broadcaster KCNA said Kim was greeted by loud cheers as he made his entrance on Sunday for the ""Grand Mass Gymnastics and Artistic Performance, 'Great Guidance'.""
The event came a day after an unprecedented nighttime military parade, which showcased an unusually broad array of the country's new weapons.
North Korea revived the so-called Mass Games in 2018, following a five-year hiatus, to sell an image of international engagement and peace while raising much needed foreign currency.
Despite the name, the Mass Games are large performances involving tens of thousands of dancers, gymnasts, martial artists and singers acting out familiar propaganda themes.
The North Korea national flag and the Workers' Party flag were hoisted to musical numbers on Sunday including ""The Workers' Party Is Our Guide"" and ""Along the Road of Socialism"", KCNA reported.
The games are usually a major draw for tourists, most of them from China, but rights groups say the inclusion of thousands of child performers is tantamount to forced child labour, and testimony collected by defector groups describes harsh training regimes.
The games went ahead this year despite strict border controls and quarantine measures imposed to prevent an outbreak of the coronavirus. Analysts say that would be devastating for the economically and politically isolated country, which is yet to report any confirmed cases of COVID-19.
Kim and his official entourage were not wearing masks in the Rodong Sinmun photograph of Sunday's event, in contrast to the crowds of suited spectators in the large stadium behind them.

703,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2020 03:05PM ET</span>","Factbox: New Zealand parties clash over COVID-19, economy, taxes and housing","(Reuters) - New Zealand holds a general election on Oct. 17, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's centre-left Labour Party holding a wide lead over the centre-right main opposition National Party.
Below are the main issues in the election.
COVID-19
Ardern has called this a ""COVID election"" and focussed her campaign on her government's “go hard, go early” response to the outbreak, which has helped boost her popularity and make her an international celebrity.
New Zealand has reported 25 deaths from COVID-19 and around 1,500 infections after Ardern's swift response, far less than in other developed countries. That's about 0.05 death per 10,000 people, compared to the United States at 6.49 or India at 0.78, according to Reuters calculations.
New Zealand placed the most significant restrictions on public movements in modern history in the initial phase of the coronavirus outbreak by closing its borders, imposing self-isolation and shutting down most of its economy to contain the spread of the virus.
Labour says it would continue tight controls and quarantines and would strengthen the contact-tracing system.
National says it would establish a border protection agency within 100 days of forming a government to prevent future outbreaks. It blames Labour's border rules for allowing a recent flare-up in the country's largest city, Auckland. 
CLIMATE CHANGE
Ardern has said climate change is ""my generation's nuclear-free moment"". Labour vows to phase out single-use plastics and replace coal-fired boilers with electric alternatives, and says it would end the use of carbon by public buses by 2035.
It aims to create 11,000 jobs in regional New Zealand to restore the environment, including cleaning up waterways to allow safe swimming.
Ardern says she would accelerate New Zealand's target of 100% renewable electricity generation by five years to 2030, responding to criticism from opposition leader Judith ""Crusher"" Collins. 
Collins, leader of the National Party, says Ardern's policies would raise electricity bills 40% and cost thousands of jobs. 
Climate change, a key issue in the election, has pitted the parties against each other on policies on oil and gas exploration - National wants to lift a ban on exploration and seeks ""responsible mining"". 
ECONOMY 
The government, in which Labour is joined by the smaller New Zealand First party, announced in May a record NZ$50 billion ($30 billion) in spending to revive the pandemic-hit economy, saying it would help businesses hire at least 40,000 who had lost their jobs or seen their working hours reduced.
Labour promises to extend a loan scheme for small firms and invest more than NZ$300 million to help the unemployed find jobs.
National says it would provide companies NZ$10,000 for each new employee hired and pay higher-education and vocational training centres NZ$4,000 for every unemployed person they retrained.
TAXES
Ardern vows to raise individual income taxes on the top-earning 2% and plug loopholes for big foreign companies. No changes have been proposed for tax rates of companies and trusts but the individuals making over NZ$180,000 annually would pay 39%, up from 33%. 
National promises short-term tax cuts worth about NZ$4.7 billion to revive the economy. The party says its temporary tax relief would put more than NZ$3,000 – nearly NZ$50 a week – into the pockets of average earners over the next 16 months. 
Collins promises NZ$430 million in one-year tax incentives for businesses that invest more than NZ$150,000 on new equipment and machinery.
EDUCATION
Labour wants to invest NZ$600 million to raise wages of early childhood teachers and to boost funding for the most disadvantaged schools by NZ$320 million over the next four years. 
National would spend NZ$4.8 billion to build schools and colleges. It proposes a four-year NZ$1.9 billion package focussing on learning support and teacher aides.
HEALTH
Labour promises to double sick leave to 10 days a year with an additional NZ$200 million to be spent over four years to cut waiting lists for surgeries. An aged-care commissioner would be established as a watchdog over the sector.
National would spend NZ$800 million more on the health sector during its term and promises faster elective surgeries and more money for cancer treatments. 
HOUSING
Ardern says her government would create a NZ$350 million fund for residential housing plans and reform decades-old laws in the sector to speed up approvals.
She promises to deliver more homes, replace a 30-year-old law that limited cost increases for urban development, support first-home buyers with loans and introduce regulations for property-management services.
Collins promises to scrap that law which is blamed for high housing costs. She dismisses Ardern's housing plans as copying National's.

Collins vows to pass emergency laws - similar to those used to rebuild the city of Christchurch after a 2011 earthquake - to build homes and curb rising home prices.

LAGOS (Reuters) - The head of Nigeria's police dissolved its Special Anti-Robbery Squad with immediate effect on Sunday, a police statement said, prompted by days of protests across the country against alleged brutality by the controversial unit.
The protests broke out after a video circulated last week allegedly showing members of the unit - known as SARS - shooting dead a man in Delta state. It also prompted a globally-trending social media campaign to abolish the squad.
Demonstrators also alleged that police shot dead another man while marching in the southwestern city of Ogbomosho on Saturday. Police did not respond to requests for comment on the allegations.
""The dissolution of SARS is in response to the yearnings of the Nigerian people,"" the police statement said.
It added that the police was redeploying unit members and would announce a new strategy to tackle SARS' remit of fighting armed robbery, kidnapping and other violent crime.
Protesters and rights groups met the announcement with scepticism and calls for justice. Police officials and politicians have said they were disbanding or reforming SARS multiple times in recent years, with little visible change, critics say.
""They all need to be punished or disciplined,"" said Charles Avackaa, a Lagos media executive who alleged SARS officers have extorted 100,000 naira ($262.7) from him.
""But they mess up and (their bosses) carry them and put them somewhere else, there is nothing on how they operate,"" he said.
For years, Nigerians have accused SARS of heavy-handed methods, particularly the young, who say officers regularly target, beat and extort them.
An Amnesty International report in June documented 82 alleged cases of SARS mistreating, torturing and extra-judicially executing detainees.
On Sunday, Nigerian police used teargas to disperse hundreds of protesters in the capital Abuja, a repeat of what witnesses said were similar events on Friday.

The Tweet was mentioned by 12-times singles Grand Slam winner Billie Jean King who also reminded her followers that Evert and Navratilova had faced each other 80 times.
Navratilova also won 18 Grand Slam singles titles and beat Evert on 43 occasions as the pair dominated women's tennis in the 1970s and 1980s.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of serious violations and crimes against civilians, and Azerbaijan also said it had launched airstrikes as a day-old humanitarian ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh looked increasingly frayed on Sunday.
The Russian-brokered ceasefire, clinched after marathon talks in Moscow, was meant to halt fighting to allow ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azeri forces to swap prisoners and war dead.
The talks were the first diplomatic contact between the two since fighting over the mountainous enclave erupted on Sept. 27, killing hundreds of people. Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan, but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.
Both sides accused one another of breaking the ceasefire almost immediately, and Azerbaijan gave the impression in public comments from top officials that it saw it as only a brief and temporary breathing space anyway.
Azerbaijan, making the first claim of an attack since the truce, said on Sunday it had carried out airstrikes against an ethnic Armenian regiment, inflicting heavy losses. Reuters could not independently verify that claim. 
A spokesman for the leader of Nagorno-Karabakh told Reuters he did not have information about the alleged attack.
Earlier on Sunday, Azerbaijan accused Armenia of heavily shelling a residential area in Ganja, its second largest city, in the early hours of the morning, and of hitting an apartment building.
The Azeri Prosecutor General's Office said nine people had been killed and 34 wounded in the attack. Reuters could not independently verify Azeri assertions about the number of deaths or injuries.
A Reuters photographer in Ganja saw rescue workers carrying one dead person from the ruins of the apartment building on Sunday morning. The structure had been almost levelled. An excavator was clearing the debris.
Buildings and cars in the immediate vicinity had also been severely damaged. 
Baku says more than 40 civilians have been killed and 200 injured since the start of the conflict.
The Armenian defence ministry called the Azeri allegations about the attack on Ganja ""an absolute lie"" and accused Azerbaijan of continuing to shell populated areas inside Karabakh, including Stepanakert, the region's biggest city.
Reuters footage from Stepanakert showed a small brick house damaged by shelling, its windows shattered and its roof caved in. The Karabakh authorities said 429 servicemen had been killed since fighting erupted last month.
CONCERN OVER WIDER WAR
Azerbaijan accused Armenia of also launching an unsuccessful rocket attack on an Azeri hydro-electric power station in Mingachevir. Ethnic Armenian forces in Karabakh denied the assertion. 
Arayik Haratyunyan, the leader of ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, early on Sunday described the overall situation as relatively calm, but said he did not know how long it would last and that the frontline remained tense. 
He accused Azeri forces of trying to unsuccessfully take control of the town of Hadrut, and said the process of the two sides exchanging prisoners should have started on Sunday, but that it was unclear if and when that would happen. 
Renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu asked his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in a phone call on Sunday to press Armenia to abide by the terms of the truce, Turkey's foreign ministry said. 
Armenia's foreign minister was due in Moscow on Monday for talks with officials from the OSCE's Minsk group. 
The clashes have raised concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.

The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.

Boris Johnson is planning to talk directly to German Chancellor Angela Merkel as he seeks a breakthrough in Brexit trade negotiations with the European Union before a crucial summit this week.
The British prime minister has set a deadline of Oct. 15 for a deal to be struck -- or to be within reach -- on future trading terms with the EU, and he is stepping up his own involvement in the process in an effort to unblock negotiations.
On Saturday, Johnson spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and he is also preparing for a possible call with Merkel, according to a person familiar with the matter.
France Warns No Brexit Deal Better Than Bad One on Fisheries
If no clear deal is in sight by Thursday’s summit of EU leaders, the U.K. side has said it will be ready to call a halt to the negotiations on a free trade agreement and will instead focus efforts on preparing to exit the EU’s single market and customs union at the end of December without one.
That would revive the risk of damaging quotas and tariffs, raising costs and disruption to trade at the U.K. border. Even if no overarching trade agreement can be struck, both sides expect they would continue talking in preparation for the end of the Brexit transition period on Dec. 31.

Footage broadcast by VTV showed fishermen being rescued by coastguard and helicopters as strong winds battered the central Vietnamese coast in the central province of Quang Tri.
Floods have cut food supplies to thousands of people. Around 31,000 people have been displaced and more than 33,000 houses submerged and damaged by floods, according to a government report.
Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline. Natural disasters - predominantly floods and landslides triggered by storms - killed 132 people and injured 207 others in the country last year.

709,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Iraqi militias say they have halted anti-U.S. attacks,"By John Davison
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - An array of Iran-backed Iraqi militia groups have suspended rocket attacks on U.S. forces on condition that Iraq's government present a timetable for the withdrawal of American troops, one of the groups said on Sunday.
A spokesman for Kataib Hezbollah, one of the most powerful Iran-backed militia groups in Iraq, said the groups were presenting no set deadline, but that if U.S. troops ""insisted on staying"" they would unleash much more violent attacks.
Washington, which is slowly reducing its 5,000 troops in Iraq, threatened last month to shut its embassy unless the Iraqi government reins in Iran-aligned militias that have attacked U.S. interests with rockets and roadside bombs.
The U.S. warning caused alarm in Iraq, where it was seen as a step towards air strikes, potentially turning Iraq into a battleground in a proxy war between the United States and Iran. A broad array of politicians called on the militia to stop provoking the Americans.
""The factions have presented a conditional ceasefire,"" Kataib Hezbollah spokesman Mohammed Mohi told Reuters. ""It includes all factions of the (anti-U.S.) resistance, including those who have been targeting U.S. forces.""
On Saturday, militia groups calling themselves the ""Iraqi Resistance Coordination Commission"" published a statement suggesting they would suspend attacks in return for a clear plan for U.S. troops to leave. Mohi did not specify which groups had drafted the statement.
He said the Iraqi government must implement a parliamentary resolution in January calling for foreign troops to withdraw.
ROADSIDE BLAST
Iraq is one of the few countries with close ties to both the United States and Iran, both of which provided military support to help defeat Islamic State fighters, who were beaten back in a three-year war after seizing a third of Iraq in 2014.
Iraqis have long feared their country could become a proxy battleground, especially since Washington killed Tehran's military mastermind Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January.
Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an Iraqi leader of pro-Iran militias, was also killed. Factions that Soleimani and Muhandis commanded, including Kataib Hezbollah, swore to avenge them.
But pro-Iran militias have faced a popular backlash from Iraqis who accuse them of putting the country's security at risk by attacking the Americans.
Mohi said there was no deadline for the government to expel foreign troops, but ""if America insists on staying and doesn't respect the parliament's decision then the factions will use all the weapons at their disposal"".
He said rockets fired at U.S. forces and diplomatic compounds were a message, and worse attacks could follow.
U.S. officials blame Kataib Hezbollah for dozens of rocket attacks against U.S. installations in Iraq.
Kataib Hezbollah denies involvement, and some attacks have been claimed by smaller, little-known militias, though Iraqi officials believe these may be fronts for bigger groups.

A roadside blast hit a convoy in southern Iraq on Sunday delivering equipment to the U.S.-led military coalition in the country, damaging a tyre but causing no casualties, the military said. There was no claim of responsibility.

Footage published by local news outlets showed police officers wearing black balaclavas dragging protesters into unmarked black vans and beating protesters with their batons at a rally that drew thousands onto the streets of Minsk, the capital.
One sequence showed a police van unleashing a powerful jet of water from a cannon into crowds, visibly pushing them back. 
Belarus, a former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, has been rocked by street protests and strikes since authorities announced that veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko had won an Aug. 9 vote by a landslide. 
People have since taken to the streets every week to demand that Lukashenko step down and allow for a new election to be held. 
Lukashenko, a former collective farm manager who has been in power since 1994, denies his win was the result of cheating.
Security forces have detained more than 13,000 people during a post-election crackdown, some of whom have been later freed.
Lukashenko's key political opponents are either in jail or have fled abroad. 
Sunday's violence followed a meeting Lukashenko held on Saturday in a Minsk jail with detained opposition leaders, an unusual event that prompted some opposition activists to believe he was preparing to make concessions. 
Police in Minsk said on Sunday they had detained ""several dozen"" people. 
Russia's Interfax news agency reported that around 50 people had been detained and that police had used stun grenades to dispel demonstrators.
The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions against a string of senior officials in Belarus accused of fraud and human rights abuses in the wake of the presidential election.
Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who is now based in Lithuania, has called for new elections and for all political prisoners to be freed. 
""We will continue to march peacefully and persistently and demand what is ours: new free and transparent elections,"" Tsikhanouskaya wrote on her Telegram channel on Sunday. 

Similar rallies were held in other cities across the country on Sunday.

Polls suggested Akinci and Tatar would lead the vote and go to a runoff next Sunday, where measures would again be in place to curb the risk of coronavirus infection. 
With a population of 326,000, Northern Cyprus has reported 807 COVID-19 infections and four deaths. 
Cyprus was split in two after a 1974 Turkish invasion in response to a brief Greek-inspired coup. 
Akinci, 72, a career politician who won the presidency in 2015 in a second round with more than 60% of votes, supports reunification of the island. Tatar, 60, who has also served as finance minister, supports separate sovereign administrations.
Turkey recognises the Turkish Cypriot state in the north, but not the internationally-endorsed Greek Cypriot government on the other side of the divided island.
The latest United Nations-mediated peace negotiations failed in 2017 and there has been no progress in talks since.
On Thursday, Northern Cyprus reopened part of the beachfront of a resort abandoned for 46 years in a move that could hurt efforts to revive dispute settlement talks. 
Nicos Anastasiades, Cyprus's internationally recognised president, called the move ""illegal"".

As well as having an impact on inter-island talks, the result of North Cyprus' election may influence negotiations between Turkey and Greece over their contested maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean.

""It has been decided that this action would start from Tehran and will be extended to other large cities in the coming weeks,"" Namaki said in remarks carried by state television.
Meanwhile Iranian media reported that Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, had tested positive for COVID-19 but that ""his general condition is good and he continuously monitors the issues of the organization"".
On Saturday, Mohammad-Baqer Nobakht, a vice president in charge of economic planning, said he had tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Two other vice presidents had been infected earlier and at least two senior officials have died of COVID-19. 
The daily death toll from COVID-19 peaked at 239 this week in Iran, the worst hit country in the Middle East.
Masks have been compulsory in indoor public spaces since July. 
Schools, mosques, shops, restaurants and other public institutions in Tehran closed for a week on Oct. 3 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The city's governor extended the closure on Friday for another week.
The United States slapped fresh sanctions on Iran's financial sector on Thursday. Tehran has accused Washington of undermining its ability to pay for basic necessities during the pandemic.

Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen made the comments on Israeli Army Radio when asked about a Reuters report that Qatar had submitted a formal request to Washington to buy stealthy F-35 fighter jets.
Asked whether Israel would oppose such a sale, Cohen said: ""The answer is yes. Our security and military superiority in the region are the most significant things for us. Our region has still not turned into Switzerland.""
The Qatari request follows an August deal between the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates in which Washington agreed to consider giving the Gulf state approval to buy F-35s in a side deal to a U.S.-brokered agreement called the Abraham Accord to normalise diplomatic ties with Israel.

718,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 11, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>","Analysis: North Korea's Kim speaks softly, shows off new military might","By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's unprecedented nighttime military parade on Saturday showcased an unusually broad array of new weapons, from a show-stopping ""monster"" ballistic missile to previously unseen battle tanks.
The hardware, likely still in varying stages of development, offered leader Kim Jong Un a chance to show the world his cutting-edge military power while adding practical capabilities to the North Korea's already formidable nuclear and conventional forces, experts said.
Kim is walking a fine line, seeking to increase pressure on the United States to ease sanctions while not destroying rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump or Pyongyang's partners in China.
""Kim Jong Un’s speech was not threatening to the United States, instead labelling North Korea's nuclear forces as self-defensive,"" said Bruce Klingner, a retired CIA North Korea analyst now at the Heritage Foundation. ""The clear message was that, counter to U.S. claims, the North Korean nuclear threat has not been solved.""
Video from the parade suggested a huge intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) potentially more lethal either because of multiple warheads or a bigger payload, larger missile carriers, a next-generation submarine-launched missile, and advances in conventional weaponry, military analysts said.
MULTIPLE WARHEADS?
The star of Saturday's show was a massive, previously unseen ICBM carried on an equally huge ""transporter-erector-launcher"" (TEL) vehicle with 11 axles.
Estimated to be 25 to 26 metres (82 to 85 feet) long and 2.5 to 2.9 metres (8 to 9.5 feet) in diameter, the unidentified missile would be the largest road-mobile ICBM in the world, military analysts said.
Given that the Hwasong-15, the largest missile ever test-flown by North Korea, can already target anywhere in the United States, the most likely practical use for the new ICBM would be the ability to carry multiple warheads, said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.
It is much cheaper for North Korea to add warheads than for the United States to add interceptors, said Jeffrey Lewis, a missile researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).
""If each new North Korean ICBM can carry 3-4 warheads, we would need about 12-16 interceptors for each missile,"" he said on Twitter. ""The last time the U.S. bought 14 interceptors, it cost $1 billion."" 
Other analysts said the missile could simply be designed to carry a single, larger warhead.
""A bigger warhead doesn’t necessarily mean multiple warheads, a technology I believe North Korea has not secured yet,"" said Kim Dong-yup, a former South Korea Navy officer who is now a professor at Kyungnam University’s Far East Institute in Seoul.
MISSILE CARRIERS
Analysts said it was also notable that North Korea appeared to have built the huge new TELs to carry the new missiles.
""They have a very limited supply of long TELs they acquired from China,"" said another CNS researcher, Dave Schmerler, adding that the lack of vehicles has limited the number of ICBMs that could be deployed. ""So the longer TELs we saw were indigenously produced.""
But the massive size of the new missile and its carrier also has drawbacks, said Markus Schiller, a missile expert based in Europe.
""Only special roads and bridges could support this in fuelled condition,"" he said. ""No sane person would drive this ticking bomb through the North Korean countryside.""
It would likely take as much as a half a day to fuel such a large missile, making it difficult to quickly deploy in a war, meaning the missile's main purpose is likely a political warning, Schiller said.
SUBMARINE MISSILE
North Korea also unveiled what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), labelled the Pukguksong-4.
""If the new SLBM is intended to be deployed, it may be intended for the new conventionally powered ballistic missile submarine that North Korea hinted at building in July 2019,"" analysts at 38 North, a U.S.-based think tank, said in a report.
At least some parts of the missile’s motor case appeared to be filament-wound, which would reduce the missile’s structure weight and allow greater range and payload capability, the report said.
CONVENTIONAL WEAPONS
The parade featured what appeared to be new or updated weapons for North Korea's conventional military, one of the largest in the world.
The North displayed rows upon rows of multiple launch rocket systems and short-range ballistic missiles that were heavily tested over the past year.
""My biggest concern was the solid-fuel, short-range tactical missiles that North Korea had focused on developing over the past year or so,"" said Chun Yung-woo, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator.

The parade also displayed new mobile air-defence radar vehicles and what appeared to be an entirely new tank with anti-tank missiles and smoke grenade launchers more closely integrated into the design than previous imported models.

""Violent attack last night on the police station of Champigny with mortar shots and various projectiles. No police officer was injured,"" the Paris police headquarters said on Twitter.
The police posted a video showing a barrage of fireworks going off in the direction of the police station in Champigny-sur-Marne, about 15 km (nine miles) southeast of central Paris. The armed people attempted to force entry into the station, but failed to do so.
Nobody was arrested, but images showed smashed windows at the police station and damaged cars. 
The motive for the attack, the third on this police station in two years, was not immediately clear. The police station is located in a housing estate area known for drug trafficking and deemed by authorities as a high-priority district for order to be restored. 
""It was an organised attack of about 40 people who wanted to do battle,"" Champigny Mayor Laurent Jeanne told BFM. ""For a few days it has been tense with people who have a certain willingness to do battle with the police. It's anti-police sentiment. We weren't far off from a disaster.""
A spate of public safety incidents across France since the end of the COVID-19 lockdown in mid-May has put the government on heightened alert for increases in crime amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
President Emmanuel Macron, who faces a presidential election in less than two years, has been criticised by opponents over crime and public safety since he took power in 2017 and opinion polls show that the public see his government as weakest on those issues.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea urged the North on Sunday to stick to agreements that bar armed clashes between the neighbours, in comments made a day after North Korea unveiled new strategic and tactical weapons at a predawn military parade. 
The massive parade on the 75th anniversary of the founding of the North's ruling Workers' Party showed off new weapons, including an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).
South Korea's presidential Blue House said it held an emergency meeting of the National Security Council to discuss the weapons and a speech by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
""We emphasised various agreements made between the South and the North to prevent armed conflicts and war,"" it said in a statement.
Although Kim vowed in his speech to continue building his military might, he said he hoped the neighbours would hold hands again after the end of the coronavirus pandemic. 
The parade and speech came as the neighbours are at odds over the killing last month of a South Korean fisheries official by the North's troops after he went missing, an incident that shocked and enraged many in the South.
Seoul called for a joint investigation after finding that the soldiers killed the man and set him on fire, though Pyongyang said they just burned a flotation device he was using. 
On Sunday, the Blue House urged the North to respond its request for investigation. 
In a separate statement, Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles cross-border affairs, said Kim's speech would lead to peace and better ties, and expressed hopes for a resumption of dialogue on issues such as the shooting incident, cooperation over virus response and humanitarian aid. 
The defence ministry expressed concerns about the North's newly unveiled weapons, however, saying it would conduct detailed analysis with the United States.

The UAE and its Arab allies have imposed a boycott on Qatar since mid-2017 and had demanded that Doha close a Turkish military base, among their conditions for ending the rift. Abu Dhabi and Ankara also back opposing sides in Libya's conflict. 
""The Turkish military presence in the Arab Gulf is an emergency,"" Anwar Gargash, the UAE's state minister for foreign affairs, said on Twitter on Saturday.
""It reinforces polarisation, and it does not take into account the sovereignty of states and the interests of the Gulf countries and its people.""
The United States, seeking a united Gulf front against Iran, has tried to resolve the row in which Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and non-Gulf Egypt severed political, trade and travel links with Qatar over accusations that it backs militants and is cosying up to regional foe Iran. 
Doha, which hosts the region's largest U.S. military base, denies the accusations and says the boycott aims to impinge on its sovereignty.
On Sept. 9, the State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East, David Schenker, said there may be some progress in resolving the rift within weeks, citing signs of ""flexibility in negotiations"", ahead of U.S. elections.
Diplomats and Gulf sources have confirmed talks between Riyadh and Doha after negotiations that broke down early this year, but there have been no signs yet of a breakthrough.
In a recent documentary on Al Jazeera television, Qatar's state minister for defence accused boycotting nations of having planned to invade Qatar, a charge they have denied in the past.Riyadh's former intelligence chief, in televised remarks this month, described Qatar as a ""tick on a camel"".

Polls show Ardern's Labour Party is expected to win the election with a wide lead over the conservative National Party, and could form government in a coalition with the Greens and New Zealand First.
""While there was no playbook for COVID-19, we went hard and early and committed to a strategy of elimination which has meant that when we've had new cases, we've circled and stamped them out and opened up our economy faster than others,"" Ardern told a campaign rally in the capital Wellington.

(Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed on the phone the issue of two Canadian citizens detained in China since late 2018 and to whom China granted rare consular access on Friday and Saturday, the Canadian government said.
Dominic Barton, Canada's Ambassador to China, was granted virtual consular access to Michael Spavor, a businessman, on Friday and to Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat, on Saturday, the Canadian government said.
""The Canadian government remains deeply concerned by the arbitrary detention by Chinese authorities of these two Canadians since December 2018 and continues to call for their immediate release,"" Global Affairs Canada, which manages the government's diplomatic and consular relations, said.
Trudeau thanked Trump in a phone call on Saturday for the United States' support in ""seeking the immediate release of the two Canadian citizens arbitrarily detained by China,"" the prime minister's office said in a readout statement of the call.
The statements did not give more information. The White House had no immediate comment on further details about the call.
China arrested Canadian citizens Kovrig and Spavor in late 2018 and later charged them with espionage. Their arrests had come soon after Canada had arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, on a U.S. warrant. 
The relations between Canada and China have since been tense. 
The United States' own tensions with China have also increased recently over the handling of the coronavirus outbreak, the ongoing trade war between the two countries, China's imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong and the subsequent end to Hong Kong's special status under U.S. law by Trump.
The Trump administration has restricted technology exports to Chinese companies, notably Huawei, citing national security risks. The company has denied such charges.

LAKE CHARLES, La. (Reuters) - Weary residents of coastal Louisiana began cleaning up on Saturday from wind and water damage inflicted by Hurricane Delta to their already storm-battered region, even as it weakened and moved northeast.
Delta made landfall near the town of Creole in Cameron Parish early Friday evening as a Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale, packing sustained winds of 100 miles per hour.
Though not as powerful as August's Hurricane Laura, a Category 4 storm that tore homes and businesses apart, Delta toppled trees and power poles, leaving hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast residents without power. 
The storm weakened to a tropical depression as it moved inland to western Mississippi, according to the National Hurricane Center, but still carried heavy rains. 
Sylvia Pastrano, 65, said the roof of her Lake Charles, Louisiana home leaked from Delta's rains after being initially damaged by Laura. She positioned three trash cans over her bed to catch the water. 
""We were debating whether to leave or not but my husband has got orthopedic issues and I do too and we're just too exhausted to even get up and evacuate,"" Pastrano said. ""Last night it was terrifying, the whistling and whistling.""
Delta brought widespread flooding of streets and riverbanks, mostly in southwestern Louisiana, tracking the path of destruction left by Laura but causing damage over a larger swath of the Gulf Coast.
""Even if it wasn't quite as powerful as Hurricane Laura, it was much bigger,"" Governor John Bel Edwards told a briefing in Baton Rouge.
Some 3,000 National Guard troops had been called up to distribute relief supplies, clear roads, maintain security and conduct search and rescue operations, the governor said.
600,000 WITHOUT POWER
While no deaths have so far been linked to Delta, Edwards said storm-related fatalities often occur in accidents such as falls, during clean-up operations, or from carbon monoxide poisoning from residents using home generators.
About 600,000 of the state's electric customers, 25% of the total, were without power at midday, Edwards said. But restoration was progressing faster than it did after Laura because Delta's winds were less damaging to the infrastructure, he said.
Laura's winds damaged tens of thousands of homes, leaving roofs across the region dotted with blue tarpaulins. More than 6,000 people were still living temporarily in hotels when Delta struck.
Delta spared many of the rooftop tarps that were still up, but deluged some streets and littered others with downed trees and branches.
""Laura was much worse,"" said Lake Charles resident Matthew Williams (NYSE:WMB), 49. ""This was more rain than wind.""
Williams, who had just gotten his power back about a week and a half ago after the outage left by Laura, said he rode out the storm at his home.
With the sun shining brightly, Frederick Hannie, 35, surveyed the water damage to his gym, CrossFit Lake Charles, which had already sustained wind and roof damage from Laura.
Between two hurricanes and the coronavirus pandemic, Hannie said, ""it definitely takes a little financial gymnastics"" to run a business this year.
As Delta made its way over the Gulf of Mexico on Friday, energy companies cut back U.S. oil production by about 92%, or 1.7 million barrels per day - the most since 2005's Hurricane Katrina.
While the storm is expected to continue weakening, it is forecast to bring rain though Tennessee, Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley through early next week. 

Delta was the tenth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season to make U.S. landfall this year, eclipsing a record dating to 1916.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuanians will be encouraged to bring their own pens to minimize infection risk at Sunday's parliamentary election seen as a vote of confidence on Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis' handling of the coronavirus crisis. 
The centrist Farmers and Greens party, an agrarian grouping that leads Skvernelis' ruling coalition, is neck-and-neck in opinion polls with the centre-right Homeland Union, which has roots in the 1980s anti-Soviet independence movement.
With support roughly 15% for both, and 15 other parties on the ballot, another coalition is inevitable but its makeup uncertain. 
Many in the Baltic Sea state of less than 3 million are aggrieved at income inequality despite brisk economic growth since Lithuania joined the European Union in 2004.
A fifth of people were at risk of poverty in 2019, mostly the elderly, which was the same figure as a decade ago, according to the state statistics authority. 
However, Lithuania's relative resistance to the economic impact of coronavirus curbs has helped compensate a previous slump in support for the government over corruption allegations.
The economy decreased 4% year-on-year in the second quarter of 2020, the second best result in the EU. The central bank attributed that to a prompt and short lockdown, generous state support and relatively unaffected trading partners.
DRIVE-THROUGH VOTING
Lithuania has reported 8,714 infections - including a record 205 new cases on Saturday - and 103 deaths.
Mindful of contagion, election officials have asked voters to mark ballots with their own pens. 
For early voting this week, they also set up a drive-through centre and booths in public squares. Teams in protective costumes have been visiting the 32,000 voters self-isolating at home to collect their ballot.
Many Lithuanians are keenly watching the government and President Gitanas Nauseda's response to a crackdown on anti-government protests by neighbouring Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko following a disputed election.
Lithuania, and neighbours Latvia and Estonia, were the first EU members to impose sanctions on Lukashenko.
Vilnius has also given shelter to opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who fled her homeland after the Aug. 9 ballot her supporters say was rigged.
Under Lithuania's hybrid election system, half of the 141-member parliament will be elected on Sunday in a proportional vote. The remaining lawmakers are elected in constituencies, with a run-off vote for the top two candidates in each of them scheduled on Oct. 25.

Results are expected around 2100 GMT on Sunday.

Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh revealed the meeting in a Twitter posting but gave no details.
Lauder, a U.S. businessman who also met Abbas a year ago in New York, attended the Sept. 15 White House signing ceremony of an agreement between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain to forge formal ties. 
He told Saudi newspaper Arab News on Sept. 16 that he hoped the accord would bring the Palestinians and Israel back to peace talks, which collapsed in 2014.
The World Jewish Congress said in a statement that Lauder met the Palestinian leader on Saturday ""for a private visit at Abbas’ invitation, to discuss a range of issues regarding Palestine and the Middle East.""
In Washington, a person familiar with the matter said Lauder's visit was not coordinated with or on behalf of the Trump administration but was in a strictly private capacity.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Palestinians have cut off diplomatic ties with the Trump administration, which they have long accused of pro-Israel bias, and spurned the Gulf states' diplomatic moves with Israel. 

A Palestinian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Lauder was not carrying a message from the White House. A second Palestinian source said Abbas discussed the call he made at the United Nations last month for a U.N.-led peace conference early next year.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government has formally asked Pope Francis for the temporary return of several ancient indigenous manuscripts held in the Vatican library ahead of next year's 500-year anniversary of the Spanish conquest of Mexico.
The request to allow the texts to be exhibited in Mexico was made in a two-page letter addressed to Pope Francis and posted on President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's Twitter page on Saturday but dated Oct. 2.
It was delivered to the pope by Lopez Obrador's wife, Beatriz Gutierrez Muller, who met with him at the Vatican following a meeting she had on Friday with Italian President Sergio Mattarella.
One of the three codicies, or books, requested is the Codex Borgia, an especially colorful screen-fold book spread across dozens of pages that depicts gods and rituals from ancient central Mexico.
It is one of the best-preserved examples of pre-conquest Aztec-style writing that exists, after Catholic authorities in colonial-era Mexico dismissed such codicies as the work of the devil and ordered hundreds or even thousands of them burned in the decades following the 1521 conquest.
In the letter, Lopez Obrador requests the Vatican return the Codex Borgia, two other ancient codicies as well as its maps of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan for a one-year loan in 2021.
The nationalist president is planning a series of events to commemorate the anniversary next year. He also reiterated his request that the Catholic Church, as well as reigning Spanish King Philip VI, apologize for atrocities that were committed following the conquest of Mexico, which Lopez Obrador said would mark an ""act of historic contrition."" 
The Vatican has not yet responded to the request, but its museums and archives have in the past lent out various manuscripts and works of art after similar requests from other countries.

DUSHANBE (Reuters) - Tajikistan's Russian-allied President Imomali Rakhmon looks sure to secure a fifth term in office in Sunday's election as his four competitors' campaigns admit they do not expect many votes.
However, the presidential poll may attract more attention this time after recent elections in two other ex-Soviet republics - Belarus and Kyrgyzstan - sparked protests, adding to a belt of instability around Russia.
Rakhmon, 68, has run the Persian-speaking nation of 9.5 million people since 1992, a period including a civil war. He has gradually strengthened his grip and a 2016 constitutional reform removed a limit on the number of terms he could serve.
Many in the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation expect Rakhmon, who has nine children, to push for his son Rustam Emomali to succeed him. Emomali is both mayor of the capital city, Dushanbe, and speaker of the upper house of parliament.
All four competitors are members of the docile lower house of parliament and have avoided criticising Rakhmon, whose official title is ""Founder of Peace and National Unity - Leader of the Nation.""
Though they say they are in the race to win, their campaign staff privately admit they have little chance of garnering any significant vote count. 
OPPOSITION BOYCOTT
The biggest remaining opposition force, the Social Democratic party, is boycotting the election in protest at laws which it says tilt the playing field to ensure the dominance of Rakhmon's People's Democratic Party.
Though Tajikistan's economy has been growing 6% or more for the last decade, the coronavirus pandemic has taken the edge off that, with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development predicting a 1.0% contraction this year, the first in 23 years.
Tajikistan has reported 10,180 COVID-19 cases with 79 deaths and chose not to introduce a hard lockdown like some neighbours.
In addition to hosting Russia's biggest military base abroad, Tajikistan has close economic ties with its former Soviet overlord as hundreds of thousands of Tajiks work in Russia to support families at home.
China is another major donor, investor and creditor of the mountainous Central Asian nation whose main resource is abundant water supply which can be used to generate cheap power.

Tajikistan signed a $3.9 billion contract with Italy's Salini Impregilo in 2016 to build the Rogun hydroelectric power plant featuring a 335-metre-high rockfill dam, the tallest in the world, on the Vakhsh River.

""In the IAEA we do not talk about breakout time. We look at the significant quantity, the minimum amount of enriched uranium or plutonium needed to make an atomic bomb. Iran does not have this significant quantity at the moment.""
Iran denies ever having had a nuclear weapons programme, saying its nuclear programme is purely for energy purposes.
The IAEA defines ""significant quantity"" as the approximate amount of nuclear material for which the possibility of manufacturing a nuclear explosive device cannot be excluded.
The most recent quarterly IAEA report on Iran last month said it had 2,105.4 kg of enriched uranium, far above the 202.8 kg limit in a 2015 deal with big powers but a fraction of the enriched uranium it had before the accord.

It is also enriching to up to 4.5% purity, far below the 20% it achieved before the deal and the 90% that is considered weapons-grade.

In a photo published by a pro-Lukashenko channel on Telegram and cited by Belta on its website, Lukashenko and eleven casually-dressed people are seen sitting at a round table decorated with flowers.
Opposition politician Viktor Babariko, who was barred from running for president in August's disputed election and detained in July along with his son, was seen on the picture to the left of Lukashenko in the photo.
A spokesman for Babariko's team, Gleb German, said he believed the picture was authentic but he did not know the reason for the meeting.
""Everyone is processing this information now,"" he said.
All people at the table apart from the president had a name card in front of them. The only woman seen at the table was a member of opposition coordination council, lawyer Lilia Vlasova, who was detained in late August.
Belarus has seen two months of protests since a contested Aug. 9 presidential election, in which Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory. His opponents say it was rigged to hand him a sixth term in power.
More than 13,000 people have been arrested and some later freed, while major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled in a crackdown that began even before the election was held.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the picture.
At the meeting, Lukashenko spoke about his proposed changes to the Belarusian constitution, according to Belta.

""The constitution can't be written in the street,"" the agency quoted the president as saying.

BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov strengthened his grip on power on Saturday, reshuffling top security officials as his principal opponent, ex-president Almazbek Atambayev, was detained again just days after leaving prison.
Jeenbekov's allies in parliament elected a new prime minister, moving to impose order on what close ally Russia has called a state of political chaos a day after the president deployed troops in and around the capital Bishkek.
Kyrgyzstan, a Сentral Asian nation that hosts a Russian military airbase and is a hub for trade with neighbouring China, has been gripped by unrest since Oct. 4, the date of a contested election that was subsequently annulled.
On Saturday night Bishkek was calm, as a state of emergency declared by Jeenbekov and incorporating a ban on public rallies and a curfew took effect.
Lawmakers earlier voted in the only candidate for premier, 51-year-old Sadyr Zhaparov, who some opposition factions accused of being in league with the president.
There was no immediate reaction from Russia to his appointment.
Jeenbekov had on Friday instructed troops to re-establish order amid flare-ups of violence, and military checkpoints were put up overnight around Bishkek while personnel carriers patrolled the city.
He also sacked top security council officials who had either supported his opponents or failed to intervene when the opposition said on Tuesday it was seizing power.
More than 1,200 people have been injured and one person has been killed, according to health ministry figures, in clashes that erupted on Monday following the election, in which establishment parties had claimed a landslide victory.
With the parliament building ransacked by protesters, lawmakers gathered on Saturday in the presidential residence on the outskirts of Bishkek to vote in Zhaparov.
He previously served as adviser to another former president, Kurmanbek Bakiyev, who was succeeded by Atambayev in 2011.
Atambayev's supporters had on Tuesday secured his release from prison, where he was serving a lengthy sentence for corruption, and said he survived an assassination attempt on Friday.
The state security service said it had rearrested Atambayev on charges of inciting unrest. The ex-president is Jeenbekov's former patron and now his arch-enemy. Among others detained on Saturday was former deputy interior minister Kursan Asanov, who had assumed leadership of the ministry when the unrest began.
Prior to his appointment as premier, Zhaparov called for constitutional reforms before fresh presidential and parliamentary elections.
He told parliament that Jeenbekov had reaffirmed to him his intention to resign once a new cabinet was approved.
Before parliament voted on Zhaparov's candidacy, speaker Myktybek Abdyldayev resigned, meaning Zhaparov would also assume presidential powers if Jeenbekov stepped down.
Zhaparov's supporters had clashed on Friday with followers of a few other parties which nominated their own candidate for PM, Omurbek Babanov.
Kyrgyzstan's opposition is divided between 11 parties that represent clan interests. Two of its presidents have been toppled by popular revolts since 2005.

The former Soviet republic, which has a population of just 6.5 million, is also home to a large Canadian-owned mining operation.

Following an annual summit in Guarda, Portugal, the prime ministers of both countries said a new identity card would allow people working on the other side of the border to access health services there.
The measures are aimed at helping 1.6 million Portuguese and 3.4 Spanish inhabitants along the border, which comprises some of the poorest districts in both countries.
At a press conference after the summit, Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Costa said ambulance services would operate across both countries so that patients could be served by the nearest vehicle, whether from Portugal or Spain.
Other measures expected include bilingual schools and a joint centre for combating fires. A full package will be announced by the end of the day on Saturday.
The border has remained open to workers and transport of goods between mid-March to July 1, despite the coronarivus pandemic. But it was closed to tourists, hurting local businesses reliant on tourism. [L8N2E826K]

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Thousands of opposition supporters rallied in the Ivory Coast's commercial capital on Saturday to protest against President Alassane Ouattara's plan to seek a third term in the Oct. 31 presidential election.
By early afternoon around 20,000 people had packed a 35,000 capacity stadium in Abidjan, chanting and dancing. Some held banners saying ""The people say no to an illegal third term."" 
Ouattara announced in August that he will seek another term following the sudden death of his handpicked successor.
The constitutional council has cleared him and three other candidates to run, but the opposition says Ouattara is violating the constitution by seeking another term and has called for a civil disobedience campaign. 
The 78-year old president, in power for a decade, says a 2016 constitutional change means his two-term limit has been reset.
Over a dozen people have been killed in violent protests, sparking memories of 2010-11, when 3,000 people died in the civil war following a disputed election that Ouattara won. Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producing nation.
""My advice to President Ouattara is that Ivorians should sit down to discuss. We want peace. We don't want war,"" Eve Botti, a supporter of the FPI opposition party, told Reuters at the rally.
Sie Coulibaly, a supporter of former rebel leader Guillaume Soro, whose candidacy was rejected, said he came to the rally to say no to Ouattara's third term. Soro is in exile in France.
The opposition has called for the election to be postponed, but have stopped short of saying they will boycott the poll, while the ruling party has said the election will take place regardless of whether they participate.

Campaigning is expected to start on Oct. 15.

The Swedish 17-year-old said in a tweet that she never engages in party politics, but that ""the upcoming US elections is above and beyond all that"".
""From a climate perspective it's very far from enough and many of you of course supported other candidates. But, I mean…you know…damn! Just get organized and get everyone to vote #Biden,"" she wrote.
Thunberg, who sparked a global climate protest movement after striking outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, could encourage participation among younger voters who are typically less likely to vote than older Americans.
After Thunberg was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year in 2019, U.S President Donald Trump mocked the teen activist, tweeting she needed to ""work on her anger management problem, then go to a good old fashioned movie with a friend"".
Trump also sarcastically commented on Thunberg's speech to a United Nations climate summit last year, in which she angrily denounced world leaders for failing to tackle climate change by demanding: ""How dare you?"".
Thunberg and the Fridays for Future movement was nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize, which on Friday was awarded to The United Nations' World Food Programme.
Trump, a Republican, has focused on dismantling former President Barack Obama's climate agenda to free the energy and auto industries from the costs of regulations meant to protect health and the environment, while Biden has a focus on a new massive green infrastructure.

The training drill, dubbed Cooperation 2020 and attended by President Aleksandar Vucic and other dignitaries, underlined Serbia's close military ties with Beijing and Moscow. 
In recent years, Belgrade has accelerated defence spending as it seeks dominance in the Western Balkans. 
Its military budget rose to around $1.14 billion in 2020 and 2019 - 43% more than in 2018. This year's military spending represented about 2.4 percent of gross domestic product.
""We are strengthening our army to deter any aggressor, we have no intention to wage any ... conflicts,"" Vucic told reporters after the exercise. 
For the first time, Serbia demonstrated the use of CH-92A combat drones, the first such deployment of Chinese unmanned aerial vehicles in Europe. It received six such drones in June. 
Beijing sees Serbia as part of its Belt and Road Initiative, aimed at opening new foreign trade links for Chinese companies that have invested billions of euros, mainly in soft loans for infrastructure and energy projects.
For Saturday's exercise, the Serbian military deployed over 40 aircraft, around 150 vehicles including tanks and armoured personnel carriers, and some 2,800 troops. 
The Serbian military is loosely based on former Soviet technology and in recent years Belgrade has procured MiG-29 fighter jets and other weapons from Russia, including the Mi-35 helicopter gunships and Pantsir air defence system shown on Saturday. 
Serbia, which is a European Union membership candidate, declared military neutrality in 2006. It joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program, though it does not seek full membership in the Western defence alliance.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea unveiled previously unseen intercontinental ballistic missiles at an unprecedented predawn military parade on Saturday that showcased the country's long-range weapons for the first time in two years.
Analysts said the missile, which was shown on a transporter vehicle with 11 axles, would be one of the largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in the world if it becomes operational. 
""This missile is a monster,"" said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.
Also displayed were the Hwasong-15, which is the longest-range missile ever tested by North Korea, and what appeared to be a new submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM).
Ahead of the parade, which was held to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of its ruling Workers' Party, officials in South Korea and the United States said Kim Jong Un could use the event to unveil a new ""strategic weapon"" as promised earlier this year.
A senior U.S. administration official called the display of the ICBM ""disappointing"" and called on the government to negotiate to achieve a complete denuclearisation.
The parade featured North Korea's ballistic missiles for the first time since Kim began meeting with international leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, in 2018. 
""We will continue to build our national defence power and self-defensive war deterrence,"" Kim said, but vowed that the country's military power would not be used preemptively. He made no direct mention of the United States or the now-stalled denuclearisation talks.
Kim blamed international sanctions, typhoons, and the coronavirus for preventing him from delivering on promises of economic progress.
""I am ashamed that I have never been able to repay you properly for your enormous trust,"" he said. ""My efforts and devotion were not sufficient to bring our people out of difficult livelihoods."" 
The video showed Kim make an appearance as a clock struck midnight. Dressed in a grey suit and tie, he waved to the crowd and accepted flowers from children while surrounded by military officials in Pyongyang's recently renovated Kim Il Sung Square. 
Kim spoke for nearly half an hour, often visibly sweating despite the cool morning air, shedding tears when thanking the troops, and smiling and laughing as he watched the missiles.
The parade was highly choreographed, with thousands of troops marching in formation, displays of new conventional military equipment including tanks, and fighter jets launching flares and fireworks.
Experts said that the new, larger ICBM is likely designed to carry multiple independent reentry vehicles (MIRVs), allowing it to attack more targets and making interception more difficult.
The new ICBM is likely intended to dispel doubts about North Korea's ability to strike the continental United States, and an implicit threat that they are preparing to test the larger missile, said Markus Garlauskas, a former U.S. intelligence officer for North Korea.
""If the Hwasong-15 could carry a 'super-large' nuclear warhead to anywhere in the U.S., then the natural question is what can this larger missile carry?,"" he said.
CORONAVIRUS MEASURES 
Kim became visibly emotional as he thanked the troops for their sacrifice in responding to natural disasters and preventing a corovonavirus outbreak. 
He said he was grateful that not a single North Korean had tested positive for the disease, an assertion that South Korea and the United States have previously questioned. 
While attendees at other celebratory events were shown wearing masks, no one at the parade appeared to be wearing them.
Kim said he hoped that North and South Korea would join hands again when the global coronavirus crisis is over. 
South Korean officials said this week that Kim could use the event as a ""low intensity"" show of power ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Nov. 3, as denuclearisation talks with Washington have stalled.

In a congratulatory message to Kim for the anniversary, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he intended to ""defend, consolidate and develop"" ties with North Korea, its state media said on Saturday.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's far-right Vox party said it would lodge a court appeal against a partial lockdown imposed on Madrid, as thousands of police on Saturday enforced curbs intended to contain one of Europe's worst coronavirus outbreaks.
Vox leader Santiago Abascal also called for demonstrations against the restrictions, implemented on Friday by the government via a state of emergency.
""I have given instructions to appeal to the Constitutional Court (against) the illegal state of emergency,"" he tweeted late on Friday.
Abascal's move escalates a standoff between Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and the conservative-led Madrid regional government, on which Vox holds 12 of 132 seats, and which argues that the government's curbs are illegal and excessive and will spell disaster for the local economy.
The restrictions include a ban on leaving locked-down areas other than for work, school or medical reasons. Around 7,000 police were deployed on roads, rail stations and at airports to make sure 3.8 million people affected in the capital city and eight satellite towns abided by them, the interior ministry said. 
The regional authorities, which support localised lockdowns, imposed less stringent curbs on Saturday on four satellite towns after infection rates there rose.
The government said rising infection rates across Madrid meant it was essential to lock down the entire city. 
Some residents felt anger over the political bickering. 
""I feel frustrated, deceived, I feel afraid because I see that we are in the middle of political disputes that lead nowhere,"" Miguel Angel, 63, a Madrid resident, said. 
The Madrid region had 723 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the two weeks to Oct. 8, according to the World Health Organization, making it Europe's second densest cluster after Andorra.

Spain said on Friday it had recorded 861,112 coronavirus cases - the highest number in Western Europe - and 32,929 deaths.

The daily death toll from COVID-19 reached a record of 239 this week in Iran, the worst hit country in the Middle East.
On Saturday, the Health Ministry reported 195 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking the total toll to 28,293. There were 3,875 new cases, ministry spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari told state TV. 
Masks have been compulsory in indoor public spaces since July, although no penalties were imposed. Now they are mandatory in public both indoors and outdoors in the capital Tehran.
Rouhani said in televised remarks that anyone caught without a mask would be fined 500,000 rials and those infected with the coronavirus who do not self-quarantine or inform friends and colleagues of their illness would be fined 2 million rials.
The Iranian rial fell to a new low against the U.S. dollar on Saturday as the country reels from the coronavirus pandemic and U.S. sanctions. The dollar was selling for as much as 304,300 rials on the unofficial market, up from 295,949 on Friday, according to foreign exchange site Bonbast.com.
The United States slapped fresh sanctions on Iran's financial sector on Thursday. Tehran has accused Washington of undermining its ability to pay for basic necessities during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Schools, mosques, shops, restaurants and other public institutions in Tehran closed for a week on Oct. 3 in an effort to curb the spread of the virus. The city's governor extended the closure on Friday for another week.

LANYARIS, South Sudan (Reuters) - By the time the waters started rising, ethnic violence had already forced South Sudanese mother Vorgol Poulo, her husband, and their seven children to flee their home twice this year. 
They were desperate to stay home when the rains began in July but ten days of heavy rainfall destroyed most of their possessions, forcing them out for a third time. 
""The cows are sick. We have lost so many, we don't know the number,"" said Pulo, who sold charcoal before flooding put most of the market under water.
She spoke to Reuters on a patch of grass poking above standing water, near the remote town of Pibor as thin cows limped by. 
The family cannot afford plastic sheeting for shelter or firewood, she said. Like most people in the area, they now eat once a day. 
The worst rains in living memory have forced nearly 370,000 people to flee their homes since July, and roughly half of South Sudan's 78 counties have large swathes of land underwater, the U.N. says. 
Scientists attribute the unusual rains to cyclical weather pattern that has been exacerbated by climate change.
Oil-rich South Sudan was already reeling from five years of civil war, which ended in 2018 with a fragile peace deal. Attacks by bandits, ethnic militias and hold out groups are still common. 
Nurse Regina Ngachan cannot say which is worse: the rainy season, which floods her home, or the dry season, which brings violence. 
Standing barefoot in a half metre of water outside her thatched roof hut in Pibor this week, she said she is struggling to help her sister and her five children, who fled the nearby village of Gumuruk after fighting broke out. 
""They came with empty hands,"" she said.
Twelve months of cycling between flooding and violence have left communities desperately needing food, shelter, and water, said Joshua Rosenstein, Pibor field coordinator for the aid group Doctors Without Borders. The town is also seeing a spike in measles and malaria cases, he said.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other of swiftly violating the terms of a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh on Saturday, raising questions about how meaningful the truce, brokered by Russia, would turn out to be.
The ceasefire, clinched after marathon talks in Moscow advocated by President Vladimir Putin, was meant to halt fighting to allow ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh and Azeri forces to swap prisoners and war dead.
But within minutes of the truce taking effect from midday, both sides accused each other of breaking it. 
The Armenian defence ministry accused Azerbaijan of shelling a settlement inside Armenia, while ethnic Armenian forces in Karabakh alleged that Azeri forces had launched a new offensive five minutes after the truce took hold.
Azerbaijan said enemy forces in Karabakh were shelling Azeri territory. Both sides have consistently denied each others' assertions about military activity.
In a statement which suggested the ceasefire was not completely dead however, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said the warring parties were now engaged in trying to find a political settlement. 
The Moscow ceasefire talks were the first diplomatic contact between the two since fighting over the mountainous enclave erupted on Sept. 27, killing hundreds of people. The enclave is internationally-recognised as part of Azerbaijan but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, who helped mediate, said in a statement in the early hours of Saturday after more than 10 hours of negotiations that the ceasefire had been agreed on humanitarian grounds.
The International Committee of the Red Cross would help make the truce work, he said.
""The specific terms of the ceasefire still need to be agreed,"" said Lavrov, who said Armenia and Azerbaijan had also agreed to enter into what he called substantive peace talks. 
Those talks would be held under the auspices of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group, he said. 
ARMENIA PRAISES PUTIN
Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan and his Azeri counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov did not speak to reporters in Moscow after striking the ceasefire deal.
But Mnatsakanyan later paid tribute on Armenian state TV to President Putin, whom he said had played a key role in making sure the talks happened and had personally intervened to help get an agreement.
Turkey, which has strongly backed Baku, welcomed the deal but said much more was needed.
""The humanitarian ceasefire is a significant first step but will not stand for a lasting solution,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. 
""Turkey emphasized that it will support any solution approved by Azerbaijan. Turkey will continue to stand by Azerbaijan in the field and at the table"".
The Azeri and Turkish foreign ministers also spoke by phone on Saturday. 
France welcomed the ceasefire, but said it now had to be fully implemented.
""It must now be implemented and strictly observed in order to create the conditions for a permanent cessation of hostilities between the two countries,"" French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said in a statement.
""Substantial discussions, to which the parties have engaged under the aegis of the co-chairs of the Minsk group, must resume without preconditions.""
Renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
The clashes have also increased concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.

The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.

While such proxy apps are not new in China, where a virtual private network (VPN) service is typically needed to allow domestic users passage to sites such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), the arrival of Tuber suggests a slight lowering of the Great Firewall.
While welcomed by internet users in China, some complained about the app's slowness. References to sensitive political issues such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown and the Hong Kong protests were also censored in part, according to Reuters checks. 
Users of the app must also register with personal information such as their identity card numbers and real names, while being warned against flouting state interests and going against the country's socialist system.

Video footage on social media showed baton-wielding police wearing body armour hauling protesters away and dismantling tents as a woman screamed ""What country do you live in?"" 
Residents of Khabarovsk, about 6,110 km (3,800 miles) east of Moscow, started holding weekly rallies after the July 9 detention of Sergei Furgal, the region's popular governor, over murder charges he denies. 
The protests have highlighted anger among some in the Far East over what they see as policies emanating from detached Moscow-based authorities who have neglected them for years.
Supporters of Furgal, who is a member of the nationalist LDPR party, say he is being punished for defeating a candidate from the ruling pro-Putin United Russia party in 2018. The Kremlin says Furgal has serious charges to answer. 
Opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who is recovering in Germany from what Berlin says was an attack on him using a nerve agent, condemned police.
""The authorities in Russia are simply scoundrels,"" Navalny wrote on Twitter.

""When half of the people in Khabarovsk took to the streets, they hid like cockroaches. They waited three months, the number of people grew less, they grew bolder, and they then went out and began to beat people for no reason,” he said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Protests rocked Bangladesh on Saturday as hundreds of people took to the streets to demand justice after a series of rapes and sexual assaults that have spurred the government to seek capital punishment for offenders.
Such incidents have surged in Bangladesh in recent years, with gang rapes accounting for more than a fifth of the nearly 1,000 attacks reported between January and September, says human rights group Ain-o-Salish Kendra.
""Hang the rapists,"" shouted protesters gathered in the capital Dhaka and elsewhere, hundreds of students among them. Many carried placards bearing messages such as ""No mercy to rapists"" and ""Please tell me, am I next?""
This week's protests have prompted the government to consider introducing the death penalty for offenders, with the cabinet set to receive a proposal for urgent amendments on Monday.
""We are making the proposal on Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s orders,"" Law Minister Anisul Huq told Reuters. ""We want to make sure those who are guilty get the highest punishment.""
Saturday's demonstrations were sparked by a video of a group of men stripping and attacking a woman for almost half an hour in the southeastern district of Noakhali.
An investigation by an autonomous state body, the National Human Rights Commission, found the woman in the video had been raped repeatedly and terrorised with weapons by one of the group over the last year.
Also fuelling outcry was the gang rape of a woman in a hostel in the northern district of Sylhet that led to the arrests of several members of the student wing of the ruling party.
On Saturday, Huq, the law minister, vowed legal action against the criminals regardless of their political ties, saying he aimed for their punishment without ""unnecessary"" delays.
Many more rapes go unreported because women fear being stigmatised. Rights activists blame the increasing rapes on a lack of awareness, a culture of impunity and protection of suspects by influential individuals for political reasons.
Even when survivors file a complaint, prosecution is very rare and takes years to complete.

The United Nations and rights groups have called for urgent reform of the criminal justice system to ensure perpetrators are held responsible.

The team was sent to Papua's Intan Jaya district to investigate a number of shootings last month that killed at least four military officers and civilians, including a Christian pastor.
Two members of the team, a researcher from an Indonesian university and a soldier, were shot on Friday and have been evacuated to the capital Jakarta to receive treatment, Indonesia's security coordinating ministry said in a statement.
The Indonesian military said on its Twitter page late on Friday that the team was attacked by an armed, criminal separatist group.
""The team is currently evaluating all ongoing activities, and especially considering safety and security factors,"" while maintaining ""the mission of obtaining clear information about this case,"" Sugeng Purnomo, a senior official at the coordinating ministry, said in the statement. 
Papua has been plagued by long-running separatist tensions since the former Dutch colony was incorporated into Indonesia after a U.N.-backed 1969 referendum called the Act of Free Choice, which has been widely criticised by human rights groups. 
Sebby Sembom, a spokesman for the separatist West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB-OPM), said in a video statement said the group rejects the fact-finding team formed by Jakarta and instead requested a team from the United Nations.
""The troops of the TPNPB-OPM will not negotiate. We are ready to attack the team formed by Indonesia,"" he said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan wants to have ""meaningful dialogue"" with China on an equal basis, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Saturday, extending an olive branch at a time of heightened military tension with Beijing, which claims the island as sovereign Chinese territory.
Democratic Taiwan has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up air force activity near the island in the past few weeks, including crossing the Taiwan Strait's sensitive mid line that normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone.
China says it is responding to ""collusion"" between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the self-governed island. Beijing views this a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China. 
Speaking at National Day celebrations, Tsai described the situation in the Taiwan Strait as ""quite tense."" This, along with disputes in the South China Sea, a China-India border conflict and China's crackdown in Hong Kong, showed democracy and peace in the region were facing big challenges, she said.
If Beijing can heed Taiwan's voice and jointly facilitate reconciliation and peaceful dialogue, regional tension can surely be resolved, she added.
""As long as the Beijing authorities are willing to resolve antagonisms and improve cross-strait relations, while parity and dignity are maintained, we are willing to work together to facilitate meaningful dialogue,"" Tsai said.
There was no immediate reaction from China, which cut off a formal talks mechanism in 2016 after she first won office.
Tsai said she was committed to maintaining stability in the Taiwan Strait, but that this was the responsibility of both sides.
Still, she has made strengthening Taiwan's armed forces a priority, and said she would keep pushing this, upholding the principle of neither seeking war nor fearing it.
""Our commitment to our sovereignty and democratic values will not change, but we will also maintain strategic flexibility and be responsive to changes,"" she said, without elaborating.

The United States has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so they can become a ""porcupine"", hard for China to attack. Washington, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei, though it is its strongest global backer.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police said on Saturday they had arrested nine people suspected of helping 12 Hong Kong activists who fled the city in August, heading for Taiwan, only to be intercepted by Chinese authorities and held on the mainland. 
The detainees' plight has grabbed international attention, with human rights groups raising concern as their families said they were denied access to independent lawyers, and aired suspicion that Hong Kong authorities helped in China's arrests. 
Accused of crimes tied to anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, the group is being detained in China's southern city of Shenzhen after authorities intercepted their boat and accused them of illegal border crossing. 
Police arrested four men and five women suspected of arranging transport for the fugitives, said Hong Kong police official Ho Chun-tung.
""One direction of the investigation is whether they helped others to flee,"" said Ho, a superintendent with the force's organised crime and triad bureau, adding that he did not rule out the possibility of more arrests.
He dismissed the relatives' accusations that police in the Asian financial hub played a role in the arrests in China. 
""The arrests on the mainland had nothing to do with the Hong Kong police,"" Ho added. 
Police also seized HK$500,000 ($64,500) in cash, computers, mobile phones, and documents related to the purchase of a boat. 
People began fleeing Hong Kong for self-ruled Taiwan from the early months of the protests, most of them legally, by air, but some by fishing boat, activists in Taipei who helped Hong Kong citizens get visas have told Reuters. 
Hong Kong authorities have said those detained are to be represented by mainland lawyers of their choice, albeit from a list provided by Chinese authorities.
Their families have been offered ""needed and feasible"" assistance, which will continue, the authorities have said.

The purpose of the exercise was ""to boost their tactical capability"", the ministry said in a statement, without giving more details on the geographical location of the drills. 
The three vessels will stop at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam over the weekend to replenish supplies, the statement said.
The ministry could not be immediately reached for further comment.
Nearly all of the energy-rich waters of the South China Sea are claimed by China, which has established military outposts on artificial islands in the area. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims to parts of the sea.
The United States has accused China of militarising the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbours who might want to exploit the area's extensive oil and gas reserves.
China's state-backed Global Times newspaper, noting the latest Japanese drills, said on Saturday that the frequent conducting of military activities in the South China Sea is not conducive to the security and stability of the area, and is firmly opposed by China.
The Chinese People's Liberation Army has always kept a high level of alert, defending China's national sovereignty, security and development interests, said the newspaper, which is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.
The Global Times said Japanese warships had recently carried out activities in the South China Sea, with a helicopter aircraft carrier spotted on satellite on Sept. 5.
On Friday, a Chinese military spokesperson said the U.S. destroyer John McCain had entered waters around the disputed Paracel Islands in the South China Sea without China's permission, and urged the United States to stop ""such provocative actions"".

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Detained Australian writer Yang Hengjun will face trial in Beijing on an espionage charge with a judge expected to be appointed in the next fortnight, friends said on Saturday.
The 55-year-old blogger was detained by Chinese authorities in January 2019 at Guangzhou Airport after arriving from New York. He has been held in a Beijing detention facility with no access to his family, while his wife remains in China. 
His Beijing lawyers were notified on Wednesday that Yang's case has been transferred to the Beijing Second Intermediate People's Court, a friend told Reuters.
A judge is expected to be appointed in the next two weeks to hear the case, said Feng Chongyi, a friend of Yang's and professor at the University of Technology Sydney.
The Australian government said on Saturday it has been informed that ""Chinese authorities have decided to prosecute Australian citizen Dr Yang Hengjun on charges yet to be announced"".
""We are obviously keen and have been stressing in all our diplomatic engagements around this issue that there should be transparency, there should be a fair and just process, and these are the things that we stand for as Australians,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a news conference.
Under the Chinese legal system, the charge, evidence to support the charge and a proposed sentence will be given to the court at the start of a trial, Feng said.
""The system there is very different from the system here in Australia and that can cause some anxiety,"" Morrison said.
Yang's lawyers have met with him twice, for an hour each time, in the past month, his first legal access after 21 months of detention and interrogation by Chinese security authorities.
Consular access via videolink to Australian embassy officials was restored in September after being suspended amid the coronavirus.
""They know what they're doing, and they'll be providing tremendous support there,"" Morrison said.
Yang told his family in a message last month that he was innocent and would ""never confess to something I haven't done"".
Australia has strongly objected to the indictment.
Diplomatic relations between China and Australia have deteriorated this year, after Beijing imposed trade reprisals in response to Canberra leading calls for an international inquiry into the source of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Last month China's foreign ministry confirmed another Australian, Chinese state television host Cheng Lei, had been detained in Beijing and was being investigated on suspicion of endangering national security.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Saturday.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's president ruled out making any concessions to Armenia on Friday ahead of talks aimed at halting the deadliest fighting in the South Caucasus region for more than 25 years.
President Ilham Aliyev's uncompromising position in a televised speech appeared to leave little room for de-escalation as the Azeri and Armenian foreign ministers arrived in Moscow. The talks were expected to be the first diplomatic contact between the enemies since fighting over the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave erupted on Sept. 27, killing hundreds of people.
The mountain enclave belongs to Azerbaijan under international law but broke away in a war as the Soviet Union collapsed and is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians. 
""Let those holding talks in Moscow know that it's our territory and we won't be making any concessions,"" Aliyev said after Azeri Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov flew to Moscow.
He said he had proved there was a military solution to the dispute: ""We are winning and will get our territory back and ensure our territorial integrity,"" Aliyev said. ""Let them abandon our territory in peace."" 
The talks in Moscow, attended by Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan, follow the launch of a peace drive by France, Russia and the United States at a meeting in Geneva on Thursday, details of which have not been made public. 
The renewed fighting in the decades-old conflict has raised fears of a wider war drawing in Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia.
The clashes have also increased concern about the security of pipelines that carry Azeri oil and gas to Europe.
FRAGILE SITUATION
The Armenian government said Friday's talks would focus on a cessation of hostilities and exchanges of bodies and prisoners.
""We are moving towards a truce soon even if the situation is still fragile,"" French President Emmanuel Macron's office said. 
But Turkey said diplomacy would succeed only if it ensured a withdrawal of Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh, which Armenians regard as part of their historic homeland.
""It is almost certain to fail if it doesn't also involve a detailed plan to end the occupation,"" Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told Al Jazeera. 
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Friday Nagorno-Karabakh was on the verge of a ""humanitarian disaster"". 
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said there had been fierce clashes on Friday with ethnic Armenian forces along the line of contact that divides the two sides, and that several areas deep in Azerbaijan had come under fire.
Shells fell on Stepanakert, the city ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh consider the capital of an independent state, the enclave's defence ministry said. Armenia denied its forces had attacked locations deeper in Azerbaijan on Friday.
Washington, Paris and Moscow have led mediation over Nagorno-Karabakh for almost three decades as co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Minsk Group.
The fighting is the worst since a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000 people and ended with a ceasefire that has been violated repeatedly.
Azerbaijan said on Thursday that 31 Azeri civilians had been killed and 168 wounded since Sept. 27. It has not disclosed information about military casualties. 

Nagorno-Karabakh said on Friday 376 of its military personnel and 22 civilians had been killed since Sept. 27.

(Reuters) - Six men arrested on suspicion of taking part in a plot by armed extremists to kidnap Michigan's governor have been arraigned on domestic terrorism and weapons charges, while a seventh awaits extradition from South Carolina, authorities said on Friday.
All seven, described by prosecutors as members or associates of an anti-government militia group called the Wolverine Watchmen, were taken into custody late on Wednesday as part of a joint state-federal investigation.
They are accused of conspiring to abduct Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has clashed sharply with Republican U.S. President Donald Trump over her COVID-19 public health orders.
Prosecutors say the men also sought to single out law enforcement officers for intimidation, made threats of violence to incite civil unrest, and trained for an operation to storm the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing and take government officials hostage.
""Clearly this was not just talk,"" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a CBS News interview on Friday. ""These were many overt actions. And so we thought it was time to move in before anybody lost their lives.""
Nessel said the governor was informed of the investigation and briefed on developments over the past couple of months.
""At times, she and her family had been moved around as a result of activities that law enforcement was aware of,"" Nessel added. 
$10 MILLION BOND
Each of the seven men named in criminal complaints filed by Nessel's office is charged with providing material support for terrorist acts and possessing a firearm in the commission of a felony - both punishable by up to 20 years in prison.
Two of them - Pete Musico, 46, and Joseph Morrison, 26 - were additionally charged with belonging to a criminal gang and with committing a threat of terrorism. At their arraignment on Thursday, Musico and Morrison were each ordered to remain jailed on a $10 million cash bond, the attorney general's office said in a statement.
Bond for each of the four others was set at $250,000. Michigan prosecutors are working to extradite the seventh defendant from South Carolina, where he was arrested, the statement said. He, too, is charged with gang membership.
Various additional pretrial court proceedings were set for later this month, but no mention was made of any pleas being entered.
In addition to the seven suspects held on state charges, six men were arrested on federal charges of conspiring to kidnap the governor, for which they could face life in prison if convicted.
Michigan, a key swing state in the 2020 presidential race, became a focus of agitation earlier this year by Trump and his supporters, including various militia groups, who opposed strict stay-at-home orders imposed by Whitmer to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
At least three of the defendants charged by the state were among hundreds of protesters, many carrying weapons, who entered the Michigan capitol on April 30 as state lawmakers debated Whitmer's request to extend her emergency public health authority. Photos show all three men were armed.

Both Whitmer and Nessel accused Trump of inflammatory rhetoric that they said has fostered a climate of racism and political extremism. Trump lashed back by calling Whitmer the ""lockdown queen"" while denying he was encouraging violence or racism.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch wants the city of Buenos Aires to stop using live facial recognition to identify children accused of committing crimes, the rights group said on Friday.
New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said Buenos Aires started using the technology in April 2019, making Argentina the only country in the world to deploy it against people under the age of 18. 
Although no minors are known to have been arrested yet, the group says the methodology is riddled with misidentifications that could unjustly limit job and educational opportunities for kids wrongly accused of theft and other crimes.
HRW sent a letter to the city and national government calling on them to stop using live facial recognition in train stations to identify suspects, particularly minors, arguing the technology often makes mistakes in identifying children.
Asked to comment on the assertions, the city government said the facial recognition system had been developed under United Nations' human rights guidelines.
""Since September 2019 no case of malfunction of this technology has been registered,"" it said in a statement.
HRW cited three cases of Argentine adults being erroneously detained by police due to the system's errors. 
Using facial recognition to identify child suspects is especially problematic because the appearance of young people can change in a matter of months as they mature, said Hye Jung Han, a child rights and technology researcher for HRW.
""Kids accused of having committed a crime are having their personal information published online, which is against international law and national standards. Anyone with an internet connection can download that data,"" Han said.
    ""What's worse is that the Buenos Aires government is feeding that data into a facial recognition system that operates in the city's train stations, to help police go search for them."" 
    Under international human rights law, children accused of crime have the right to privacy curing criminal proceedings, HRW said in a statement. It said the facial recognition technology used in Buenos Aires was built by a Russian company.

    ""We are asking the government to remove all children from its public criminal database, suspend its facial recognition system, and release verifiable statistics about its performance to date,"" Han said. ""People's rights and privacy are being violated by a government that doesn't understand this technology very well, without safeguards and without public debate.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - In a congratulatory message to Kim Jong Un for the founding anniversary of North Korea's ruling party, Chinese President Xi Jinping said he intends to deepen relations with Pyongyang, North Korean state media reported on Saturday.
""We have an intent to successfully defend, consolidate and develop the China-Korea relations together with Korean comrades and propel the long-lasting and stable development of the socialist cause of the two countries,"" North Korean state news agency KCNA quoted Xi as saying.
Saturday marks the 75th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, and events are expected to include a large military parade that may feature some of North Korea's long-range ballistic missiles for the first time since 2018.
Xi said he was ""greatly pleased"" with the achievements that North Korea had made in recent years by engaging with foreign countries in the face of hardships and challenges, KCNA reported.
After years of cool relations during which China joined the United States and other nations in imposing sanctions on North Korea over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes, Xi and Kim met five times in 2018 and 2019. The North Korean diplomatic offensive included Kim meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.

While North Korea says it has had no confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, strict border closures and other measures it imposed to prevent an outbreak have further strained its economy, which is heavily reliant on trade with China.

Socialist candidate Luis Arce leads centrist former President Carlos Mesa by just six percentage points, the poll showed, indicating a dip in support for the MAS political party of Bolivia's socialist former president Evo Morales.
The Oct. 18 election will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a fraught ballot last year prompted Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. 
The opinion poll of 15,500 Bolivians was carried out between Oct. 2 and 5 by ""Your Vote Counts,"" a group of several universities and local media. It showed that 33.6% of voters said they would support Arce, down from 40.3% in a September poll, and no longer enough to win the election outright. Just under 10% of people polled, however, said they were still undecided.
Mesa's support came in at 26.8%, up slightly from 26.2% in September. Conservative interim President Jeanine Anez, who had about 10.6% voter support, withdrew her candidacy last month in a bid to unify the opposition against Arce, a former economy minister and Morales loyalist.
To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40% of valid votes in the first round and a ten point advantage over the closest competitor.
Political analyst Alvaro del Rio said the poll indicates that the election will likely advance to a second round. 

""It clarifies a lot,"" Del Rio said. ""The latest polls show us that the second round is practically Bolivia's decision. No party will be able to gain an advantage of ten points and reach 40% [to avoid a second round].""

Lithuania, which had also been asked by Minsk to cut its diplomatic staff in the country, recalled five diplomats on Friday, the foreign ministry there said. 
Belarus has accused its neighbours Poland and Lithuania of meddling in its affairs by hosting exiled opposition leaders and refusing to recognise Alexander Lukashenko's victory in the Aug. 9 poll. His critics say the vote was rigged, which he denies.
Both countries had initially refused to comply with the demand to cut staffing but then recalled their ambassadors to Minsk for consultations in the hope of reducing the tension.

In a televised address, Diab, who resigned two months ago after a huge explosion damaged much of Beirut and worsened the country's economic crisis, said $4 billion had been spent so far in 2020 on subsidizing food, medicine, flour and wheat imports.
He warned that the country's central bank and ""all those who support such a decision"" on subsidies would be responsible for the ensuing chaos in the country, already gripped by a financial meltdown. 
Crushed by a mountain of debt, Lebanon is facing its worst economic crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. As prices soar, many Lebanese have been plunged into poverty and are increasingly reliant on subsidised food, medicine and fuel.
Lebanon has $1.8 billion of foreign exchange reserves left for subsidising food and other imports but could make this last for six more months by scrapping support for some goods, an official source told Reuters on Thursday.
Diab said the subsidies should not be completely removed, but suggested targeting them to support those most in need.
Parliamentary consultations to choose a new prime minister will begin on Oct. 15, in an effort to push Lebanon's fractious political class to move on forming the country's next government.
Recent efforts faltered amid bickering over cabinet posts among the country's various political factions, dealing a blow to a French plan aimed at rallying politicians to tackle the country's woes. 

Diab said it was incumbent upon the country's feuding sectarian political leaders to revive the French road map and form a government swiftly because the country ""cannot wait another two months"".

PARIS (Reuters) - An Iranian diplomat charged in Belgium with planning to bomb a meeting of an exiled Iranian opposition group in France warned authorities of possible retaliation by unidentified groups if he is found guilty, according to a police document.
Belgian prosecutors charged Vienna-based Assadolah Assadi in Oct. 2018 and three others with planning an attack that year on a rally of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI) attended by high profile former U.S., European and Arab officials.
Assadi, who goes on trial on Nov. 27, was the third counsellor at Iran's embassy in Vienna. French officials have said he was in charge of intelligence in southern Europe and was acting on orders from Tehran.
He is one of the first Iranian diplomats to face trial on terrorism charges in the European Union. 
Tehran has repeatedly dismissed the charges against Assadi, calling them a ""false flag"" operation by the NCRI's political arm, the MEK, (Mujaheedin-e Khalq), which presents itself as an alternative to Iran's theocracy. Assadi has not commented on the charges and his lawyer has declined to comment on them.
Minutes of a March 12 meeting between Assadi and Belgian police, seen by Reuters and confirmed as authentic by his lawyer, show the diplomat initially set out Tehran's long-standing grievances with the MEK's activities in the past.
He then warned Belgian authorities that his case was being closely watched by undisclosed groups in Iran and neighbouring countries.
""According to ASSADI Assadolah we (Belgium) do not realize what is going to happen, in the event of an unfavourable verdict,"" the minutes, taken by the Belgian police, say.
Assadi told police that armed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen and Syria, as well as in Iran, were interested in the outcome of his case and would be ""watching from the sidelines to see if Belgium would support them or not"", according to the minutes.
He declined to answer when asked by police if any kind of organization was involved.
Asked about Assadi's comments, a spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor said: ""Such threats can occur, but we always take the necessary security measures."" The spokesman declined to comment further or say whether intelligence services had been informed of Assadi's statement.
Assadi said he was making the statement at his own behest and had not discussed it beforehand with the Iranian embassy, according to the record of his 31-minute encounter with police. The embassy could not immediately be reached for comment.
Assadollah's lawyer, Dimitri de Beco, denied his client was making threats.
""It is absolutely not a threat of retaliation and if it's understood that way it's a misinterpretation,"" he told Reuters. ""He will explain the sense of his remarks to the court.""
Tehran accuses European states of harbouring the MEK, which it deems a terrorist organisation. The group had been based in the Iraqi capital Baghdad under former president Saddam Hussein and was on the U.S. State Department's terror list from 1997 to 2012 when it was taken off it renounced violence.
A co-ordinated intelligence operation between French, German and Belgian services thwarted the planned attack in the days prior to the NCRI rally, in which the keynote speech was given by U.S. President Donald Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.
Assadi was arrested while on holiday in Germany and handed over to Belgium, where two of his suspected accomplices had been arrested with 500 grams (one lb) of TATP, an explosive, as well as a detonation device.
France said Iran's intelligence ministry was behind the plot and expelled an Iranian diplomat, while the European Union froze the assets of an Iranian intelligence unit and two of its staff.

OSLO/GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations' World Food Programme, which has coordinated medical logistics during the coronavirus pandemic, won the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday in what its boss said was a call to action that no one should go hungry with the wealth in the world today. 
The head of the awards committee called the WFP a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict, and said the COVID-19 pandemic, which the WFP says could double hunger worldwide, had made it even more relevant.
At one point at the height of the pandemic, as airlines were cutting back flights, the WFP was running the largest operational airline in the world, a WFP spokesman said.
The Rome-based organisation says it helps some 97 million people in about 88 countries each year, and that one in nine people worldwide still do not have enough to eat.
WFP Executive Director David Beasley told Reuters the prize was a clarion call ""to our donors around the world"" and ""to the billionaires who are making billions off COVID"". 
""It's a call to action to not let anyone die from starvation, it's a call to action that we've got to save and help our friends, our brothers, our sisters around the world,"" he said. 
""All the wealth in the world today no one should go to bed hungry, much less starve to death."" 
Only this week, a report by UBS and PwC found billionaire wealth had reached a record high during the pandemic, helped by a rally in stock prices.
""The need for international solidarity and multilateral cooperation is more conspicuous than ever,"" Berit Reiss-Andersen, chairwoman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, told a news conference.
WFP runs a logistics service that has dispatched medical cargoes to over 120 countries throughout the pandemic to help governments and health partners fighting COVID-19. 
It has also provided passenger services to ferry humanitarian and health workers where commercial flights were unavailable.
""Until the day we have a medical vaccine, food is the best vaccine against chaos,"" the Nobel committee said in its citation.
""INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION""
Beasley, travelling in Niger, posted a video statement on social media praising the ""WFP family"".
""They are out there in the most difficult, complex places in the world, where there's war, conflict, climate extremes – it doesn't matter. They are out there and they deserve this award ...,"" he said.
In Geneva, WFP spokesman Tomson Phiri told reporters:
""When everything went into shutdown mode, the World Food Programme was there. When everyone was leaving and we were going into lockdowns, the World Food Programme had to provide the logistical support that the world deserved, that the world needed.""
Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said the Norwegian Nobel Committee had wanted to send a message of both hope and ""support for international cooperation"".
""Hunger, like climate change, the pandemic and other issues, is a world problem that can only be properly addressed through cooperation,"" he told Reuters.
""Unfortunately, in too many quarters, especially among the great powers, there is a declining appetite for cooperation.""
He noted that, after declining for several decades, world hunger had been on the rise again since 2016.
The United Nations, which turns 75 this month, has itself won the Nobel Peace Prize in the past, as have several of its agencies, including the High Commissioner for Refugees, the UNICEF children's fund and its peacekeeping forces.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee plans to go ahead with an award ceremony, albeit in a reduced format due to the pandemic, in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of the death of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, who founded the awards in his 1895 will. 

The Nobel Peace Prize is worth 10 million Swedish crowns, or around $1.1 million.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian police used teargas on Friday to disperse dozens of people in the capital Abuja who had gathered to protest at alleged brutality by members of a special police unit, witnesses said.
Protesters, some holding placards, ran as clouds of teargas hung in the air. Multiple people at the incident said on Twitter that police had fired the canisters. 
A spokesman for the police did not immediately respond to a message and call requesting comment. 
""They poured teargas on each and every one of us, it's so hot I had to put water on my face. This is what Nigeria has turned into,"" protester Anita Izato said.
""We just got there with our placards and decided, they started throwing us teargas. That was it,"" another protester said.
Sporadic protests have broken out across Nigeria in recent days after a video circulated last week alleging to show members of the Special Anti-Robbery squad, known as SARS, shooting dead a man in Delta state. 
The police pledged to reform the unit soon after the alleged incident, including by banning SARS agents from carrying out routine patrols and requiring them to wear uniforms when on duty. But protesters have called for the unit to be abolished. 
Nigerians and international rights groups for years have accused SARS of brutality, harassment and extortion, and there have been multiple pledges in the past, including from the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, to reform the unit. 
#EndSARS has been trending on Twitter in Nigeria for several days, popular singer Naira Marley held an Instagram chat with a police spokesman over the issue watched live by more than 30,000 people and even the deputy governor of Lagos state said he had been harassed by SARS agents. 
""Every citizen of Nigeria should be upset,"" Lagos state government spokesman Gboyega Akosile said in a Tweet, sharing a video of Lagos state Deputy Governor Obafemi Hamzat addressing protesters and sharing his own story of harassment.

A Kenyan court had acquitted Liban Abdulleh Omar on Wednesday of charges of helping al Qaeda-linked Somali militants storm Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in a 2013 attack in which at least 67 people were killed. Two other defendants were found guilty of assisting the jihadist attackers. [L8N2GY2MP]
The abduction occurred on Thursday as Omar was in a taxi accompanied by some relatives heading home after anti-terrorism police freed him that morning, according to his sister Sahara Abdulle Omar, who was in the vehicle.
Minutes after the taxi departed the police station, another vehicle forced it to stop, several men jumped out of the car, pulled Liban out of the taxi and took him away, Liban's sister Sahara said by phone.
""They were armed, more than five of them. They took my brother by force and sped away,"" she said.
She said the gunmen were wearing civilian clothes along with face masks many Kenyans now wear to protect themselves from the coronavirus pandemic.
Omar's lawyer Mbugua Mureithi told Reuters he believed that his client was abducted by Kenyan anti-terrorism police, though he did not offer evidence to substantiate the claim.
Kenyan police spokesman Charles Owino did not respond to phone calls requesting comment on the alleged abduction.
Wednesday's verdict marked the end of the only prosecution Kenya has mounted over the 2013 shopping mall assault by Somali al Shabaab militants that left at least 67 people dead.
The attack on the upscale mall - frequented by the country's growing middle class and foreigners - came two years after Kenya sent troops into Somalia following a series of kidnappings and raids on Kenyan soil claimed by al Shabaab.

BISHKEK (Reuters) - Kyrgyz President Sooronbai Jeenbekov declared a state of emergency in the capital Bishkek on Friday and ordered the military to end days of unrest, as supporters of rival political groups fought on the streets.
A Reuters journalist in the capital heard gunshots and saw demonstrators from rival groups throwing rocks and bottles at each other and scuffling. One opposition politician was reported to have been wounded.
Jeenbekov's office said in a statement the state of emergency, including a curfew and tight security restrictions, would be in effect from 8 pm on Friday until 8 am on Oct. 21.
His order did not say how many troops would be deployed but they were instructed to ""take the situation under control"" and use military vehicles, set up checkpoints, and prevent armed clashes.
Earlier the president had said he was ready to resign once a new cabinet was appointed. 
The country has seen a power vacuum, with opposition groups quarrelling among themselves since seizing government buildings and forcing the cancellation of results from Sunday's parliamentary election which they denounced as fraudulent.
Two leading opposition figures reached an agreement to join forces on Friday, and won the backing of Jeenbekov's predecessor as president, Almazbek Atambayev. But their followers and followers of other groups held rival rallies, which politicians said posed a danger of violence. 
Russia has described the situation in Kyrgyzstan, which borders China and hosts a Russian military base, as ""a mess and chaos"". 
The crisis tests the Kremlin's power to shape politics in its former Soviet sphere of influence, at a time when fighting has erupted between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and Belarus is also engulfed in protests.
The opposition is divided between 11 parties which represent clan interests in a country that has already seen two presidents toppled by popular revolts since 2005.
Rival candidates for the premiership Omurbek Babanov and Tilek Toktogaziyev joined forces on Friday, with Toktogaziyev agreeing to serve as Babanov's deputy. They were backed by four parties, local news website 24.kz reported.
They were joined at a rally in Bishkek by the former president Atambayev. A few thousand followers chanted ""I am not afraid"" and ""Kyrgyzstan"" to the rhythmic beating of large drums. 
Followers of another candidate, Sadyr Zhaparov, also numbering a few thousand, held a demonstration nearby. Some of Zhaparov's supporters later rushed into the square, leading to scuffles between the rival groups until the Babanov and Toktogaziyev supporters withdrew.
A video posted by several Kyrgyz media showed an apparently unconscious Toktogaziyev being taken away from the square, with people around him screaming he was wounded and taking off his coat to revel a bulletproof vest.
Separately, an aide to Atambayev said a shot had been fired at his car which did not wound anyone.
Jeenbekov's allies swept Sunday's parliamentary vote in the official results that have now been discarded. They have kept a low profile as the opposition parties have taken to the streets. Western observers said the election was marred by credible allegations of vote-buying.

So far, veteran officials who supported the revolt have been in control of the security forces. On Friday, self-appointed provisional heads of the interior ministry and the state security service left their respective buildings and handed over the leadership to their deputies. The two state bodies said the move was meant to ensure security forces remained apolitical.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen will pledge to strengthen the island's defences and work more with regional partners on security in a major speech on Saturday, at a time when tensions with its giant neighbour China have risen dramatically.
Democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its own territory, has come under increasing pressure from Beijing, which has ramped up air force activity near the island in the past few weeks including crossing the Taiwan Strait's sensitive mid line that normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone.
China says it is responding to ""collusion"" between Washington and Taipei, angered at growing U.S. support for the self-governed island which Beijing views as a precursor to Taiwan declaring formal independence, a red line for China.
According to an outline of her national day speech on Saturday, as described to Reuters by a source briefed on its contents, Tsai will say that only solid determination and strength can guarantee security and maintain regional peace.
Tsai, re-elected by a landslide in January on a promise to stand up to China, will emphasise military modernisation and the speeding up of ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, which refers to making any attack Chinese attack difficult and costly, for example with smart mines and portable missiles.
Washington, which, like most countries, has no formal diplomatic ties with Taipei though it is its strongest global backer, has been pushing Taiwan to modernise its military so they can become a ""porcupine"", hard for China to attack.
Tsai has sought to work more closely with like-minded democracies, and she will say that Taiwan will ""strengthen its security partnership role with surrounding countries"" while protecting its democracy and sovereignty.
Taiwan will also ""proactively participate"" in the building of a future new international and regional order, she will say.

On relations with China, Tsai will say that Taiwan will stick to its principles and is ""determined"" to ensure stability, but that this is the responsibility of both parties.

Restrictions could include tighter rules on mask-wearing, restrictions on private gatherings and stricter rules on buying alcohol, Merkel said, adding that her top priority was to avoid shutting down the economy and society again, as in the spring.
""These are the days and weeks that will determine in what shape Germany will get through winter in this pandemic,"" Merkel told reporters. ""Summer went very well overall, but we now see a picture that is cause for concern.""
Germany has so far managed to keep the number of cases and deaths lower than many of its neighbours but the number of new daily coronavirus cases has leapt in recent days, and some hospitals warned of staff shortages on Friday.
It was still possible to bring the pandemic under control i Germany, Merkel said, adding that she was aware the restrictions were painful.
""But I am also convinced that we are at a point where we have to be clear about what is important for us this autumn and winter, and where we have to prioritise, and my highest priority is - if at all possible - not to have to cut back economic and public life again as was necessary in spring,"" she said.
Schools should stay open to the extent possible, she added.

Merkel and the mayors would meet again in two weeks to review whether the measures had been effective, she said, adding: ""We have proven that we can stand together against the virus and we should do that again.""

777,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 09:40AM ET</span>",Turkish court approves new indictment against philanthropist Kavala: media,"By Ali Kucukgocmen
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish court has approved an indictment accusing philanthropist Osman Kavala of helping organise an attempted coup in 2016, state media reported, months after he was acquitted on charges of financing nationwide protests in 2013.
In the new indictment seen by Reuters, Kavala is accused of collaborating with Henri Barkey, a prominent Turkey scholar in the United States. The indictment accuses Barkey of links to the network of U.S.-based Turkish Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, which Ankara accuses of orchestrating the coup. 
Kavala, Barkey and Gulen have all denied any involvement.
Kavala, in jail for nearly three years, was acquitted in February along with eight others of charges related to the Gezi protests, which threatened the grip on power of then-premier, now President Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkey's Western allies and rights groups have called for Kavala's release and voiced concern that his indictment points to a politicisation of Turkey's justice system.
A court ordered Kavala's release in February, but the same day a new detention warrant was issued for him related to the failed coup. 
State-run Anadolu news agency said an Istanbul court had accepted the indictment on Thursday, paving the way for a trial.
Kavala's lawyers were not immediately available for comment.
Nacho Sanchez Amor, the European Parliament's rapporteur on Turkey, said the indictment ""without any real evidence is outrageous"". He said it ""disdains"" a European Court of Human Rights ruling that called for Kavala's immediate release.
Amnesty International called the indictment ""absurd"".
ACCUSATIONS
In an emailed response, Barkey said the indictment, which includes accusations first levelled against him in Turkish pro-government media four years ago, was a ""complete fabrication"". 
He and Kavala are charged with attempting to overthrow the constitutional order and the government, and preventing parliament from doing its job. Conviction on any of the charges carries a life sentence without parole. A further charge is espionage, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in jail.
The indictment says Kavala and Barkey spoke twice by phone on Oct. 8, 2016, nearly three months after the failed July 15 coup. It says that many times between 2013 and 2016, signals on Barkey and Kavala's phones came from the same area and that they met at an Istanbul restaurant on July 18, 2016.
Barkey said the two had run into each other at the restaurant and chatted briefly. ""On the basis of a chance encounter, officials concocted this absurd story,"" he said, adding that their phones could easily have been in the same district of a crowded city at other times without them meeting.
The indictment also says Barkey left a bell featuring a map of the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, where Gulen lives, at the reception of an Istanbul hotel where he organised a meeting at the time of the coup attempt.
Barkey said he arranged the meeting to save on travel costs for the attendees, most of whom he said came from Turkey and the Middle East. He said he did not leave any bell behind.
""You cannot defend yourself against such concoctions,"" he said of the assertions in the indictment.

(Reuters) - The 31-year-old Cuban rancher arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border after crossing through nearly a dozen countries to seek political asylum in the United States.
More than a year later, Yudanys Perez remains locked up. As he presses his legal case, he's been shuttled among six immigration detention centers and denied parole seven times.
In May, medical records show, he tested positive for the coronavirus. For more than a month, he suffered fever, shakes and diarrhea in a dormitory with dozens of other sick detainees, he said during a telephone interview from the Winn Correctional Center in rural Louisiana.
""Especially since the coronavirus pandemic began, I worry every day about my survival,"" he said in a declaration earlier this year in an ongoing federal lawsuit brought on behalf of hundreds of detained asylum seekers.
Amid a global health emergency, immigrants are being held in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) detention for longer than any period in at least a decade, according to ICE data on monthly averages analyzed by Reuters. More than 6,400 detainees have contracted COVID-19 in ICE detention centers around the country, and eight have died.
Reuters spoke to 20 detainees from Africa and Latin America who said they had been held in ICE detention for more than six months. Each described cramped and sometimes unsanitary conditions, which made social distancing virtually impossible and control of COVID-19 infections and other diseases difficult.
The agency has also continued to transfer detainees among centers during the pandemic, seeding or exacerbating outbreaks in some cases.
Detention centers now house fewer than half as many people as before the pandemic - less than 20,000 as of early October - in part because emergency health measures established in March have allowed authorities to expel nearly 150,000 migrants at the border. 
At the same time, the ICE data show, the average amount of time immigrants spent in U.S. detention almost tripled to three months this September compared to September 2016, before President Donald Trump took office. Detainees in September 2020 were being held nearly double the amount of time as in September 2019.
(For a graphic on detention stays, see https://tmsnrt.rs/3lmxJ4L)
ICE officials did not dispute Reuters findings on increased periods of detention. The agency said the pandemic has hindered swift deportation of detainees because some countries have closed their borders or been unwilling to consistently accept returnees. ICE also said the health crisis has delayed U.S. immigration court proceedings and asylum screenings.
ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said the agency is ""committed to adhering to U.S. Centers for Disease Control guidance on detention levels and minimizing the spread of the virus.""
Determinations about who is released are made on a case-by-case basis ""as a matter of discretion or as a matter of controlling law or court decisions,"" Bennett said.
'VERY SCARY'
The agency could make greater use of its wide discretion by releasing more detainees on parole, bond or their own recognizance, several immigration attorneys, former ICE officials and public health experts familiar with ICE detention practices said.
Some of these sources said migrants may be kept longer because of the way the detention system is funded.
Congress looks at the prior year's average detention numbers to decide how much to allocate to ICE and its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), in the future.
""This creates an incentive for DHS to limit discretionary detainee releases and slow down asylum processes, to keep its detained population as high as possible,"" said Kevin Landy, a former ICE detention official. 
In response, ICE said that 2020 was an exceptional year due to the pandemic and Congress would likely take this into account when setting next year's funding levels.
Overall, about half the people currently in detention have been convicted of crimes in the United States and often come into custody after they have finished serving U.S. jail or prison sentences, ICE data show.
In 2019, the most common convictions were for drunk driving, followed by drug offenses, criminal immigration violations - such as illegally crossing the border multiple times - and traffic offenses, like driving without a license.
About a third of detainees have committed civil immigration violations, such as overstaying a visa. These people are stuck in detention the longest - more than five months on average in September, according to the ICE data. The rest of those detained have been charged with crimes but not yet convicted.
Reuters spoke to a wide range of detainees - men and women from Burkina Faso, Mali, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Cuba and Venezuela, as well as Mexico and Central America.
Sandra Cervantes, 26, whose parents brought her from Mexico when she was 6 months old, lost her Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) protection after being convicted of drunk driving causing injury. The Los Angeles resident said she was given five years of probation.
In August 2019, she was again before a judge after missing a probation appointment in June, according to court records. Police records show she reported having been raped and falsely imprisoned that month, something she said kept her from attending to her own criminal case.
She was released by the court but was detained by ICE that same day and has been at the Adelanto detention center near Los Angeles ever since, fighting deportation to a country she last lived in as a baby. ""I'm so remorseful for what happened,"" she said of her drunk driving offense.
ICE said Cervantes was a ""convicted criminal alien, who has been ordered removed by an immigration judge.""
More than 100 Adelanto detainees have tested positive for COVID-19 since early September, according to ICE data. At least 16 detainees have been hospitalized for COVID-related symptoms since then but most have since recovered and returned to the center, ICE said. The agency said it provides masks to staff and detainees at Adelanto, regularly disinfects common areas and is staggering meals and recreation times.
But Cervantes worries about contracting the coronavirus in her dorm, where she bunks with nine other women. ""It's kind of dirty in here, and we're close to each other,"" she said.
A former dorm mate said she had the same concerns. Uninfected detainees move through the same common areas as those in quarantine, said Silvia Ramirez, 37, a Mexican national who told Reuters she was detained after she finished a jail sentence for a third DUI.
""They use the same microwave we use, we touch the same stuff, they eat at the same tables,"" said Ramirez, who has lived in the United States since she was 5 and is fighting deportation. ""It's very scary.""
Ramirez, who has high blood pressure - potentially putting her at higher risk for severe COVID-19 - was released last Friday following an order by a federal judge in a lawsuit brought on behalf of Adelanto detainees. She had been there six months.
GROWING RESTLESS
More than 2,600 detainees are asylum seekers who have passed their first screening and are awaiting resolution of their court cases, ICE data showed. The Trump administration says many asylum claims are fraudulent and has tried to narrow who is eligible and keep more detained pending court proceedings.
Perez said he left Cuba after being arrested and assaulted by police because he declined to participate in pro-government activities. Representing himself in U.S. immigration court, he lost his asylum case in January in part because of a Trump administration rule that required migrants to apply for asylum first in countries through which they traveled. That rule has since been blocked in federal court.
His appeal was dismissed for being late, and he was ordered deported, the documents show. But Cuba has not accepted any deportation flights since late February, ICE said.
Unable to leave detention and unwilling to return to his home country - even if it were possible - Perez is seeking to reopen his asylum case. 
In the meantime, his fellow detainees at Winn, the Louisiana center, have been growing restless, he said.
On Sept. 19, he said, a group of men in another dorm lit their bedding on fire. ICE confirmed there was a ""small"" fire that was quickly put out after four detainees microwaved a sheet.

""They were protesting because of how long they have been here,"" Perez said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist-led government invoked a state of emergency on Friday to impose a partial lockdown on Madrid, one of Europe's worst COVID-19 hotspots, after a court had struck down the measures, state TV said. 
The move escalates a standoff between Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government and the conservative-led Madrid regional chief who believes the curbs are illegal, excessive and disatrous for the local economy.
Many of the 3.8 million people affected in the capital city and nine satellite towns are bemused and angry. 
""I feel bad because I don't know how to act, what to do, if I'm doing things right or wrong, and I feel totally misruled by our politicians who are just not up to the job,"" said 64-year-old retiree Jesus Doria.
Following a Health Ministry order, Madrid authorities last week reluctantly barred all non-essential travel in and out of the city and other nearby towns. The region had 723 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the two weeks to Oct. 8, according to the World Health Organization, making it Europe's second densest cluster after Andorra.
But instead of a blanket restriction, the Madrid region chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso wants tailored restrictions in different neighbourhoods according to local contagion levels.

A Madrid court sided with her on Thursday, effectively suspending the restrictions and prompting the government's response with an emergency order.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - At one point during her four years in the hands of jihadist militants in northern Mali, French aid worker Sophie Petronin said she felt like giving up hope. She wandered into the desert, sat on the ground in the baking sun and wept.
The 75-year old, who ran a charity for malnourished and orphaned children when she was kidnapped near the desert city of Gao in late 2016, was one of four hostages released and flown to the capital Bamako late on Thursday.
She said snippets of news from home had provided comfort while in captivity and that she was able to find the strength to endure her ordeal when a small voice in her head spoke to her.
""It said you mustn't cry or be sad. I will stay with you. And until today it hasn't left,"" Petronin told journalists.
Petronin's son, who was there to greet her on the tarmac at Bamako airport on Thursday, lifted her from the ground as he embraced her. She is due to return to France on Friday.
There are at least six foreigners still held by Islamist groups in West Africa's Sahel region, where thousands of international troops are struggling to curb the growing reach of the insurgency in the vast desert borderlands. 
Another of the freed captives, Malian politician Soumaila Cisse, described his sense of loneliness and hardship after he was seized by gunmen on the campaign trail in the northern region of Timbuktu in March.
""I spent six months in conditions you can't imagine, extremely difficult conditions - in semi-permanent isolation,"" Cisse told journalists, wearing white robes and a face mask.
Petronin said a doctor had given her a clean bill of health, although she has lost some weight and four teeth.

""We've all had or will have trials to go through. If you don't accept what happens, it will be too hard,"" she said. ""I almost turned it into a spiritual retreat.""

783,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Explainer: How Georgia could leave voters guessing until January about U.S. Senate control,"By David Morgan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When the dust settles next month and all the ballots are counted, Americans still may not know until January which party will control the U.S. Senate for the next two years thanks to an unusual confluence of events in Georgia.
Two Senate seats in that state are up for grabs at the same time, and if no candidate wins 50% of the vote, state law forces a run-off election on Jan. 5 - two days after the rest of Congress is sworn in.
Some 10 Senate races are rated competitive this year, giving Democrats a chance of erasing Republicans' 53-47 majority. That could lead to a bitter post-Nov. 3 political fight in the a largely Republican state with a growing Democratic electorate. 
WHY ARE BOTH GEORGIA SENATE SEATS ON THE BALLOT?
Republican Senator David Perdue is up for re-election, according to the regular six-year U.S. Senate election cycle. He was first elected in 2014 and is now in a tight contest against Democrat Jon Ossoff, an investigative journalist and media executive. 
Georgia's other Republican senator, Kelly Loeffler, was appointed in 2019 to succeed former Senator Johnny Isakson, who retired. Her seat is now up for grabs in a special election that has drawn 21 candidates, including Republican U.S. Representative Doug Collins and Democrats Raphael Warnock and Matt Lieberman.
HOW COMMON ARE RUNOFF ELECTIONS AMONG U.S. STATES?
Several U.S. states including Georgia require runoff elections for primary contests that produce no clear winner. 
But Georgia became one of the few states to apply runoffs to general elections, after a gubernatorial race in 1966 failed to produce a clear winner and a state legislature dominated by Democrats chose their own candidate over a Republican who had won a slightly larger plurality of voters. 
HOW COULD BOTH SENATE RACES END IN RUN-OFF ELECTIONS?
The special election for Loeffler's seat is an open ""jungle primary"" contest in which all candidates compete, regardless of party. The sheer number of candidates makes it unlikely that anyone will cross the 50% threshold. A recent poll showed Warnock leading the pack, but with only 31%.
In the Perdue-Ossoff matchup, neither candidate has reached the 50% mark in polling since July and recent data shows the race within a single percentage point. Libertarian Party Senate candidate Shane Hazel could also force a run-off by capturing only a small percentage of the vote. 
WHY WOULD RUN-OFFS IN GEORGIA AFFECT CONTROL OF THE SENATE?
Republicans currently hold a majority of majority 53 seats in the 100-seat Senate. Democrats are slightly favored to take control of the chamber in November, which would require them to net three Republican seats if Democratic candidate Joe Biden won the White House, allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to serve as Senate tie-breaker. 

Ten Senate seats are highly competitive - eight Republican and two Democratic. But political analysts say the single most likely outcome is a 50-50 split, raising the possibility that Georgia could prove to be a January nail-biter.

784,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 09, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>","Special Report: For Black South African rugby player, a COVID victory, and loss","By Tim Cocks
CAPE TOWN, South Africa (Reuters) - On Broadhurst Cona's fifth night in the COVID-19 ward of Cape Town's Groote Schuur Hospital, the patient in the bed next to him was giving up.
The man gripped his own throat in panic as he choked, and he kept pulling off his oxygen mask. Cona pleaded with him to put it back on, but the man was beyond listening.
Early the next morning, Cona awoke to a commotion. The man's bed was empty, and nurses in protective clothing were spraying it down with disinfectant. He was sealed in a beige-coloured body bag, and it took four people to lift him away to a passage leading to the lift.
Cona didn't know it yet, because his companion had been too sick to speak and his face unrecognisable with pain, but he had seen this man many times before, as an opponent on the rugby field.
The two had played in rival Black neighbourhood teams under apartheid's racial segregation laws in the late 1960s. Cona had gone on to compete in international games with South Africa's Blacks-only team over the following decade. He played against England, France and New Zealand's vaunted national team, and also toured Italy.
He was competing in a sport that, to many, had become a symbol of Afrikaner domination of the country's majority Blacks, but it was a game that his broad body and determination were made for.
The dead man, Phakamile Maqhasho, had never made it beyond provincial rugby, but the two had kept in touch. Cona had last seen him at the funeral of a mutual rugby friend four years back. Cona only realised it was him in the bed next to him when a friend sent him a copy of his obituary in a local Xhosa-language community paper some days later.
Now Maqhasho's funeral would be next, and Cona felt like he had witnessed what his own death from COVID-19 might be like. Would he ever again see his daughter and especially his son, who lived on the other side of the country?
""I could be next,"" he thought to himself, and sure enough, within 24 hours, the 72-year-old's own condition had dramatically worsened, and he was gasping for breath.
For decades, he had survived all the indignities that South Africa's apartheid system could throw at a Black man: the bulldozing of his childhood home; his move to a Black township; a racist law that forbade him from playing rugby on South Africa's all-white national team, the Springboks, despite his talent.
Wheezing in his hospital bed, Cona made a vow. ""I can't have come this far to be killed by a virus. There's no glory if I die in my sleep,"" he would later recount. ""Let me die fighting, on my feet, rather than in my bed.""
That night, after barely four hours of sleep, Cona got up and started doing vigorous exercise: push-ups, chin-ups, jogging around the ward, even shadow boxing – with the novel coronavirus as his invisible opponent. His body was heavy as lead and his chest felt like it was about to explode with pain, but he just kept on training.
The nurses urged him to rest, lest he injure himself falling, and he politely declined.
He was going to fight this one out.
UPROOTED
Cona had discovered rugby by accident, after the South African government bulldozed his family home.
He was 6 months old when, in May 1948, the Afrikaner Nationalist Party representing the descendants of Dutch settlers came to power – and set about implementing its vision of an apartheid state, solidifying decades of racially discriminatory policies introduced by South Africa's British former colonial masters.
Two years later, the government passed what would be one of the most hated laws of the era: the Group Areas Act, which sought to keep the races apart by demarcating neighbourhoods where each was allowed to live.
They grabbed all the best neighbourhoods for the white minority, forcibly relocating Black and coloured – as mixed-race citizens are called here – people into less desirable areas. Cona was a teenager when his family, who lived in picturesque seaside Simon's Town, were uprooted to the township of Gugulethu.
""I still say that was the most heinous legislation of the apartheid era. Because it destroyed the fibre of the community,"" Cona told Reuters at his daughter Kholiswa's house in the Black township of Langa, whose neat rows of bungalows built by the apartheid regime are now painted in riotous colours that previously were forbidden.
Ironically, the forced relocation set him on a path that would become his life's passion. There was no rugby team in Simon's Town, and Cona had only ever played soccer, which has always been the more popular sport with the country's Black majority.
When he was 22, he joined a soccer team in Gugulethu. In one match, he played against a team whose players included Norman Mbiko, who also happened to be a coach of a rugby team, the Flying Eagles, in the nearby township of Nyanga. Mbiko would later recall noticing the stocky player who combined a blistering pace with a Herculean upper-body strength.
""I could see he'd be good at rugby,"" Mbiko told Reuters in an interview at his spotless red-brick home, whose wood-panelled interior was adorned with team photos and newspaper cuttings featuring him from his rugby days. ""He was so fast for his big size.""
So in 1969, Mbiko and another sports friend persuaded Cona to start playing rugby. Within a year, Cona had established himself as a powerful tighthead prop – one of the two positions in the front row of the scrum that are usually reserved for the team's heaviest players – and rose up to play for the racially segregated Black Western Province team.
Resources were scant. The pitch was mostly dirt, and they had none of the facilities the white clubs enjoyed, such as gyms or scrummaging machines. There was no changing room at Nyanga; they suited up in the open.
Despite the challenges, in 1972 Cona and Mbiko were selected for the national Black rugby squad, the Leopards, with Mbiko as captain. Cona became known in rugby circles as ""Broadness,"" part wordplay on his size, part the result of a misprint on his ""dompas"" – the passes Blacks were required to carry every time they entered a white area.
But it wasn't until 28 years later, long after they'd both retired and six years after South Africa had transitioned to democracy with a historic election that brought Nelson Mandela to power, that their contribution to the sport would finally be recognised.
In 2000, the two men received the thing they long had been denied during the apartheid era: the coveted green and gold blazers of the team that had for decades been the realm of white players alone, the Springboks. Balfour Ngconde, the sports minister under Mandela who had fought for the belated honor, bestowed the blazers on the men.
""We were so excited. We had always been yearning to be on one platform, not separate ones,"" Cona said. But it was tinged with bitterness.
""While we were mingling afterwards, some of the guys said, 'It's only a blazer, it's meaningless.' And we all agreed. Because the whites who played are well-off now, but we had nothing.""
""I WAS DENIED AN OPPORTUNITY""
On a bright day in September, Cona surveyed the grounds of his old club in Nyanga, just down the road from Mbiko's house. He picked up a rugby ball and jogged around the muddy, balding pitch practising some dummy passes, his cropped white hair flashing in the sun. He somehow managed not to sully his immaculate black leather shoes and dark suit trousers.
His big frame had put on weight around the middle, but he was clearly still fighting fit.
Mphakamisi Zali, 24, who plays for the club, joined his longtime hero, and they passed the ball between them.
""It's nice to have a legend like him back on our [rugby] pitch,"" Zali said. ""I don't think he ever got the recognition he deserves.""
Black South Africans' relationship with rugby has long been fraught. Such was the resentment of the country's white rugby establishment, township crowds would cheer the Springboks' opponents – ""we wanted anyone but them to win,"" Cona said. A spokesman for SA Rugby, the sport's current governing body, declined to comment on its apartheid-era predecessor.
When Cona was playing back in the 1970s and early 1980s, tour cancellations and international boycotts of the racially segregated South African teams were mounting. Back home, anti-apartheid protests were erupting across the country.
Morne du Plessis, a Springbok star from that era who would later play with Cona in a veterans team after apartheid ended, gives an idea of the conflicted feelings of some players at that time.
""That was the pinnacle of your rugby achievement, to be a Springbok, albeit in a divided country,"" Du Plessis, who was captain of the national team, told Reuters by telephone.
As international protests gathered steam, he said many players were forced to reflect on the system in which they had been indoctrinated. ""For many of us, it was a realisation that this couldn't go on.""
In an effort to placate public opinion, the rugby board that governed the players started making small concessions to non-racial sport.
In 1976, it created a mixed team – not the official one – to play the visiting New Zealand team in Cape Town. Cona participated.
He shared a hotel room with two of his white teammates, Springbok stars Moaner van Heerden and Richard Prentis. Cona remembers that they joked and laughed like equals, and talked endlessly of their passion: rugby.
Though they set aside racial tensions, Cona had started to develop a budding resentment of how apartheid had consistently denied him the opportunities his white colleagues had had.
""It was the same story every time. I was denied an opportunity,"" he said of being unable to play for the Springboks. ""I'm not saying I'm a superstar, but when I watch the rugby now, I can see I'm better than some of the guys who are being selected in my position.""
Such was the case with all sports, but in rugby the discrimination was worsened by the absurd perception of rugby as a ""white"" sport, said Hendrik Snyders, a sports historian at the National Museum in Bloemfontein.
""In reality, the game in Black communities – both African and coloured – dates back to the late 1890s,"" he said. ""There's a whole line of very able players like Broadness.""
""I CRIED THE WHOLE NIGHT""
South Africa has suffered, so far, the worst COVID-19 pandemic in Africa – with more than 685,000 cases and over 17,000 deaths.
The virus brought the country's lingering problems into sharp relief: The extreme inequalities in economic opportunity established under apartheid have actually worsened in the quarter-century since it ended, according to International Monetary Fund data. Healthcare is a stark lottery in South Africa, with a world-class private system for those who can afford it, and an overburdened public one for the mostly Black citizens who cannot.
Cona's friends and family persuaded him to go to hospital to get a COVID-19 test on May 15, 2020, when Cape Town was at the heart of South Africa's epidemic.
He was ill, he couldn't eat, and he struggled to walk. His daughter, Kholiswa, and a friend of his took him to a health centre in the friend's car, where he tested negative, but his breathing was bad and he had pre-existing high blood pressure. They referred him to another clinic for a second test the following day.
The night he tested positive, Cona was transferred to Groote Schuur Hospital, one of South Africa's best public hospitals, which in 1967 had completed the world's first human-to-human heart transplant. Though the hospital was under strain with COVID-19 cases at the time, it was coping better than many public hospitals at the epidemic's peak.
When Kholiswa got the news of her father's result, she called her older brother, Morgan, who had moved to Queenstown in South Africa's Eastern Cape province, and they ruminated on the worst.
""I cried the whole night. He's 73, it was the time when everybody was going to hospital, it was the peak,"" Kholiswa said. ""He's got an underlying condition. The elderly were dying. I thought, 'No, he's gone.'""
But Cona wasn't giving up.
""I told the nurse: 'All these years I've been playing rugby and people were tackling me, and often I didn't fall. No one is tackling me now: I am NOT going to fall.'""
Finally, after days of forcing himself out of his hospital bed on his training regime, Cona started to feel better around the start of June. He could feel the oxygen returning to his lungs, and he felt fitter and more vital. Three weeks after being admitted, a fully recovered Cona went for a last medical exam before being transferred to a quarantine facility.
""You're a fighter,"" the doctor examining him said.
The day after he arrived at his quarantine hotel, he got a pleasant surprise: Morgan had travelled from Queenstown with his wife, Joyce, and Kholiswa to welcome him out. They weren't allowed in, but Cona's balcony had a view of the parking lot next to the hotel beach, and he could see Morgan and wave while talking to him on his phone.
""You are very lucky to see me, because there are no visitors,"" he told Morgan. ""I'm very happy about that,"" came the reply down the phone line.
INVICTUS
On a recent day, Cona went for a visit at Mbiko's house. Age has taken its toll on the 75-year-old. He has Parkinson's and needs a walker to move around, but he's still proudly wearing a Springbok jersey. They remain close friends.
Mbiko had made quite a career for himself as a coach after retiring, including on the coaching team for the legendary 1995 Rugby World Cup. South Africa won the cup at home, in front of a huge crowd of Black and white South Africans, all screaming for the Springboks. Du Plessis, by then retired from playing, was the manager.
In the game, celebrated in the 2009 movie ""Invictus,"" starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon, the Springboks overcame seemingly impossible odds in beating the world-leading New Zealand team.
In what was widely seen as one of Mandela's most unifying gestures after being elected president a year earlier, at the game he donned the Springbok jersey, which until then had been associated among Blacks with apartheid oppressors who'd imprisoned him for 27 years.
The team had only one non-white player, Chester Williams (NYSE:WMB).
Cona and his rugby friends watched the game live on TV at Mbiko's house, a part of which doubles up as a tavern. Cona remembers most people initially cheering for the New Zealand team, but at some point the camera cut to Mandela in his green jersey. Someone said, ""Hey, let's do it for the old man,"" he recalled, and within minutes the whole tavern was unanimously behind the Springboks.
For then-Springbok captain Francois Pienaar, it wasn't until the game was over that he realised the significance of the victory.
""It was insane,"" he told Reuters in a phone interview. ""We didn't realise the impact it would have. Twenty-five years later, I still think to myself how lucky we were … to unify our country like that.""
After a brief honeymoon period following the World Cup final, disillusionment swiftly set in among Cape Town's Black rugby players. Decades of apartheid-era neglect was going to take a lot of money to fix, and the government had other priorities besides rugby.
In an effort to reverse segregation, teams from Black townships were required to play teams in richer, mostly white areas, and vice versa. But they had no resources to compete – they were still practicing on poor fields with no equipment.
Pienaar said the euphoria in the wake of the World Cup win ""put too much pressure"" on South Africa to quickly fix its entrenched problems.
Most of the players couldn't even afford the bus fares to travel to these faraway stadiums, Cona said. Although rugby, like life, in South Africa was no longer legally segregated, most urban Blacks remained too poor to live anywhere else but in their townships. All the best Black talent swiftly abandoned the township teams to join the better-resourced clubs. Within a few years, most of the clubs that had first stoked Cona's passion for the sport had either collapsed or been merged into one megaclub.
""We expected in our townships we would have the same facilities like those in the white areas, but that never happened,"" Cona said. ""Our fields are still the same fields like before the unity. We knew it wouldn't be overnight, but it's been years now.""
Andy Colquhoun, spokesman for SA Rugby, said, ""We have learnt that the idea of any South African sporting federation being able to create a mass-participation project that reaches every community is impossible.""
He added, ""It's a sad fact that only a minority of South Africa's 25,000 schools provide any kind of sport to their learners, and we know that Springboks are made in schools.""
He pointed with pride to the grass-roots program called Get Into Rugby, but added: ""With 170,000 children participating in a normal year, we know it is just scratching the surface. But we'd need hundreds of millions of rands to reach everyone,"" compared with a current outlay of more than 50 million rand ($3 million) a year.
Last year, South Africa won the Rugby World Cup final for a third time, with its first Black captain, Siya Kolisi – who grew up in a township near Port Elizabeth and often went to bed hungry as a child – receiving the trophy.
""These are things you never thought you would see in South Africa,"" Cona said. ""We were so excited; it tells us we are heading in the right direction.""
Still, full integration in rugby, as in society as a whole, remains mostly an aspiration. The country is three-quarters Black and nearly 10% coloured, but just 11 non-white players were part of the 31-man squad in the World Cup tournament.
A BATTLE LOST
On June 13, a Saturday, Cona arrived home to Gugulethu to a hero's welcome, organised by his local walkers' club. He was overjoyed. After the celebrations, at 9 p.m. that evening, his son, Morgan called: He'd just tested positive for the coronavirus.
Like his father, Morgan had high blood pressure, but Cona wasn't worried: If an old man like him could survive, his son should be fine. The clinic had even sent him home to self-isolate, concluding that his case was mild.
On Sunday, Cona phoned him back. Morgan's wife, Joyce, picked up the phone and said he was too ill to come to the phone.
On Monday, Morgan phoned Cona to say he was getting worse. He sounded awful: He was struggling to breathe and suffering headaches. Later, Joyce called to say Morgan had been admitted to a private hospital in Queenstown, as a precaution, although his temperature was back to normal and he seemed on the path to recovery.
On Tuesday morning at 4:45 a.m., Cona was at Kholiswa's house when Joyce called Kholiswa's mobile. Cona approached, anxious for news on Morgan. ""I knew something was wrong. Joyce was crying.""
Seconds passed before Joyce delivered the news: Morgan had died overnight.
""That was the sad part,"" he said. He moved his gaze to the window and didn't speak for a long moment.

Then, finally, he said: ""Morgan was so worried about me when I was in the hospital. But in the end, I was fine. I won the battle."" Another pause. ""He didn't.""

Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said Zuma would be required to appear on Nov. 16-20, adding that this could be via videolink if appropriate arrangements were made.
The inquiry was set up more than two years ago to test allegations that Zuma allowed the Gupta brothers, friends of his, to plunder state resources and influence government appointments during his nine years in power.
""The secretary of the commission is hereby authorised and directed to sign and issue a summons ... requiring Mr Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma, former president of the Republic of South Africa, to appear"" on Nov. 16-20 to give evidence, Zondo said.
Zuma, who appeared at the inquiry in July 2019, denied he had broken the law with the Guptas. [nL8N24G25C]
The inquiry's evidence leaders have tried to get Zuma to appear this year to answer more questions but he has not done so.
Zuma has said through his lawyers that he was unable to attend the inquiry. His reasons have included that he was preparing for a criminal trial and that his doctors had advised him to limit his movements during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Zuma said through his lawyers last month that Zondo was biased against him and he would apply for Zondo's recusal.
The Guptas have refuted allegations of wrongdoing. They left South Africa around the time Zuma was ousted by the governing African National Congress in February 2018.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's army on Friday denied using nearly a thousand Twitter accounts blocked by the social media company, which said they were linked to the army and had targeted the political opposition.
In its first such move against Thailand-based accounts, Twitter said it had ""permanently suspended"" 926 accounts linked to the Royal Thai Army (RTA) for violating its manipulation policies. 
""These accounts were engaging in amplifying pro-RTA and pro-government content, as well as engaging in behaviour targeting prominent political opposition figures,"" it said in a statement. 
In response, Deputy Army Spokeswoman Sirichan Ngathong said the accounts were anonymous and did not belong to the army - which had only its official account.
""The issue of information operations is a misunderstanding. We don't do this. It's not one of our objectives for using Twitter,"" she told reporters.
Thailand's army ruled from a 2014 coup until elections last year, when junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha stayed on as prime minister - rejecting the complaints of critics that the ballot was a facade to keep the military's hands on power. 
The army had previously dismissed opposition accusations it was carrying out information operations through social media - which has been a powerful rallying force for anti-government protesters over the past three months.
The blocked accounts appeared to have had limited influence. 
Data from Twitter showed that more than two thirds of them had no followers. A study by Stanford Internet Observatory, a research group at Stanford University, said more than half of the accounts never tweeted and most of the tweets had no engagement. 
""This was a coordinated but low-impact operation,"" it said in an analysis.
Twitter also took down accounts it said were linked to the governments of Iran, Saudi Arabia, Cuba, and Russia.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Marcellina Akpojotor weaves past thumping sewing machines, and leaves a Lagos shop with a bag brimming with discarded fabric. The colourful pieces, which would typically be burned or thrown into the Nigerian city's lagoon as waste, find a second life in the hands of the artist. 
Akpojotor, 31, creates portraits using discarded pieces of ankara, a brightly coloured African fabric that is ubiquitous from the slums of Lagos to high-powered meetings in the capital, Abuja. She says the meaning of the cloth helped fuel her work. 
""I was so inspired by those materials,"" she said. ""In this part of the world we use them to celebrate all kinds of festivity: burial, naming ceremony, wedding"".
Nigeria's economy runs on oil, which pumps in billions of dollars, but its fashion, art and film are ascending, feeding national pride. 
Ankara, inspired by Indonesian batik, was originally manufactured in the Netherlands, but became wildly popular in West Africa in the 1800s. Global fashion houses have used it for nearly a decade, and prices for African artwork have risen by 70% to 100% over the past 10 years, according to London auction house Bonhams. 
Akpojotor's work combines art and fashion on canvas, complimented with acrylic paint. A sketch of a woman's profile comes to life as she carefully adds tiny slivers of fabric to colour her skin, lips and clothing. Another canvas features a child playing, her form in bright swatches, casting a shadow.
""There's a common ground between you and the work because it is fabric, it is something that you know,"" she said. 
She has sold pieces for as much as $25,000. Kehinde Afolabi, associate director of Lagos's Rele Gallery, found Akpojotor on social media and first featured her pieces in 2017. 

""You can't find anybody doing similar art,"" Afolbai said. ""It is mind blowing, how somebody can take waste and create something out of it.""

Indonesia, the world's biggest producer of palm oil and nickel ore for electric vehicle batteries, has forests bigger than any outside the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Congo, and environmentalists say the country's abundant natural reserves could be exploited under the new law.
The reforms are contained in a so-called “omnibus” bill of changes in more than 70 laws, which allowed parliament to vote in a single swoop and pass the measure on Monday.
Thousands of people took to the streets of cities across Indonesia over the past three days, part of protests and national strikes against the law.
The government says the law is needed to improve the investment climate and create jobs in Southeast Asia's largest economy. It says the environment will be protected.
Here are some of the changes to environmental rules: 
AMDAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL PERMITS
The new law merges the approval of business permits with environmental permits.
To get an environmental permit under the previous legislation, companies exploiting natural resources had to produce an AMDAL - a study to assess the impact investments have on the environment and local communities. 
The new AMDAL process has removed a requirement for companies to consult environmental experts by only allowing ""directly impacted communities"" to give input for the assessment. 
""Sure, it (AMDAL) is still there, but it is weakened,"" Asep Komaruddin, a senior forest campaigner at Greenpeace, told Reuters. 
Environment Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar says undermining environmental laws will now incur more risk to a company as its business permit would also be on the line.
MINIMUM FOREST AREA 
The previous law required Indonesian islands have a forest cover of at least 30%. This requirement has been removed, raising concerns that palm oil plantations and mining companies could sharply step up land clearance. 
The law risks provinces like Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra, home to massive palm oil plantations, losing natural forests within 20 years, environmental group The Sustainable Madani Foundation said.
""Losing forests is more than just losing tree cover,"" said Teguh Surya, the foundation's executive director. 
""(It also means) increasing intensity of forest fires, floods and landslides, harvest failures, a lack of clean water"".
Bambang Hendroyono, an environment ministry official, said the previous 30% threshold was ""unscientific"" and would be replaced by new metrics. 
The new law calls for minimum forest areas to be based on ""geophysics"", and ""socioeconomic conditions"", but does not provide any specifics. 
PENALTIES FOR FOREST FIRES, DUMPING TOXIC WASTE
In previous regulations, companies were responsible for environmental damage in their concessions, even if there was no proof that the company was at fault.
This is known in legal terms as ""strict liability"".
Environmentalists say the wording of the section is vague under the new law and proof of wrongdoing is now required to prosecute the company. 
Officials say this is to provide legal certainty in criminal investigations but environmentalists are worried it weakens an article commonly used to prosecute companies for forest fires caused by negligence.
The new law also removes criminal punishment for the illegal handling of toxic waste. 
""(Toxic waste) dumping is illegal in America, Netherlands, Europe, even China. It was in Indonesia, but now no longer,"" Andri Wibisana, law professor with the University of Indonesia said. 
While the new law does not criminalise illegal toxic waste dumping specifically, it does prosecute those who dispose toxic waste that causes harm to the environment.
INVESTORS FIGHT BACK 
Banks like Citibank and ANZ say if the new jobs law is implemented well, there will be a better investment climate for Indonesia.
However, 35 global investors managing $4.1 trillion in assets have warned the new law may backfire in light of investors' growing desire for environmental protections.
""Efforts to stimulate foreign investment by... easing restrictions on clearing land in palm oil concessions, are counter-intuitive,"" said a spokesman for Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE:SMFG) Trust Asset Management, part of the alliance of investors. 
Their opposition to the law however, does not mean they would dump Indonesian assets they hold, but the law could lower Indonesia's market attractiveness. 

Satu Kahkonen, World Bank Country Director Indonesia and Timor Leste, said in July that the reforms would ""move Indonesia's environmental legislation further away from international best practices and this is not basically helping Indonesia"".

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - Domestic tourism in China saw a robust rebound over the just-ended Golden Week holiday, encouraged by the country's success in stamping out the novel coronavirus, although levels were still well short of last year.
Tourism sites were visited by 637 million domestic tourists over the eight-day National Day holiday that started Oct. 1, 79% of last year's total, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday. 
Domestic tourism revenues stood at 466.56 billion yuan ($68.7 billion), it added, down from nearly 650 billion yuan a year earlier. 
That, however, marked an improvement from China's last long holiday period over May 1-5 for Labour Day, when 115 million domestic tourists travelled and tourism revenues were only 47.56 billion yuan. 
Since then, COVID-19 cases have ebbed, with no new community transmissions in mainland China since early August. 
""The quick rebound may have alleviated concerns about China's growth momentum, but it is too early to be complacent,"" Betty Wang, senior China economist at ANZ, wrote in a note. 
The October Golden Week figures undershot last year's levels, even though the holiday period was extended this year by a day as it overlapped with China's mid-autumn festival.
The figures also defied some expectations that domestic tourism would be much stronger with cross-border travel restrictions and a dearth of international flights deterring millions of Chinese nationals from overseas trips. 
""Tourism revenue during the holiday period only rebounded to 69.9% of last year,"" Wang said, noting core inflation trended lower year-on-year to 0.5% growth in July and August, the lowest level since 2010.
The soft CPI growth suggests domestic demand remained fragile.
""We failed to see a so-called retaliatory rebound (in consumption),"" said Zhang Qidi, visiting researcher at the Center of International Finance Studies at the Central University of Finance Studies in Beijing. 
Zhang does not expect consumer spending to perform strongly in the near term, noting that middle and low-income households have been hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic. 
Household income fell 1.3% on the year as of end-June versus a 5.8% increase at end-December, according to official data. 
""It will still take a long time for income growth to return to normal,"" Zhang said.
Separate data from the commerce ministry showed average daily sales at key retail and catering enterprises rose 4.9% over the October holiday period from a year earlier, with sales totalling 1.6 trillion yuan ($238 billion). 
It also noted strong car sales growth in some areas around the country, with sales in Beijing 23.5% higher.
Car trips featured prominently this year, according to state media, contributing to highway congestion and also indicating continued caution over coronavirus transmissions and outbreaks.

Maduro last week delivered the ""anti-blockade"" bill on Tuesday to the assembly, a parallel legislature he created to bypass the opposition-controlled congress.
""We can provide President Nicolas Maduro with a legal instrument to continue fighting, confronting the blockade,"" said Diosdado Cabello, the assembly's president and the vice president of the ruling Socialist Party.
The law will allow changes to the ownership of joint ventures between state oil company PDVSA private companies, but does not say what percentage of participation PDVSA would have in future joint ventures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Less than a month before the election, U.S. President Donald Trump's abrupt vow to bring home troops from Afghanistan by year-end is a sign of how he may feel increasingly unchained to push through a foreign policy ""wish list"" he hopes could appeal to voters, current and former officials say.
Trump, a former businessman from New York who boasts about his deal-making skills, has made finishing up what he has called ""ridiculous endless wars"" a cornerstone of his foreign policy.
But the Republican, trailing Democratic candidate Joe Biden in opinion polls, still has thousands of troops in Iraq, Syria and the site of America's longest war, Afghanistan.
Trump, confined to the White House where he is being treated for COVID-19, on Wednesday tweeted that all U.S. troops in Afghanistan should be ""home by Christmas,"" just hours after his national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, said Washington would reduce its forces in Afghanistan to 2,500 by early next year.
Trump's tweet caught the National Security Council, State Department and Pentagon by surprise, according to three U.S. officials, and they fear that it could reduce the limited leverage the Afghan government has in talks with the Taliban.
""A lot of different scenarios have been discussed, but we weren't expecting this,"" one of the officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said. 
A second official, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump's remarks often underscore his desires and broad intentions, instead of any actual plans. He made a similar surprise announcement on withdrawal from Syria two years ago, yet hundreds of U.S. troops remain.
Yet U.S. officials say they are concerned that Trump, in the run-up to the Nov. 3 election, may make moves to score political points that could alienate allies, undermine his own administration's efforts and upend assumptions about America's national security agenda. 
Officials said that no formal orders had been given based on Trump's tweet and they would be surprised if any moves would be made before the election. 
The military will almost certainly balk at being pushed too quickly to carry out a complete withdrawal, given the need to remove or destroy sensitive equipment, shutter bases and safely exit where it once had more than 100,000 troops.
TALIBAN CHEERS
Still, a complete withdrawal is on the horizon. A landmark deal between the United States and the Taliban in February said foreign forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government.
But Trump and other officials had previously said the United States would go down to between 4,000 and 5,000 troops in Afghanistan around November and a reduction beyond that would depend on conditions in the country - wording that reflects deep U.S. national concerns over al Qaeda and Islamic State elements there.
The Taliban cheered Trump's tweet, calling it ""a positive step"" toward fulfilling U.S. pledges.
Even if Trump does not follow through, the tweet is likely to weaken the Afghan government's position in talks with the Taliban. 
Laurel Miller, who served as acting U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said Trump appears to have put his re-election bid above U.S. national security concerns and relations with allies, who serve alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan.

""This is once again taking a sledgehammer to U.S. credibility around the world,"" Miller said.

CANCUN, Mexico (Reuters) - Tourists from around the globe thronged Cancun's international airport on Thursday, shunning social distancing norms, a day after Hurricane Delta hit the Mexican beach resort and forced mass evacuations, hotel closures and flight cancellations.
The terminal building seethed with thousands of cramped tourists, crying babies and even barking dogs. The screen board, flanked by a long line of travelers struggling to reach a check-in counter, showed at least a dozen canceled flights.
Even after spending hours in line, many tourists found themselves stranded.
For 28-year-old New Jersey native Anthony Ricci, an idyllic Caribbean vacation had turned into a nightmare.
Ricci tried to fly to the United States on Tuesday before Delta arrived, but could not get a flight.
His departure was changed to Thursday, and he spent two days at a shelter for evacuated tourists, unable to contact family and friends because his phone was stolen.
""Finally I came here today hoping to leave, waited in line for hours, and just for them to tell me their computers are down and I can't get on the plane,"" said Ricci. ""It's a madhouse!""
Other tourists fretted the crowding could feed the spread of coronavirus in Mexico, which has recorded almost 83,000 fatalities from COVID-19, the fourth highest globally.
""This is too many people. Even though we're wearing masks, it's still not social distancing,"" said Houston-based 29-year-old reggaeton and hip hop artist BBK Phat.
""I don't think I'm going to make my flight on time because there are so many people,"" said Phat, who was traveling with his wife, children and sister.
Though the Yucatan peninsula, home to Cancun, largely dodged a bullet as Delta weakened before coming ashore, streets were littered with downed trees and power lines, shop windows were blown in and the city was left in the dark.
Almost as fast as the hurricane blew through, soldiers, police, and municipal workers started clearing up.

After tidying up her store, 52-year-old shopkeeper Dolores Jasso was busy selling souvenirs to tourists returning to the beach. ""We've got to get going because this is what we live off,"" she said.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday temporarily allowed a drug used for medication-induced abortions to be mailed or delivered during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The court declined to act on a request by the Trump administration asking to reinstate a U.S. Food and Drug Administration rule, suspended by a federal judge in July, that required women to visit a hospital or clinic to obtain the drug.
The order was unusual in that it neither granted nor denied the government's request. 
The court instead ordered that the judge should ""promptly consider"" within 40 days whether his ruling should be withdrawn or amended due to changed circumstances on the ground. The court did not elaborate.
U.S. Judge Theodore Chuang in Greenbelt, Maryland, blocked the FDA's rule as litigation continues in lower courts. Chuang had ruled that the in-person requirements ""place a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a medication abortion"" and likely violate their constitutional rights.
The Trump administration's application was filed before the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, which has left the court with only eight justices and a 5-3 conservative majority. Two conservative justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, noted that they would have granted the application.

The confirmation hearing for Trump's nominee to replace Ginsburg, conservative Judge Amy Coney Barrett, begins next week.

In the latest escalation of tensions between the two administrations, the government said it would hold an extraordinary cabinet meeting on Friday morning to decree the state of emergency if Madrid does not impose the restrictions or request intervention.
Following a Health Ministry order, Madrid authorities reluctantly barred all non essential travel in and out of the city and nine surrounding towns last Friday to curb the spread of COVID-19 in one of Europe's worst virus hotspots.
But a Madrid regional court on Thursday annulled the measures, ruling the government had overstepped its mandate and the restrictions interfered with fundamental human rights.[
Declaring a state of emergency - the same legal framework that underpinned Spain's tough lockdown during the first wave of the virus - would grant the national government the powers to restrict movement.
According to a government statement, Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told Madrid's conservative regional leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso that she must either enforce the restrictions or request a state of emergency, or the central government would unilaterally impose one.
""In any of the three cases the measures would be exactly the same as those already being applied, the only thing that would change would be the legal instrument,"" the statement said.
Ayuso said regional officials would discuss alternatives on Friday morning. 
""We hope to agree on a solution that benefits citizens and provides clarity,"" she said in a statement.
Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party, said he would call a nationwide protest on Monday if a new state of emergency was passed. 

""Spaniards won't let themselves be imprisoned again,"" he tweeted.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday slapped fresh sanctions on Iran's financial sector, targeting 18 banks in an effort to further choke off Iranian revenues as Washington ramps up pressure on Tehran weeks ahead of the U.S. election.
The move freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them, while extending secondary sanctions to those who do business with them. This means foreign banks risk losing access to the U.S. market and financial system.
The Treasury Department said in a statement the prohibitions did not apply to transactions to sell agricultural commodities, food, medicine or medical devices to Iran, saying it understood the need for humanitarian goods.
However, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the United States of targeting Iran's ability to pay for basic necessities during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""U.S. regime wants to blow up our remaining channels to pay for food & medicine,"" Zarif said on Twitter. ""Conspiring to starve a population is a crime against humanity.""
Iranian Central Bank governor Abdolnaser Hemmati dismissed the sanctions as political propaganda and played down their practical impact.
""Rather than having any economic effect, the American move is for U.S. domestic propaganda and political purposes, and shows the falsity of the human rights and humanitarian claims of U.S. leaders,"" Hemmati said in a statement.
Analysts said the secondary sanctions may further deter European and other foreign banks from working with Iran, even for permitted humanitarian transactions.
""It's like a punch in the face to the Europeans, who have gone out of their way to indicate to the Americans that they view it as being extremely threatening to humanitarian assistance or humanitarian trade going to Iran,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg of the Center for a New American Security think tank.
""They also want ... to make it very difficult for any future president to be able to unwind these measures and engage in nuclear diplomacy,"" Rosenberg added, alluding to the possibility that Democratic candidate Joe Biden could defeat Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 U.S. election.
Biden, who was vice president when the Obama administration negotiated the nuclear accord, has said he would rejoin the deal if Iran first resumed compliance with it.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have soared since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor and began re-imposing U.S. sanctions that had been eased under the accord.
The sanctions Trump has reinstated target everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities. While they exempt food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies, many foreign banks are already deterred from doing business with the Islamic Republic - including for humanitarian deals.
Washington's latest move targeted what the Treasury described as 18 major Iranian banks, which were designated under authorities including U.S. Executive Order 13902, which allows the Treasury Department to target entire sectors of the Iranian economy.

It named them as Amin Investment Bank, Bank Keshavarzi Iran, Bank Maskan, Bank Refah Kargaran, Bank-e Shahr, Eghtesad Novin Bank, Gharzolhasaneh Resalat Bank, Hekmat Iranian Bank, Iran Zamin Bank, Karafarin Bank, Khavarmianeh Bank, Mehr Iran Credit Union Bank, Pasargad Bank, Saman Bank, Sarmayeh Bank, Tosee Taavon Bank, Tourism Bank and Islamic Regional Cooperation Bank.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex filed a lawsuit in July alleging that unnamed paparazzi photographers used drones and helicopters to take ""illegal"" photos of their son, Archie, at the family's private residence in California when he was 14 months old.
Court documents filed with Los Angeles County Superior Court on Thursday said photo agency X17 had agreed to stop distributing the images, which showed Archie with his maternal grandmother in a garden at the family's residence, and to turn over the original pictures and all copies. 
In addition, X17 apologized to the family.
""We apologize to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their son for the distress we have caused,"" X17 said in a statement. ""We were wrong to offer these photographs and commit to not doing so again.""
The agency also agreed to pay a portion of the family's legal fees, according to a Michael Kump, an attorney for the couple. 
""This is a successful outcome,"" Kump said in a statement. ""All families have a right, protected by law, to feel safe and secure at home.""

Meghan, Harry and Archie now live in Los Angeles after the couple stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March to forge new careers. They moved out of Britain after growing hostility to the media's intense coverage of their private life.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The Chilean government is keeping close tabs on a large fleet of Chinese fishing vessels that has stirred up controversy further north along the Pacific coast of South America, Foreign Minister Andres Allamand said on Thursday.
Allamand said Chile´s Defense Ministry and Navy were monitoring the advance of the fleet in order to protect the ""sovereignty"" of the country´s exclusive economic zone. 
The fleet consists of some 300 ships that frequent the Pacific Ocean, often around Peruvian waters, Allamand said. 
The boats, previously fishing for giant squid near the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands off Ecuador, angered the domestic fishing industry in Peru last month and sparked a Twitter war between Washington and Beijing.
The U.S. Embassy in Lima said in September the Chinese vessels had a history of avoiding tracking and seemed to ""be dumping plastic"" pollutants. The Chinese embassy responded that it attached great importance to protecting the environment and the ocean. ""We hope that the Peruvian public is not deceived by false information,"" it said on Twitter.
Chile´s foreign minister said that Chilean officials had not made contact with the Chinese government. He said the fleet includes private ships ""and some that may have some connection with the state.""
Chile´s long Pacific coastline offers an abundance of fish and shellfish, a critical source of income for fishermen in communities throughout the country.

""I fear a civil war and what is happening in terms of carrying arms and what we are seeing in terms of military displays in the street ... means the collapse of the state,"" Hariri said in a TV interview.
Lebanon's financial meltdown since last year has wiped out the value of the currency and sent inflation soaring. It has fuelled unrest in a country where divisions run deep since a war fought along sectarian lines. 
Hariri, a Western ally traditionally aligned with Gulf states, also said Lebanon had no way out of the crisis other than a programme with the International Monetary Fund. 
IMF talks stalled earlier this year over disputes among Lebanese government officials, bankers and political parties about the scale of the country's vast financial losses. 
Hariri added he would only return as prime minister if there was agreement by Lebanon's many fractious politicians on securing an IMF deal.
Huge protests - by people furious at the ruling elite they accused of corruption - toppled his government around a year ago.
Wrangling among Lebanese parties blocked talks on a new cabinet last month, in a blow to a French effort to pull the nation out of crisis. The outgoing government quit over the explosion at Beirut port which killed nearly 200 people and wrecked the capital in August. 

Foreign donors have made clear there will be no fresh aid unless the heavily indebted state begins reforms it has long ignored to tackle waste and corruption.

Romanian state-owned nuclear power producer Nuclearelectrica (BX:ROSNN) ended talks with China General Nuclear (CGN) about the construction of the two reactors in June after they had dragged on for six years.
The firm has two 706 megawatt reactors, which account for roughly a fifth of Romania's power production, and it wants to add two more. It also needs to refurbish the first unit.
Economy Minister Virgil Popescu will sign an intergovernmental cooperation agreement with U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette for the refurbishment and the building of two new units, Zuckerman told a conference.
""This $8 billion project will be a paradigm for future Romanian-American economic and energy development projects,"" he said, adding Popescu will also meet Exim Bank president Kimberley Reed to sign a memorandum of understanding for the financing of the nuclear units and other projects.
""The financing package is the largest financing package ever received by Romania to date,"" he said.
The Romanian government, economy ministry and Nuclearelectrica did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Nuclearelectrica had initially planned to build the two reactors in partnership with six European energy firms. Those firms withdrew one by one between 2010 and 2013, feeling the impact of Europe's then debt crisis and project delays.
China's CGN filed a non-binding bid to partner with Romania in the project in 2014, but the negotiations, which included price guarantees, had progressed only very slowly.
Nuclearelectrica, in which Romania's economy ministry has an 80% stake, has a market capitalisation of 4.95 billion lei ($1.20 billion).

“It’s impossible to make taxation levels exactly the same” as places where social security costs aren’t as high, Kenji Nakanishi said in an interview Wednesday. “But we often hear that even a small change would make a difference and the government needs to send some kind of clear message.”
Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, who took office last month and appointed Nakanishi, sees a need to make Japan more inviting for overseas financiers as part of his reform agenda. This week he said he wants to speed up efforts to cut some taxes to this end and make more business services available in English.
The need for companies to diversify their operations in the coronavirus era also helps create a window of opportunity for Japan to push its goal of becoming an international finance hub, Nakanishi said.
Higher income taxes, a largely non-English-language working environment and an economy growing much more slowly than high-flying China have made banks and investment funds less willing to locate big offices in Japan. A full day’s outage on the Tokyo Stock Exchange due to a system failure last week also dented the city’s reputation as a financial center.
How One Piece of Hardware Took Down a $6 Trillion Stock Market
Nakanishi said the lack of a shock reaction among the international community over the outage was a worrying sign of continued lukewarm interest in setting up in Japan.
The Financial Services Agency last month proposed that lawmakers consider allowing privately held companies to expense bonuses paid to executives, a double-whammy benefit that would effectively lower corporate taxes and encourage higher payouts.
The FSA is also proposing exemptions from some parts of Japan’s onerous inheritance taxes that can hit long-term foreign residents even on assets and cash bequeathed abroad.

Nakanishi said tax cuts and other tweaks to regulations ultimately matter less than whether Japan can bring back business opportunities for firms, and raise the country’s productivity.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's foreign ministry is gaming out scenarios for the U.S. election and what the implications could be, especially if the aftermath is unpredictable, five sources familiar with the matter said.
Ottawa is talking to other members of the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations who are working on similar initiatives that plan out responses to various election outcomes, one source said.
The sources said officials were looking at scenarios ranging from a straightforward win by either Republican President Donald Trump or Democratic opponent Joe Biden to more complicated outcomes where the result is contested or delayed.
Insiders cite concern in Ottawa about the potential for economic disruption to highly integrated supply chains, especially for the auto industry. Canada is particularly vulnerable, given that 75% of its goods and services exports go to the United States.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's office declined to comment on the scenarios.
Canada's ambassador in Washington, Kirsten Hillman, is playing a central role, said the sources, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation and declined to give precise details as to what they were looking at. Hillman's office declined an interview request.
Trudeau said Canada was looking at political polarization in the United States with some concern.
""We're all watching the U.S. election with close attention because of its potential impact on the Canadian economy and on Canadians,"" he told reporters on Thursday.
""If it (the result) is less clear there may be some disruptions and we need to be ready for any outcomes,"" he said.
Canadian officials are also looking at what happened in the disputed 2000 U.S. election, which took five weeks to resolve in favor of George Bush. Despite the tensions, there was no political violence.
But Trump has questioned the integrity of the electoral system many times, prompting apprehension about what his supporters might do in case of a contested or unclear result. That said, Canadian officials are not looking at extreme scenarios.
""I doubt anyone seriously would consider a flood of people making a mad dash to the border no matter how bad it gets,"" said one person familiar with the discussions inside Ottawa.
Colin Robertson, a former Canadian diplomat with several U.S. postings, said contacts at the foreign ministry told him they had already sent a memo on the matter to members of Trudeau's team. 
""There has been some concern from the prime minister's office about 'What if things went very badly, what might we do?',"" said Robertson, who is also vice president of the Canadian Global Affairs Institute.
Robertson said he had been told the concern was largely from people who had not served in the United States and therefore had a less deep understanding of U.S. institutions.
In public, Canadian officials are taking a neutral tone. 
Trudeau, who has clashed with Trump in the past, said last week that Canada was respectful of events south of the border.
""We will not be interfering or engaging in any way in their electoral processes and that includes commenting on their electoral processes,"" he told reporters.
Trudeau's team was left scrambling in 2016, as no one had predicted a Trump victory, and it rushed to respond to the implications the day after the election, according to two people directly familiar with the matter.
University of Ottawa international affairs professor Roland Paris, Trudeau's first foreign policy advisor, said Ottawa was right to stay out of U.S. politics.

""Trump has a clear track record of retaliating vindictively against anyone who says things that he doesn't like,"" he said.

A further 77 people died after testing positive for the virus within 28 days, government data showed while the number of COVID-19 patients in hospitals in England rose to 3,044 from 2,944 on Wednesday, the highest figure since June 22.
""We are seeing a definite and sustained increase in cases and admissions to hospital. The trend is clear, and it is very concerning,"" said Dr Yvonne Doyle, Medical Director for Public Health England.
""Numbers of deaths from Covid-19 are also rising so we must continue to act to reduce transmission of this virus.""
Many parts of northern England, Wales and Scotland have seen new tough restrictions on social interaction to try to curb the growing spread of the disease.
In a speech on Thursday, health minister Matt Hancock said he was very concerned about the rise in cases, adding that hospitalisations in northwest England were doubling every fortnight and had risen by 57% in the last week alone.
""We are at a perilous moment in the course of this pandemic. In parts of the country, the situation is again, becoming very serious,"" he said. 

""Unfortunately, we are seeing hospitalisations of the over-60s rising sharply and the number of deaths from coronavirus also rising.""

The opposition has said it is considering filing a lawsuit against the veteran ruler in the International Criminal Court for what it says is the harsh treatment of protesters who have taken to the streets after they say he rigged his re-election in August.
When asked on Thursday whether she wanted to see Lukashenko face the ICC, she said she could not forgive his ""atrocities"" personally but understood it should be a subject of negotiation.
""If it is the way out, for him to go somewhere to the seaside and spend his time there, I think it could be done,"" she told the Globsec Bratislava Forum in the Slovak capital. 
""Just leave us and we will build our country further. And that is it,"" said Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Lithuania shortly after the disputed vote.
Lukashenko, who denies electoral fraud, is grappling to contain two months of street protests that pose the biggest challenge to his 26-year rule. More than 13,000 people have been arrested and some later freed, while major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled.
The Belarusian government has denied abusing detainees.

The crisis has pushed Lukashenko back towards traditional ally Russia, which has propped up Belarus with loans and an offer of military support. Both have accused the West of meddling in Belarus.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Veteran Indian politician Ram Vilas Paswan, a federal minister and an ally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling coalition, died on Thursday after weeks in hospital, his son Chirag Paswan said in a Tweet. He was 74.
Paswan, India's Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, was admitted to a city hospital on Sept. 11 and underwent heart surgery on Oct. 4.
In his role as food minister, Paswan oversaw the world's biggest food welfare programme. Under its multi-billion dollar food aid, the government gives ultra-cheap rice and wheat to India's millions of poor people.
""I am saddened beyond words,"" Modi said in a Tweet reacting to news of his death. ""There is a void in our nation that will perhaps never be filled.""
In his long political career, Paswan worked with many prime ministers and served as India's mines, steel, and telecommunication and information minister among other portfolios. 
As the chief of the Lok Jan Shakti (People's Power) Party (LJP), Paswan joined Modi's right-wing National Democratic Alliance (NDA) that swept India's general election in 2014. The NDA was voted back to power with a bigger majority in 2019.
Paswan and his party represented India's socially disadvantaged classes, which make up about three-quarters of the majority Hindu population that is about 80% of India's 1.3 billion people.
The LJP enjoys considerable support in Paswan's home state of Bihar in the east.

State elections in Bihar will start at the end of October and will be spread over three days, and Chirag Paswan, a lawmaker, is leading the LJP into the voting to the state legislature.

YEREVAN/BAKU/GENEVA (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians fought with artillery and heavy guns on Thursday as the United States, France and Russia stepped up efforts to secure a ceasefire and avert a wider war in the South Caucasus.
Azerbaijan said the city of Ganja had come under fire, deep inside its territory. Ethnic Armenians who control the mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh inside Azerbaijan said Stepanakert, its main city, had been shelled by Azeri forces.
In a sign of growing alarm in the region, the head of a six-country military alliance led by Russia and including Armenia warned that the group could intervene if Armenian sovereignty were threatened.
The continued fighting and rising tension underlined the difficulties facing U.S., Russian and French officials meeting in Geneva to try to halt fighting in which at least 400 people have been killed since it broke out on Sept. 27. 
Azeri Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov was due to attend Thursday's talks in Geneva, but no direct meetings have been scheduled between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
Armenian Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan is expected to hold separate talks with U.S., French and Russian officials in Moscow on Monday. 
Washington, Paris and Moscow are co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's Minsk Group that has led mediation over Nagorno-Karabakh since 1992. 
""The position of the United States has been clear and has not changed: Both sides must cease hostilities immediately and work with the Minsk Group Co-Chairs to return to substantive negotiations as soon as possible,"" a U.S. spokesman said.
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin spoke by phone with his Azeri counterpart, Ali Asadov, on Thursday to underline the importance of restarting peace talks and establishing a ceasefire, Russian news agencies reported, citing the government.
Russia's foreign ministry said earlier on Thursday that it was in talks with Azerbaijan and Armenia to organise a possible meeting in Moscow.
No news conference was planned in Geneva, and the sides did not say where in the Swiss city they were meeting, hoping to keep details secret and boost hopes of a breakthrough.
Nagorno-Karabakh's defence ministry denied a ceasefire had been agreed to go into force on Thursday.
INTERNATIONAL CONCERN
Under international law, Nagorno-Karabakh belongs to Azerbaijan, but it is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians and broke away in a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000.
The renewed fighting has increased concern that Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, could be sucked into the conflict.
The clashes have also increased worries about the security of pipelines in Azerbaijan that carry natural gas and oil to Europe, and Moscow fears Islamist militants will enter Nagorno-Karabakh and use it as a base for which to enter Russia. 
Stanislav Zas, who heads the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) that groups Russia and five other former Soviet republics, gave no details when he said it could intervene if Armenia's sovereignty were threatened. 
But he said the group did not welcome any actions by Turkey and other countries that were aimed at fostering peace.
Azerbaijan say 31 Azeri civilians have been killed and 154 wounded since Sept. 27 but have not disclosed information about military casualties. 
Nagorno-Karabakh said 350 of its military personnel and 19 civilians have been killed.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev's main demand for a ceasefire is for Armenia to set a timetable for a withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azeri territories.
Armenia has ruled out a withdrawal from territory it considers its historic homelands. It has also accused Turkey of military involvement in the conflict and sending in mercenaries, allegations denied by Ankara.

In other fallout from the conflict, Armenia fired its National Security Service chief without giving a reason, and Azerbaijan recalled its ambassador to Greece for consultations - a tit-for-tat move after Athens withdrew its own envoy, saying Azerbaijan had accused it of tolerating militants on its soil.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament on Thursday chastised Bulgaria for flaws in respecting the rule of law, combating endemic corruption and supporting media freedom, underlining the legislature's line on defending the bloc's democratic principles.
EU lawmakers voted 358 to 277 with 56 abstentions in favour of a resolution that challenges Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's governance after almost three months of anti-graft protests in Bulgaria.
""The European Parliament deeply regrets that the developments in Bulgaria have led to significant deterioration of respect for the principles of rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights, including the independence of the judiciary, separation of powers, the fight against corruption and freedom of the media,"" the resolution said.
Thousands of Bulgarians have rallied daily since July, accusing three-times premier Borissov of eroding democratic rules and allowing corrupt practices that support oligarchs and businesses close to his centre-right GERB party.
The resolution also slams Bulgaria, the EU's poorest member, for backsliding on democratic values and abuse of EU funds, inhumane prison conditions, hostility to women, people of Romani origin, LGBTI people and other minority groups.
Bulgaria ranks as the EU's most corrupt member according to Transparency International's index. The country has dropped to 111th in terms of media freedom from 51st in 2007 when it joined the EU, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The resolution has no practical consequences other than political embarrassment for Borissov. 
But it may strengthen the EU parliament's position in talks with EU governments about the next long-term budget and recovery plan. Lawmakers have demanded that only governments respecting the rule of law be eligible for EU money.
Unlike Hungary and Poland, Bulgaria has avoided formal EU action by promising changes and setting up bodies to combat graft and overhaul the judiciary. But it has dragged its feet.
Last week the European Commission criticised Bulgaria's shortcomings on courts' independence and the lack of senior officials jailed on corruption charges in its first report on rule of law in the EU.

A classical Iranian composer and singer, he tried to stay out of politics even though he initially sang in support of the movement that toppled the country’s last monarch in 1979 and ushered in the Islamic Republic.
But in 2009, when the government cracked down on protests against the disputed election that gave a second term to hardline president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Shajarian demanded that state media refrain from playing his music. 
The government retaliated by banning Shajarian from holding concerts and releasing albums. But this appeared to only increase his appeal.
""Certainly, the grateful Iranian nation will always keep the name, memory and work of this popular artist alive in their memory,"" President Hassan Rouhani said on Twitter.
Videos on social media showed fans gathering at night outside Shajarian's hospital this week to sing one of his most popular songs.

815,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>",Israel's second lockdown carries a hefty economic price,"By Maayan Lubell, Tova Cohen and Steven Scheer
JERUSALEM/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Restaurateur Tamir Barelko has had enough.
Israel's decision last month to impose a second nationwide lockdown after a resurgence in coronavirus infections has dealt a hammer blow to the economy and the livelihoods of small business owners, Barelko says.
He launched a petition calling for small businesses to defy the lockdown and reopen from Sunday, the end of the Jewish holiday season, and has attracted more than 60,000 supporters for his campaign on Facebook (O:FB) over the past two weeks. 
The finance ministry and central bank support reopening offices of companies that can avoid face-to-face contact with customers, or employ less than 10 workers - highlighting growing tensions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the pandemic, which is set to see Israel's economy shrink this year for the first time in nearly two decades.
""The economy is breaking down, people's hope is breaking down,"" said Barelko, speaking in the Tel Aviv restaurant he runs, now empty of customers. ""If the government does not give us the opportunity to live and to provide for our families, we'll do it ourselves.""
Thousands of people have taken to the streets across Israel for almost daily protests that have built up since July, demanding Netanyahu resign over his handling of the crisis and over corruption charges he faces in court, which he denies. 
The country, with a population of nine million, has reported nearly 280,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 1,800 deaths. 
Schools and most offices, shops and restaurants are closed, unless they provide ""vital services"" such as supermarkets, pharmacies and banks, and people must stay within a kilometre from their home - harsher restrictions than in many other countries fighting a second wave.
Netanyahu had wide public backing when he imposed the first lockdown, lasting from mid-March until late May, which flattened the first wave of COVID-19. 
But as infections soared after schools and businesses reopened, the cabinet bowed to pressure from some coalition partners and watered down limited lockdowns on infection epicentres to the extent that the curbs became ineffective. 
On Sept. 18 the entire country was put under full lockdown again, extended on Wednesday until Oct. 13, a measure now widely seen as an avoidable failure for which Israelis will pay dearly.
An Israeli official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said political pressures were ""only part of the picture."" Partial restrictions would not have been sustainable in such a small, close-knit country. ""A partial lockdown is very difficult to do in Israel,"" the official said. 
Opinion polls, however, show only about a quarter of Israelis have confidence in government policies to contain the spread of the virus.
""The second lockdown signals to investors and consumers that this is a whole different story, the health crisis is much worse,"" said Momi Dahan, an economist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""(It) also signals that the management of the crisis is poor and amateur."" 
Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron told Army Radio on Thursday that the government's decision making ""could certainly have been more orderly."" 
Israel's economy tipped into recession in the second quarter and is set to shrink by 6% this year, the OECD forecast in a report published on Sept. 23, its worst performance ever, as lockdowns depress business activity and consumer confidence.
Without a budget in place amid political bickering, Israel has fewer resources to deal with the crisis. So far it has allocated 100 billion shekels ($29 billion) on measures including aid to businesses whose revenue has fallen by at least 25% due to the pandemic.
SLOW RECOVERY
Economists initially predicted the economy would rebound quickly from the pandemic, but the OECD now cautions ""the recovery will be slow,"" forecasting gross domestic product will grow by only 2.1% in 2021.
Daily infections of COVID-19 have dropped from around 8,000 to below 5,000 since the second lockdown began, but Netanyahu has said restrictions could persist for many more months. 
""There is cautious optimism that the lockdown is working but it is too early to say,"" Netanyahu said on Twitter on Thursday. ""I will continue to make the right decisions and do what is right for you, the citizens of Israel. I will not bow to political pressure from either side, from inside the government or outside it.""
But pressure is growing.
""It is important we resume activity of the small businesses,"" Yaron told Army Radio. ""Businesses that don't receive customers, where data has not shown high infection risk, comprise almost 10% of the workforce and product - almost 400,000 workers."" 
Asked if he thought they should open, Yaron replied: ""Yes.""
The finance ministry said on Tuesday that small businesses and businesses that don't serve customers should reopen from next week, after the Sukkot holiday.
Israel's unemployment rate has tripled since the first quarter of this year to above 11%, a 15-year high, and the finance ministry's chief economist, Shira Greenberg, estimates a 5-1/2-week-lockdown would cost the economy 25 billion shekels, or 1% of economic output. 
Business analytics firm Dun & Bradstreet has estimated 80,000-85,000 firms in Israel will go out of business this year, a 7-8% decline in the number of businesses.
It is not clear how many small businesses will defy the lockdown and reopen on Sunday, but Jonathan Katz, chief economist at Leader Capital Markets, said that if businesses can get back to normal by the end of the year Israel's economy could grow by 5% in 2021.
""If we avoid a third shutdown and most of the damage is in Q4 of 2020 we would be starting 2021 with a clean slate,"" he said.
The Israeli official said small businesses would likely be the first to open when lockdown is relaxed, ""but we are not there yet.""
Katz said the Bank of Israel may cut its benchmark interest rate to zero for the first time at its monetary policy meeting on Oct. 22, from 0.1%.
Other measures the bank could take to support the economy include doubling its government bond purchase programme to 100 billion shekels and extending long-term loans to banks at negative interest rates, on condition the loans translate to credit for the private sector, he said. 

($1 = 3.3916 shekels)

Members of the Foreign Policy Committee unwittingly spoke with a person pretending to be Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya for 40 minutes on Tuesday before the call was ended abruptly, parliament said in a statement on the matter.
It said that associates of Tsikhanouskaya, who fled to Lithuania shortly after a disputed Aug. 9 election in Belarus, have told Danish lawmakers she did not participate in any such meeting. The committee has ascertained the meeting was a spoof, the parliament said. 
The deputy chairman of the committee, Michael Aastrup Jensen, said the meeting was envisaged as a videoconference, but that the impersonator had told the politicians she could not get her webcam to work, so it was held just with audio.
The impersonator's website had been traced to Russia, Aastrup Jensen told Reuters. The chairman of the committee, former Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard, told Reuters it was unclear who was behind the hoax, but said there were indications of a Russian link. 
""It could appear in a satire show in a Russian-speaking country, or it could be an awkward attempt at espionage or a bad joke. I dare not say,"" Lidegaard said.
Vovan, one of a duo of pranksters called Vovan and Lexus who are known in Russia for targeting celebrities and politicians with prank phone calls, told Reuters when asked about the ""Tsikhanouskaya call"": ""It is possible we have something to do with this. There will be more details next week."" 
Ever since fleeing Belarus, Tsikanouskaya has met with European political leaders and called for the country's President Alexander Lukashenko to leave power. Lukashenko has denied opposition accusations that the August presidential vote was rigged to secure his re-election.

No confidential information was disclosed during the hoax meeting and measures have been taken to avoid similar incidents in the future, the Danish parliamentary statement said, without giving details.

The government announced earlier this year it wanted to put question and answer sessions with journalists on camera, shifting away from Westminster's behind-closed-doors briefings to a U.S. White House-style format.
Stratton, who works as finance minister Rishi Sunak's communications chief, was appointed after a recruitment process which set out to find someone who could ""communicate with the nation on behalf of the Prime Minister"".
Prior to her role at the finance ministry, Stratton had worked as a television and newspaper political reporter and editor.
The regular question and answer sessions between U.S. reporters and White House officials have - particularly at times during president Donald Trump's presidency - resulted in some awkward and hostile tussles.
In Britain, television cameras have hitherto been banned from the twice-daily meetings between reporters based in parliament and the prime minister's spokesman, at which questions on any subject can be asked. 
Over the last six months, the coronavirus pandemic has forced these briefings to take place by conference call, complete with crackly connections and participants forgetting to both mute and unmute. 
The shift to televised briefings is seen by Johnson as a way to offer viewers a more direct engagement with those in power. The exact format of the briefings has not been set out.
During the pandemic, Johnson, his ministers and public health officials held daily news conferences which, at their peak, drew tens of millions of viewers.

Britain will fully leave the European Union on Dec. 31, meaning businesses will need declarations to import and export into the world's biggest trading bloc for the first time in years. 
With less than three months to go, the government is still setting out its plans for trade after it warned that a lack of preparation by many companies could lead to queues of around 7,000 lorries in the southeast of England.
It said on Thursday it had identified 10 sites around the country including in the county of Kent - home to the ports of Dover (NYSE:DOV) and Folkestone which sail to Calais - in central England and near the ports sailing to Ireland.
In the area of Ashford (NYSE:AINC), near Dover, it has started work on a site in Sevington which may hold trucks if traffic is disrupted, and where goods and declarations could be checked to make sure they are ready to travel. Other sites still require planning permission. 
In a bid to prevent trucks from clogging the roads of Kent, the government will also introduce a Kent Access Permit which truck drivers must carry to access the main roads to the ports. 
""HGV (lorry) drivers on those key roads in Kent without one could be stopped and issued with a 300 pound on-the-spot fine,"" it said. 
The government's latest document on the Border Operating Model said lorry drivers operating in the Kent area but not bound for Europe should also carry paperwork, in a sign of the increased bureaucracy business is likely to face next year. 

""With fewer than 3 months to go, businesses need to prepare now for new procedures whether or not we reach a trade agreement with the EU, so that they can seize the significant opportunities that lie ahead,"" said Michael Gove, the minister overseeing Brexit planning.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 11:01AM ET</span>",American 'family' poet Louise Gluck wins Nobel Prize for Literature,"By Anna Ringstrom and Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - American poet Louise Gluck won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Literature for works exploring family and childhood in an ""unmistakable...voice that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal"", the Swedish Academy said on Thursday.
Academy Permanent Secretary Mats Malm said that Gluck, 77, also a multiple winner of U.S. literary awards, was ""surprised and happy"" at the news when it came in the early morning hours U.S. time. She gave no immediate comment to journalists gathered outside her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
A professor of English at Yale University, Gluck first rose to critical acclaim with her 1968 collection of poems entitled ""Firstborn"", and went on to become one of the most celebrated poets and essayists in contemporary America.
The Swedish Academy said that in Gluck's works ""the self listens for what is left of its dreams and delusions, and nobody can be harder than she in confronting illusions of the self"".
Drawing comparisons with other authors, the Academy said Gluck resembled 19th-century U.S. poet Emily Dickinson in her ""severity and unwillingness to accept simple tenets of faith"".
Gluck becomes the 16th woman to win the literary world's most prestigious distinction since the Nobel prizes were launched more than a century ago. 
While she draws on her own experiences in her poetry, Gluck, who is twice divorced and suffered from anorexia in younger years, explores universal themes that resonate with readers in the United States and abroad.
Erica McAlpine, associate professor of English at Britain's Oxford University, said Gluck ""has managed to feel urgently contemporary and yet simultaneously timeless"". She added:
""The occasional bleakness of her voice speaks especially well to our present moment, and yet her poetry has always been intimately connected to the long lyric tradition behind it.""
In her poems, ""love, loss, desire, and beauty wear the specific dress of her own life while turning the everyday into something mythical,"" McAlpine added. 
NOBEL PRIZE LIKELY TO BROADEN APPEAL
Jonathan Galassi, president of her publisher Farrar, Straus and Giroux, said via email he was certain the Nobel prize would bring Gluck ""to many, many new readers.""
""She is one of the rare contemporary poets whose work has the gift of speaking directly to readers through her great and subtle art,"" he said.
Gluck was awarded a U.S. Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for her poetry collection ""The Wild Iris"", with the title poem touching on suffering and redolent with imagery of the natural world. 
She was Poet Laureate of the United States in 2003-04, and won the U.S. National Book Award for her collection ""Faithful and Virtuous Night"" six years ago.
In 2015, then-President Barack Obama honoured Gluck with the National Medal of Arts and Humanities, saying her ""probing poems capture the quiet drama of nature and the quiet emotions of everyday people"".
Nobel prizes for medicine, physics and chemistry were awarded earlier this week, and the peace prize is to be announced on Friday.
The awards are named after dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel and have been awarded since 1901 in accordance with his will. 
CONTROVERSIES, SCANDAL
Gluck's Nobel prize followed years of controversy surrounding the literature award, but Malm sidestepped questions whether Gluck was chosen to address any related concerns. 
Alluding to past disputes, he told reporters: ""I'd say that in our Nobel (prize) work the crisis hasn't been decisive."" 
In 2019, the Academy exceptionally named two winners after postponing the 2018 prize in the wake of a sexual assault scandal involving the husband of one of its members. 
The secretive, 234-year-old Academy later announced changes it billed as improving the transparency of the awards process.
But one of the literature laureates announced last year, Austria's Peter Handke, had drawn international criticism over his portrayal of Serbia as a victim during the 1990s Balkan wars and for attending the funeral of its nationalist strongman leader Slobodan Milosevic.
The 2016 literature prize granted to American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan polarized opinion over whether a popular musician should be given an award that had been largely the domain of novelists and playwrights.
Like much of public life around the world, this year's awards have taken place under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the cancellation of the splashy Nobel prize-giving ceremony held each December in Stockholm.

Instead, a televised event will be held with winners receiving their honours in their home countries.

A landmark deal between the United States and the Taliban in February said foreign forces would leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counterterrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent ceasefire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government.
Trump and other officials have said the United States will go down to between 4,000 and 5,000 troops in Afghanistan around November. 
Beyond that, officials have said that a reduction will depend on conditions in Afghanistan.
On Twitter, Trump said: ""We should have the small remaining number of our BRAVE Men and Women serving in Afghanistan home by Christmas!""
It was unclear whether Trump was giving an order or verbalizing a long-held aspiration. 
Trump, who is seeking re-election next month, has made walking away from ""ridiculous endless wars"" the cornerstone of his foreign policy, even though thousands of troops remain in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. 
The Taliban, fighting to expel foreign forces and re-establish their Islamic state since their ouster in 2001, welcomed Trump's comments.
The U.S. president's statement was ""a positive step towards the implementation of the Doha agreement"", Taliban spokesman Mohammad Naeem said in a statement, referring to the February pact signed in the Qatari capital.
The U.S.-backed Afghan government did not immediately respond to requests for comment but officials have warned against a hasty withdrawal of foreign forces.
Trump's comments could further weaken the Afghan government's leverage during negotiations with the Taliban on a ceasefire and power-sharing taking place in Qatar.
'HARD PROCESS'
Just hours before Trump's tweet, national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the United States had less than 5,000 troops in Afghanistan currently and would go down to 2,500 by early next year. 
""Ultimately, the Afghans themselves are going to have to work out an accord, a peace agreement. ... It's going to be slow progress, it’s going to be hard progress, but we think it’s a necessary step – we think Americans need to come home,"" O'Brien told an event at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
The National Security Council and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The White House's plan for the drawdown will almost certainly be subject to review should Trump lose his bid for a second term in the Nov. 3 election.
Despite the agreement on the U.S. troop withdrawal and the talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government, the war shows no sign of ending.
Scores of Afghan soldiers and Taliban fighters have been killed in clashes in recent seeks. Dozens of civilians have also died.
Testifying before a U.S. House of Representatives committee last month, U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said that once the number of U.S. troops reached 4,500, the administration ""would do an evaluation of ties and actions that we have taken and make decisions on that.""
About 2,400 U.S. service members have been killed in the Afghan conflict and many thousands more wounded.

Wednesday also marks 19 years since the United States invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban rulers who had harbored al Qaeda militants who attacked the United States on Sept. 11, 2001.

Michel, speaking in Dublin after talks with Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin, urged Britain to put its cards on the table, saying the bloc needed clarity about their position.
""The coming days are crucial. This is the moment of truth. There is only one week to go before the European Council"" meeting on Oct. 15-16, Michel told journalists. 
""This is a challenging situation. We think we need more clarity and we will see if it is possible to make real and concrete progress,"" he said.
The two sides say they are inching towards a deal that would govern around $900 billion in trade after Dec. 31 - when the current transitional arrangements end - though sticking points remain on fishing, level playing field issues and governance. 
Martin said the mood around the talks had changed in recent weeks, leading to intensified engagement between the two sides. 
""But mood is one thing, it does need substance to follow,"" Martin said.

The United Kingdom formally left the EU on Jan. 31, more than three years after it voted 52%-48% for Brexit in a 2016 referendum. The two sides are now trying to work out how everything from cars to Camembert to whisky will trade.

824,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 09:46AM ET</span>","'Treated like slaves', migrant workers bear brunt of Lebanon crisis","By Alaa Kanaan
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Chanting their national anthem in the departure hall of Beirut airport, a group of migrant workers prepared to return home and close a chapter on their time in Lebanon which drove some to despair,
The International Organization for Migration (IOM), which supports many domestic workers in Lebanon, says as many as 10,000 migrants have asked to be repatriated because their wages collapsed after the country plunged into a deep financial crisis a year ago. 
Many employers stopped paying salaries in dollars and some foreign workers said they were leaving with their wages unpaid. 
The numbers of those asking to go home increased further after the huge explosion which struck Beirut in August, the International Labour Organisation said. 
The IOM's Dima Haddad said UN agencies in Lebanon had found ""shocking numbers"" of vulnerable migrant workers. She said 50% of those they interviewed said they could not pay rent, of which 34% said they were borrowing money to cover basic needs. 
""They treat us like slaves,"" said a 25-year-old domestic worker heading home after what she said were months of hardship at the hands of her employers that led her in February to jump from the third floor of the house she worked in.
She survived but, without work and alone on the streets, she faced destitution as the coronavirus pandemic compounded Lebanon's economic problems. 
""After jumping ... I thought I would die but God made it possible for me,"" she said, recalling how she found help through other migrant workers. 
""I am begging everybody, anyone not to step their feet in this country. It is really not easy,"" she said from a hotel room in a Beirut suburb where she and other women where preparing to fly home.
She spoke on condition that she not be identified, and the IOM asked that her nationality not be specified, but most migrant domestic workers in Lebanon come from Africa and southeast Asia. 
Another worker preparing to be repatriated said she came to Lebanon for secretarial work but found herself working as a maid, moved from one household to another by a local agent. 
When she begged to be sent home she was told to complete her two-year contract first. Under Lebanon's 'kafala' (sponsorship) regulations, which give employers the right to hold the passports of their domestic workers, she was trapped.
Many of the estimated 250,000 migrant domestic workers in Lebanon are excluded from protection under Lebanon's labour laws, leaving them vulnerable to abuse, rights groups say. 
Human Rights Watch (HRW) describes the kafala system as a restrictive regime which ""ties migrant workers’ legal residency to their employer"". 
Amendments to the system last month provide guarantees for workers including 48-hour work weeks, a rest day, overtime payment, as well as sick and annual leaves. Workers can now terminate their contracts without their employer's consent.
HRW welcomed the reforms as a step towards protecting workers’ rights and abolishing the ""kafala system"" if they were accompanied by a stringent enforcement mechanism. The IOM said it was a positive move.

""But we must have practical steps to guarantee the execution of this decision so this contract does not remain just ink on paper,"" Haddad said.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian voters, hit hard by political turmoil and the coronavirus pandemic, are looking for some economic certainty ahead of elections on Oct. 18, which opinion polls suggest could boost the country's socialists and see a return of 'Evonomics'.
The Andean country was one of Latin America's steadiest economic growth stories during the near 14-year rule of leftist leader Evo Morales, whose brand of socialist capitalism drew plaudits - though cracks appeared in later years.
Morales resigned in 2019 after a fraught election that was dogged by allegations of fraud, sparking off a period of political tumult and violent protest. The vote this month is a delayed re-run of that ballot.
Morales' socialist MAS party leads in opinion polls even though the man himself is in exile in Argentina. The party has been helped by memories of past economic stability, while the pandemic has left many in poverty and out of work.
""I will vote for MAS because it identifies with the people and it gave us work all these years. Not like now, when there is hardly anything to eat,"" said Juan Muriel, 43, a bricklayer from the highland city of El Alto.
Bolivia's economy, dominated by farming and gas, is forecast by the World Bank to contract around 6% this year, while foreign reserves have fallen dangerously as exports of gas and soy have declined.
Morales' so-called 'Evonomics' - a mixture of nationalization, public works and some industry-friendly policies for sectors like farming - helped drive over a decade of growth, though critics say his government rode the regional commodities boom in the 2000s which pumped up gas exports, and growth started to fade long before he left office.
Growth of 2.2% last year was already the weakest since 2001.
(Graphic: The return of Evonomics? - https://graphics.reuters.com/BOLIVIA-ELECTION/ECONOMY/xlbpgjaxkvq/chart.png)
The interim government's newly appointed Economy Minister Branko Marinkovic told Reuters the economic damage caused by the pandemic was around $5 billion, though he was hoping the economic contraction could be held at 4% this year.
""I hope to narrow the drop,"" he said, adding the economy could rebound 4% in a ""very tough"" 2021.
The interim government of President Jeanine Anez, who took over in a power vacuum after Morales' resignation last year, was looking to seal loans from international lenders to help the country recover, he said.
""I can't leave a time bomb for the next government and not be responsible for leaving some kind of bridging loan for the years ahead, which are going to be tough,"" he said.
The pandemic saw Bolivia's economy contract 7.9% in the first seven months of the year, while unemployment has shot up to 11.8%, official data show. The fiscal deficit has ballooned.
(Graphic: Reserves dwindle - https://graphics.reuters.com/BOLIVIA-ELECTION/ECONOMY/jznpnlraqpl/chart.png)
'BOLIVIA IS IN DANGER'
Anez withdrew from the presidential race last month, leaving centrist former President Carlos Mesa as the key rival to socialist front-runner Luis Arce, a close ally of Morales and his long-time economy minister.
""Today more than ever Bolivia is in danger, Bolivia is at risk and there is no response from the right-wing parties that will solve the problem. We have the solution,"" Arce said last month.
The latest opinion polls show Arce leading in the first round ahead of Mesa, though not by enough to avoid a second round run-off, which Mesa could potentially win.
Mesa, whose Citizen Community (CC) party came second in last year's voided election, said that his priority would be job creation.
""In order to recover the jobs that were lost as a result of the pandemic and generate new ones, we need to inject economic resources into companies and families,"" he said.
Ruddy Villanueva, 48, the owner of a clothing store in La Paz, said he was leaning towards voting for Mesa, citing accusations of MAS corruption and saying they did not do enough to invest in industry or jobs while in power.
Daniela, a 23-year-old student at the Catholic University in La Paz who declined to give her second name, said she was still undecided.
""No candidate yet convinces me and I don't see that there are any real proposals. The country's situation is urgent and without a good president things can only get worse.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Worried that remote schooling could become a struggle, a local authority in the Philippines has set up a makeshift call centre staffed by dozens of teachers to make sure students don't fall behind in class.
The temporary call centre opened in the capital Manila on Monday staffed by 70 people who have been busy answering hundreds of daily queries by phone, email and instant messenger, as students get to grips with virtual learning.
""Quality education must continue. Just because there is an ongoing pandemic the quality of learning shouldn't suffer,"" said Ferdinand Delgado, team leader of the support programme.
""This programme was made to strengthen the government's efforts to help students with their education.""
Schools across the Philippines have been closed since March to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 330,000 people locally, with over 6,000 deaths.
President Rodrigo Duterte has vowed not to reopen schools until a COVID-19 vaccine is available. 
Some 50 teachers and 20 substitute teachers at the support programme have been trained by call centre supervisors to handle student inquiries, most of which have so far been about maths or science. 
The Philippines itself has been dubbed the ""call centre of the world"", employing more than a million people in its Business Process Outsourcing industry, serving international companies with customers worldwide. 
""This programme is very important for the students because they cannot always easily reach out to their school teachers,"" said maths teacher, Ailene Almoite.

""More often than not, parents are also unsure about the lessons given to the students and are unable to help them.""

""Either you resolve your impasse and pass the budget legally and constitutionally. If you don't, I will do it for you,"" Duterte said in a televised address, without saying how he intended resolve it.
The row over a term sharing agreement for the role of speaker in the lower house is threatening to delay the passage of next year's budget, something Duterte cannot afford as he faces the enormous task of resuscitating the coronavirus-hit economy before his six-year term ends in June 2022.
Duterte has asked Congress to approve a record 4.3 trillion pesos ($88.76 billion) budget for 2021 to finance key infrastructure projects that are expected to generate much needed jobs as the pandemic left millions unemployed.
The firebrand leader, whose allies dominate both houses of Congress, warned ""I will do my thing"" if nothing happened in the next few days. 

The World Bank has said the Philippine economy may contract this year by as much as 6.9%, worse than the government's projected 5.5% decline.

For the Future of Montenegro and its allies from the centre-right alliance Peace is Our Nation, and a group led by the green URA party, jointly secured a slim majority of 41 deputies in the 81-seat parliament in an election on Aug. 30. They subsequently agreed to form a cabinet. 
After meeting the leaders of the proposed coalition, President Milo Djukanovic said he would forward Krivokapic's name to parliament. 
Djukanovic, who faces reelection in 2023, said the new government would maintain reforms and investments in the tiny Adriatic republic of only 620,000, a NATO member and a candidate to join the European Union. 
""This proves the maturity of our society ... Montenegro is recognised as a (key) factor for regional stability,"" he said. 
For Future of Montenegro has pledged the country would maintain its EU membership bid and NATO membership.
Krivokapic said that the talks with Djukanovic ""were a sign of improvement of the political culture"" and that he and other opposition leaders will send a proposal for the composition of new Cabinet to the parliament by Nov 8.
""The most important thing for us is the different future for Montenegro,"" he told reporters.
Opposition leaders, democracy and human rights watchdogs, have long accused Djukanovic and his Democratic Party of Socialists (DPS) of running Montenegro as their own corrupt fiefdom with links to organised crime.
The DPS and Djukanovic deny the charges.
Montenegrins who identify as Serbs account for about a third of its population. Most Montenegrins and Serbs share language and the Orthodox Christian faith, and many of Serbia's citizens have roots and families in Montenegro. 

The Serbian Orthodox Church, the largest in the country, held daily protests against a law adopted last December that allows the state to seize religious assets whose historical ownership cannot be proven.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis sought to assure external inspectors of the Vatican's financial operations on Thursday that he was pushing ahead with reforms, as the Holy See reeled from a scandal in which he fired a powerful cardinal.
In an address to Moneyval, the Council of Europe's financial monitoring arm, Francis listed recent actions he had taken to make Vatican finances more transparent.
He appeared to refer to the Vatican's latest financial scandals when he quoted the gospel story of Jesus driving the merchants from the temple and telling them ""You cannot serve both God and money"".
Last month, the pope fired Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, accusing him of embezzlement and nepotism. Becciu has denied all wrongdoing.
Moneyval is making one of its periodic inspections to check the Vatican is complying with international norms to combat money laundering and financing of terrorism.
""The measures that you are evaluating are meant to promote a 'clean finance', in which the 'merchants' are prevented from speculating in that sacred 'temple',"" Francis said.
Italian media have this week run interviews with a woman who says she received 500,000 euros from Becciu to run a ""parallel diplomacy"" to help missionaries in conflict areas. 
Cecilia Marogna's purported work for the Vatican's Secretariat of State, where Becciu held the number two position until 2018, was not previously known. 
In an emailed response to Reuters on Wednesday, Becciu's lawyer, Fabio Viglione, said the cardinal knew Marogna but that his dealings with her had been ""exclusively about institutional matters"". He did not mention her comments about the funds, which Marogna said went through a company she started in Slovenia.
Marogna, 39, who like Becciu is from Sardinia, did not reply to a phone message from Reuters.
Addressing the inspectors, Francis pointed to his approval in June of sweeping new rules for procurement and spending meant to cut costs, ensure transparent competition and reduce the risk of corruption in awarding contracts.
Moneyval has given the Vatican increasingly positive evaluations since its first inspection eight years ago but has lamented the slowness of its judicial arm in carrying out investigations and bringing suspects to trial.
In his email, Becciu's lawyer also denied Italian media reports that his client had sent money to Australia to help enemies of Cardinal George Pell, the former Vatican economy minister who was cleared this year of sexual abuse charges in Australia after spending 13 months in prison. 

Pell had accused Becciu of blocking Vatican financial reforms and after Becciu was fired, Pell said the pope ""is to be thanked and congratulated"".

DHAKA (Reuters) - A turf war raging between criminal armed groups in Rohingya refugee camps in southern Bangladesh has forced thousands of people to flee and at least eight have been killed in clashes in recent days, police and humanitarian workers said on Thursday.
Authorities have arrested 12 people after days of gunfire, arson, and abductions by gangs competing for dominance in the sprawling settlement, the world’s largest refugee camp home to more than a million people.
“A tense situation is prevailing there,” Rafiqul Islam, an additional police superintendent based in the nearest town of Cox's Bazar, told Reuters by phone.
“Two groups are trying to establish dominance in the area,” he said, adding that they were suspected drug and human traffickers.
The region is a crucible of the lucrative trade in methamphetamine, mostly manufactured across the border in Myanmar.
More than 100 Rohingya have been killed since 2018 in incidents human rights groups say are extrajudicial killings but police say the victims were caught in the “cross-fire” during shootouts with suspected drug smugglers.
Three refugees speaking on condition of anonymity named the two groups behind the fighting as the “Munna” gang, named after a notorious local alleged drug baron, and the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA), an armed group that has a presence in the sprawling camps and that refugees have accused of carrying out kidnappings and attacks.
In a Twitter post, ARSA denied responsibility for the latest violence and blamed criminals seeking to cast aspersions on the group.
Attacks by ARSA on police posts in Myanmar in 2017 triggered a sweeping military crackdown that led more than 730,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh.
About 2,000 Rohingya families were displaced in the latest violence, though some had returned by Thursday, according to additional refugee relief and repatriation commissioner Mohammad Shamsu Douza.
“We are living in fear, especially at night,” one of the refugees told Reuters by phone. 
“Last night also, one group carried out an arson attack. Where will we go now?”

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand is pushing back plans to receive its first batch of foreign tourists due to administrative issues, a senior official said on Thursday, adding to uncertainty about when it will welcome back visitors vital to its economy. 
Processes involved in applying for and issuing special visas is delaying the soft reopening, Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) governor Yuthasak Supasorn told Reuters, adding that about 100 tourists were expected to arrive this month. 
Foreign arrivals stopped in April after the government banned commercial flights to keep the coronavirus at bay.
In September, the TAT said some 120 tourists on special long-stay visas would fly directly from Guangzhou to the resort island of Phuket this week, but their travel has been delayed.
Chinese media has questioned the identity of those tourists, however, with reports unable to confirm any Thailand travel bookings among agents in Guangzhou.
Operators in Phuket are also puzzled. 
""We have not been notified about the arrivals,"" Phuket Tourism Association President, Bhummikitti Ruktaengam told Reuters. 
""Phuket is ready, but we need clarity, where are they from, how many and where will they stay?"" Bhummikitti said, adding that more information would help create confidence among the local community. 
Authorities last month announced that a limited number of long-stay visitors would be allowed from countries deemed low risk and their trips must include two weeks of quarantine at their resort. 
Thailand has just over 3,600 confirmed cases, among the lowest in Asia, but its economy could contract by a record 7.8%. 
The tourism-reliant country could see just 6.7 million foreign visitors this year, the government predicts, after a record 39.8 million in 2019, whose spending made up about 11.4% of GDP, or 1.93 trillion baht ($61.88 billion).
Authorities had earlier shelved a ""travel bubble"" plan to allow movement of travellers between countries with low infection rates.

Hodiedah governorate has seen sporadic, limited fighting since the truce was agreed in late 2018 but intense clashes broke out this week between forces from the Iran-aligned Houthi movement and those allied with Yemen's Saudi-backed government around al-Durayhimi city and the nearby town of Hais.
Military and medical sources said dozens of people had been killed in the clashes. The U.N. statement cited reports of a number of casualties among civilians, including women and children. 
U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths said the military escalation violates the truce agreement and ""runs against the spirit of the ongoing U.N.-facilitated negotiations that aim to achieve a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic measures and the resumption of the political process"".
The Hodeidah agreement reached at U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Sweden in December 2018 had stipulated a redeployment of troops from both sides which was never fully implemented.
Houthi-held Hodeidah is the main entry point for Yemen's commercial imports and aid. Some 80% of the population relies on humanitarian assistance and millions face famine in what the United Nations describes as the world's biggest humanitarian crisis.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since a Saudi-led coalition intervened in March 2015 to restore the government ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, by Houthi forces. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.
Griffiths is trying to mediate a nationwide ceasefire in order to restart stalled political negotiations to end the war that has killed more than 100,000 people.

The conflict is largely seen as a proxy war between foes Saudi Arabia and Iran.

The 2.8 metre scroll had been cut in half as it been deemed too long to display, police told a news conference on Wednesday. 
It was looted on Sept. 10, along with stamps, coins and other pieces of calligraphy worth a total of HK$5 billion ($645 million), said senior superintendent Tony Ho.
An independent valuation was not immediately available.
Mao memorabilia remains highly sought after in China with many businesses in the mainland trying to cash in by selling collectables from the Cultural Revolution. Fakes are rampant due to a proliferation of reproductions.
""Someone thought the calligraphy was too long ... and difficult to show and display. That's why it was cut in half,"" Ho said. 
The scroll was cut in two for storage purposes by a buyer who purchased it for a mere HK$500 ($65) and believed it to be counterfeit, the South China Morning Post reported, citing an unnamed police source.

Police have arrested three men for the robbery.

The 12, who are accused of crimes tied to anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year, are being held in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen after mainland authorities intercepted their boat and accused them of illegal border crossing. 
China's foreign ministry has called them ""separatists"".
The families said they had obtained the flight path of a Hong Kong government plane showing it was surveilling the boat the 12 were in, which led them to suspect local authorities helped Chinese officials. 
They did not say how they obtained the data.
""Explain whether the police have deployed fixed-wing aircraft for aerial surveillance; give a full account of the conspiracy to send the 12 Hong Kongers to China,"" the group said in a statement on Thursday. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said this week she would not comment on the ""actual operational details except to reinforce ... that the police has absolutely no role to play in this particular case."" 
The father of detainee Cheng Tsz-ho, 18, held up a placard outside Government Flying Service headquarters that read: ""Government lied, return my son back to me."" 
The wife of detainee Wong Wai-yin, 30, displayed a sign that said: ""Give me the truth, release my husband.""
The detainees case has grabbed international headlines and human rights groups have raised concerns. The families say the detainees have been denied access to independent lawyers. 
More than a dozen police stood guard as the relatives staged a peaceful protest, with live television footage showing some being stopped and searched by officers. 

The Hong Kong government has said it cannot interfere on the detainees' behalf and they must face legal proceedings in China before they can come home, though it says it is willing to provide ""feasible"" assistance to their families.

845,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 06:41AM ET</span>",EU ministers look at new migration pact amid divisions,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU governments started talks on Thursday on a proposed European Commission overhaul of broken migration rules, trying to resolve years of bitter divisions and provide a better welcome for refugees fleeing the Middle East and Africa.
The video-conference of EU interior ministers is the first chance to exchange views on the scheme proposed by the EU executive last month, and especially on its most sensitive part which de facto obliges each EU country to host some refugees.
Poland and Hungary are dead set against that, even though under the Commission proposal the EU would pay a country 10,000 euros ($11,750) per adult taken in.
The EU's reluctant eastern members, the richer northern states where many of the newcomers aspire to live and the Mediterranean-shore countries where they mainly arrive have been clashing over where to locate people since the 2015 migration crisis showed existing EU migration rules were inadequate.
In 2015, more than a million people made it to EU shores, overwhelming security and welfare networks, and stirring far-right sentiment. The EU now receives up to 1.5 million net new foreigners coming legally to live and work per year and only 140,000 asylum seekers arrive illegally.
""Our aim is for Europe to focus on those who need protection, which includes those fleeing the civil war of course,"" German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, told reporters.
""But we also want order which means that we won't in future be letting in so many people who don't in reality need protection,"" he said before the video-conference started.
Under the Commission's latest proposal, EU countries would be obliged to help each other under the new idea of ""mandatory solidarity"" by either accepting migrants, sponsoring their return to their countries of origin or offering material assistance on the ground in arrival countries.
But if an EU country were under major migration pressure, the Commission wants a crisis mechanism to oblige other EU governments to take people in or send them back.
If a migrant could not be sent back within eight months -- which national migration experts and some EU officials admit is tight -- the EU country in charge of the return process would be forced to take in the migrant -- anathema to the easterners.

Germany is keen to reach a deal among EU governments and institutions on the new migration regime by the end of the year, but the process might take longer.

A leading advocate for the abolition of the death penalty in Iran, Mohammadi was jailed in 2016 for founding a campaign group that was deemed to be an illegal splinter group.
She was freed Wednesday night, the chief justice of the northwestern Zanjan province, where she was imprisoned, was quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency. It did not explain why her sentence had been cut short.
In July, the United Nations called for her release after she was reported to have been showing symptoms of COVID-19. In August, her husband said she appeared to have recovered.
The Iranian judiciary said in March that it had temporarily released about 85,000 inmates in response to the coronavirus, including people held on security charges who say they are political prisoners; in late May many were returned to prison.
Amnesty International said in July that Iranian authorities had ignored appeals from prison officials to provide them with resources to stem the spread of the coronavirus within jails.
Rupert Colville, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters earlier this week prisons were severely overcrowded. ""It's impossible to isolate people and enforce physical distancing because of lack of space,"" he said.
A report carried on Wednesday by Mizanonline, the official website of the Iranian judiciary, denied prisons were in poor condition.
It said 18 preventative measures had been taken in the past three months, including continuous testing of prison staff for the coronavirus, distribution of required medical items, isolation for infected prisoners and social distancing during family visits.
Colville said political prisoners include conservationists, dual nationals, human rights defenders, and lawyers, such as Nasrin Sotoudeh, who has been sentenced to 33 years for various charges under national security laws.

849,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 06:27AM ET</span>",Russia says Kyrgyzstan is in chaos and needs stabilising,"BISHKEK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that Kyrgyzstan, where Russia has an air base, had descended into chaos and Moscow had obligations under an existing security treaty to prevent the situation from totally breaking down.
The Central Asian nation has been gripped by unrest since parliamentary elections on Sunday which government critics and western monitors said were marred by vote-buying. Protesters stormed government buildings on Tuesday and rival groups have since claimed power.
Parliament failed to gather a quorum in an overnight session, deputies said earlier on Thursday, extending the power vacuum.
""The situation looks like a mess and chaos"", Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a briefing, referring to Russian obligations under a security treaty between the two countries to avoid a complete breakdown of government.
He also confirmed that Alexander Bortnikov, the head of Russia's FSB security service, had spoken to the new acting security chief of Kyrgysztan, Omurbek Suvanaliyev, on Wednesday.
Three opposition groups have each proposed their candidates for interim prime minister who would need to oversee a repeat vote in the coming months, Kyrgyz news website Akipress quoted deputy Ryskeldi Mombekov as saying.
In addition to Sadyr Zhaparov and Tilek Toktogaziyev, who have already made their ambitions clear this week, Mombekov said Omurbek Babanov, who has already served as the cabinet head, had also emerged as a contender.
But the outgoing parliament has itself split into two groups that were meeting separately outside the headquarters ransacked by protesters, Mombekov said, and the group that met overnight in a hotel only included 40 MPs, whereas major decisions such as naming a cabinet require a 61-vote majority.
Another MP, Elvira Surabaldieva, posted a video from the meeting online, saying it had failed to pass a motion to impeach President Sooronbai Jeenbekov.
Jeenbekov's whereabout have remained unknown since Tuesday although his spokeswoman told Russia's TASS news agency he remained in Kyrgyzstan and was personally holding talks with various political groups.
Kyrgyzstan's central bank has allowed financial institutions to reopen on Thursday since their closure on Tuesday, as business associations warned the nation of 6.5 million could face food shortages if banks and tax offices remained shut and public safety could not be guaranteed.
At the same time, deputy security council chief Omurbek Suvanaliyev told Russia's Interfax news agency Kyrgyzstan was tightening border controls to ensure security.
Sunday's election handed the victory to two establishment parties, one of them closely linked to Jeenbekov.
Eleven other parties refused to accept the results and the central election commission annulled them on Tuesday as it became clear Jeenbekov was losing his grip on power.
One person has been killed and more than a thousand have sought medical help since the unrest broke out, as vigilante units formed by Bishkek residents scuffled with protesters and looters.
However, acting interior minister Kursan Asanov, who took over this week after running in the election as an opposition candidate, said police and vigilantes had managed to prevent mass looting in the capital.
He vowed to stop any attempts to further destabilise the country where ethnic violence left hundreds dead after the ouster of president Kurmanbek Bakiyev in 2010 in another revolt.

Asanov also urged parliament to convene and install a legitimate cabinet, describing the current situation as stable but tense.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's new Crown Prince Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah took the oath of office in parliament on Thursday, pledging the Gulf Arab state's commitment to democracy and peace and calling on Kuwaitis to shun divisions.
The assembly unanimously endorsed the octogenarian Sheikh Meshal for the role in what has been a smooth succession that retained power firmly within the ruling family's oldest ranks following last week's death of Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad.
New ruler Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad, 83, assumed power last Wednesday in the U.S.-allied OPEC member state as it faces a liquidity crunch caused by low oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic against the backdrop of continued tensions between larger neighbours Saudi Arabia and Iran.
Sheikh Meshal, addressing parliament, said Kuwait would uphold its regional and international commitments and ""its path of peace and democratic approach"".
He pledged to ""raise the banner of popular participation and promote a tolerant spirit that shuns division.""
Diplomats and analysts say that due to Sheikh Nawaf's low-key style and age, he may delegate a larger portion of responsibilities to Sheikh Meshal, a forceful figure who had been deputy head of the National Guard since 2004 and before that headed State Security for 13 years, shunning public-facing roles. 
The succession is not expected to alter oil policy or a foreign policy shaped by Sheikh Sabah that defended Arab unity and balanced ties with Saudi Arabia, Iran and former occupier Iraq.
Sheikh Meshal's rise stands in contrast to some other Gulf states, most notably Saudi Arabia, where ruling families are starting to give top jobs to younger princes.
Sheikh Nawaf and Sheikh Meshal, both brothers of the late ruler, are expected to focus on domestic issues as the country prepares for parliamentary elections this year and the government tries to shore up its finances.
Frequent clashes between the hand-picked cabinet, in which ruling family members hold most senior posts, and the assembly have led to successive government reshuffles and dissolution of parliament, hindering investment and economic reforms.

""We face a challenging period ... which does not allow for divisions, and maintaining national unity is a serious and joint responsibility,"" Prime Minister Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid said in parliament on Thursday.

851,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>",Germany says Thai king cannot rule from there,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's foreign minister has said that Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn should not be conducting politics from the European country, where he spends much of his time.
Foreign Minister Heiko Maas responded to a question by a Greens member of parliament in the Bundestag on Wednesday at a time that King Vajiralongkorn's monarchy faces unprecedented calls for reform from protesters in Thailand. 
""We have made it clear that politics concerning Thailand should not be conducted from German soil,"" Maas told parliament.
""If there are guests in our country that conduct their state business from our soil we would always want to act to counteract that.""
Thousands of protesters have been holding demonstrations in Bangkok over recent months calling for reform of the monarchy to curb the king's powers and for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader, and a new constitution and elections.
Greens parliamentarian Frithjof Schmidt also asked Maas whether Germany was prepared to discuss with the European Union (EU) freezing free trade talks with Thailand again ""as long as the junta continues to block the path to democracy in Thailand"".
The EU halted contact at all levels with Thailand after a 2014 coup but resumed trade talks after a general election last year that saw Prayuth reinstated as a civilian prime minister.
Maas said that halting negotiations was ""an option"" to exert pressure but it would be right to discuss with Thailand first. 
Neither the Royal Palace in Bangkok nor the Thai government responded immediately to a request for comment. 
Protesters challenging Thailand's palace and army-dominated establishment broke a long-standing taboo by demanding reform of the monarchy in August.
King Vajiralongkorn, 68, has been on Thailand's throne since 2016, but spends much of his time in Bavaria, where his 15-year-old son is at school. 
Thai protesters have complained about the cost of the king's stays in Europe as well as his absence from the kingdom.
The protesters seek to reduce the king's powers under the constitution, which specifically allows him to exercise powers when he is outside Thailand without appointing a regent.
Protesters also want to remove his direct control of a royal fortune valued in tens of billions of dollars and some units of the army. The Palace has made no comment on the protests.
In the German parliament, Greens member Schmidt asked: ""Why does the German government tolerate this extremely unusual - and in my opinion illegal - behaviour of a foreign head of state conducting politics on German soil?"" 

Protesters in Thailand on Thursday said they would rally again next Wednesday and expected a big turnout to pressure the government to step down and press their calls for reform of the monarchy.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A 350-pound (159-kg) black bear was released by a veterinary team into the remote woodlands of northern California this week, newly healed from crippling burns it suffered last month in one of the state's devastating summer wildfires.
The adult male bruin was the first of several four-legged fire victims admitted for medical treatment and successfully rehabilitated by a wildlife-rescue network launched in September by two of the state's leading veterinarians.
One of them, Dr. Jamie Peyton, a specialist at the University of California, Davis campus, recalled being overwhelmed at the sight of the bear's recovery, and the vitality the animal showed as it bounded away from captivity to freedom on Monday.
""When we found him, he couldn't walk. He was crawling,"" Peyton told Reuters in an interview the next day. ""But what's amazing is we can take that animal and in a couple of weeks literally get him back on his feet again.""
Perhaps just as astonishing is an innovative therapy administered to many of the network's animals. Tilapia fish skins, rich in collagen, are applied as temporary dressings over their wounds to speed healing of burned tissue, a treatment physicians in Brazil pioneered for human burn patients.
The tilapia bandaging was part of the care received by the network's newly freed ursine patient, nicknamed Barry - so dubbed because he was injured in the so-called Bear Fire and was found near the town of Berry Creek by a first-responder named Barry.
Severe burns to the sensitive pads on the bottoms of all four of his paws had left him hobbled and unable to effectively forage for food and water. Once recovered, he was returned to a secluded area untouched by fire and containing ample natural sources of food, water and shelter, about 25 miles (40 km) from where he was found.
A female mountain lion rescued with similar injuries from the Bobcat Fire near Los Angeles and treated at the same facility is likely to be discharged in a couple weeks, said Kirsten Macintyre, spokeswoman for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).
Caregivers at the agency's Wildlife Investigations Laboratory (NYSE:LH) in Rancho Cordova, near Sacramento, also check the animals for signs of smoke inhalation and ensure they are well-hydrated and nourished. 
UNCOUNTED VICTIMS OF CLIMATE CRISIS
The mammals under treatment there are among an uncounted tally of wild animals likely injured, killed and displaced by scores of catastrophic blazes that have swept California and other western states since mid-August in a wildfire season of unprecedented dimensions.
Those fires have charred a record 4 million-plus acres of landscape and killed at least 31 people in California alone, while destroying some 9,000 homes and other structures across the state.
Experts say the intensity and prevalence of major conflagrations has steadily grown in recent years, stoked by bouts of blistering heat, extreme dry spells, fierce winds and lightning storms.
Scientists have pointed to the region's incendiary weather, along with supercharged fuel beds overgrown with tinder-dry grass and scrub, as consequences of climate change.
Seeking to address an often-overlooked cohort of fire victims, biologists and veterinarians led by Peyton at UC Davis and her CDFW counterpart, Dr. Deana Clifford, teamed up to form the Wildlife Disaster Network.
The organization, modeled after a 25-year-old rescue network started at UC Davis for seabirds and other marine life injured by oil spills, has begun surveying some of California's major fire zones to collect data on impacts to wildlife and their habitat.
They also plan to conduct search-and-rescue operations for stranded, injured animals, perform field triage and transport badly hurt wildlife to long-term rehabilitation facilities.
The new network draws on veterinarians, scientists and trained volunteers, along with 90 existing state-licensed wildlife rehab centers. 
The CDFW lab began taking in fire-injured bears and mountain lions for treatment and rehab in 2017. 
This year, the lab has treated Barry the bear, the female mountain lion from Los Angeles County and a 520-pound male black bear from the Zogg Fire near the northern California town of Redding.
Several other burned mammals, including a bobcat, a gray fox, a coyote and a bear cub found abandoned and clinging to a scorched tree were admitted to the Gold Country Wildlife Rescue facility in Auburn, California. 
Southern California's mountain lion population, already imperiled by fragmentation of its habitat by human development, could end up especially hard hit by fires.
The network recently rescued three mountain lion kittens orphaned in the Zogg Wildfire, one with burns. They will eventually be placed in a wildlife sanctuary or zoo.

""They're barely a month old,"" Clifford said. ""Mom didn't have enough time at all to teach them how to be mountain lions and to have the skills they need to survive in the wild.""

MANILA (Reuters) - Activists and families of victims of the Philippines' bloody war on drugs on Thursday vowed to keep fighting for justice, after the United Nations Human Rights Council opted to give technical assistance to a government accused of ignoring atrocities.
The council on Wednesday voted to provide help to the administration of President Rodrigo Duterte to try to ensure unlawful killings and other violations were properly investigated and prosecuted. 
The decision comes despite a landmark U.N. report in June that said tens of thousands of people may have been killed in Duterte's war on drugs since mid-2016 with ""near impunity"" for police, and incitement from top officials. The government has rejected that. 
Activists said the resolution was a let down, but it would not weaken their resolve or their pursuit of a comprehensive international investigation. 
""There will be no let-up on our campaign for justice,"" said Llore Pasco, 65, who represents Rise up for life and for rights, a network of victims' families. 
""We will intensify our collection of evidence so we can pursue our call for an independent investigation,"" said Pasco, whose two sons were killed. 
""The fight is not yet over.""
The president's office on Thursday said the council's adoption of the latest resolution was a ""reversal of the narrow and contentious decision"" it had made last year, when it voted in favour of compiling a report on human rights in the Philippines.
The latest resolution keeps the issue on the agenda for another two years.
Human rights groups accuse police of systematically executing suspected drug dealers and users. Police reject that and say all those killed had resisted arrest. 
For Cristina Palabay, head of human rights group Karapatan, that meant the international community remained committed to closely monitoring the Philippines and Duterte's government was not yet off the hook. 

However, Carlos Conde, Philippines researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the government was using ""cynical and misleading spin,"" because the council's resolution had ""affirmed the abuses"".

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - China was accused by Taiwan of trying to impose censorship in India after its embassy in New Delhi advised journalists to observe the ""one-China"" principle after newspapers carried advertisements for Taiwan's national day.
Coming just months after deadly clashes between Indian and Chinese troops on the disputed Himalayan border between the two Asian giants, the controversy has flared at a time when Indian sentiments toward China are filled with antipathy and suspicion.
China's hackles were raised on Wednesday by advertisements placed in leading Indian newspapers by Taiwan's government to mark the democratic, Chinese-claimed island's national day on Saturday.
The advertisement carried a photograph of President Tsai Ing-wen and hailed India, a fellow democracy, as a natural partner of Taiwan.
China, which claims Taiwan and regards it as a wayward province, made its displeasure evident in an e-mail sent by its embassy on Wednesday night to journalists in India, including Reuters.
""Regarding the so-called forthcoming 'National Day of Taiwan', the Chinese Embassy in India would like to remind our media friends that there is only one China in the world, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China,"" the embassy said.
""We hope Indian media can stick to Indian government's position on Taiwan question and do not violate the 'One China' principle.
""In particular, Taiwan shall not be referred to as a 'country (nation)' or 'Republic of China' or the leader of China's Taiwan region as 'President', so as not to send the wrong signals to the general public."" 
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu scoffed at Beijing's advice to Indian media. 
""India is the largest democracy on Earth with a vibrant press & freedom-loving people. But it looks like communist #China is hoping to march into the subcontinent by imposing censorship. #Taiwan's Indian friends will have one reply: GET LOST!"" he said in a tweet.
New Delhi has no formal diplomatic relations with Taipei, but both sides have close business and cultural ties.
India's government has carefully avoided upsetting China over Taiwan. But relations became fraught after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in June, and there have been calls from some Indian nationalist groups for a boycott of Chinese goods. 
""The Chinese government behaves like a street goon, not like an aspiring super-power. It threatens us,"" said Nitin Gokhale, the editor of a defence and security website, after receiving the Chinese embassy's email.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Police and demonstrators clashed in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Thursday on the third day of protests and labour strikes against a polarising new jobs law passed in Southeast Asia’s largest economy earlier this week.
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered near the presidential palace in central Jakarta, shouting and throwing stones. Police responded by firing tear gas and water cannon in an attempt to disperse the crowd, Reuters witnesses said. 
The “omnibus” jobs creation bill, passed into law on Monday, has seen thousands of people across the world’s fourth-most populous nation take to the streets in protest against legislation they say undermines labour rights and weakens environmental protections.
“We ask that the law be repealed immediately,” Maulana Syarif, 45, who has worked at Astra Honda motors for 25 years, told Reuters in Jakarta. “This is our struggle for our children and grandchildren, and our future generations... If it's like this (with the new law) our well-being will decrease, and we will lack job certainty.”
“I feel a responsibility to the Indonesian people,” said another demonstrator, IT student Arawinda Kartika, as she marched toward the palace. “I feel sorry for labourers working day and night without sufficient wages or power.”
In the past two days, almost 400 people have been detained in major cities, and two students hospitalised with serious head injuries, as protests have swept across the archipelago.
On Thursday, demonstrations were underway in almost a dozen cities across the country with television channels showing protests, including in remote areas such as North Maluku, where demonstrators carried coffins and held mock funerals for the ‘death’ of the parliament.
The government of President Joko Widodo has championed the flagship legislation as key to boosting Indonesia’s ailing economy by streamlining regulations, cutting red tape and attracting more foreign direct investment.

Met with cautious optimism by some financial analysts, the bill has sparked a significant outcry, with labour unions, students and academics criticising it for a lack of consultation, expedited passage, and problematic clauses they argue will disadvantage workers and the environment.

The 43-year-old theme park and Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Hong Kong Disneyland have been shuttered for most of the year, only reopening in September. Both parks are mandated to operate at a maximum of half-capacity and face masks remain compulsory.
At over HK$6 billion in debt according to its latest annual report, Ocean Park secured a HK$5.4 billion ($696 million)government bailout in May which it said would help it stay operational for another year.
Anti-government protests last year and the rise of competing amusement parks in the region such as Chimelong Ocean Kingdom on China's Hengqin island, have exacerbated pressure on both Ocean Park and Hong Kong Disneyland.
Ocean Park also said it would for the first time open hiking trails underneath its cable car ride which overlooks the South China Sea. Air-conditioned tents will be available for those who want to camp and barbecue, it said.
However, 26-year-old resident Sze who was visiting Ocean Park on Thursday, said paying an additional cost for yoga and hiking seemed unnecessary when she was only interested in the rides.
""We need to pay extra money to join the hiking activities while hiking is supposed to be free,"" said Sze, who did not want to give her full name. ""Doing yoga is also free if you go into the wild.""

861,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Malaysia's Anwar says to meet king to prove majority,"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday said he will meet with the country's king next week to present his case for taking over the premiership from Muhyiddin Yassin.
Anwar said King Al-Sultan Abdullah had agreed to grant him an audience, where he will present documentation ""of the strong and convincing majority"" of members of parliament backing his claim to the premiership.
""I would like to express my gratitude to His Majesty for granting me an audience to meet on Tuesday, October 13, 2020, Insha'Allah,"" Anwar said in a statement, using the Arabic term for ""God willing"".
Two weeks ago, Anwar declared that he had gathered a ""formidable"" majority among federal lawmakers to oust Muhyiddin, sparking a fresh bout of political drama in the Southeast Asian country.
Anwar had said he commanded support from close to two-thirds of parliament's 222 lawmakers, without giving actual numbers or disclosing who had pledged support.
The national palace and the prime minister's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on his royal audience.
The latest twist in Malaysia's protracted power struggle comes after the coronavirus pandemic saw the country's export-driven economy post its first contraction in the second quarter since the 2009 global financial crisis.
Muhyiddin, whose seven-month-old coalition has survived on a razor-thin majority, had earlier dismissed Anwar's claims as a ""mere allegation"" and told him to prove his majority through a constitutional process.
Muhyiddin came to power in March after securing a majority with the support of the United Malays National Organisation, which was defeated in the 2018 election. 
His opponents have accused him of grabbing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.

The king plays a largely ceremonial role in Malaysia but he could appoint a prime minister who in his view is likely to command a majority in parliament. He could also dissolve parliament and trigger elections on the premier's advice.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore is launching cruises to nowhere from November, as the travel hub tries to kick-start a tourism industry battered by the coronavirus pandemic.
Genting Cruise Lines and  Royal Caribbean  (NYSE:RCL) International will run the pilot cruises, which have no ports of call and will operate at half capacity with stringent health protocols, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said on Thursday. 
The cruises, which the STB classed as ""round trips"", are open only to people who live in Singapore and will sail in waters just off the city-state.
The global cruise industry has taken a major hit from the coronavirus pandemic, with some of the earliest big outbreaks found on cruise ships.
Singapore's plan comes as travelers in Asia have been snapping up tickets on ""flights to nowhere"" that take off and land at the same airport.
""This cruise pilot is a valuable opportunity for cruise operators to reinvent the entire cruise experience in order to regain the confidence of passengers,"" said Keith Tan, STB chief executive. 
Facing its deepest recession this year, the Southeast Asian island has been gradually loosening its coronavirus curbs to boost its economy.
The cruises will require guests to have mandatory COVID-19 tests prior to boarding and refrain from close contact with others on the ship. 
Globally, some cruise companies are restarting operations incrementally but the industry is far from reaching pre-COVID-19 level capacity.
Royal Caribbean International said its three-night sail from Singapore to nowhere has a base price of S$374 ($257).

Its vessel, Quantum (NASDAQ:QMCO) of the Seas, boasts a glass observation capsule 300 feet (91 metres) above sea level, a trapeze school, cocktails served by robots and has previously offered skydiving, surfing, bumper cars, roller skating and gaming.

The closely watched 1News-Colmar Brunton poll showed support for Ardern's Labour party, which is seeking a second term in office, at 47%, unchanged from the last poll on Sept. 28.
This means Labour, which is campaigning on its record of bringing the coronavirus pandemic under control within New Zealand's borders, would have 60 seats in parliament, one short of the 61 seats needed to form a government.
Support for its coalition partner the Green Party was at 6%, which would give it eight seats. 
New Zealand heads to the polls on Oct. 17 and advance voting began on Saturday.
The main opposition National Party got 32% support, failing to close a 15 percentage point gap between the parties, despite the tough-talking conservative leader Judith Collins claiming to have won two live debates with Ardern.
Ardern's popularity as preferred prime minister dropped four percentage points to 50%, while Collins was unchanged at 23%.
Smaller parties also continued to gain more support with ACT Party at 8% and New Zealand First inching up slightly to 2%.
All recent polls have pointed to a victory for Ardern's Labour Party, governing in a coalition with the Greens and New Zealand First.
Ardern, 40, has won support at home and global admiration for her response to last year's attack by a white supremacist on two mosques, a fatal volcanic eruption and her success in tackling the coronavirus.
She declared this week that New Zealand has eliminated COVID-19 from the community, again, as a second wave of infections in Auckland had been contained.

866,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 08, 2020 12:09AM ET</span>","Despite Brexit Ultimatums, U.K. and EU Are Lurching Toward Deal","(Bloomberg) -- Just as the U.K.’s trade negotiations with the European Union look like they’re heading off a cliff, there’s reason to suspect things might not be as bleak as they seem.
On the surface, the brinkmanship is clear: On Tuesday, the EU dared Boris Johnson to walk away from the talks by his Oct. 15 deadline if he views a deal as impossible. The very next day, Johnson’s government said it fully intends to do just that, if that’s what it concludes.
That followed weeks in which statements from both sides have barely gone beyond reiterating the need to keep trying because the gulf between them remains huge. On Wednesday, EU Council President Charles Michel urged the U.K. to “put its cards on the table.”
Yet, in private, officials are more upbeat. While the politics are inescapable -- and may yet be definitive -- experienced negotiators know that sometimes the worst moments happen shortly before an accord is struck.
They recall Johnson’s telephone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in October 2018, which prompted one U.K. government insider to brief that, because of her intransigence, a deal on the country’s withdrawal from the EU was effectively impossible. One was done nine days later.
The two sides are now trying to reach an accord not only on their future trade relationship, but also on a range of issues from co-operation on law enforcement to transport. Failure to reach an agreement by the time U.K. leaves the EU’s single market and customs union on Dec. 31 would leave businesses grappling with tariffs, costs and disruption at the border.
Stock-Taking
Johnson has said that if he doesn’t see that a deal is on the cards by Oct. 15, he will pull the plug so businesses have time to prepare themselves.
The EU, whose leaders will discuss Brexit at a summit on the same day, doesn’t recognize that deadline and plans to carry on talking however long it takes.
Officials in Brussels with knowledge of the negotiations suggest an elaborate choreography is being worked out, in which, despite some level of differences remaining, both sides will find a way to carry on discussions into the second half of October.
The summit will be a mere “stock-taking” exercise, which won’t get in the way of the negotiations.
‘Eminently Achievable’
The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told a meeting of European ambassadors on on Wednesday that he didn’t expect the U.K. to walk away on Oct. 15, according to officials present.
Meanwhile, his British opposite number, David Frost, told a parliamentary committee that while there is “some really difficult stuff in there that’s not yet resolved,” the negotiations have been constructive.
“I think that a deal is eminently achievable, and could be achieved -- but, equally, it is possible that we don’t get there, and we’ll have to see what the next few weeks bring,” Frost said at a hearing alongside Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove.
There are signs, too, that the two sides are getting closer to overcoming some the biggest obstacles to a deal: what rules limiting state aid the U.K. will have to follow, and what access EU fishing boats will have to British waters.
Frost told lawmakers that the U.K. is prepared to discuss conditions on business subsidies that go beyond what “you normally do in a free trade agreement.”
And Barnier told the meeting of ambassadors that member states should be willing to be more flexible on fish, an official said. France has lobbied hard to preserve the the bloc’s current access to British waters, something Johnson’s government has said is unacceptable.
EU officials are also increasingly confident that Johnson will agree to continue to apply the principles of the European Convention on Human Rights -- something hardliners in his ruling Conservative party have previously resisted.
Experienced officials in Brussels note that the mood music around a negotiation is good when both sides start talking the same language. On that, too, there are signs of progress.
After a telephone call with Johnson on Wednesday afternoon, Michel tweeted that “the EU prefers a deal, but not at any cost.”
Shortly afterward, Gove was asked for his assessment. “We are obviously keen to get a deal,” he said, but “we will not do a deal at any price.”

867,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 11:45PM ET</span>","Japan’s Suga Could Call Election Early Next Year, Adviser Says","(Bloomberg) -- Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga could call a general election either at the beginning of 2021, or after the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics end in early September, according to a key political strategist.
Suga sparked renewed speculation about a swift vote by picking campaign consultant Hiroshi Miura, who specializes in election planning, as his breakfast guest the morning after he was installed as the new premier by parliament on Sept. 16. With only a year to go on the lower house term, Suga has little time to waste, though he has repeatedly said his current priority is tackling the virus and its economic fallout, rather than elections.
“The options are January, February or after August,” Miura said in an interview this week. “Either way, I think he’ll win.”
Suga came into office with some of the highest support rates on record for a new prime minister, with a few heavyweights in his ruling Liberal Democratic Party recommending a swift vote to take advantage of the solid footing. But opinion surveys show the public is against the idea, and although the opposition has recently consolidated, it doesn’t look like it will be able to take over from the LDP any time soon.
Holding an election just ahead of, or during, a massive event like the Tokyo Olympics could cause a undesirable vacuum in management, Miura added. Leaving it until after the Paralympics, which end Sept. 5, would give Suga a window of only about two weeks until the Sept. 21 deadline.
Japan’s first new premier in almost eight years, the 71-year-old son of a strawberry farmer, takes charge of an economy that saw its biggest contraction on record in the April-June quarter as the virus hit consumption.
While Japan’s Covid-19 death toll is by far the lowest of any Group of Seven country, the cabinet’s handling of the pandemic has often come in for criticism.
Since taking office, Suga’s has focused on policies with popular backing such as reducing mobile phone bills and extending health insurance coverage of fertility treatments, which has helped put his support rate in one major poll this week at more than 70%.
Yet, clouds are gathering. Suga’s refusal to accept some nominations for an academic advisory council, which were usually rubber-stamped by previous governments, has met with a backlash. Past Japanese premiers have often seen public support be quickly eroded by scandals, resulting in a prompt turn over of leaders.
“What he has now is not so much real support, but expectations,” Miura said. “By responding to those expectations properly, one by one, he will gain real, settled support.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. national security adviser warned China on Wednesday against any attempt to take Taiwan by force, saying amphibious landings were notoriously difficult and there was a lot of ambiguity about how the United States would respond.
Robert O'Brien told an event at the University of Nevada in Las Vegas that China was engaged in a massive naval buildup probably not seen since Germany's attempt to compete with Britain's Royal Navy prior to World War One.
""Part of that is to give them the ability to push us back out of the Western Pacific, and allow them to engage in an amphibious landing in Taiwan,"" he said.
""The problem with that is that amphibious landings are notoriously difficult,"" O'Brien added, pointing to the 100-mile (160-km) distance between China and Taiwan and the paucity of landing beaches on the island.
""It's not an easy task, and there's also a lot of ambiguity about what the United States would do in response to an attack by China on Taiwan,"" he added, when asked what U.S. options would be if China moved to try to absorb Taiwan.
O'Brien was referring to a long-standing U.S. policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" on the question of whether it would intervene to protect Taiwan, which China considers its province and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary.
The United States is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, but it has not made clear whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack, something that would likely lead to a much broader conflict with Beijing.
O'Brien's comments come at a time when China has significantly stepped up military activity near Taiwan and when U.S.-China relations have plunged to the lowest point in decades in the run-up to President Donald Trump's Nov. 3 re-election bid.
O'Brien repeated U.S. calls for Taiwan to spend more on its own defense and to carry out military reforms to make clear to China the risks of attempting to invade.
""You can't just spend 1% of your GDP, which the Taiwanese have been doing - 1.2% - on defense, and hope to deter a China that's been engaged in the most massive military build up in 70 years,"" he said.
Taiwan needed to ""turn themselves into a porcupine"" militarily, he said, adding: ""Lions generally don't like to eat porcupines.""
On Tuesday, the senior U.S. defense official for East Asia called Taiwan's plan to boost defense spending by $1.4 billion next year insufficient.
He said it needed to invest in capabilities including more coastal defense cruise missiles, naval mines, fast-attack craft, mobile artillery and advanced surveillance assets. 

Taiwan's Defense Ministry, in a response provided to Reuters, said they will ""strive for an adequate budget"" in accordance with their needs to build a solid national defense force.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican scientist Mario Molina, who became his country's first winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for his work on the threat to the ozone layer from chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), died on Wednesday at the age of 77.
One of Mexico's most eminent scientists, Molina conducted some of his first experiments at a tender age in his childhood home before becoming a global authority on climate change.
The Centro Mario Molina, an environmental research body he founded, said he died of ""unexpected cardiac problems"".
Born in Mexico City, Molina was a graduate of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) and took postgraduate degrees at universities in Germany and California.
In 2008, he was appointed a scientific adviser to U.S. President Barack Obama and also advised authorities in the Mexican capital on their efforts to reduce smog and air pollution, a chronic problem in the metropolis.
When Molina was a small boy, his parents bought him a microscope. He recalled transforming one bathroom into a makeshift laboratory and was at the age of 10 already devouring biographies of Nobel laureates, such as Marie Curie.
In 1995, Molina, Frank Sherwood Rowland and Paul Crutzen were awarded the Nobel Prize for their work showing how CFCs used in spray cans were destroying the ozone layer.
Molina worked at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California in San Diego (UCSD), a key center of learning on phenomena linked to climate change.
His commitment to fighting global warming set Molina at odds with Mexico's current government, which has pursued an energy agenda aimed at strengthening state energy firms whose business models depend heavily on the use of polluting fossil fuels.

In an interview with Reuters in July, Molina vigorously condemned that policy, saying his homeland was ""going backwards to the last century - or the one before"" on climate change, an assessment the government denies.

870,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 08:55PM ET</span>",Explainer: What a North Korean holiday may reveal about Kim Jong Un's plans,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea is expected to use a major holiday this weekend to showcase its military power, highlight domestic political messages, and galvanize citizens at a time when the country faces increasing economic hardship and isolation.
International observers are closely watching the celebrations to mark the 75th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea on Saturday, eager to see what messages Kim Jong Un will send to domestic and foreign audiences. 
The stakes are high for Kim, who has seen his promises of economic progress fall short in the face of international sanctions in place amid stalled denuclearisation talks, a strict lockdown to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, and damaging summer storms.
Analysts say most of the events are expected to focus on domestic messaging through things such as national meetings, art and industry exhibitions, a light show, visits to key monuments, and ceremonies to mark the completion of construction projects.
But there is also growing speculation that Kim may use a military parade to show off his largest ballistic missiles for the first time since he first met with U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018.
The weekend's events come just weeks before the presidential election in the United States, and analysts say the parade could offer Kim a chance to project a more militant stance without resorting to something as provocative as a new nuclear test or long-range missile launch.
NEW MISSILES
Kim had promised this year to unveil a new ""strategic weapon"" in the face of continued U.S. pressure that he says stalled denuclearisation talks.
North Korea is believed to be developing a submarine capable of launching ballistic missiles, and there is speculation that a test could be imminent, but in a recent report for the Atlantic Council, two former U.S. intelligence officers argued that Kim could unveil more potent weapons at the parade.
""If he offers up an 'October surprise' this year, it probably won't be the North Korean version of the fictional Soviet ballistic-missile submarine 'Red October,' they wrote. ""Instead, it may well come in the form of new missiles displayed on the streets of Pyongyang.""
North Korea has used previous parades to unveil missiles - or mockups of missiles - that it had yet to test, and South Korean media reports have cited unnamed intelligence sources who said intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) larger than anything tested so far have been spotted at facilities near Pyongyang.
That may suggest that North Korea could showcase a ""canisterized system,"" in which missiles are stored in containers, ready to launch, similar to the kind shown in a 2017 military parade, said Melissa Hanham, deputy director of the Open Nuclear Network.
""At the time, it suggested they were working toward a multiple stage solid-fuel ICBM,"" she said. 
Solid-fuel weapons in some cases may be easier to store and faster to deploy than liquid-fueled systems, but it is unclear if the canisters displayed in 2017 carried missiles inside.
MORE MISSILES, MORE LAUNCHERS
While Kim placed a moratorium on nuclear tests and ICBM launches, he also called for the rapid production of battle-ready missiles and atomic weapons, sparking speculation that he may use this parade to show off large numbers of missiles.
Such a display would not only showcase the country's success in following Kim's directive, but would reveal whether North Korea has managed to build or buy more large ""transporter-erector-launcher"" (TELs) vehicles needed to carry ICBMs.
""The number of these vehicles is the major constraint on the North's missile numbers,"" Hanham said.
Hanham said she would be closely watching to see whether North Korea displays more short-range missiles, such as the KN-23, which was test launched multiple times since it was unveiled early last year.
""I think these types of missiles are the most destabilising, because they are small, quick to launch and the kind of thing you might try to use for a 'limited war' that could spin into nuclear war,"" she said.
DOMESTIC MESSAGING
North Korean construction workers have been rushing to complete a massive new hospital in downtown Pyongyang, which was meant to be finished in time for the Oct. 10 holiday.
Commercial satellite imagery shows that the exterior of the building is complete, according to a report on Tuesday by 38 North, a U.S.-based think tank that monitors North Korea.
Although it is doubtful that the hospital's interior is anywhere close to finished, the building is likely to ""form one of the main propaganda pillars to this weekend's events"", the report said.
Workers also carried out major renovations of Kim Il Sung Square, where the parade and other events are expected to take place.

""Major political events are great opportunities for the North Korean leadership to promote domestic unity and inspire the people's pride in the country's power,"" said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an independent analyst and former North Korea open source intelligence expert in the U.S. government. ""Since North Korea has been affected by prolonged COVID quarantine measures and lately the floods, the leadership will really want to make the best of the upcoming celebrations to do just that.""

(Reuters) - A Black police officer in Wisconsin will not face charges for the killing of an armed Black teenager eight months ago outside of a mall in a suburb of Milwaukee, his third deadly encounter with a suspect in five years. 
Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm announced on Wednesday that he found police officer Joseph Mensah was justified when he shot Alvin Cole after the 17-year-old fired a stolen handgun outside Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa on Feb. 2.
""In this case, there is sufficient evidence that officer Mensah had an actual subjective belief that deadly force was necessary and that belief was objectively reasonable,"" Chisholm said.
Mensah was involved in two other deadly shootings over the last five years. Mensah remains on administrative suspension pending proceedings with the Wauwatosa Police and Fire Commission. 
The ruling comes after a summer of protests, some violent, across the United States over racial injustice, sparked by the death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, while in the custody of Minneapolis, Minnesota police in May. 
In preparation of possible civil unrest, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers authorized the Wisconsin National Guard to respond to Wauwatosa. There have been demonstrations in the city to the west of Milwaukee since the shooting of Cole.
""I am not surprised by this miscarriage of justice,"" said State Representative David Bowen in a statement after learning of the ruling. ""It is past time for systemic transformation."" 
On Feb. 2 at about 5:30 p.m., Cole entered the Mayfair Mall with a semi-automatic pistol in a bag over his shoulder. Cole then got into an argument with another man and displayed his weapon.
Mall security told Cole to leave the mall and contacted the police. When police confronted Cole outside the shopping center, he ran. During the pursuit, Cole shot himself in the arm and fell before he pointed his gun at officers. Mensah opened fire, killing Cole, district attorney Chisholm wrote in his report.

The Earthshot Prize will award five one-million-pound ($1.29-million) prizes each year for the next 10 years under the categories of protecting and restoring nature, cleaner air, reviving oceans, waste-reduction and climate change.
Nominations open on Nov. 1 ahead of the first awards ceremony in the autumn next year. 
William, grandson of Queen Elizabeth and second-in-line to the throne, said change was critical in the next decade to help protect and restore the environment.
""By 2030 we really hope to have made huge strides in fixing some of the biggest problems the Earth faces,"" Prince William, 38, will tell BBC Radio when he is interviewed on Thursday with naturalist David Attenborough. 
""I think that urgency with optimism really creates action. And so the Earthshot Prize is really about harnessing that optimism and that urgency to find solutions to some of the world’s greatest environmental problems."" 
The British royal family have been vocal campaigners on a host of environmental issues, with William's father Prince Charles speaking out for decades about the impact of climate change and the importance of conservation.
Kensington Palace said the prize drew its inspiration from U.S. President John F. Kennedy's Moonshot, which it said since the 1969 moon landing was synonymous with ambitious and ground-breaking goals.
It said the prizes would provide at least 50 solutions to the world’s environmental problems by 2030. 
The Earthshot Prize Council will be set up to decide on the winners with its members to include names from the environmental, philanthropic, business, sporting and entertainment worlds. They will be announced later on Thursday. 
The project has more than 100 partners around the world who will submit nominations from Nov. 1, said the statement. The 2021 awards ceremony will take place in London and then in different cities around the world.
The Earthshot Prizes were first announced last December.

875,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 06:05PM ET</span>",What women want: Female vote key but policies lacking in New Zealand election,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's upcoming general election has the rare distinction of providing a choice of two female candidates as the country's next leader in a poll that could be decided by the female vote.
Yet there is growing criticism that neither incumbent Jacinda Ardern nor challenger Judith Collins have policies to address the fact that women - who make up half the 5 million population - have been disproportionately negatively affected by the coronavirus pandemic. 
""There has been a frightening silence, to be honest,"" said Lisa Lawrence, President for the National Council of Women.
Some analysts believe the oversight could cost Ardern, who polls show is on track to win the election, a chance to become the country's first leader to govern outright since electoral reform in the 1990s, rather than as part of a coalition.
Alarm (NASDAQ:ALRM) bells pealed in August when official data showed about 90% of people who left their jobs in the April to June quarter, at the peak of the country's coronavirus lockdown, were women. While the unemployment rate for men fell 3.6% that quarter, the women's measure surged 4.4%.
The data crystallized a global trend of ""shecession"", with sectors worst hit by the pandemic, such as hospitality and tourism, dominated by women.
In response, both Ardern's Labour Party and Collins' conservative National Party have put the male-dominated infrastructure industry at the heart of their coronavirus recovery plans, promising more construction and jobs.
Ardern referred to ""double duty"" in a recent leaders' debate, saying a building boom would both employ skilled workers and create new training programs - encouraging women to join the sector.
""These are high-skilled, high-wage jobs that have good prospects attached to them,"" she said. ""Why shouldn't our women take them up?""
Yet with women representing fewer than 3% of the construction industry workforce, and few commitments for teaching, healthcare and care-giving professions, where women form majority of the workforce, critics say it is far from enough.
""All of the economic responses and stimulus packages seem to be about 'shovel ready' projects, and even this wording gives a connotation of male dominated industries, if we are going by gender stereotypes,"" said Lawrence.
Even the current Minister for Women Julie Anne Genter, a senior leader of Labour's junior coalition partner Green Party, said while the government's multibillion dollar wage protection helped women stay in jobs, more needed to be done.
""Now we need to make sure that the huge investments in retraining and trades-training is accessible to women and is meeting the needs of women who may have lost their job due to hospitality and tourism being affected by COVID-19,"" Genter said. 
National said its policies included working with the private sector to promote women to senior management positions, providing a one-off payment to pregnant women to provide post-natal support, and investing in retraining programmes to get women get back into the workforce.
PLAYING IT SAFE
While Ardern is widely expected to win the Oct. 17 election, recent polls have indicated a shift away from both Labour and the Nationals to the minor parties, including the Greens. 
A closely watched 1News-Colmar Brunton poll on Sept. 28 showed support for Labour had dipped to 47%, which would leave the party two seats short of the 61 needed to form a majority government. Support for the Greens rose to 7%, which would give it eight seats. 
Under New Zealand's mixed-member proportional electoral system, that result would force Ardern to lean on the Greens to form government, with the junior party then taking up the deputy leadership and other key cabinet positions. 
More than a century after New Zealand women became the first in the world to win the vote, they continue to exercise the right more than men, making their support critical.
Ardern was able to form government in 2017 partly on the back of a swing to Labour by female voters who celebrated the elevation of a fresh, young dynamic woman fighting against a male-dominated opposing political team.
Support has grown during Ardern's first term, in which she became only the second woman in the world to give birth while in elected office. She won global praise for both her decisive yet compassionate handling of the 2019 Christchurch mosque attacks and her swift action this year to successfully contain the COVID-19 outbreak in New Zealand.
Political commentator Bryce Edwards of Victoria University in Wellington said that strong record meant the Labour party simply did not need to take any risks with new policies or ideas heading into the election. Ardern's government passed abortion law reforms through parliament earlier this year and has promised to tackle so-called ""period poverty"".

""They are running a conservative election campaign,"" Edwards said. ""Ardern is well aware of New Zealand voters. She does not want to be painted as a feminist or disparagingly called 'woke', and be targeted as a liberal elite.""

Since leaving the European Union earlier this year, Britain is seeking bilateral agreements with other countries, underlining Johnson's resolve to go it alone once a transition arrangement with the bloc concludes at the end of this year.
Britain threw its support behind Ukraine after Russia seized Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014 and backed separatists in a war that has killed thousands of people, in action that brought Western sanctions against Moscow.
""The UK is Ukraine's most fervent supporter ... we are utterly committed to upholding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,"" Johnson said in a statement.
""The Strategic Partnership Agreement we are signing today signals the next chapter in our relationship. It's a chapter that will bring increased security and prosperity for both the people of the UK and Ukraine.""
The agreement includes a comprehensive preferential free trade agreement covering goods, services, and tariffs and quotas, the government said, adding that it rolled over and built upon the EU-Ukraine Agreement.
On Wednesday, Ukraine said it would sign a memorandum with Britain to secure 1.25 billion pounds to build new military vessels for the Ukrainian Navy. 

Zelenskiy is on a two-day visit to Britain, where he was given a tour of the Prince of Wales aircraft carrier in Portsmouth.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Mexican government official who oversaw public security in his country pleaded not guilty to new U.S. charges over his alleged role in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme, to protect the Sinaloa drug cartel once run by drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
Genaro Garcia Luna entered his plea on Wednesday to engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise at a hearing before U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan in the federal court in Brooklyn, a spokesman for Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme said.
The charge was added in an indictment in July, after Garcia Luna had pleaded not guilty on Jan. 3 to charges including drug trafficking conspiracy and making false statements.
Two former subordinate law enforcement officers, Luis Cardenas Palomino and Ramon Pequeno Garcia, were also charged in the new indictment, despite being at large.
Garcia Luna had been living in Florida prior to his December 2019 arrest in Dallas.
He was detained following his initial plea, when prosecutors called him an ""unacceptable"" flight risk.
Guzman is appealing his February 2019 conviction and sentence of life in prison without parole for smuggling tons of drugs to the United States in a colorful, decades-long career.
He is incarcerated at ADX Florence, a maximum-security facility in Colorado known as the nation's most secure ""Supermax"" prison. Cogan oversaw Guzman's trial.
Garcia Luna led Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005, was secretary of public security from 2006 to 2012, and was once considered a leader in Mexico's efforts to combat drug trafficking.
But prosecutors said the Sinaloa cartel bribed Garcia Luna throughout his time in government to ensure safe passage for its drugs, obtain information about rival cartels, and learn about Mexican probes into its activities.
The cartel delivered bribes to Garcia Luna in briefcases at least twice, prosecutors said.

In the final episode of a three-part interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television aired on Wednesday, Prince Bandar once again criticised Palestinian leaders.
""We are at a stage in which rather than being concerned with how to face the Israeli challenges in order to serve the Palestinian cause, we have to pay attention to our national security and interests,"" he said.
Prince Bandar previously in the interview criticised the Palestinian leadership for their ""transgression"" and ""reprehensible discourse"", in opposing the decision of some Gulf states to normalise ties with Israel.
The United Arab Emirates agreed a historic deal to normalise relations with Israel in August, and the Gulf state of Bahrain, a close Saudi ally, followed suit in September. Palestinian leaders regarded the deal as ""betrayal"".
Palestinians fear the moves will weaken a long-standing pan-Arab position - known as the Arab Peace Initiative - that calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab states.
The deals are seen as a strategic realignment of Middle East countries against Iran. Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has not directly commented on the normalisation deals, but has said it remains committed to peace on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative.
Prince Bandar said Palestinian leaders had high regard for ""new players into the picture"" such as Iran and Turkey, than Riyadh and other Gulf countries. 
""Turkey occupies Libya and wants to liberate Jerusalem by withdrawing its ambassador from Abu Dhabi. Iran wants to liberate Jerusalem through the Houthis in Yemen or through Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria,"" he said.
He spoke at length about the decades-long support of successive Saudi kings and other Gulf countries to the Palestinian cause, adding that the denial of these efforts from Palestinian leaders will not affect the attachment to the cause.
""Things are clear and we are at our limit with those guys,"" he said.

Republican James Lankford and Democrat Chris Van Hollen wrote to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asking about the report and saying that Washington's failure to act more decisively about the S-400 purchase had ""emboldened"" Turkey's government.
Turkey bought a batch of the missile systems from Russia last year, leading to its suspension by Washington from the U.S. F-35 stealth fighter jet program. The United States has said Turkey risks U.S. sanctions if it deploys the Russian-made S-400s, but has not yet imposed them.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter.

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Police on Wednesday rescued 11 children and two teenagers working on cocoa plantations in southwestern Ivory Coast and arrested three farmers on suspicion of people trafficking, the police commissioner said.
Child labour increased in the world's top cocoa producer during the coronavirus lockdown, according to a report in June by the Swiss-based International Cocoa Initiative (ICI).
""We conducted this operation this morning in the two major cocoa-producing cities ... and arrested the farmers who were employing them in their fields,"" police commissioner Luc Zaka said.
The children were shelling cocoa pods in a field near approximately 20 adults, Zaka said. Initially planned for May and June, the operation was postponed because of the novel coronavirus pandemic.
The Ivorian government introduced restrictions on March 16, including closing schools and partially sealing its external borders. Most of those measures have now been lifted.
In December last year Ivorian police rescued more than a hundred children from cocoa plantations during a similar operation in the east of the country.
More than one million children work illegally on cocoa plantations in the west African country, a figure that has been rising steadily over the last decade, according to charities working in the sector.
In March the police received more resources and opened six operational centres in the main cocoa producing regions to better combat child trafficking and labour.
""Now that we have more means, we can deploy faster to all corners and carry out these kinds of operations,"" Zaka said.

The monarch dissolved parliament on Sept. 27 at the end of its four-year term, a move that under constitutional rules meant the government had to resign within a week.
In a letter of designation, the monarch said he entrusted Khasawneh, who has been a palace advisor since last year after a career mostly spent as a diplomat and peace negotiator with Israel, to form a cabinet of qualified ministers who would rise to the country's challenges.
Khasawneh will oversee parliamentary elections due on Nov. 10 whose outcome is expected under an electoral law that marginalises the Islamist opposition to maintain a majority of pro-government deputies.
The country is facing a peak in COVID-19 infections at a time of rising popular discontent over worsening economic conditions and curbs on public freedoms under emergency laws.

Jordan's economy is expected to shrink by 6% this year as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in many years, with unemployment and poverty aggravated by the pandemic.

883,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Qatar makes formal request for F-35 jets - sources,"By Mike Stone
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Qatar has submitted a formal request to the United States to buy stealthy F-35 fighter jets, three people familiar with the deal said, in a deal that if pursued could strain U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
The request for the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) Co jets was submitted by the Persian Gulf state in recent weeks, the people said.
A U.S. State Department spokesman said, ""As a matter of policy, the United States does not confirm or comment on proposed defense sales or transfers until they are formally notified to Congress.""
The Qatari embassy in Washington, D.C. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Keen to counter Iran in the region, the U.S. helps to arm allies including Qatar, host to the largest U.S. military facility in the Middle East, and home to 8,000 U.S. service members and Department of Defense civilian employees.
The request follows an August deal between the U.S. and the United Arab Emirates in which Washington agreed to consider giving the Gulf state approval to buy F-35s in a side deal to a U.S.-brokered agreement called the Abraham Accord to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel.
Israel has signaled stiff opposition to a UAE sale and would likely be just as resistant to one with Qatar, fearing it could undercut its military advantage in the Middle East.
In Washington, a fourth person familiar with the matter said concern about Qatar's links to Hamas have frequently surfaced over arms sales to the Gulf state. But in the case of an advanced warplane like the F-35, it could be a deal breaker.
One of the people said Qatar's letter of request for the jets, the first formal step in the legal process of foreign military sale, was not directly linked to its adoption of the Abraham Accord. Nor has Qatar shown any sign it will normalize ties with Israel.
U.S. and Qatar have close ties. In September Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Qatar Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met in Washington as the U.S. hopes to move forward with naming Qatar as a major non-NATO ally.
Despite being U.S. allies, both the potential Qatari and UAE F-35 deals must satisfy a decades-old agreement with Israel that states any U.S. weapons sold to the region must not impair Israel's ""qualitative military edge,"" guaranteeing U.S. weapons furnished to Israel are ""superior in capability"" to those sold to its neighbors. 
Saudi Arabia, Washington's most powerful and closest partner among the Gulf Arab states, is also likely to oppose the United States supplying F-35s to Qatar. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt remain locked in a three-year standoff with Qatar that the Trump administration has tried to end, so far without success.
A formal letter of request typically contains specifications that would be used to furnish pricing data to a customer, but currently the F-35A, a fifth generation stealthy fighter jet, costs around $80 million.
Any F-35 sale could take years to negotiate and deliver, giving a new U.S. presidential administration ample time to halt the deals. Any sale would also need congressional approval.

Poland, the most recent F-35 customer, purchased 32 of the jets, but will not receive its first delivery until 2024.

PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France and Germany said on Wednesday they would propose European Union sanctions against Russian individuals after receiving no credible answers from Moscow over the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny with a nerve agent.
Several Western governments have said Russia, which has denied accusations by Navalny that it was involved in poisoning him in August, must help in investigations or face consequences.
The decision and speed with which Europe's two main powers agreed to push ahead with sanctions suggested a hardening of the bloc's diplomacy towards Moscow, which in turn said that it no longer considered ""business as usual"" to be possible with Berlin and Paris.
The move is in stark contrast to 2018 when it took almost a year for members to agree on sanctions against Russian individuals following a nerve agent attack on a Russian spy in Britain.
""No credible explanation has been provided by Russia so far. In this context, we consider that there is no other plausible explanation for Mr Navalny's poisoning than a Russian involvement and responsibility,"" Foreign Ministers Jean-Yves Le Drian and Heiko Maas said in a joint statement. 
Diplomats had earlier told Reuters the two countries would propose sanctions on Russian GRU military intelligence officials when the EU's 27 foreign ministers meet on Oct. 12. 
""Drawing the necessary conclusions from these facts, France and Germany will share with European partners proposals for additional sanctions,"" the two ministers said.
""Proposals will target individuals deemed responsible for this crime and breach of international norms, based on their official function, as well as an entity involved in the Novichok programme.""
Blood samples taken from Navalny confirmed the presence of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Tuesday.
""Instead of appropriate cooperation with the Russian Federation in the interest of clarifying circumstances of what has happened to the blogger, the governments of Germany and France have now switched to threats and attempts to blackmail us,"" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Paris and Berlin are unwilling to take into account facts that Russia has voiced many times, Zakharova said, without naming the facts.
""We don't consider 'business as usual' to be possible with Berlin or Paris,"" she said in comments published on the foreign ministry's website.
EU foreign ministers are expected to give their political support on Monday, but the sanctions are not expected to be approved immediately as legal texts must be prepared and cleared by experts from the 27 EU states.
Le Drian told a parliamentary committee in Paris on Wednesday: ""We say with Germany that clarification by Russia is indispensable and if it doesn't clarify then we will need to draw conclusions among Europeans. We are in sync with Germany.""

He said Paris was not closing the door to dialogue with Moscow.

BAKU/YEREVAN/PARIS (Reuters) - France, the United States and Russia will step up efforts to end fighting between Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces in the South Caucasus by holding talks in Geneva on Thursday, as fears of a regional war grow. 
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said Russian, French and U.S. representatives would also meet in Moscow on Monday to look at ways to persuade the warring sides to negotiate a ceasefire. 
""We want everyone to understand that it's in their interest to immediately stop hostilities without conditions and that we start a negotiation,"" he told the French parliament's foreign affairs committee.
Le Drian did not make clear whether any Armenian and Azeri representatives would attend but Azerbaijan said its foreign minister, Jeyhun Bayramov, would visit Geneva on Thursday.
The Armenian foreign ministry said Foreign Minister Zohrab Mnatsakanyan would visit Moscow on Monday but gave no details. It ruled out a meeting with Bayramov.
The warring sides have so far ignored ceasefire calls by Paris, Washington and Moscow, which have mediated for nearly three decades in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave which under international law belongs to Azerbaijan but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.
The Azeri and Armenian leaders have also been at odds over their conditions for halting fighting that began on Sept. 27. 
More than 360 people have been killed, including 320 military personnel and 19 civilians in Nagorno-Karabakh, and 28 Azeri civilians. They are the deadliest clashes since a 1991-94 war over Nagorno-Karabakh that killed about 30,000. 
Azerbaijan says Azeri cities outside the conflict zone have also been attacked. This has taken fighting closer to territory from which pipelines carry Azeri gas and oil to Europe, and prompted British oil company BP (NYSE:BP) to look at tightening security at its facilities in Azerbaijan.
""We must be attentive that the war between Armenia and Azerbaijan does not become a regional war,"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said in televised remarks.
Iran, which borders both Armenia and Azerbaijan, has been talking to both the former Soviet republics as concern mounts that Turkey, a close ally of Azerbaijan, and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, could be sucked into the conflict.
CEASEFIRE CONDITIONS 
France, the United States and Russia are co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group that mediates over Nagorno-Karabakh.
Turkey has accused the group of neglecting the conflict and said it should not be involved in mediation.
Le Drian hit back at Turkey, reiterating accusations - denied by Ankara - that it is involved militarily and saying this fuelled the ""internationalisation"" of the conflict.
Azeri President Ilham Aliyev has said his country will hold talks with Armenia only after the acute phase of military conflict ends, and wants Turkey involved in mediation.
He also wants Armenia to set a timetable for a withdrawal from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azeri territories.
Armenia’s ceasefire conditions are Turkey ""discontinuing its engagement"" and ""the withdrawal of mercenaries and terrorists or their elimination"", Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's press service quoted him as telling Time magazine.
In comments to Sky News, Pashinyan said Turkey and Azerbaijan were pursuing a policy of genocide and ""reinstating the Turkish empire"". Both have dismissed such accusations in the past.

Some 1.5 million Armenians were killed under Ottoman rule between 1915 and 1923. Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide.

CANCUN, Mexico (Reuters) - Hurricane Delta left a trail of toppled trees, torn roofs and downed power lines in top Caribbean getaway Cancun on Wednesday but the storm weakened before landfall and appeared to have wrought less destruction than many had feared.
Beachside roads were flooded, small boats overturned in a marina, while roof tiles and broken glass littered sidewalks in what looked like a ghost-town early on Wednesday, with 39,000 residents and tourists mostly hidden in shelters before winds abated.
Steven Helling had hunkered down in his 16th-floor condominium overlooking the ocean, where he felt the building sway and in the morning discovered his glass balcony railing had been blown out, along with many others across the complex.
""Honest to God you could feel the building moving... the winds were unbelievable,"" said Helling, a Texas native, adding that experiencing a hurricane had been ""on my bucket list.""
Fallen trees partially blocked a road to the resort's strip of five-star hotels, and a heavy-set policemen with an axe hacked a path through the debris. Smaller properties suffered caved in-walls or shattered windows, including a local Banco Azteca bank branch surrounded by shards. 
Delta had weakened to Category 2 on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of intensity, with winds of 110 miles per hour (175 km per hour), by the time it hit the coast close to Puerto Morelos, a fishing village popular with tourists.
The storm retained a similar strength as it raked across the Yucatan peninsula, an area of jungle, Mayan ruins and modern-day Mayan indigenous towns and villages. 
It was expected to gather strength again and hit the Gulf of Mexico later in the day. Its approach has prompted oil companies to shut down offshore production platforms and withdraw workers.
The NHC issued a storm surge warning for parts of the U.S. Gulf Coast, including High Island Texas and along to the Alabama-Florida border. 
""I WANT TO GO HOME""
Cancun scrambled to shutter shops and evacuate tourists from beach hotels on Tuesday as Delta looked to be one of the strongest hurricanes to threaten the area in years.
Even as a weaker storm, Delta's arrival was a blow to Mexican efforts to revive tourism battered by the coronavirus pandemic in the surrounding beach-lined state of Quintana Roo.
""I want to go home, this is crazy,"" said Dee Harris, a 29-year-old from Michigan who came to Cancun with his partner and had been due to leave before the storm led to the cancellation of their flight. ""The vacation was good before this.""
A hurricane warning was in place from the beach town of Tulum westwards, including Cozumel.

894,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>",UK sees 66% chance of Brexit trade deal but tells EU to hurry up,"By Guy Faulconbridge, Kate Holton and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain said on Wednesday there was a 66% chance of a Brexit trade deal but sought to use Prime Minister Boris Johnson's deadline of Oct. 15 to hurry the bloc's negotiators towards an agreement.
The two sides say they are inching towards a deal that would govern around $900 billion in trade after Dec. 31 - when the current transitional arrangements end - though sticking points remain on fishing, level playing field issues and governance.
""The landing zone and the nature of the agreement is pretty clear if not exactly pinned down yet,"" David Frost, the UK's chief Brexit negotiator, told parliament. ""A deal is eminently achievable and could be achieved but equally it is possible that we won't get there.""
When Johnson's Brexit supremo, Michael Gove, was asked by a Conservative lawmaker if the probability of a deal was still 66%, Gove said: ""I think that's about right.""
Frost cautioned the EU that an Oct. 15 deadline set by Johnson on Sept. 7 remained a deadline. The EU is due to asses progress on a deal at an Oct. 15-16 summit. 
He added that Britain's ""door would never be closed"" and that a huge amount of textual work would need to follow Oct. 15 if an outline deal was struck.
""As we approach the 15th -- and it is very close already -- I will have to advise the prime minister on whether the conditions in his statement have been met or not, and we will have to consider the situation at that point,"" Frost said.
Sterling fell on a Bloomberg report that Britain would pull out of talks next week unless there was clear landing zone for a deal. Sources told Reuters the EU is gearing up to keep negotiating until as late as mid-November.
The United Kingdom formally left the EU on Jan. 31, more than three years after it voted 52%-48% for Brexit in a 2016 referendum. The two sides are now trying to work out how everything from cars to Camembert to whisky will trade.
Johnson told European Council President Charles Michel on Wednesday that some progress had been made but that significant differences remained.
""NOT AT ANY PRICE""
Gove said no-deal preparations were intensifying so that if the EU was intransigent and no good deal was available, the United Kingdom would not be held hostage by the EU.
""Those preparations are intensifying as we speak,"" Gove said. ""While we are obviously keen to get a deal, we will not do a deal at any price.""
The EU replied to Gove within hours.
""The EU prefers a deal, but not at any cost,"" said Michel. ""Time for the UK to put its cards on the table.""
While many investment banks say their base case is that a deal will be done, some diplomats fear Johnson could ultimately decide that a no-deal is more attractive in domestic political terms than such a thin trade deal.
The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed EU ambassadors in Brussels on Wednesday on the negotiations.
""Barnier did not strike a particularly optimistic tone today,"" said one diplomat who attended the briefing, adding that expectations for the Brexit-focused EU summit next week were low and negotiations were expected to continue after that.
Emotive issues remain unresolved, such as fishing.
A French EU lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament's fisheries committee told Reuters there could be no annual quota negotiation in a trade deal with Britain, sticking to a tough line from Paris that could make a Brexit deal more difficult.

Britain could agree to a ""glide path"" towards a suitable end point for a future fisheries agreement with the EU as long as it satisfied the country's fishing communities, Frost said.

895,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Britain examining how to reduce travel quarantine period using tests,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is urgently looking at ways to reduce the 14-day quarantine period which applies to some arriving passengers, transport minister Grant Shapps said on Wednesday, adding that a mix of COVID-19 testing and self-isolation was promising.
Arrivals from countries like France, Spain and the United States must self-isolate for 14 days on arrival in Britain, a restriction which airlines say is crushing travel demand.
Shapps said he was setting up a Global Travel Taskforce to open up international travel.
""The overall aim of the Taskforce will be to consider what steps the government can take... to enable the safe and sustainable recovery of international travel,"" he added in a statement.
It would report back no later than early November. 
In July, Britain changed its policy from a blanket quarantine to one which established ""travel corridors"" to countries with low infection rates. 
But with cases on the rise in several places, the list of countries on the quarantine exemption list is dwindling, and the travel industry has warned it faces an existential crisis unless the policy is changed again.
""My ministerial colleagues and I have agreed that a regime, based on a single test, provided by the private sector and at the cost of the passenger after a period of self-isolation, could achieve our objective,"" Shapps said.
Virgin Atlantic, easyJet (LON:EZJ), London's Heathrow airport and Manchester Airports Group said that a test of a passenger after five days should be the starting point of proposals in a joint statement. 
But airline body IATA said that 80% of travellers said they would not fly at all if any quarantine were in place.

""The proposals on the table do not go as far as we had hoped,"" the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said. ""A reduction in the length of quarantine is the very minimum needed to restart travel demand.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi diplomats, Sikh separatists and Indian business executives have been among those targeted by a group of hired hackers, according to research published on Wednesday by software firm BlackBerry (NYSE:BB) Corp. 
The report https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/blackberry-uncovers-massive-hack-for-hire-group-targeting-governments-businesses-human-rights-groups-and-influential-individuals on the group, known publicly as Bahamut, the name assigned to the mythical sea monster of Arab lore, highlights how cybersecurity researchers are increasingly finding evidence of mercenaries online. 
BlackBerry's vice president of research, Eric Milam, said the diversity of Bahamut's activities was such that he assumed it was working for a range of different clients. 
""There's too many different things going on across too many different ranges and too many different verticals that it would be a single state,"" Milam said ahead of the report's release.
In June, Reuters reported on how an obscure Indian IT firm called BellTroX https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23G1GQ offered its hacking services to help clients spy on more than 10,000 email accounts over seven years, including targeting prominent American investors.
BlackBerry - which absorbed antivirus firm Cylance in 2019 - stitched together digital clues left by other researchers over the years to create a picture of a sophisticated group of hackers. BlackBerry also linked the group to mobile phone applications in the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) app stores. Those apps, which included a fitness tracker and password manager, may have helped the hackers track their targets, the report said. 
A Google spokesman said all the apps in the Google Play Store mentioned in the report had been removed. Apple said two of the seven apps were no longer in its App Store and that it was not provided with enough information about the remaining programs to judge whether they were malicious. 
Milam declined to comment on who he thought might be behind Bahamut, but he said he hoped the report would help to sharpen the focus on hackers-for-hire. 
Taha Karim, the chief executive of Emirati cybersecurity company tephracore - who was not involved in BlackBerry's research but reviewed the report ahead of publication - said the findings were credible and ""they found links that aren't obvious.""
THE TARGETS
BlackBerry did not name any of Bahamut's targets directly, but researchers have previously publicly identified Middle Eastern human rights activists, Pakistani military officials, and Gulf Arab businessmen as being in the group's crosshairs. Reuters was also able to identify new targets by cross-referencing data published in BlackBerry's report with boobytrapped webpages preserved by urlscan.io, a cybersecurity tool. 
One heavily targeted organization included the New York-based Sikhs for Justice, a separatist group that's campaigning for an independent homeland for Sikhs in India. Its founder, Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, said his campaign websites have been repeatedly hacked and his emails broken into. Others pursued by the hackers included: The United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Defense, its Supreme Council for National Security, and Shaima Gargash, the Emirates' No. 2 diplomat in Washington. 
In an email, Gargash said the embassy had no comment.
Saudi officials were also targeted by the hackers. Cached phishing pages preserved by services such as urlscan and reviewed by Reuters showed that the cyber spies targeted Mawthouq, the Saudi government's email service, half a dozen Saudi government ministries, and the Saudi Center for International Strategic Partnerships, a Riyadh-based body aimed at helping coordinate the petrostate's foreign policy. 
The Saudi Embassy in Washington declined comment.
The hackers pursued royals and business executives in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. In August 2019 they attempted to compromise an employee of major Indian energy conglomerate Reliance Industries around the time that the company was negotiating the sale of a stake in its oil-to-chemicals business to  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222).

Reliance did not return repeated messages. Attempts to reach the hackers were unsuccessful.

The gunmen, who carried out the attack near the town of Pissila in the Center-North region on the night of Oct. 4, separated the men from the group and shot them. The women and children were let go, UNHCR said in a statement based on survivors' testimony. 
""The attack on the (internally displaced people) occurred as they were returning to their homes from Pissila, hoping for an improved security situation there,"" the U.N. said.

Peter Pham, U.S. Special Envoy to the Sahel, said on Wednesday.
Pham, who recently visited Mali and met the new leaders of the transition, told a news conference the interim government marked progress towards conducting free and fair elections.
""But until such time as those are held, and a constitutional government is restored, we are obliged under U.S. law to restrict our military assistance,"" Pham said.
The policy means Mali will be without U.S. military support, which includes training of troops, for the next 18 months, after which the interim authorities have pledged to hold an election. 
The United States halted military support on Aug. 21 following the ouster of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.
Mali's international partners and neighbours are worried the coup, the second in less than a decade, could fuel further political instability and derail a joint fight against insurgents who have gained a foothold in the country.
Hopes of a smooth transition were dampened on Tuesday when an opposition coalition that led large-scale protests before the coup said it would not endorse the new government, claiming it had been sidelined in talks.
The United States has maintained its support during this period to other international partners in Mali such as France, who are battling militants there linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
Pham said security assistance to international partners such as the G5 Sahel nations, the French Barkhane operation and European Takuba task force, or cooperation with the United Nations mission to Mali, remains in place. 
""The restrictions are specific. They are security assistance to the regime that takes over from an elected government. It doesn't involve humanitarian and development assistance which consist of the bulk of our assistance for Mali,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two alleged Islamic State militants known as the 'Beatles' will arrive in the United States on Wednesday to face trial on U.S. charges for their alleged involvement in beheadings of American hostages in Syria, the U.S. Department of Justice said. 
The alleged militants, Alexanda Kotey and El Shafee Elsheikh, have been in U.S. military custody abroad since they were captured in 2019. They grew up in Britain and were UK citizens, but the British government withdrew their citizenship.
The pair are suspected of membership in a four-strong Islamic State cell known as the 'Beatles' because of their British accents. The group is alleged to have detained or killed Western hostages in Syria, including U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and aid workers Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig.
""These charges are the product of many years of hard work in pursuit of justice for our citizens slain by ISIS. Although we cannot bring them back, we can and will seek justice for them, their families, and for all Americans,"" Attorney General William P. Barr said in a statement. 
In order to secure British help in obtaining evidence on the pair, Barr agreed that U.S. prosecutors would not seek the death penalty in any cases against them and would not carry out executions if they were imposed. 
The pair were held in Iraq by the U.S. military for around a year and are now in FBI custody, Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers told a news conference. 
""As for their ringleader, Mohamed Emwazi (infamously known as Jihadi John), he faced a different type of American resolve - the mighty reach of our military, which successfully targeted him in an airstrike several years ago,"" Demers said. 
FBI Director Christopher Wray said Islamic State is still trying to radicalize people in the United States and elsewhere. 
""Their goal is to motivate people to launch attacks against Western targets wherever they are, using any means available,"" Wray said. 
Wray and Demers said the support of the British government was critical to moving the investigation and prosecution forward.
The families of Foley, Kassig, Mueller and Sotloff welcomed the news. 
""James, Peter, Kayla and Steven were kidnapped, tortured, beaten, starved, and murdered by members of the Islamic State in Syria,"" they said in a joint statement. 
""Now our families can pursue accountability for these crimes against our children in a U.S. court."" 

If convicted, Kotey and Elsheikh could face up to life in prison. The two are expected to appear in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Wednesday afternoon, officials said.

The Tripoli-based interior ministry said in a statement it had arrested the three suspects in the case, adding that they had used petrol to set the victim on fire at a factory. 
Federico Soda, Libya country chief for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), a U.N. migration agency, said those responsible must be held accountable. 
There are half a million migrants in Libya according to IOM, some of them having worked in the oil producing country before it descended into chaos and warfare, others attempting to travel through it to Europe. 
The IOM and the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR have both repeatedly said that Libya should not be classified as a safe port for migrants. 
Thousands have attempted the perilous sea crossing to Europe this year, with hundreds drowned in ship wrecks. 
In July, three migrants from Sudan were shot dead by Libyan authorities while trying to flee detention after they were disembarked in Khums.
In May, some 30 mostly Bangladeshi migrants were shot dead in a southern desert town after being abducted by a local gang, Bangladesh and the Libyan interior ministry said at the time.

""It is getting harder. It is getting hotter. We expected this,"" Lissu, from the main opposition Chadema party, told Reuters on Wednesday.
Chadema says its party offices in Arusha in northern Tanzania were firebombed. Meanwhile, dozens of opposition parliamentary candidates were disqualified from running in the elections for president and members of parliament on Oct. 28.
""The regime is getting scared and therefore they are pulling out all the stops, using all instruments of power in their capacity to fight my campaign,"" said Lissu. 
Government spokesman Hassan Abbasi said that elections are under the purview of the National Electoral Commission when Reuters contacted him for comment.
Some iteration of Tanzania's CCM party has held power since independence in 1961, and President John Magufuli is widely expected to win a second term, tightening his grip on East Africa's third-largest economy. 
However, CCM's percentage of the presidential vote has slightly declined over the past two elections. 
Last month U.S. ambassador to Tanzania Donald Wright tweeted his concerns about ""politically motivated violence and the overall increase in tensions as we get closer to Tanzania's elections."" 
International watchdogs like Human Rights Watch and Reporters Without Borders have warned that repression of the opposition, activist groups, and the media has increased.
The government has previously denied clamping down on dissent. 
Lissu returned in July after three years in exile following an unsolved 2017 assassination attempt. He was shot 16 times but survived.
Police said they teargassed Lissu's campaign convoy after unidentified people threw stones at them. They also said they had arrested opposition activists in one case, after Chadema offices were firebombed.
CANDIDATES SUSPENDED
Last Friday, the ethics committee of the National Electoral Commission (NEC) suspended Lissu from campaigning for a week for using incendiary language.
The NEC has also upheld the disqualification of 39 parliamentary candidates who were initially disqualified and reinstated 67 others.
The opposition says the disqualifications are an attempt to boost the ruling party, an accusation the commission rejects.
""Why should the commission disqualify you if you meet all the criteria? It is not true,"" said Emmanuel Kawishe, the commission's legal services director. 
Magufuli - nicknamed ""The Bulldozer"" - won the presidency in 2015, promising to fight corruption and build infrastructure. 
Pictures of his wife being treated in a public hospital shortly after he was elected instead of being flown abroad for treatment helped boost his popularity. 
But he has also clamped down on dissent. His government banned public rallies in 2016, and at least 10 Tanzanian media outlets have been banned for periods ranging from one week to indefinitely between January 2016 and July 2020, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. 
That means the opposition has effectively been muzzled for several years, although now they are able to campaign, said Nicodemus Minde, a researcher on Tanzania at Nairobi's United States International University. 
The media is wary of covering the campaign however, said political analyst Aikande Kwayu, as the Media Services Act of 2016 and the Electronic and Postal Communications Regulations are vague and are used to punish the media. 

""This has made the media cautious in covering the campaign and scared to portray the ruling party in a negative light,"" she said.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Estonia and Latvia said on Wednesday they were recalling their ambassadors to Belarus in response to what Tallinn called ""unfounded"" Belarusian pressure on Lithuania and Poland, fellow critics of veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko.
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were the first European Union countries to sanction Lukashenko and other officials for alleged fraud during a disupted Aug. 9 presidential election he said he won and violence against protests that followed.
Belarus in turn accuses Lithuania and Poland of meddling in its affairs by hosting exiled opposition leaders and refusing to recognise the victory of Lukashenko in the election.
Belarus recalled its own ambassadors from Poland and Lithuania on Friday for consultations and issued a request that the two EU member states scale back the number of staff at their embassies.
Lithuania and Poland refused to cut the staff, and subsequently recalled their ambassadors to Belarus for consultations in the hope of reducing regional tensions.
""In Estonia's view, the Belarusian pressure on Lithuania and Poland is unfounded and unfortunate,"" Estonian Foreign Minister Urmas Reinsalu said in a statement.
""In protest against the steps taken by Belarus, we have decided to invite our ambassador from Belarus to Tallinn for consultations,"" he said.

Lukashenko's opponents accuse him of rigging the vote to prolong his 26-year-old rule, which he denies. The former Soviet republic has been rocked by weeks of protests that have drawn a violent crackdown, prompting the United States and European Union to impose sanctions on Minsk.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania has blocked 5.8 million euros ($6.83 million) in payments to Belarus for an EU-funded cross-border development programme, fearing the money could be misused, the Lithuanian government said on Wednesday.
The European Union has condemned police crackdowns on protesters in Belarus since a disputed Aug. 9 election, and last week imposed travel bans and asset freezes on dozens of Belarusian officials.
Neighbouring Lithuania has been one of the strongest backers of a strong EU stance against President Alexander Lukashenko's attempts to stifle opposition and is hosting his main opponent, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who fled there after the vote.
Lithuanian Interior Ministry spokeswoman Bozena Zaborovska told Reuters that payments for the cross-border assistance programme that Vilnius oversees were halted immediately after the post-election crackdowns began, out of fear that the money would be misused by Lukashenko's government.
""All payments were ceased until we receive clarification from the European Commission on the apparent risks,"" she said.
The funds have not been redirected for other purposes and remain shelved pending the clarification, she added.
The EU Observer newspaper reported on Tuesday that Belarus had purchased 15 surveillance drones using EU money, prompting alarm they could be used against pro-democracy demonstrators.
Lithuanian police chief Renatas Pozela told reporters funds for the drones were sent to Belarus in the first half of 2020.
The funding programme aims to develop regions on both sides of the border between Belarus and EU members Lithuania and Latvia. The EU is due to contribute 74 million euros, with the funds for Belarus channelled through neighbouring EU countries.
Under initial plans, the EU was due to spend a total of 18.4 million euros on the programme in 2020, 10.7 million euros in 2021, and 3.5 million in 2022-2024.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The Philippines pledged on Wednesday to cooperate with the United Nations on human rights issues after U.N. investigators documented tens of thousands of killings in the so-called war on drugs whose perpetrators were treated with ""near impunity"".
Under a resolution adopted by the Human Rights Council on Wednesday the U.N. will provide technical assistance to help the government of President Rodrigo Duterte ensure unlawful killings and other violations are properly investigated and prosecuted.
Philippines ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Evan Garcia said the government had ""identified projects for the joint programme in the areas of strengthening investigative and accountability mechanisms, the establishment of compliance monitoring systems for the national police and engagement with civil society"". 
The resolution cited similar areas in which the United Nations could provide technical assistance. 
But activists said it fell short of their appeals to establish an international investigative mechanism.
""The human rights situation in the Philippines warrants more than just 'technical assistance' from the U.N.. A full international investigation to effectively address the pervasive impunity in the country is urgently needed,"" said Rachel Chhoa-Howard, Philippines researcher at Amnesty International.  
A landmark United Nations report in June said tens of thousands of people in the Philippines may have been killed in the war on drugs since mid-2016 amid ""near impunity"" for police and incitement to violence by top officials. 
Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque has said what he called ""rehashed claims"" of impunity in the report were unfounded.
The text of the resolution presented on Wednesday by Iceland on behalf of countries including the Philippines keeps the issue on the agenda for two years.
""We are hopeful that this first step will lead to concrete results on the ground,"" Harald Aspelund, Iceland's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, told the Council.

The $18 billion expansion was declared unlawful on environmental grounds by a court in February, after a judge said that a failure to take into account the UK government's commitments on climate change was ""legally fatal"" to the plans.
But at a virtual Supreme Court hearing on Wednesday, Heathrow, the busiest airport in Europe prior to the pandemic, said it had always been the case that planning permission would depend on its compliance with carbon reduction obligations. 
""Heathrow will ensure the expansion project is compliant with the UK’s climate-change obligations, including under the Paris Climate Agreement, as part of our plans to reach net-zero carbon. We fully expect to be held to account by government through the planning process,"" a Heathrow spokesman said.
Since the ruling against the runway in February, the aviation sector has been hit by its worst ever downturn, meaning Heathrow now has plenty of spare capacity.
But the airport, owned by Spain's Ferrovial, the Qatar Investment Authority and China Investment Corp among others, continues to want to expand. 
""My instructions are very clear on this: Heathrow Airport Limited does still wish to construct the Northwest runway,"" said lawyer David Anderson at the hearing.
By 2030, when the runway could be completed, he said the pandemic would be a ""distant memory"". 

A judgment is expected in early 2021.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The sprawling Najha cemetery outside Damascus, resting place for thousands of dead from Syria's wars, is struggling to cope with a surge in victims from the country's latest conflict - the largely unacknowledged battle with COVID-19.
Official data put the national death toll from the pandemic at 20‮9‬, but throughout the summer burial notices were posted on city walls and social media almost daily as professional groups mourned lost doctors, academics, lawyers and politicians.
Najha cemetery, the designated site for COVID-19 victims in the Syrian capital, usually handles around 40 burials a day.
That number more than tripled during most of July and there was a spike in August, and the numbers remain well above average, said Abdul Rahim Badir, who issues burial certificates at Najha.
While there are no independent figures for the number of new coronavirus cases and deaths in Syria, Badir's account chimes with reports from some NGOs and aid workers who say the official data reflect a small fraction of the real toll.
Senior government health officials contacted by Reuters declined to comment on the discrepancies. The Syrian information ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment.
In 30 years of work, Badir said he had never seen such a surge in burials. Some ceremonies have been held at night to avoid bodies piling up.
""We are already digging a mass grave that could bury thousands,"" he said.
Syria's health system, shattered by a nine-year war and lacking equipment to detect the virus, combined with millions of people made vulnerable by impoverishment and displacement, makes it highly susceptible to the pandemic.
Yet it has reported only a fraction of the cases registered by its neighbours, some of them suffering a spike in infections.
The World Health Organization, which did not challenge government statistics in the early months of the pandemic, said recently that Syria's limited testing capabilities hid the scale of the crisis - particularly around the capital.
""A lot of cases are still going unreported, and the actual number of COVID-19 cases is much higher ... Damascus and rural Damascus are the hardest hit,"" WHO's Syria representative Akjemal Magtymova told Reuters, citing surveillance data, epidemiological analysis and health ministry reports.
A senior coordinator in a major Western NGO, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there had been a ""major and unprecedented spike in July and most of August"" to an average of 120 daily deaths, easing to around 60 last month.
BREAKING THE SILENCE
Members of the Syria Medical Association took the unusual step in August of going public about losses among their colleagues to COVID-19.
""This is a list of 61 of Syria's best doctors, who Syria lost in the last few days,"" it said in an Aug. 16 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. Since then there have been at least another 87 confirmed deaths of medical workers, a source in the association said. 
Other professions have also suffered. The head of the Syrian Lawyers Union, Al Firas Faris, warned colleagues in a letter on Aug. 9 about a ""large spread of the pandemic in state courts and the deaths of a large number of lawyers"".
At the peak of the crisis, medical shortages at Damascus hospitals meant some middle class homes became treatment centres, with private firms delivering oxygen. Hard-pressed health officials appeared on state media to encourage the trend.
Since then U.N. and NGO support has helped authorities stock up on equipment, easing pressure that prompted some hospitals to ask patients to get their own beds and oxygen canisters to secure a space, two medical sources and an NGO worker said.
But the congested public markets and streets of poorer areas offer the virus the chance to break out again. 

""Conditions are all there for it to spread quickly and this is what is happening. Damascus and rural Damascus are the hot spots,"" said Matt Hemsley, a Damascus-based Oxfam policy adviser.

PODGORICA (Reuters) - The senior cleric of Montenegro's Serbian Orthodox Church, who avoids mask-wearing and called a pilgrimage ""God's vaccine"", has tested positive for coronavirus, his office said on Wednesday.
Metropolitan Amfilohije Radovic, 82, who wields big political influence as well as heading the largest Christian denomination, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Tuesday but felt well after a night in hospital in the capital Podgorica.
""He is under constant doctors' care,"" added the statement from his Metropolitanate office.
From December until August this year, Amfilohije played a pivotal role in protests over a contested religious law in the tiny Balkan country of 620,000 people that is a member of the transatlantic NATO alliance and aspiring European Union member.
The dispute over the law, which allowed the state to seize some religious property, helped the opposition win Aug. 30 parliamentary elections and unseat the Democratic Party of Socialists of President Milo Djukanovic.
After the outbreak of COVID-19, Amfilohije appeared regularly in public without a face mask. 
During ceremonies in May to honour a 17th century bishop, St Vasilije Ostroski the Miracle Maker, he called the pilgrimage and the revered cleric ""God's vaccine.""
""It would be good if contemporary scientists invent the vaccine ... but before it is found ... there's a vaccine here which has acted through the centuries,"" he said then at the Ostrog Monastery on a cliff near Podgorica.
So far, Montenegro has reported 188 deaths and 12,584 infections from the coronavirus.

The Serbian Orthodox Church has about 12 million followers, mainly in Serbia, Bosnia, and Montenegro.

The victims, 31 men and boys and eight women whose ages ranged from 15 to 44, were discovered last October in a container at the back of a truck on an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London.
British-Romanian dual national Gheorghe Nica, 43, admitted an offence of conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration at London's Old Bailey court.
Nica is still charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, along with Eamonn Harrison, 23, from Northern Ireland. Two other men are also accused of immigration offences and the trial of all four men is due to begin at the court later on Wednesday.
Two other men have already pleaded guilty to manslaughter over the deaths. In August, a 41-year-old Irish haulier, Ronan Hughes, admitted the offence while Maurice Robinson, 26, from Northern Ireland, who was driving the truck when the bodies were found, pleaded guilty in April.
Two other men have also entered guilty pleas to immigration offences following the police investigation.
Autopsies concluded that the provisional cause of death of the 39 victims was a combination of hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, and hyperthermia, or overheating, in an enclosed space.

922,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","Myanmar releases voter app criticised for Rohingya label, despite EU objection","(Reuters) - Myanmar’s election commission has released a smartphone app criticised over its use of a derogatory label for Rohingya Muslims despite entreaties by its European Union funders to remove controversial data.
The mVoter2020 app, aimed at improving voter awareness, labels at least two candidates from the Rohingya ethnic group as “Bengali”, a term that implies they are immigrants from Bangladesh and is rejected by many Rohingya. 
After campaign group Justice for Myanmar said last week the app risked inflaming nationalism, a website shared by the election commission directing people to download it went offline and a mobile version was not available.
But the mobile app has been available to download since Saturday with candidates' race and religion data listed, and that of their parents, and a web version is also accessible.
Pierre Michel, public diplomacy adviser to the EU’s Myanmar mission, said the EU had “strongly advocated for the removal of all controversial data that could lead to discrimination and exclusion”, declining to comment further.
The Union Election Commission (UEC) did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
The app was developed by the election commission, with support from STEP Democracy, an EU-funded project implemented in Myanmar by the Sweden-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), and the U.S.-based Asia Foundation.
Donors have sought to distance themselves from the app, saying the UEC is solely responsible for its content and removing social media posts detailing their involvement.
A Rohingya candidate listed as “Bengali” on the app was disqualified from running on Friday after the UEC said it had found his parents were not citizens, though it was not clear if the decision was connected to the app.
Marcus Brand, the country director of International IDEA, said the organisation regretted “that any candidates have been targeted, harassed or attacked over their ethnicity or religious affiliation” but said the declaration of ethnicity and religion was an integral part of Myanmar's electoral process.
He said he had been informed the candidate disqualification was “not related to the app or the current controversy”.
The Asia Foundation did not respond to requests for comment.

926,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 06:07AM ET</span>",Kuwait's new crown prince is a security czar who shunned limelight,"By Ahmed Hagagy
KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's crown prince in waiting, Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Sabah, is a forceful figure who steered clear of political battles and public roles and spent much of his career helping build the Gulf Arab state's security and defence apparatus.
Close to the late emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad and new ruler Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad, Kuwait experts say, he is expected to help guide state affairs in the U.S.-allied OPEC member state.
""The emir will listen to his views, he will have an impact in that way,"" said Kuwaiti political scientist and former U.N. envoy Ghanim Alnajjar. ""His focus will be security, the judiciary and other domestic issues.""
Sheikh Meshal, 80, has been deputy chief of the National Guard since 2004 and was head of State Security for 13 years after joining the interior ministry in the 1960s. He had been offered several senior positions in the past but declined them, the experts say.
Sheikh Meshal, who attended Britain's Hendon Police College, was credited with helping to reform Kuwait's National Guard, and Kuwaiti journalist Faisal al-Qanae once described him as the ""biggest enemy"" of cronyism and lawbreaking.
Sheikh Meshal's appointment, which must be approved by parliament, temporarily halts jostling among senior members of the ruling Al Sabah dynasty for a position that had traditionally managed the government's often tense relationship with the assembly, for which elections are to be held this year.
The roles of heir apparent and prime minister were split in 2003 due to the health of the then-crown prince. The premier has since dealt with frequent gridlock between the hand-picked cabinet and the assembly, which has hindered investment and economic reforms.
Observers say that while both Sheikh Nawaf and Sheikh Meshal kept a low public profile, the latter has stronger views. 
REFORMS
Sheikh Nawaf, who is seen upholding Kuwait's current oil, investment and foreign policies, takes the helm as the country faces a liquidity crisis caused by low oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, which the National Guard has played a visible role in combating. 
Diplomats and analysts say the immediate focus will be on domestic issues with perceived corruption, living standards and the economy the top priorities for most Kuwaitis in a country with a cradle-to-grave welfare system and where expatriates constitute a big part of the workforce.
 Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) has estimated that Kuwait's nearly $140 billion economy could shrink by 7.8% this year in what would be one of the worst economic crunches among Gulf oil exporters.
Key will be cooperation between cabinet and the outspoken assembly, the Gulf region's oldest legislature that wields power to block bills and question ministers. Clashes have led to successive government reshuffles or dissolution of parliament. 
The body was often in the past dominated by opposition groups until Sheikh Sabah in 2012 broke their hold by using executive powers to amend the voting system, sparking some of the largest protests in the country's history.
Kuwaiti opposition figures have proposed electoral reforms and a pardon for dissidents in recent meetings with Sheikh Nawaf before he assumed power.
""Reformers and independents are looking for reconciliation (with the government), enhancing freedom of speech, economic and political reforms, combating corruption, demographics,"" Alnajjar said. 

""It will be difficult to amend the electoral law with elections coming up ... but anything is possible.""

The EU, like the United States, wants new presidential elections to reverse Venezuela's spiral into authoritarian rule and economic collapse, seeing the parliamentary vote as a way for Maduro to seize control of the opposition-held assembly. 
""As the elections are not going to be postponed, the European Union can not even consider sending an election observer mission,"" the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell told the European Parliament. 
Maduro invited the EU as an election observer in late September for the Dec. 6 vote, in which voters will elect delegates in the National Assembly. That is too to organise an EU mission, which would typically involve sending a team months ahead of time to assess free and fair campaigning, as well as other conditions.
Members of Venezuela's opposition have also called for a delay so that international observers can attend, fearing that the result could otherwise be rigged in Maduro's favour.
The current assembly head, Juan Guaido, is recognised by the EU as Venezuela's legitimate head-of-state, though Maduro retains control of the government and military.
Maduro has said he is bound by Venezuela's constitution to hold the vote on Dec. 6.

""This only serves to worsen the political situation in Venezuela,"" Borrell told EU lawmakers during a debate on the crisis in the South American nation.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Wednesday proposed allowing abortion up until the fourteenth week of pregnancy as part of a new law designed to comply with a landmark ruling by the constitutional court that struck down a decades-long ban.
South Korea criminalised abortion in 1953 when its leaders wanted to boost the population, but exceptions to the law were introduced in 1973, including when the pregnancy was caused by a sexual crime.
However, the Constitutional Court overturned the ban in April last year, saying it unconstitutionally curbed women's rights and ordering the government to come up with a new law.
Under the new proposal, abortion would be banned after 14 weeks except in the case of a sex crime, or if the health of the mother is at risk, or if the fetus shows signs of severe birth defects, in which case abortion would be allowed up to 24 weeks, the Justice Ministry said in a statement. 
It also allowed the use of the drug mifepristone for performing abortions.
The proposal drew criticism from both sides of the debate, with women's rights groups arguing that the law is still focused on punishing women.
Instead, any law should focus on how to safely provide the procedure, the Joint Action for Reproductive Justice in Seoul said in a statement.

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Korea issued a statement opposing the justice ministry decision, saying that children should be protected ""from the very moment of conception.""
Ahead of the court's ruling, opinion polls showed around three-quarters of South Koreans supported dropping the ban.
South Korea has a fertility rate of 1.1 births per woman, the lowest of 198 countries and falling far behind the global average of 2.4, according to the 2020 United Nations Population Fund report.

Speaking to Putin by video link, Valery Gerasimov, chief of the army's general staff, said the test strike on Tuesday was carried out from the Admiral Gorshkov vessel which was located in the White Sea in northern Russia.
Putin, who has pledged to beef up Russia's military presence in the Arctic, talked up hypersonic missiles and a new generation of Russian weapons in a March 2018 speech. He praised the test launch on Wednesday. 
""This is a big event not only for the life of the armed forces, but also for all of Russia, for the whole country,"" Putin told Gerasimov. 
The Tsirkon test comes amid tensions over arms control between Russia and the United States. New START, the last major nuclear arms pact in place between the two countries, is due to expire in February. 
Gerasimov said the missile hit its target at a distance of 450 kilometres (280 miles) in four and a half minutes after reaching hypersonic speeds of more than Mach 8. 
He added that tests would continue and that Russian surface vessels and submarines would be armed with the missile when those tests are completed. 

Russia reportedly test-launched the missile successfully from a military vessel for the first time in January.

BISHKEK (Reuters) - The Central Asian nation of Kyrgyzstan slid deeper into chaos as rival opposition factions made grabs for power on Wednesday, a day after they stormed government buildings, forcing the prime minister to quit and a parliamentary election to be annulled.
Left isolated by the resignation of Prime Minister Kubatbek Boronov's government late on Tuesday, President Sooronbai Jeenbekov called for all party talks in a statement on Wednesday, reiterating his willingness to mediate.
Two presidents have been overthrown in Kyrgyzstan in the past 15 years, and longtime ally Russia expressed concern as protests spread across the country in the wake of Sunday's vote.
Kyrgyzstan borders China and hosts both a Russian military airbase and a large Canadian-owned gold mining operation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday Moscow was in touch with all the sides in the conflict and hoped that democratic process would be restored soon. China's foreign ministry said it was highly concerned about the situation.
A total of 16 parties took part in Sunday's election and 11 refused to accept the results, which had handed victory two establishment groups. As protests grew, the election commission annulled the vote.
At least three distinct groups have now attempted to claim leadership. The first was the Coordination Council set up on Tuesday and largely made up of established political parties opposing Jeenbekov.
Another group which called itself People's Coordination Council emerged on Wednesday and united five lesser-known opposition parties whose leaders have not held any senior government positions.
Finally, the Ata Zhurt political party has attempted to outmanoeuvre competitors by getting parliament to nominate its candidate Sadyr Zhaparov - freed from prison by protesters just hours earlier - for prime minister on Tuesday night.
However, an angry mob then broke into the hotel where parliament convened, forcing Zhaparov to flee through a back door, according to Kyrgyz media. It was not clear when parliament might convene again to confirm him as premier.
Making a late night appearance on television, Zhaparov said he would propose a constitutional reform before holding presidential and parliamentary elections in two to three months.
While opposition parties have made rival claims to power, the establishment parties that claimed initial victory in the election have largely kept quiet, accepting the decision to annul the vote. Jeenbekov has told his supporters not to confront the protesters to avoid escalation.
But the split among opposition parties and power grabs by competing factions have plunged the nation of 6.5 million people into uncertainty. Kyrgyz security forces appeared to avoid siding with any of the factions although their support could eventually help decide the winner.
Residents in the capital, Bishkek, quickly formed vigilante neighbourhood watch units to reinforce police, having suffered during violent revolts followed by looting in 2005 and 2010.

There were scuffles overnight between vigilantes and protesters who tried to force their way into government buildings or attacked businesses such as shops and restaurants, according to a report by local news website 24.kg.

The shooting in August 2019 of Tornike K., a Georgian who had fought against Russia in Chechnya, led to the expulsion of Russian embassy employees in December.
Prosecutors say 55-year-old Vadim K. approached the victim from behind on a bicycle in the Tiergarten park in central Berlin in broad daylight and shot him with a pistol equipped with a silencer. 
The suspect then shot the victim twice in the head while he lay on the ground, they say. 
Vadim K., also known as Vadim S., was arrested nearby soon after the attack and has been in custody ever since. He is charged with murder and the illegal possession of a weapon. If found guilty, he faces life in prison.
""The defendant is alleged to have carried out a state mission, either for payment or because he shared the motives of his clients,"" the Berlin court said in a statement.
Russia has denied any involvement in the killing.
The trial begins as Chancellor Angela Merkel's government discusses with partners what action to take after the global chemicals watchdog confirmed Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family.

Navalny was air-lifted to Berlin for treatment after collapsing on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20. Germany and other Western governments have called on Russia to help with the investigation. Moscow denies it was involved in the poisoning.

Holding banners - some of which read ""Crack down on the Nazis"" - a sea of people surrounded the building in Athens, where a three-bench court was due to start reading out its verdict around 0800 GMT, the culmination of a trial which started in 2015.
Golden Dawn leader Nikos Mihaloliakos and more than a dozen party members were arrested on charges of founding and participating in a criminal group following the killing of an anti-fascism rapper in 2013 by a party supporter.
The party denied the allegations and says the defendants are victims of a political witch-hunt. 
The killing sparked nationwide protests and prompted a government-led crackdown on the fiercely anti-immigrant party, which entered parliament for the first time in 2012 by tapping into voter anger at Greece’s economic crisis.
Its anti-austerity and anti-immigrant agenda made it Greece's third-most popular party at the peak of the country's worst financial crisis since World War II. It lost its parliamentary seats in an election last year.
The killing seven years ago of 34-year old Pavlos Fyssas by a party supporter prompted a crackdown against the party that led prosecutors to arrest and investigate Golden Dawn leaders and lawmakers over a series of crimes. 

""They are not innocent, they must go to jail, they must be convicted,"" said a 69-year old demonstrator outside the court who gave her name as Sophia. ""We must send a message to the younger generations, a message against fascism,"" she said.

""The goal is to limit settler attacks on our villages, our children, our little ones, that live close to settlements,"" Ali Faraj, one of the project's founders, said.
Cameras mounted in 10 locations will be linked to a mobile application that will warn residents of a breach and record alleged incidents that often go undocumented, Ahmed Essa, another of the project's founders, said. 
Faraj said Kisan and surrounding villages have seen more than 450 incidents involving settlers, including attacks on people and damage to homes.
The United Nations has documented some such incidents, as well as acts of Palestinian violence against Israelis in the West Bank, where nearly 430,000 settlers live among some 3 million Palestinians on land Israel captured in a 1967 war.
The camera project is being funded through an initiative called 3al Ard -- on the ground, in Arabic -- founded by Palestinian-American businessman Bashar Masri. 
Masri initially funded half a dozen projects in remote areas ""to encourage people to take matters into their own hands vis-a-vis stopping the mad expansion of the settlements"", he said. 
While the Palestinian Authority (PA) has limited autonomy in some areas, many villages, like Kisan, lie in areas under complete Israeli military control, leaving them with little avenue for redress after alleged incidents involving settlers.
""The (PA) cannot enter here ... it is the duty of local residents to fill the gap,"" Faraj said.

LONDON (Reuters) - The Church of England's spiritual leader said on Wednesday it was disgraceful that the institution had for decades failed to protect children from sexual predators within its ranks and shown lack of care for victims.
From the 1940s to 2018, 390 clergy and people in positions of trust with the Church were convicted of sexual offences against children, an inquiry found this week.
""It's shameful and disgraceful and reveals exactly what they said - a culture in which there was cover-up and hiding,"" Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby told the BBC in his first public reaction since the report was published.
The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse found the Church allowed abusers to hide so as to defend its reputation rather than help young people.
""It didn't come as a surprise,"" Welby said, adding that the Church had begun ""a journey of change"". 
""We have not gone quick enough or far enough yet.""
The Catholic Church has been similarly excoriated for belated action over decades of scandals around the world, though it has paid billions in damages and Pope Francis has urged an ""all-out battle"" against clerical child abuse. 
'LACK OF CARE'
Welby, who became archbishop in 2013, said he had known abuse was happening because of the case of a former bishop of Gloucester, who in 2015 pleaded guilty to indecent assault.
Peter Ball (NYSE:BLL) had suggested to victims that humiliation - including praying naked, masturbation and flagellation - was a teaching of St Francis and would bring closeness to God. 
One of Ball's victims took his own life years later.
""I was shocked by the level, when I came into this job, by the extent to which it was happening,"" said Welby, 64.
""We have been poor at dealing with redress and dealing with the victims and the survivors ... The whole lack of care in this is shocking.""
Welby said the Church had now overhauled internal systems to deal faster and better with allegations and helping victims. 
The archbishop is the spiritual leader of the Anglican Communion - a global network with 85 million believers. Queen Elizabeth is the supreme governor of the Church of England, a title dating back to Henry VIII's split with the Pope. 
One abuse victim has said Welby should resign. 
""I can understand his anger,"" the archbishop said. 

""I know that since I came into this job, I have worked as hard as I could to move the Church to a different place.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament has voted in favour of a legally binding target for the European Union to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2030, against 1990 levels, according to vote results released on Wednesday.
The goal is more ambitious than the net emissions cut of ""at least 55%"" by 2030 proposed by the European Commission, which wants to finalise the target by the end of the year. 
To do that, Parliament will need to agree the target with EU member countries, who are split over how ambitious it should be.
The EU's current 2030 goal is a 40% emissions cut.
The legislative assembly approved the 60% target with a 26-vote majority. It will rubber-stamp its position with another vote on Wednesday. 
Jytte Guteland, lead lawmaker on the issue, said Parliament had taken ""a big step closer"" to fulfilling the goals of the Paris climate accord.
Experts say a 55% cut by 2030 is the minimum effort needed to steer the EU towards becoming climate neutral by 2050, putting EU emissions firmly on a pathway that, if adopted globally, would cap global warming at safe levels.
A 60% target is unlikely to secure support from EU countries. But Parliament backing a more ambitious aim could make it harder for countries to water down the target in the ensuing negotiations.
""We have decided on really ambitious instruments, and we will not easily give that away,"" said Green lawmaker Michael Bloss.
Roughly half of the EU's 27 member countries have said they support an emissions cut of ""at least 55%"" by 2030. 
Even this target will have huge implications for all sectors, with higher carbon costs for many businesses and a sharp drop in coal use. The Czech Republic has said it opposes the 55% goal, while coal-heavy Poland wants to see more detailed economic analysis before approving any new target.

That resistance could matter, since heads of government are expected to decide the member states' negotiating position at a summit in either October or December, in a process which requires unanimous support from the 27 countries.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean lawmakers and officials raised concerns on Wednesday about the safety of the teenage daughter of a former senior North Korean diplomat in Italy after news reports that he has settled in South Korea while she was sent back to the North. 
Jo Song Gil, who was North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in November 2018. 
His whereabouts had been unknown since, but a member of South Korea's parliamentary intelligence committee on Tuesday confirmed news reports that Jo arrived in South Korea in July 2019 under the protection of the government.
The reports triggered concerns among some lawmakers about Jo's daughter, who according to Italy's foreign ministry, was repatriated to the North at her request after her parents went missing. She is a teenager, but no other details about her were immediately known.
Thae Yong-ho, Pyongyang's former deputy ambassador to Britain who defected to South Korea in 2016, had publicly asked Jo to come to the South but urged restraint in media coverage of him. 
""Where a defected diplomat lives determines the levels of treatment or punishment to be given to his relatives left in the North,"" said Thae, who is now a lawmaker. 
""If he takes asylum in South Korea, he is defined as a traitor, apostate. ... And no one knows what penalties would be imposed on the family members of a traitor."" 
Cho Tae-yong, another opposition lawmaker and former deputy national security advisor, accused the government of leaking the information even though Jo had not wanted his defection to be publicly known because of his daughter. 
""It was impossible to know without help from intelligence authorities and the government effectively confirmed it, which was an act that completely lacked humanitarian considerations regarding his daughter,"" Cho told a parliamentary session. 
The National Intelligence Service declined comment. 
Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said at the session she was ""surprised"" to see the news and shared the lawmakers' concerns about the safety of Jo's daughter.

Pompeo on Tuesday visited Japan and called for deeper cooperation with Australia, India and Japan to counter China's growing regional influence.
""Pompeo has repeatedly fabricated lies about China and maliciously created political confrontation,"" the Chinese embassy in Japan said in a statement.
""We once again urge the U.S. to abandon its Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice, stop unprovoked accusations and attacks against China and treat relations with China in a constructive manner,"" the embassy said. 
Pompeo's East Asia visit, his first in more than a year, coincides with worsening tensions with China. 
The United States and China, the world's top two economies, are at loggerheads over a wide range of issues from Beijing's handling of the coronavirus to its imposition of a new security law in Hong Kong and ambitions in the South China Sea. 

Pompeo's call for the Quad nations of the United States, Japan, India and Australia to form a united front against China's growing influence is a sensitive subject for its regional allies, which are reliant on China for trade.

Pham Doan Trang, a writer who has published widely on human rights and alleged police brutality, was arrested in Ho Chi Minh City, according to Human Rights Watch, charged with ""making, storing, disseminating or propagandising information, materials and products that aim to oppose the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam"".
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party tolerates little criticism and has stepped up its crackdown on activists ahead of a key party congress in January next year.
Trang's arrest just before midnight on Tuesday came hours after an annual U.S.-Vietnam human rights dialogue concluded.
The U.S. Embassy in Hanoi could not provide immediate comment on her detention. The arrest was not reported in Vietnam's state media.
Trang was in 2014 among several activists apprehended by the authorities on their way to a meeting with former U.S. President Barack Obama during his landmark visit to Vietnam.
HRW and Amnesty International condemned Tuesday's arrest and demanded her immediate release. 
A source with direct knowledge said she had been anticipating issues with the authorities just days before she was detained.
Trang had also shared a letter titled ""just in case I am imprisoned"" dated May 2019, that outlined democratic goals she strived to achieve. She also asked that she be allowed to have her guitar in jail. 
""I had a long chat with her on Sunday and she seemed very nervous,"" the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the case, told Reuters. 
""When she arrived for our meeting she came carrying her large guitar on her back, explaining she felt they wouldn't detain her if she was carrying that"".

""What we are facing is an Azeri-Turkish international terroristic attack,"" Pashinyan told Sky News. ""To me there is no doubt that this is a policy of continuing the Armenian genocide and a policy of reinstating the Turkish empire.""
The Armenian genocide refers to the killing of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923.

Turkey accepts that many Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire were killed in clashes with Ottoman forces during World War One, but contests the figures and denies that the killings were systematically orchestrated and constitute a genocide.

942,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 07, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","In Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Erdogan eyes Turkey's ""place in world order""","By Orhan Coskun and Jonathan Spicer
ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan's strong backing for Azerbaijan in the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh has set Turkey apart from other big nations and alarmed NATO allies that are demanding a ceasefire.
But for Erdogan, the resolute stance is a strategic priority and a costly necessity that reinforces his strategy of flexing military muscle abroad to retain support at home.
The president has described Ankara's support for Azerbaijan as part of Turkey's quest for its ""deserved place in the world order.""
He sees an opportunity to alter the status quo over Nagorno-Karabakh - in which France, the United States and Russia have for decades led international mediation efforts and ethnic Armenians have retained control of the enclave even though it is internationally recognised as part of Azerbaijan. 
""Turkey's logic in almost all corners of the map is disruption. Anything that undermines the status quo is good for it, because the previous status quo was seen to counter its interests,"" said Galip Dalay, fellow at Robert Bosch Academy. 
""In Nagorno-Karabakh there was a frozen conflict in which it remained in Armenia's hands. Turkey wants to undermine this game even if it cannot fully determine it"" given Russia's traditional influence in the region, he said.
Turkey's stance - sending an implicit threat to Armenia and a message of caution to Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia - reflects its confidence in drone warfare used in Syria, Libya and Iraq, political analysts said.
Turkish-made drones are now spearheading Azeri attacks and one senior official in Ankara told Reuters that Turks were providing infrastructure and support for the weapons, though there are no troops in the field. 
Erdogan is also betting that, despite their differences over Nagorno-Karabakh, Turkey and Russia get on well enough to prevent a wider conflict in the region.
YEARS OF ""NEGLECT"" 
Russia, the United States and France have led calls for a ceasefire over Nagorno-Karabakh but Erdogan says they have neglected the crisis over the past three decades and should not lead peacemaking. Turkey says a lasting peace will depend on proposals being made for what happens after hostilities end.
Erdogan's stance had worsened a war of words with France, whose population includes many of Armenian origin, but it is accepted by Turkey's main opposition parties.
Military successes and the flexing of military muscle in other parts of the world have helped his ruling AK Party, allied with nationalists, retain an edge in opinion polls despite a currency depreciation that has worsened economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. 
Erdogan's job approval rose nearly 5% last month, according to MetroPoll research group, after a standoff with the European Union over Mediterranean territorial rights. 
""All of these conflicts out there boost the perception that Turkey is a country under siege, rightly or wrongly,"" said Sinan Ulgen, chairman of the Istanbul-based EDAM think tank. 
But he said that ""ultimately it's the economy that determines the political contest.""
OBLIGATION AND PRIORITY
Two economic contractions in as many years have halted the boom years under Erdogan, and Moody's (NYSE:MCO) ratings agency says Turkey risks a balance-of-payments crisis after a nearly 25% drop in the lira this year. 
Ankara's reliance on gas imports from Azerbaijan, which jumped 23% in the first half of 2020, are also an incentive to take a firm position on Nagorno-Karabakh.
Defence spending jumped 16% this year to $7 billion, or 5% of the overall budget, and the military budget has soared nearly 90% in a decade. 
But cross-border campaigns such as those waged by Turkey in northern Syria, Iraq and Libya are a priority for Erdogan, a second Turkish official said. 
""Neither the pandemic nor the deterioration of the budget will be an obstacle to defence spending,"" the official said. ""It's not preferable but it's obligatory. Turkey is in the field with the United States and Russia. We cannot think or act small.""
A diminished U.S. presence in the region has left gaps that Turkey and Russia have sought to fill, using diplomacy to help contain conflicts in Syria's Idlib province and in Libya, two protracted proxy wars in which they are on opposing sides.
Ankara has denied allegations - including by Russia - that it has sent Syrian mercenaries to support Azerbaijan.

Close cooperation with Moscow in many areas means ""there is no concern over being dragged into a conflict with Russia,"" the second official said.

CANCUN, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexicans formed long lines at supermarkets near Cancun on Tuesday to stock up in preparation for a hit overnight from powerful Hurricane Delta, which weakened slightly as it bore down on the Caribbean resort and its famous shoreline.
Late on Tuesday, the Category 4 hurricane on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale was packing maximum sustained winds of 130 miles per hour (209 kph), down from 145 mph earlier in the evening, the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said.
""In the Yucatan Peninsula, potentially catastrophic hurricane conditions are expected in portions of the warning area late tonight and early Wednesday,"" the NHC said.
Late on Tuesday, Delta was about 135 miles (217 km) east-southeast of the island of Cozumel off the coast.
Expectations of tropical storm conditions led to evacuations of coastal areas in Cuba. Delta is forecast to weaken and linger over Mexico's Yucatan peninsula before strengthening again in the Gulf of Mexico, where oil companies were bracing for impact on their installations and ports closed.
Officials ordered evacuations of Cancun's hotel zone and other coastal areas, and opened the city's convention center as a shelter. Workers at the Avis car rental firm boarded up windows with wood under a light rain on Tuesday afternoon.
The governor of Quintana Roo state urged residents near the shore to evacuate, while recommending health precautions in shelters due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""We have to prevent COVID in these sites, we have to take all preventative measures to this effect,"" Governor Carlos Joaquin said, noting that the hurricane could take 12 hours to pass through the state after touching down by 2 a.m.
Joaquin recommended households stock up on food and water for two or three days, anticipating delays in restoring water and electricity.
A hurricane watch was in place for an area stretching from the beach town of Tulum, west past Cancun, and including Cozumel, an island made famous by Jacques Cousteau for the quality of its reef scuba diving.
PANIC BUYING
Since Monday, local residents have formed long lines at supermarkets and construction stores to load up on food and supplies to protect their homes, television images showed.
Panic buying left some shelves empty of basic pantry goods, said Marian Castro, who lives in Cancun's hotel zone and recalls the destruction wrought by Category 5 Hurricane Wilma in 2005. 
""I'm not scared, because after Hurricane Wilma ... destroyed my house, this time we're more prepared,"" she said, pointing out her anti-cyclone windows.
Water levels could rise by as much as 9 feet (3 m) over normal tide levels near Delta's landfall, accompanied by dangerous waves in the hurricane warning area.
The Yucatan peninsula was hit on the weekend by Hurricane Gamma, a smaller storm that nonetheless damaged property and forced restaurants and attractions to close, including the famed Chichen Itza pyramids.
The region at the heart of Mexico's tourist industry has suffered various setbacks in recent years, most recently from the coronavirus pandemic.
Before that, the coast known as the Riviera Maya was affected by swaths of Sargasso seaweed on its pristine beaches.

Cuba's western province of Pinar del Rio and the Island of Youth also hunkered down ahead of tropical storm conditions, with schools closed and coastal areas evacuated.

China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up its military activity near the island, responding to what China calls ""collusion"" between Taiwan and the United States.
China has been angered at increased U.S. support for Taiwan, including visits by senior U.S. government officials and ramped up arms sales.
In the past few weeks, Chinese fighter jets have crossed the mid line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an unofficial buffer zone, and flown multiple missions into Taiwan's southwestern air defence identification zone.
Speaking at parliament, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen De-fa said to the air force had scrambled 2,972 times against Chinese aircraft this year at a cost of T$25.5 billion ($886.49 million).
""Recently the pressure has been great. To say otherwise would be deceiving people,"" Yen said, without giving a comparison figure for last year.
He clarified that a figure of 4,132 air force missions this year, as provided in a ministry parliamentary briefing paper, included training and regular patrol missions. 
Yen said that the armed forces would this month carry out their own drills off Taiwan's southwest coast, though they would not be live fire.
Taiwan's armed forces are well-trained and well-equipped but are dwarfed by those of China's, and Taiwan's Defence Ministry has previously acknowledged the strain the repeated Chinese drills were placing on them.
Taiwan is in the process of revamping its fighter fleet.

The United States last year approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would bring the island's total number of the aircraft to more than 200, the largest F-16 fleet in Asia.

President Tsai Ing-wen attended Lee's state funeral held at a military cemetery in the mountains outside of capital Taipei. Lee, who died in July aged 97, was president from 1988 to 2000. 
A memorial service for Lee was held last month in the shadow of renewed Chinese war games, as did his election as Taiwan's first democratic leader in 1996.
Lee's greatest act of defiance was becoming Taiwan's first democratically elected president in March 1996, achieved in a landslide following eight months of intimidating war games and missile tests by China in waters around the island.
Those events brought China and Taiwan to the verge of conflict, prompting the United States to send an aircraft carrier task force to the area in a warning to the Beijing government.

Lee, a devout Christian, had said at a 2012 election rally that he hoped for Taiwan to be ""a country of democracy, freedom, human rights and dignity, where one does not have to be ruled by others and where everyone can say out loud 'I'm Taiwanese'.""

Germany said on Tuesday it was discussing with its partners what action to take after the global chemicals watchdog confirmed Navalny had been poisoned with a new and undeclared variant in the Novichok family.
Several Western governments have said Russia, which has denied accusations by Navalny that it was involved in the poisoning, must help in investigations or face consequences.
""Sanctions against the whole country don't work. The most important thing is to impose entry bans on profiteers of the regime and freeze their assets,"" Navalny told top-selling German daily Bild. 
""They embezzle money, steal billions and at the weekend they fly to Berlin or London, buy expensive apartments and sit in cafes,"" he said.
He singled out Valery Gergiev, chief conductor of the Munich Philharmonic as a target for sanctions, saying he was a supporter of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Options for action include targeted asset freezes or travel bans on Russians deemed to be involved in the Navalny case, economic sanctions and halting the Nord Stream 2 pipeline that is being built to carry gas directly from Russia to Germany.
Navalny was airlifted to Berlin for treatment after taking ill on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20 and has since been discharged. He has said he wants to return to Russia.
He was scathing about what he said was Russia's failure to help in the investigation.
""There is not even an attempt to make it look like they are investigating,"" Navalny told Bild, reiterating his view that his poisoning was a direct order from Putin.

Navalny also criticised former German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, a friend of Putin and lobbyist for Russian energy firms, calling him ""an errand boy for Putin who protects murderers"".

For the first time since the second coronavirus outbreak caused more than 800 deaths in the state - more than 90% of the country's 897 virus-related deaths - the two-week average has fallen below 10. 
The metric is key as officials in the second-most-populous state are reluctant to ease mobility restrictions until the rolling average in the two-week window falls below five.
""The strategy is working,"" premier Daniel Andrews told reporters at his daily briefing. ""Its success is pinned ultimately to whether symptomatic people come forward and get tested.""
Australia has so far reported more than 27,000 COVID-19 cases, with Victoria accounting for about 75% of infections. In the previous 24 hours, the state had found six new cases and reported two more deaths, Andrews said.
In the neighboring New South Wales (NSW) state, the most populous, officials found three new locally transmitted infections overnight, putting an end to a 11-day run of zero such cases.
""It is a concern when you have a handful of community transmission, but ... we're always going to have cases pop up because we're in a pandemic, but we're also in an economy which is open where people are undertaking their business,"" NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.
Although the number of deaths and infections in Australia from COVID-19 has been low compared with many other countries, the outbreak has driven the country to its deepest economic slump on record. 
On Tuesday, Australia's conservative government unveiled billions in fiscal stimulus as part of plans to boost jobs and help its economy out of its historic recession.

Its budget assumes the country will be able to contain COVID-19 outbreaks by the end of the year, the majority of its inter-state borders will be reopened, and a vaccine will be developed in 2021.

""The Hawks would like to categorically distance itself from the IOL (media) report regarding the so called impending arrest against Mr Ace Magashule,"" Hawks spokesman Hangwani Mulaudzi said in a statement on WhatsApp shortly before midnight Tuesday. 
The Hawks ""view the report as a malicious intent to undermine the integrity of the organization"".
The Independent Media, citing sources, reported that Magashule will be arrested and charged over an alleged role in the controversial Estina dairy project in the town of Vrede in the Free-State.
The online newspaper also said Magashule confirmed to it over the phone that he was aware of the imminent arrest and that he will address media ""at an appropriate time"".
The Estina dairy received public money and was meant to benefit the local community, but prosecutors say funds were illegally diverted to bank accounts of people including Atul Gupta, a wealthy businessman and friend of former President Jacob Zuma.
Magashule, who along with Gupta have denied any wrongdoing, was the premier of the Free State at the time.
His arrest would have important political repercussions, as it could lead to Magashule losing his job as ANC secretary general, a post that puts him in charge of the day-to-day running of the ruling party.
An ANC media relations officer diverted questions to the National Prosecuting Authority, whose spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 

The reports come after a number of high-profile arrests that have been made recently in connection to alleged corruption.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. defence official said on Tuesday Taiwan's plan to boost defense spending by $1.4 billion was a step in the right direction, but insufficient to ensure resilient defense in the face of an increasing Chinese threat.
In August, the Taiwanese cabinet proposed T$453.4 billion ($15.24 billion) in military spending for coming year, versus T$411.3 billion ($13.99 billion) budgeted for this year, a rise of more than 10 percent.
The move comes as China has significantly stepped up military activity near Taiwan, which it regards as a breakaway province, raising fears it might one day attempt to retake the island by force.
David Helvey, the acting U.S. assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, told an online defense industry conference hosted by the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council that actions of China's People's Liberation Army were a test for Taiwan's ""ability and preparedness to respond to coercion.""
""While the PLA’s actions are real and dangerous, the PLA is not unbeatable,"" he said. ""Taiwan can, through smart investments, send a clear signal to Beijing that Taiwan’s society and its armed forces are absolutely committed to the defense of Taiwan.""
Referring to the proposed defense budget, he added:
""These increases, while a step in the right direction, however, are insufficient to ensure that Taiwan can leverage its geography, advanced technology, workforce and patriotic population to channel Taiwan’s inherent advantages necessary for a resilient defense.""
Helvey said Taiwan must continue to seek a balance in defense investment between indigenous development and foreign purchases, while avoiding over-investment in areas that did not provide a good return for limited resources.
He said United States encouraged Taiwan to invest in ""large numbers of small capabilities"" that would signal that ""an invasion or attack would not come without significant cost.""
These include acquiring as many coastal defense cruise missiles as possible and other capabilities to help defend coastal areas and beaches, including short-range air defense, naval mines, fast-attack craft, mobile artillery and advanced surveillance assets. 
Helvey also said Taiwan needed to strengthen its reserve forces, and their training ""should demonstrate to the people ... how small, but manageable actions can support Taiwan’s defense.""
As fears have grown about China's intentions, so have concerns in military circles in the United States and elsewhere about Taiwan's military preparedness, as well as the willingness of its people to stand up to any Chinese attack.
The United States is required by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself but has maintained a policy of ""strategic ambiguity"" when it comes to the question of whether it would intervene militarily in the event of a Chinese attack.
Last month, sources told Reuters the United States plans to sell as many as seven major weapons systems, including mines, cruise missiles and drones to Taiwan.

Ardern, who is also the leader of the Labour Party, said her government would introduce laws to prevent installation of new boilers and replace existing ones with electric alternatives to reduce emissions.
The government will also create a NZ$50 million ($32.9 million) fund to help local councils buy zero emissions buses by 2025.
""Over the last three years we have put in place the foundations to reach our 2050 climate obligations,"" the prime minister said. ""But there is more to do.""
She said the latest initiatives to address climate change concerns are build on plans put in place during her first term.
""During our first term in government, climate change was at the centre of all our policy work and commitments. It is inextricably linked to our decisions on issues like housing, agriculture, waste, energy and transport,"" Ardern said. 
Climate change is a key issue in the New Zealand election, which according to a string of opinion polls, Ardern's Labour Party was largely expected to win.
Proud of being one of the most pristine and beautiful countries in the world, New Zealand introduced climate change curriculum in its schools last month.
Parliament passed a zero carbon bill last year and there are other measure in the pipeline to limit the impact of climate change.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - The Kremlin issued a new appeal for an end to hostilities in and around Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday after Moscow's foreign intelligence chief said the mountain enclave could become a launch pad for Islamist militants to enter Russia.
Moscow expressed alarm after the deadliest fighting in more than 25 years between ethnic Armenian and Azeri forces entered a 10th day, though the French news agency AFP later said Armenia had offered concessions only if Azerbaijan was ready to do so.
AFP gave no details of the offer it said had been made by Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. Azerbaijan has said it will stop fighting only if Armenia sets a timetable to withdraw from Nagorno-Karabakh, which under international law belongs to Azerbaijan but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called for fighting to stop and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov voiced ""serious concern about the unprecedented escalation"" in a phone call with Iran's foreign minister, 
Sergei Naryshkin, the head of Russia's SVR Foreign Intelligence Service, said the conflict was attracting people he described as mercenaries and terrorists from the Middle East.
""We are talking about hundreds and already even thousands of radicals hoping to earn money in a new Karabakh war,"" Naryshkin said in a statement.
He warned that the South Caucasus region could become ""a new launch pad for international terrorist organisations"" from where militants could enter states including Russia.
His comments were released after Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, whose country is a close ally of Azerbaijan, urged Moscow to be more active in peacemaking.
NEW FIGHTING
Mediation efforts led by Russia, France and the United States have failed to prevent intermittent flare-ups of fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh despite a ceasefire which ended a 1991-94 war that killed about 30,000.
Renewed fighting since Sept. 27 has increased concern that Turkey and Russia, which has a defence pact with Armenia, could be sucked into the South Caucasus conflict. 
Iran, which borders Azerbaijan and Armenia, is also worried about the conflict and President Hassan Rouhani underlined the importance of peace in the region in a phone call with Azeri leader Ilham Aliyev on Tuesday. 
In the latest fighting, Armenia said Azerbaijan launched an attack with tanks and artillery on a southern part of the contact line that divides ethnic Armenian and Azeri forces. 
Nagorno-Karabakh said four cluster bombs had exploded in the centre of Stepanakert, its main administrative centre. 
Azerbaijan says Azeri cities outside the conflict zone have been struck, taking the fighting closer to territory from which pipelines carry Azeri gas and oil to Europe.
Both sides say the other has hit civilian areas. Each denies targeting civilians.
Nagorno-Karabakh said 244 of its servicemen and 19 civilians had been killed since Sept. 27 and many more wounded.
The Azeri prosecutor's office said 27 Azeri civilians had been killed in the renewed fighting. Azerbaijan has not disclosed information about its military casualties.
In an interview with Russian news agency RIA, Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad said Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan was ""the main instigator and the initiator of the recent conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh between Azerbaijan and Armenia"". 
Reiterating accusations first levelled by French President Emmanuel Macron that Turkey has sent Syrian jihadists to fight in the conflict, Assad said: ""Damascus can confirm this.""
Assad offered no evidence for his allegation against Turkey, which backs rebels trying to oust him in Syria's civil war. 

Ankara did not immediately respond but has described similar accusations as part of attempts by Armenia to create ""dark propaganda"" about Turkey.

City mayor Michael Mueller, a Social Democrat, said experts had pointed to two problem areas that had to be addressed - large groups of people who were not sticking to social distancing rules and gatherings in closed rooms.
""The advice showed we have to act quickly,"" Mueller told reporters, adding action was needed to avoid a full lockdown in the German capital, famous for its club scene which has already come to a standstill due to corona restrictions.
From this weekend until the end of October, restaurants and bars will have to close at 11pm (2100 GMT) until 6 am (0400 GMT) and petrol stations will be banned from selling alcohol during those hours.
In addition, a maximum of 10 people will be allowed at private parties indoors, down from 25. 
The city of 3.8 million inhabitants is the latest major EU capital to take tougher measures to fight a steep surge in COVID-19 cases and the banking hub of Frankfurt also announced tighter rules on Tuesday.
Madrid, Europe's COVID hotspot, has imposed a second lockdown, and Paris has decided to shut bars and gyms for two weeks. 
Four out of 12 Berlin districts have become high-risk zones, meaning they exceeded 50 cases per 100,000 inhabitants for seven days in a row, according to health senate figures from Monday. For the city as a whole the figure was at 41.5.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Blood samples taken from Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny confirmed the presence of a nerve agent from the banned Novichok family, the global chemical weapons watchdog said on Tuesday.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said in a statement that the biomarkers in his blood and urine had ""similar structural characteristics as the toxic chemicals belonging"" to the Novichok group.
The findings confirm results released by Germany, where Navalny was treated after falling ill on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20. Berlin asked the OPCW to take samples from Navalny and test them after German doctors concluded he had been poisoned with Novichok.
The precise substance in Navalny's samples that was detected by the OPCW's designated laboratories was not on the list of banned chemical weapons, but is a new and undeclared variant in the Novichok family, the statement said.
""These results constitute a matter of grave concern,"" said OPCW Director-General Fernando Arias, calling on members to uphold the international treaty banning chemical weapons use.
Western governments have called for sanctions against Moscow over the case. Russia denies any involvement and has said it doubts Navalny was poisoned.
""No doubt Novichok nerve agent used to poison Alexey #Navalny,"" Britain's delegation at the OPCW said on Twitter. 
A joint statement from 44 OPCW member countries including the Germany, Britain and the United States called on Moscow to investigate.
""We urge the Russian Federation, on whose territory the attack took place, to investigate and to disclose, in a swift and transparent manner, the circumstances of this chemical weapons attack,"" the statement, tweeted by the UK delegation, said. 

Novichok, a Soviet-era nerve toxin, was also used to poison a former Russian spy in England in 2018. The OPCW's member states agreed last year to ban chemicals in the Novichok family, a ban that went into effect four months ago.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations Human Rights Council on Tuesday extended by two years the mandate of investigators who have documented executions, disappearances and torture in Venezuela that they say may amount to crimes against humanity https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2671UQ.
It condemned ""widespread targeted repression and persecution"" by security forces and called on the government of President Nicolas Maduro to cooperate with a preliminary examination opened by the International Criminal Court (ICC).
""We continue to see new cases of arbitrary killings, torture and other serious violations of human rights in that country,"" said Silvia Elena Alfaro Espinosa, Peru's ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, as she presented the resolution.
Venezuela's ambassador Jorge Valero rejected the text, which was also backed by the European Union, as ""a clear display of manipulation and politicisation of this Council"". 
""President Maduro would like to ask the European Union are you going to continue with the battered, beaten, and failed script of Donald Trump against Venezuela?,"" Valero asked.
The resolution was adopted with 22 countries in favour, three against (including Venezuela) and 22 abstentions (including Mexico).
U.N. investigators, in a report in September, said that the Maduro government had committed systematic human rights violations.
""The gravity of human rights violations, the erosion of rule of law and the dismantlement of democratic institutions in the country continue to merit the scrutiny of this Council,"" Germany's Ambassador Michael Freiherr von Ungern-Sternberg, speaking on behalf of the EU, told the Council.
Brazil's Ambassador Maria Nazareth Farani Azevedo said that the U.N. findings had ""renewed the hope for justice"" among Venezuelans. 
""Of particular alarm is that many of these violations were planned, made widespread and systematic under the command of individuals at the highest levels. The goal being to hang onto power at all cost,"" she said.

SAINT-DALMAS-DE-TENDE, France (Reuters) - Corpses from a cemetery in southern France were swept down a mountainous valley by a violent storm, with some believed to have washed up on Italy's Mediterranean shore, officials said.
In the village of Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, surging flood waters washed away dozens of graves and family tombs. 
Much of the cemetery has disappeared, swallowed up by the raging river. A headstone stands atop a muddy bank that now cleaves its way through the graveyard; some vaults lie broken where the waters of the Roya River have receded.
""You cannot rebuild a cemetery,"" said local resident Chantal Bocchin. ""It's not worth rebuilding when there's no one left.""
More than half a metre (1.6 feet) of rain fell over the rugged Franco-Italian border area north of Nice in less than 24 hours on Friday, swelling rivers and sending flash floods cascading through the region's narrow gorges.
In Saint-Dalmas-de-Tende, all four bridges linking the two halves of the village collapsed into the churning water, houses were swept off their foundations and power lines went down. Road and rail lines are all cut off and the only way in is by helicopters. 
Mayor Jean-Pierre Vassallo said the storm as 'apocalyptic'.
""It disemboweled the cemetery,"" Vassallo told Reuters. ""Our families were taken away, nearly 150 people carried away by the water."" 
Italian authorities on Sunday said they had discovered four bodies that washed ashore between the towns of Ventimiglia and Santo Stefano al Mare, close to the border with France. Another was found slightly inland, close to a river.
French officials said they were in an advanced state of decay.
""These aren't recent deaths ... but old cadavers which likely correspond to bodies from the (French) cemeteries that were engulfed by floodwater,"" French media cited Bernard Gonzalez, prefect of the Alpes-Maritimes department, as saying.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A state funeral was held on Tuesday for former Canadian Prime Minister John Turner who passed away last month at the age of 91.
Turner, who served the Canadian Prime Minister for just 11 weeks and led his Liberal Party to a massive electoral defeat in 1984, died in his Toronto home.
The funeral took place at the St. Michael's Cathedral Basilica in Toronto and was attended in person by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Trudeau.
""He knew we could rise to any challenge, and meet any moment – if we believed in one another and stood together,"" Justin Trudeau said during the funeral. ""Today, more than ever, we need people like John.""
Turner served as Canada's 17th prime minister after winning the Liberal party leadership in 1984. He also served in the cabinets of prime ministers Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau. 
Turner was a lawyer by training and served as finance minister from 1972 to 1975 but quit amid disagreements over policy with Pierre Trudeau. After serving as leader of the official opposition he retired from politics in 1993. He is survived by his wife Geills and four children.
Prior to his political life Turner was an accomplished athlete, qualifying for Canada's 1948 Olympic team as a record-breaking track sprinter. He received a Rhodes scholarship after attending the University of British Columbia.

""John Turner believed in taking the high road,"" Elizabeth Turner, his daughter, said, making reference to her father's way of handling negative commentary from the media and his colleagues.

Irina Slavina, editor-in-chief at a small news outlet in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, self-immolated in front of the local branch of the interior ministry in Nizhny Novgorod last Friday after blaming Russian authorities for her death in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
A day before her death, investigators and police had searched her apartment for materials linked to the Open Russia opposition group, which is financed by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
In a joint statement on Tuesday, the heads of Open Russia, the Memorial human rights group and the Public Verdict Foundation called on the authorities to refrain from carrying out unwarranted searches and to respect procedures - including the use of a warrant - when carrying out raids. 
""From a tool used to investigate a crime, searches have turned into a method of forceful and psychological pressure,"" the statement said. 
""As representatives of civic organisations, we demand that searches stop being used to intimidate citizens.""
The statement coincided with Slavina's funeral in Nizhny Novgorod, a city of 1.3 million about 400 km (250 miles) east of Moscow, where her supporters marched in a procession in her honour, with many clutching flowers. 
""Her death is a terrible tragedy, and we must ensure that no such tragedies happen again,"" said Andrei Pivovarov, executive director of Open Russia. ""To do this, we need to stop all political repression and, first of all, do away with cynical and humiliating searches.""
The regional branch of the Investigative Committee, Russia's equivalent to the FBI, said last Friday that Slavina's self-immolation had nothing to do with the raid carried out at her apartment on the previous day. 
It said she had only been a witness in a criminal case and that the search was related to that.

Macron had said ""Islamist separatism"" was threatening to take control in some Muslim communities in France and a bill on the issue would be sent to parliament with steps restricting home-schooling and encouraging teaching of Arabic.
""The 'Islam is in crisis' statement made by Macron in a city where Muslims are in the majority is beyond disrespectful, it is a clear provocation,"" Erdogan told an event celebrating mosques and religious personnel in Ankara.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's federal prosecutor's office said on Tuesday it had arrested three people of Rwandan origin who were charged with serious violations of international law linked to the 1994 genocide.
The arrests come as survivors of the genocide have demanded an acceleration in the pace of international justice, and Belgium, the former colonial power in Burundi and Congo as well as Rwanda, seeks to do more to come to terms with its past.
Militants from Rwanda's Hutu ethnic majority killed about 800,000 minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates in 100 days during the genocide in 1994.
Belgium's prosecutor said the trio were arrested following police searches in Brussels and the Belgian province of Hainaut on Sept. 29-30.
""The investigations are conducted by the federal police of Brussels and concern serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in Rwanda during the 1994 Tutsi genocide, in Kigali, in the Gikondo and Kacyiru sectors,"" the prosecutor said in a statement.
The prosecutor's office did not identify the suspects or specify what role they were accused of playing in the killings.
On Oct. 1 survivors of the Rwanda genocide said a special U.N. tribunal in Tanzania should quickly try elderly tycoon Felicien Kabuga on charges of financing the genocide. 
Last June, France's top civil court ruled Kabuga could be handed over to a U.N tribunal for trial.

The police officer was responding to a disturbance call on Oct. 3 when he sought to detain Price, who ""resisted in a non-threatening posture and began walking away,"" according to a statement from the Texas Department of Public Safety.
Shaun Lucas of the Wolfe City Police Department first deployed his Taser before shooting Price with his service weapon, the statement said. Price was transported to the hospital, where he later died.
""The preliminary investigation indicates that the actions of Officer Lucas were not objectively reasonable,"" the statement said, adding that the Texas Rangers have charged Lucas with murder.
The incident raised the possibility that Wolfe, a city of 1,500 people in North Texas, would become the latest flashpoint in a national uprising over racism and police brutality that was set off by the death of George Floyd on May 25.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive said on Tuesday that Turkey's government was undermining its economy, eroding democracy and destroying independent courts, leaving Ankara's bid to join the EU further away than ever.
Blaming ""excessively"" centralised presidential power for deteriorating conditions in freedom of speech, prisons and the central bank, the European Commission said the government was also exposing Turkey to ""rapid changes in investors' sentiment"".
""The EU's serious concerns on continued negative developments in the rule of law, fundamental rights and the judiciary have not been credibly addressed by Turkey,"" the Commission said in its annual report on the country.
""Turkey's (EU) accession negotiations have effectively come to a standstill,"" it said.
A NATO ally, Turkey has been negotiating its EU membership since 2005 after economic and political reforms that made it an important emerging market economy and trade partner. 
Although never easy because of disputed Turkish claims over Cyprus, talks rapidly unravelled after a failed coup in Turkey in July 2016 and President Tayyip Erdogan's ensuing crackdown on perceived opponents.
""In Turkey, the serious backsliding observed since the 2016 coup attempt continued,"" the Commission said.
There was no immediate comment from Turkey. Ankara has said in the past that EU criticism is unfair and disproportionate.
Turkey has since faced several years of harsh Commission reports, and the EU executive once again intensified its criticism, citing monetary policy, public administration and widespread corruption as failures of the Turkish government.
While the EU, Turkey's biggest foreign investor, relies on the country to house some 4 million Syrians fleeing civil war rather than let them proceed to Europe, Brussels also reiterated its threat to impose economic sanctions on Ankara over an energy dispute in the Eastern Mediterranean.
EU leaders agreed last week to consider sanctions if Turkey continued to explore for oil and gas in waters claimed by Greece and Cyprus. 

""In case of renewed unilateral actions or provocations in breach of international law..., the EU will use all the instruments and the options at its disposal,"" the report said.

The protesters were commemorating demonstrators killed during months of anti-government unrest last year in which more than 500 Iraqis died, most of them gunned down by security forces and militias.
Tuesday's clashes took place near the Imam Hussein shrine during the annual Arbaeen pilgrimage to commemorate the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson. 
The protesters had marched towards the shrine, witnesses said. Some became angry because they were not allowed into the shrine concourse, the Reuters reporter said. Security forces then charged the protesters with batons, causing skirmishes and pushing them back.
A Kerbala security official said the protesters had arrived as part of a pilgrimage group, but before the time allotted for them to tour the shrine. Part of the group grew violent and police acted to eject them from the area, the official said.
The Arbaeen pilgrimage is the world's largest public annual gathering and normally attractions millions of Muslims from Iraq and abroad.
This year there have been fewer pilgrims because Iraq has mostly closed its borders to foreign pilgrims over fears of a bigger spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Iraq is already recording up to 5,000 new cases a day.

A U.S.-brokered establishment of full diplomatic relations between the Gulf power and Israel on Sept. 15 owed much to their shared concerns about Iran, though some in Israel worry the deal could herald sales of advanced U.S. weaponry to Abu Dhabi that were previously withheld.
Both sides have pointed to a sense of reconciliation and mutual tolerance as a driver of the deal - a message that UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan left at the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe memorial in Berlin, which he visited with Israel's Gabi Ashkenazi.
Writing in the visitors' book in Arabic, he called the site ""a witness to the fall of a group of human beings who were victims of advocates of extremism and hatred,"" and he advocated ""the noble human values of co-existence, tolerance, acceptance of others and respect of all religions and beliefs"".
""Never Again,"" Sheikh Abdullah added in English - a slogan often taken up by survivors of Nazi Germany's World War Two genocide to justify actions to protect Israel and the Jewish people.
Ashkenazi and his UAE counterpart were in Berlin to discuss a variety of issues in promoting relations, according to an Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman. 
The UAE dignitary's visit to the memorial was in itself unusual: Many in the overwhelmingly Islamic Middle East feel geographically removed from the Holocaust, some deny it happened and others believe it was unfairly parlayed by foreign powers to create Israel in 1948 at the Palestinians' expense.
In his own inscription, Ashkenazi - a former commander of Israel's armed forces - said his presence there alongside the Emirati and their host, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, ""symbolises a new era, an era of peace between the peoples"".

It was also a reminder of the need ""to live strong and ensure that this will never recur,"" Ashkenazi wrote in Hebrew.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A former senior North Korean diplomat who disappeared from his country's embassy in Italy in 2018 has settled in South Korea, a lawmaker in Seoul said on Tuesday. 
Jo Song Gil, who was North Korea's acting ambassador to Italy, disappeared with his wife after leaving the embassy without notice in early November 2018, and his whereabouts have been unclear since.
In a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Ha Tae-keung, a South Korean opposition party lawmaker who sits on parliament's intelligence committee, said that Jo had settled in South Korea last year under the protection of the government.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited multiple unnamed sources who also said that Jo and his wife were living in South Korea.
A National Intelligence Service official told Yonhap that the agency could not confirm the report.
Thae Yong Ho, Pyongyang's former deputy ambassador to Britain who defected to South Korea in 2016, had publicly urged Jo to settle in the South.
According to Italy's foreign ministry, Jo's daughter was repatriated to North Korea at her request after her parents went missing.
Media reports at the time suggested Jo was seeking asylum in the United States or an unspecified European country.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - ""Fried chicken, fried fish, rice!"" Mohammed al-Mohammedawi shouts to Shi'ite pilgrims passing his roadside food tent in Baghdad on their way to the holy city of Kerbala on foot.
His tent is among hundreds in the Iraqi capital providing free food, shelter and even clothes to the thousands of pilgrims making the 90-kilometre journey to Kerbala, which will take them two to three days, for the annual Arbaeen pilgrimage.
Local men founded a volunteer group 'Ahbab al-Zahra' to assist the pilgrims after the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003, who had for decades banned the pilgrimage.
Arbaeen marks the end of a 40-day mourning period for the grandson of the Prophet Mohammad, Imam Hussein, killed in battle in 680. The climax of the pilgrimage will be held on Thursday (October 8) in Kerbala.
Although their operation had been growing ever since 2003, this year is different, al-Mohammedawi said.
With the coronavirus continuing to spread in Iraq and with new cases averaging around 3000 to 5000 per day, the Iraqi government decided to limit the number of foreign pilgrims to 1,500 per country of origin.
Neighbouring Iran has banned flights to Iraq and closed land borders due to the pandemic. Last year, about 2 million Iranians had visited Iraq for Arbaeen. Al-Mohammedawi said he also noticed a decrease in Iraqi pilgrims this year.
But fear of the pandemic did not deter 'Ahbab al-Zahra's Sattar al-Souaidi from volunteering. Despite losing two of his brothers to COVID-19 HE is convinced he won't catch the virus himself.
""The volunteers here serve people without wearing face masks, without using disinfectant, because our love and passion for (Imam) Hussein kills this illness,"" he said.
Mohammed Yousef, a pilgrim from Kirkuk, was trying to respect protective measures by keeping his distance and wearing a face mask, but still stopped to mingle and enjoy the free food. 

The head of Baghdad's Operations command, Qais al-Mohammedawi, told Reuters a number of security force units were deployed to raise awareness among pilgrims about the dangers of the pandemic.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's government must prioritize communities' safety over military operations against armed groups to stop killings of activists, while ensuring perpetrators face legal punishment, advocacy organization International Crisis Group said in a report on Tuesday. 
At least 415 human rights and community activists - widely known in Colombia as social leaders - have been killed since January 2016, according to government figures cited in the report. Some human rights groups put the figure much higher.
President Ivan Duque's government has focused on destroying coca crops and weakening armed groups in a bid to protect activists, but military operations can provoke retaliation against communities, according to Crisis Group, a nongovernmental organization focused on conflict resolution.
The government must implement rural reforms to offer viable alternatives to illegal activities such as coca growing and should widen demobilization programs, the report said. 
""Without abandoning the goal of dismantling armed groups, Colombia should offer their members realistic pathways back into civilian life through negotiated collective demobilization,"" the report said. 
A ministry of defense spokesperson reiterated the government's view that violence will not be stopped by military and police presence alone, but by establishing rule of law. 
The government accuses left-wing guerrillas from the National Liberation Army, ex-members of the FARC rebels who reject a 2016 peace deal and criminal groups, some comprised of former right-wing paramilitaries, of attacking activists as they seek control of drug trafficking and illegal mining areas.
The attacks have drawn condemnation from advocacy groups and the international community.
Some 60% of the killings have occurred in municipalities earmarked under the 2016 peace agreement for special development programs, the report found. 
The areas generally have high levels of poverty and are locations where multiple armed groups are jostling for control. 
""In this sense, violence is a continuation of, rather than a departure from, the past,"" the report said.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of Indonesians took to the streets of several cities on Tuesday in a national strike to protest against a new jobs law they say is too pro-business, but which the government has promoted as vital to attract investment.
President Joko Widodo's ""omnibus"" Job Creation bill, approved by parliament on Monday, revises more than 70 existing laws to accelerate reform of Southeast Asia's largest economy. 
Unions expect some two million workers to join the three-day national strike, starting on Tuesday, against the law.
Demonstrations began on Tuesday in industrial areas around Jakarta and on Batam island, home to many electronics plants, as well as in cities in Sumatra and Sulawesi islands, local media reported.
Television footage showed thousands of people protesting in Bandung, West Java, wearing face masks but without observing social distancing. They burnt tyres in front of the local parliament office, according to media reports.
Citing the need to contain the spread of the coronavirus, police blocked workers from protesting in front of the national parliament in Jakarta as planned.
""The law will definitely affect the status of our employment,"" said Anwar Sanusi, a member of FSPMI trade union in Tangerang, west of Jakarta.
People fear losing pensions and insurance if they are made contract workers for life due to the law, Sanusi told Reuters.
The law removes the three-year maximum duration of contracts and reduces severance benefits - provisions the government said are intended to promote formal hiring. Other reforms include longer working hours and changes to mandatory paid leave.
MARKETS WELCOME LAW
Indonesian markets cheered the passage of the bill, with the main stock index (JKSE) up as much as 1.31% and the rupiah  reaching as high as 1.28%, before paring some gains.
The Indonesia Investment Coordinating Board, a government agency, said it would lead to better welfare for workers by facilitating more foreign investment.
Citibank, in a research note, said the law simplifies business licensing and addresses restrictive trade and labour policies, but added that immediate foreign investment was unlikely in the currently depressed global economic climate.
Trimegah Securities economist Fakhrul Fulvian said banks and export-oriented industries should benefit from the law, while consumer and retail sectors may be pressured as workers may increase savings to compensate for changes in labour rules.

However, many Indonesians criticised the law on Twitter, with one trending hashtag incorporating an expletive against parliament and another calling lawmakers traitors.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy has softened rules penalising aid groups that bring illegal migrants ashore and extended protection for refugees who risk persecution at home, drawing the fire of former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini who set the tough measures.
Rescue boats which violate official orders in carrying out their activity will now face lighter fines, of up to 50,000 euros ($59,000), compared with up to 1 million euros previously, according to a decree approved by the government.
Migrants will, meanwhile, not be expelled if they ""risk being subjected to torture or inhumane treatment"" at home, under the decree, which also makes it easier for those who hold special residence permits to obtain a regular working visa.
""The propaganda/Salvini decrees are no more,"" tweeted Nicola Zingaretti, leader of the Democratic Party (PD) in a coalition government. ""We want a more humane and safe Italy.""
However Salvini, who remains a popular figure in Italian politics with his anti-immigrant League party topping opinion polls, denounced the decision.
""Open ports (and wallets) for smugglers and illegal migrants are back,"" he said in a statement. ""We will stop them.""
Salvini, leader of the League, has repeatedly accused aid groups of being complicit with people-smugglers by sending out rescue boats to pick up migrants from the fragile vessels in which they set out to sea.
During his 14 months in office, he closed ports to migrant rescue ships and threatened them with hefty fines if they tried to dock, while clamping down on asylum rights to curb arrivals.
Salvini faces the possibility of being tried for illegally detaining migrants aboard ships when he was interior minister and could face up to 15 years in jail if found guilty.
After months of often tough negotiation, the government of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement and centre-left PD has revised some policies set under the last government, in which Salvini was a leading figure.
The decree was passed late on Monday despite opposition from some 5-Star politicians, who were unwilling to water down rules approved under their former coalition with Salvini's party, even though President Sergio Mattarella has criticised those measures.

Tsikhanouskaya, who says she won Belarus's presidential election two months ago and accuses long-standing President Alexander Lukashenko of hanging on to power only via massive electoral fraud, is in Berlin to drum up support.
Hundreds of thousands have protested in the streets of Belarus's cities since the election, defying brutal police crackdowns and widespread violence to demand Lukahsenko clear the way for a fresh vote.
""The first thing I did in Berlin was come to look at the Berlin Wall,"" she said of the structure thrown up by East Germany's Communist regime in 1961 to stop East Germans fleeing their Soviet-backed government to democratic West Germany.
Fragments of the wall remain dotted around the city, many of them decorated, as they were on the West Berlin side in the 28 years during which the city was divided, with political graffiti.
After speaking to reporters she went to one piece, on Berlin's central Potsdamer Platz, which activists had painted in Belarus's national colours red and white in support of the protests.
""I was shown a picture of people from the eastern side standing on the wall,"" she said, referring to the scenes from after the collapse of the East German regime in 1989. ""It's the same in Belarus: we are on this wall and we are going to tear it down.""

The issue of how Britain deals with the legacy of parts of its history, particularly its role in the transatlantic slave trade and the colonial period, has been hotly debated in recent months in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protest movement.
A statue of a slave trader was torn down by protesters in Bristol in June, while a range of venerable institutions such as Oxford University have grappled publicly with what they should do about controversial objects they own.
""We’re proud of this country’s culture, history and traditions,"" Johnson said in a speech to his Conservative Party's annual conference.
""They literally want to pull statues down, to rewrite the history of our country, to edit our national CV to make it look more politically correct,"" he said. 
He did not explain exactly who he was referring to, but the comment came just after he set out what he saw as the contrast between the Conservatives and the Labour opposition.
Johnson alluded to a controversy that took place in August, when the BBC announced plans to omit the words from two patriotic songs, including Rule Britannia, from the pomp-laden climax of an annual classical music festival.
""We aren’t embarrassed about songs about how Britannia rules the waves. In fact, we are making sense of it with a Conservative national shipbuilding strategy,"" Johnson said.
Rule Britannia includes the lyric: ""Rule Britannia! Britannia rule the waves; Britons never, never, never shall be slaves.""

After a storm of criticism, including from Johnson who accused the broadcaster of ""cringing embarrassment"" about British history and culture, the BBC reversed course. The Labour Party said at the time it was the right decision.

KYIV, Oct 6 (Reuters) - Belarusian electro-folk singer Rusia Shukiurava fled Minsk in early September but every sight of a police officer or sound of a car with a siren still makes ""everything squeeze"" inside her.
Shukiurava left for Ukraine's capital Kyiv with her 1.5-year-old daughter and mother in the aftermath of Belarus' disputed Aug. 9 presidential election, saying fear for her safety paralysed her in both her personal and professional life.
The 40-year-old had been working as a voice trainer for opposition politicians, including Viktor Babariko, a key figure who was later arrested, and worried her professional activity would make her a target for persecution by the authorities.
The Freedom Belarus movement, which unites anti-government Belarusian artists, also used one of Shukiurava's songs for a music video featuring women wearing white throwing truncheons, arms and protective equipment into a grave.
""I was not able to do anything. All I could do was fear for my life, read news, attend rallies. I was not able to be a proper mother, a proper singer,"" Shukiurava told Reuters.
""I was not able to be a proper person either because of that powerful fear.""
Mass protests have rocked Belarus and represent the gravest threat to President Alexander Lukashenko's rule since he took power 26 years ago. Protesters, who were detained, said they were beaten by security forces, authorities deny any wrongdoing.
Shukiurava said she also left because of the obstacles to her career in Belarus and because she sees more opportunities in Ukraine. Trying to negotiate all of the bans in Belarus was like a flower trying to grow through asphalt, she said.
Shukiurava had visited Kyiv with music tours and had friends there. Relocation to the city was the safest and quickest solution and she was welcomed and helped by locals, she added.

The FSB did not provide details of any information it had passed on to Estonian authorities.

The FSB added that the serviceman's brother, a permanent resident of Estonia, had also been detained in Pskov, a Russian city located about 30km from the border with Estonia. 
Separate footage released by the FSB showed officers pinning a man in civilian clothing to the ground, handcuffing him and taking him away in a van.

The Danish government has said meeting its ambitious target of cutting emissions by 70% in 10 years is doable, but has faced headwinds for counting too much on technologies that take years to become commercially viable. 
Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen defended her government's plans for targeted investment in new technologies such as carbon capture, green hydrogen, sustainable farming and plastic recycling.
""Denmark must be a showcase for the world. But no one will follow us if our path is expensive, unmanageable and socially unjust,"" Frederiksen told parliament.

The report, part of a wider inquiry into far-right extremism in the civil service, seeks to dispel concerns that authorities have turned a blind eye to potentially violent nationalists gaining footholds in the uniformed services.
It is a highly sensitive issue in a country still haunted by the murder of six million Jews by Hitler's Nazi dictatorship during World War Two.
""The result of the report is clear: we have a small number of cases,"" said Interior Minister Horst Seehofer. 
""This means that the very overwhelming majority of security employees, meaning more than 99%, abide by the constitution. This means also that we have no structural problem with right-wing extremism among security forces at the federal or state level.""
Seehofer commissioned the wider report into the scope of extremism within the civil service last year after the shooting dead of a pro-immigration politician by a suspected far-right sympathizer in Hesse and a deadly attack outside a synagogue and a kebab joint in the city of Halle by an anti-Semitic gunman.
German police forces have in recent months been hit by embarrassing revelations of officers sharing racist and extremist content in far-right chatrooms or sending threatening emails to legislators of Turkish background. 
""Each of these cases is a case too much,"" said Thomas Haldenwang, head of the BfV domestic intelligence agency.

Relations between the two NATO allies and neighbours are fraught with disagreements ranging from maritime boundaries to the ethnically divided island of Cyprus. Tensions came to a head this summer when each made overlapping claim to swathes of the east Mediterranean, and Turkey dispatched a survey vessel to map out possible oil and gas drilling prospects, infuriating Greece.
Turkey pulled out the vessel in mid-September.
""Our country welcomes as positive a first step made by Turkey towards de-escalating the recent tensions,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said after talks in Athens with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg.
""It now remains to be seen if it is a sincere move or a short-lived manoeuvre,"" Mitsotakis said, adding that Greece was committed to dialogue and diplomacy to resolve any disputes.
Last week Stoltenberg announced the creation of a mechanism to avoid accidental clashes in the eastern Mediterranean as part of broader efforts to defuse tensions between Ankara and Athens.
The 'de-confliction' includes setting up a hotline to avoid accidents in the sea and air. There was a light collision between Turkish and Greek frigates in August.
""It is up to Turkey to close the path of crisis and open a path of resolution. We are willing to meet it on that second path and I'm optimistic that is the route we will take, to the benefit of our two peoples,"" Mitsotakis said.

BISHKEK (Reuters) - Opposition groups in Kyrgyzstan said they had seized power in the strategically-important Central Asian country on Tuesday after taking control of government buildings in the capital during protests over a parliamentary election. 
President Sooronbai Jeenbekov said the country, which hosts a Russian air base and a large Canadian-controlled gold mine, was facing an attempted coup d'etat. He ordered security forces not to open fire protesters however. 
One person was killed and 590 wounded in unrest overnight, the government said. The opposition said it had freed Almazbek Atambayev, a former president jailed on corruption charges, and was already discussing the line-up of a provisional government. 
It was not clear what role, if any, Atambayev would receive, and Jeenbekov, the sitting president, showed no immediate signs of relinquishing power, although the central election commission was reported to have annuled the results of the Oct. 4 election.
Local news website 24.kg said the commission took the decision at a meeting held after the storming of the government headquarters.
Several opposition politicians urged the outgoing parliament to install a provisional cabinet in order to legitimise a transfer of power.
Kyrgyzstan borders China and is a close ally of Russia and has long been a platform for geopolitical competition between Moscow, Washington and Beijing. It has a history of political volatility -- two of its presidents have been toppled by revolts in the past 15 years.
The Russian embassy to Kyrgyzstan said in a statement it supported resolving the matter through legal means while ensuring people's safety and domestic stability.
Burnt out cars littered Bishkek, the capital, on Tuesday morning after protesters took control of the main government building, known as the White House, which briefly caught fire before emergency services put out the blaze. 
Debris from inside, including government papers, and office furniture, was strewn outside after protesters ransacked parts of it.
Interior Minister Kashkar Junushaliyev did not show up for work on Tuesday, a ministry spokesman said, saying that Kursan Asanov, an opposition politician and a former senior security official, had taken over as acting interior minister. 
Police had been ordered to ensure citizens' safety and prevent clashes and looting, the same spokesman said. Meanwhile, the second-largest gold deposit in Kyrgyzstan, Jeruy, was shut down by unidentified people on Tuesday, its Russian-owned operator said.
CONTESTED VOTE
Trouble erupted on Monday after police used teargas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people demonstrating against the results of a parliamentary election on Sunday which they demanded be annulled.
Western observers said the election, which appeared to have handed most seats to two establishment parties supporting closer links between the former Soviet republic and Russia, had been marred by vote buying. 
One of the parties was close to Jeenbekov, the president.
Police had broken up one protest late on Monday, but protesters later returned to Bishkek's central square and broke into the White House, which houses both the president and parliament, local news websites Akipress and 24.kg reported.
Protesters then broke into the headquarters of the State Committee on National Security and freed former president Almazbek Atambayev, who was sentenced to a lengthy prison term this year on corruption charges after falling out with Jeenbekov, his successor.
Opposition groups took over several more buildings, including the mayor's office, and appointed their own acting head of national security, acting prosecutor general and a commandant of Bishkek though it was unclear how much actual power they wielded.
Protesters also freed several former senior officials jailed under Jeenbekov, including ex-prime minister Sapar Isakov and Atambayev's former chief of staff Farid Niyazov.
Several provincial governors have resigned, according to local media reports which said public rallies had begun on Tuesday in several provincial centres, most of them anti-government.

Jeenbekov's supporters were gathering in the southern city of Osh, the same reports said, where his brother Asylbek Jeenbekov called for unity and order.

(Reuters) - Taliban and Afghan peace negotiators have agreed on a code of conduct to safeguard against the risk of any breakdown in talks that began last month in Qatar to bring an end to decades of war, three official sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The breakthrough was achieved with the help of U.S. officials, as the two sides drew up 19 ground rules that their negotiators should observe during talks, the sources said.
While the talks have been taking place in Qatar's capital Doha, scores of Afghan soldiers and Taliban fighters have been killed in clashes and suicide attacks in which dozens of civilians have also died in recent weeks. 
""Firming up code of conduct was extremely crucial as it proves that both sides are willing to continue talks even as we see that violence has not reduced on the ground,"" said one senior Western diplomat on conditions of anonymity. 
The breakthrough came as Afghan President Ashraf Ghani held bilateral discussions in Qatar's capital of Doha with Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. Special Envoy, and Gen. Austin Miller, the top commander for U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan. 
The intra-Afghan talks are part of a landmark deal signed between the United States and the Taliban in February.
Under the deal, foreign forces will leave Afghanistan by May 2021 in exchange for counter terrorism guarantees from the Taliban, which agreed to negotiate a permanent cease-fire and a power-sharing formula with the Afghan government.
Diplomats had told Reuters that the talks had got off to a difficult start, with disagreements over how the Hanafi Islamic code could be used to guide negotiations and on whether the deal signed between the United States and the Taliban in February should be the basis for the talks, as demanded by the Taliban.
The three sources said the delegations were putting those differences to one side to move forward and agree on an agenda, but would work on resolving these issues during negotiations. 
""The ground rules will serve as a foundation as both sides are making an effort to prevent a collapse,"" said a second senior official in Doha overseeing the talks. 
A ceasefire is a top priority for the Afghan officials and the western diplomats who are facilitating these talks.

However, analysts believe the Taliban would not agree to a comprehensive ceasefire since clashes with Afghan forces and violence gives them leverage at the negotiation table.

""They understood that there were big, big problems threatening them ahead of elections for the State Duma,"" Navalny said in a YouTube interview with a Russian blogger, his first video appearance since being discharged from a Berlin hospital. 
The outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin emerged from a coma in early September after collapsing on a domestic flight in Siberia on Aug. 20. 
German doctors say he was poisoned with a Novichok nerve agent. Germany, France and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny's illness.
The Kremlin has rejected any suggestion that Putin or the Russian authorities were responsible for Navalny's condition. 
Navalny said he did not know how a Novichok nerve agent had got into his system, but that he could have touched something. 
He said his recovery could take another two months. At one point in the interview he held out his hand to show it shaking. 
Navalny said he was undergoing physical therapy, but that his health had improved significantly and that doctors were surprised at the speed of his recovery. 

Russia's parliamentary elections are due to take place in September, although some media reports have suggested they could be brought forward to next spring.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thais paid their respects with flowers and prayers on Tuesday to the victims of a 1976 massacre of pro-democracy students by state forces, an event given new resonance by a recent surge in student-led protests.
As people laid wreaths at the Thammasat University monument, 64-year-old survivor Wichian Visutanakon recalled the bloodshed.
""The worst thing is those people who did those crimes are still proud and don't regret their actions,"" he said.
On Oct. 6, 1976, security forces attacked some 2,000 student protesters on the campus, accusing them of being communist sympathisers and seeking to bring down the monarchy. Dozens were killed - shot, hanged or beaten to death.
The events have never been investigated officially.
This year's memorial ceremony drew more younger sympathisers than in recent years after nearly three months of street protests against the government, in which some protesters had called for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
A 23-year-old student, Thantara Sriserm, said she was worried the protests might be violent like 1976, but that ""it might be less likely as these days we have smartphones that we can use to film and share things quickly"".
The protests are the biggest challenge in years to a ruling establishment long dominated by the army and the palace. The next big protest is set for Oct. 14.
Protesters seek the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader whose critics accuse him of keeping power by manipulating 2019 elections. He says the vote was fair.
Last month, tens of thousands of protesters gathered just outside Thammasat University also cheered calls for palace reform, breaching a longstanding taboo on criticising the monarchy. Protests have been peaceful so far.
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said the Oct. 6 memorial ceremonies happen every year and the government has no objection to this year's event.
The #Oct6 hashtag in Thai was among the top trending on Twitter in Thailand, used more than 410,000 times.
""I hope that instigating hatred in the name of love for the nation, religion and monarchy, as seen in the Oct. 6 incident, will not happen again,"" said opposition MP Rangsiman Rome, a former student activist.

Thailand became a constitutional monarchy when absolute monarchy ended in 1932. Thailand's army has seized power 13 times since then and has on several occasions carried out bloody crackdowns on protesters.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Lawmakers in the European Parliament expect a tight vote on Tuesday on the European Union's new climate target for 2030, with support splintered over the bloc's green ambitions.
The assembly will vote in the evening on a landmark bill to make EU climate targets legally binding. The most contentious part is a new target for emissions cuts this decade. 
The EU's current goal is to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030, against 1990 levels. That needs upgrading if the bloc is to become climate neutral by 2050.
The European Commission last month proposed a 2030 emissions cut of ""at least 55%"", which it said was economically feasible but would require tougher policies for many sectors, including tighter car emissions standards and higher carbon costs for industry and airlines.
The European Parliament's environment committee last month voted for a 60% cut target for 2030, and groups representing just under half of the assembly said they would back this goal on Tuesday. Some officials said enough extra votes had been secured for a razor-thin majority.
""I think we have a historic opportunity to take the climate policy to higher levels,"" said Sweden's Jytte Guteland, lead lawmaker on the issue.
""It will be a very tight result,"" said Pascal Canfin, chair of Parliament's environment committee.
Conservative lawmakers are meanwhile rallying behind a proposal by the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) to cut emissions by at least 55% this decade.
""The 60% is stretching too much,"" German EPP lawmaker Peter Liese said, adding that he was ""quite optimistic"" his proposal would gain majority support.
Some Green lawmakers said they could support a 55% goal, but took issue with EPP's plan to count carbon sinks - emissions absorbed by forests - and carbon credits from overseas projects towards the target.
""That is a clear red line for us,"" Green lawmaker Bas Eickhout said.
The split in Parliament reflects broader divisions among the EU's 27 countries, which must also approve the 2030 goal.

Wealthy western and northern countries largely back an emissions cut of at least 55%, while others oppose tougher climate policies that could hit their strategic economic sectors, such as coal mining in Poland and automobile manufacturing in the Czech Republic.

The ruling follows a complaint from the European Commission and is one of many issues in which the EU has clashed with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's hardline stance on migration and minorities, as well as moves to increase state control of the courts, media and NGOs.
Under the reform, passed in 2017, foreign-registered universities can no longer operate in Hungary unless they also provide courses in their home countries, a provision that the European Court of Justice said on Tuesday was against EU law.
""The conditions introduced by Hungary to enable foreign higher education institutions to carry out their activities in its territory are incompatible with EU law,"" the court said.
Central European University transferred the bulk of its courses out of Hungary after a long legal battle between Hungarian-born Soros, who promotes liberal causes through his charities, and the government of Orban.
The EU court also said the requirement introduced by the reform that non-EU universities could operate in Hungary only if their home country had a bilateral treaty with Hungary was in breach of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights which protects academic freedom and the freedom to conduct a business.

It was also against commitments made by Hungary as a member of the World Trade Organisation, the EU Court said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The United Nations Human Rights office in South Korea called on Tuesday for an impartial investigation into the killing of a fisheries official by North Korean troops at sea last month, as the man's family urged the U.N. to conduct its own probe. 
The death of the official, whose family identified him as Lee Dae-jun, sparked a dispute over why and how he was found floating in North Korean waters nearly 36 hours after he went missing.
The South Korean government said their investigation suggests Lee wanted to defect to the North, but his family disputes that.[L4N2GQ0PB]
Lee's brother, Lee Rae-jin, told reporters outside the Seoul office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights that he wanted to expose North Korea's ""atrocities"" and ask for a ""fair and objective investigation"" by the U.N.
In a statement on Twitter, the U.N. human rights office in Seoul said both Koreas are obligated to carry out a ""prompt, impartial, and effective investigation"" and to make the findings public, but made no mention of the U.N. playing a role.
North Korea should also engage with the South to return the man's remains, the U.N. office said.
Lee Dae-jun's teenage son wrote a letter to South Korean President Moon Jae-in accusing the government of failing to save his father's life.
""Would you have acted the same way if it were your own child or grandchild going through this pain?"" he wrote to Moon.
Moon's office said that the president planned to respond to the boy personally.
A spokesman for South Korea's ministry of defense said it would respond to the family after reviewing their request for information.
South Korea has accused the North of dousing Lee's body in fuel and setting it on fire in an effort to prevent any possible coronavirus infections. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un offered an apology for the killing, but Pyongyang denied it burned his body and has not responded to Seoul's call for a joint probe.
Ha Tae-keung, an opposition party lawmaker on parliament's intelligence committee, told reporters that the government would also ask the U.N. to investigate whether North Korea is executing people who don't follow anti-coronavirus measures.

North Korea has not confirmed any coronavirus infections and has imposed strict virus-control measures including closing its borders, although South Korea and the United States doubt it has managed to avoid the pandemic completely.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's military has launched aircraft to intercept Chinese planes more than twice as much as all of last year, the island's defence ministry said, describing Taiwan as facing severe security challenges from its huge neighbour.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up its military activities near the island, responding to what Beijing calls ""collusion"" between Taipei and Washington.
In the past few weeks, Chinese fighter jets have crossed the mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, which normally serves as an official buffer between the island and the mainland, and have flown into Taiwan's southwestern air defence identification zone.
In a report to parliament, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said so far this year the air force had scrambled 4,132 times, up 129% compared to all of last year, according to Reuters calculations. 
China ""is trying to use unilateral military actions to change the security status quo in the Taiwan Strait, and at the same time is testing our response, increasing pressure on our air defences and shrinking our space for activity,"" it said.
The rapid development of China's military has been accompanied by ""targeted"" military actions against Taiwan, the ministry added.
China has been particularly angered by growing U.S. support for Taiwan, including senior U.S. officials visiting the island, adding to broader Sino-U.S. tensions.
While Taiwan is unable to compete numerically with China's armed forces, President Tsai Ing-wen has been overseeing a military modernisation programme, aiming to make the island's armed forces more nimble and Taiwan more difficult to attack.
Addressing a Taiwan-U.S. defence conference late Monday, Vice Defence Minister Chang Guan-chung said China has been ramping up what he called ""realistic training against Taiwan"". 
""We are developing systems that are small, numerous, smart, stealthy, fast, mobile, low-cost, survivable, effective, easy to develop, maintain and preserve, and difficult to detect and counter,"" he said.
Chang called for enhanced cooperation with the United States that goes beyond weapons sales, saying that would further invigorate Taiwan's defence reform and military modernisation.

""We will also emphasise joint effort in training, operational concepts, capability assessment, intelligence sharing, and armament cooperation. These are equally important as the acquisition of hardware,"" he said.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of men, women and children with mental health conditions are living chained up in roughly 60 countries, Human Rights Watch said on Tuesday.
Without mental health support or awareness, families or institutions often shackle people against their will, leaving them eating, sleeping, urinating and defecating in one small space, the rights watchdog said in a report.
In the run-up to World Mental Health Day on Oct. 10, Human Rights Watch's report documents through almost 800 interviews how people with psychosocial disabilities in countries like China, Nigeria and Mexico can live shackled for years - chained to trees, locked in cages, imprisoned in animal sheds.
""We have found the practice of shackling across religions, social strata, economic classes, cultures and ethnic groups - it's a practice that is found around the world,"" said Kriti Sharma, senior disability rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, in an interview.
The belief in many countries ""is that people with mental health conditions are bewitched, or possessed or have sinned, and as a result, they have a condition,"" she said.
China's foreign ministry and Mexico's health ministry did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. A Nigerian health ministry spokesman said the ministry had not seen the report and declined to comment.
Last year, Nigerian authorities' raids on Islamic rehabilitation centres for drugs and behavioural issues made global headlines after boys and men told of being shackled, kept naked, beaten and sexually abused.
But around the world, in state-run and private centres and traditional and religious healing institutions, handlers deny people food, force medications and herbal remedies on them, and mete out physical and sexual violence, Human Rights Watch said.
In many countries, these services are ""very profitable businesses,"" Sharma said. 
The watchdog said families often shackle their loved ones out of fear they will escape and harm themselves or others.
""I've been chained for five years,"" a Kenyan man named Paul told Human Rights Watch, whose chains were so heavy he could barely move, according to the group.
""I stay in a small room with seven men,"" he said. ""I'm not allowed to wear clothes, only underwear. I eat porridge in the morning and if I'm lucky, I find bread at night.""

Kim made the announcement in a politburo meeting of the ruling Workers' Party on Monday. The meeting comes during a difficult year for North Korea as the coronavirus pandemic puts more pressure on a economy hurt by recent storms and flooding.
""We have performed historical feats with our costly efforts, boldly overcoming unprecedentedly grave trials and difficulties this year, but we should not rest on our laurels,"" KCNA said.
""We still face the challenges that cannot be overlooked and there are many goals we have to attain within this year.""
In August, Kim had announced that the ruling party will hold a congress in January to decide a new five-year plan, with a party meeting noting serious delays in improving the national economy.
Last year, Kim vowed to make a ""frontal breakthrough"" in the country's campaign to build a self-reliant economy in the face of tightening sanctions aimed at curbing its nuclear and missile programmes.

Security officials were watching for signs that North Korea may use an upcoming holiday to unveil new weapons or test fire a submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) on Oct. 10, the 75th anniversary of the ruling workers party.

A vote is expected later this week on the resolution that challenges Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's governance after almost three months of anti-graft protests in Bulgaria that seek his resignation. 
Thousands of Bulgarians have been rallying daily since July, accusing three-times premier Borissov of eroding democratic rules and allowing corrupt practices that support oligarchs and businesses close to his centre-right GERB party.
In a heated debate, lawmakers from the socialist party family, as well as the Greens and liberals slammed Bulgaria's government for backsliding on democratic values and abuse of EU funds.
MEPs from the centre-right group EPP, to which Borissov's own party belongs, defended Borissov as a pro-European leader.
Bulgaria ranks as the bloc's most corrupt member state according to Transparency International's index. The country has dropped to 111th position in terms of media freedom from 51st in 2007, when it joined the EU, according to Reporters Without Borders.     
""Bulgarian citizens will deal with their government, but we need to stop feeding the vampires that are sucking the life blood out these wonderful people,"" said Clare Daly from the group of the European United Left-Nordic Green Left.
EPP chair Manfred Weber said the protests showed that democracy works in Bulgaria. Borissov has refused to step down and on Monday Weber said protesters could have their say at an election scheduled for next March. 
A European Parliament resolution rapping Bulgaria for shortcomings in respecting the rule of law would have no practical consequences except political embarrassment for Borissov. But it would also be a signal that Brussels is not turning a blind eye.
Unlike Hungary and Poland, Bulgaria has managed to avoid a formal EU process checking if rule-of-law is observed, by promising changes and setting up bodies to combat graft and overhaul the judiciary, while dragging its feet on delivering results.
Last week the European Commission, in a milder tone, criticised Bulgaria's shortcomings on courts' independence and the lack of senior officials jailed on corruption charges in its first report on rule of law in the EU.
Speaking on Monday, the EU's top democracy official, Commissioner Vera Jourova said the EU Commission would press ahead in monitoring Bulgaria until it sees tangible results in fighting corruption and overhauling of the judiciary.

""There is still unfinished business. And we want to see the job done,"" she said.

In an interview with Saudi-owned Al Arabiya television aired on Monday, the prince labelled the Palestinian authorities' criticism a ""transgression"" and ""reprehensible discourse"".
""The Palestinian cause is a just cause but its advocates are failures, and the Israeli cause is unjust but its advocates have proven to be successful. That sums up the events of the last 70 or 75 years,"" he said in the first of a three-part airing of the interview.
""There is something that successive Palestinian leadership historically share in common: they always bet on the losing side, and that comes at a price.""
The United Arab Emirates agreed a historic deal to normalise relations with Israel in August, and the Gulf state of Bahrain, a close Saudi ally, followed suit in September. 
Palestinians fear the moves will weaken a long-standing pan-Arab position - known as the Arab Peace Initiative - that calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab states. 
President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian leadership regarded the UAE’s move as ""a betrayal"". Veteran Palestinian negotiator Hanan Ashrawi told Reuters the deal was ""a complete sell-out"".
Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, has not directly commented on the normalisation deals, but has said it remains committed to peace on the basis of the Arab Peace Initiative. 
Prince Bandar noted the decades-long support of successive Saudi kings to the Palestinian cause and said the Palestinian people should remember that the kingdom has always been there for them to offer help and advice.
""This low level of discourse is not what we expect from officials who seek to gain global support for their cause,"" he said.
While Saudi Arabia is not expected to follow the example of its Gulf allies any time soon, experts and diplomats believe the kingdom has started shifting the public discourse on Israel.
Prince Bandar's daughter, Princess Reema, is the current Saudi ambassador to the United States.

(Reuters) - Two conservative justices mounted a fresh attack on Monday on the landmark 2015 ruling that legalized gay marriage nationwide even as the U.S. Supreme Court rebuffed a bid by a former Kentucky official to avoid lawsuits over her refusal to grant marriage licenses to two same-sex couples. 
The court turned away an appeal by Kim Davis, who had served as Rowan County clerk, of a lower court ruling that let the lawsuits accusing her of violating the constitutional rights of the couples proceed. 
In an opinion accompanying that action, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote that the same-sex marriage ruling, known as Obergefell v. Hodges, continues to have ""ruinous consequences"" for religious liberty. Thomas and Alito both dissented in the Obergefell ruling. 
""Davis may have been one of the first victims of this court's cavalier treatment of religion in its Obergefell decision, but she will not be the last,"" Thomas wrote. 
Thomas and Alito agreed on technical grounds with the decision to reject the Davis appeal. But Thomas took the opportunity to assert that the Obergefell decision has left ""those with religious objections in the lurch"" and made it easier to label them bigots ""merely for refusing to alter their religious beliefs in the wake of prevailing orthodoxy.""
The court ""has created a problem that only it can fix,"" Thomas added. 
LBGT advocacy groups took those comments as an ominous sign for same-sex marriage and gay rights on a court moving further rightward. 
""These comments made clear that the war on marriage equality, against the lives of same-sex couples, is alive and well,"" said Alphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign LGBT advocacy group. 
If the Senate confirms President Donald Trump's nominee Amy Coney Barrett, a favorite of Christian conservatives, the court would have a 6-3 conservative majority. With Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death and Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement, only three of the justices who comprised the court's 5-4 majority in the Obergefell ruling still serve on the bench. 
Jim Obergefell, a lead plaintiff in the 2015 case, said the opinion by Thomas and Alito signaled that the justices are willing to overturn the right to same-sex marriage.
""It is unthinkable that Alito, Thomas and others on the Supreme Court would want to take away that right and the dignity that comes along with it,"" Obergefell said.
The Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that Davis could be sued in her individual capacity as the former county clerk. It rejected her argument that she is protected by a legal doctrine called qualified immunity, which can shield government officials from liability in certain cases. 
Davis was jailed for five days for defying court orders in the aftermath of the Obergefell decision to issue licenses to same-sex couples. 
The couples - David Ermold and David Moore, and Will Smith and James Yates - sued Davis in 2015, accusing her of violating their constitutional right to marry as recognized in the Obergefell ruling. Both couples received licenses while Davis was jailed. 
In the ruling, the court found that the Constitution's guarantees of due process and equal protection under the law meant states cannot ban same-sex marriages. 
A number of cases have arisen around the country testing the Obergefell decision's scope and the rights of people to object to gay marriage on religious grounds. 

On Nov. 4, the justices are due to hear a religious rights case involving Philadelphia's refusal to place children for foster care with a Catholic agency that bars same-sex couples from serving as foster parents.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. court has ordered the government of Iran to pay more than $1.4 billion in punitive and compensatory damages to the family of a former FBI agent who disappeared during a visit to an Iranian island in March 2007.
In a decision issued late last week, U.S. District Judge Timothy Kelly said that he adopted a special expert's recommendation that Robert Levinson's family be awarded $107 million in compensatory damages. The judge awarded punitive damages of $1.3 billion.
In a statement, Levinson's family welcomed the judge's ruling. 
""This judgment is the first step in the pursuit of justice for Robert Levinson, an American patriot who was kidnapped and subjected to unimaginable suffering for more than 13 years,"" Levinson's family said. 
""Until now, Iran has faced no consequences for its actions. Judge Kelly’s decision won’t bring Bob home, but we hope that it will serve as a warning against further hostage taking by Iran,"" the family said, adding: ""We intend to find any and every avenue, and pursue all options, to seek justice for Robert Levinson."" 
A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier this year, Levinson's family said they believed he died in Iranian custody, based on information from U.S. officials. Iran denied that and said the former FBI agent had left the country ""years ago.""
Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Iran-controlled Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington.
Months after he disappeared, U.S. government sources acknowledged that before his trip, Levinson had maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the Central Intelligence Agency.
A handful of CIA officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal investigation.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The former chief executive of a staffing and information technology services provider was sentenced on Monday to a year of home confinement after admitting he participated in a vast U.S. college admissions and fraud scheme.
Federal prosecutors in Boston say that former ASGN (NYSE:ASGN) Inc CEO Peter Dameris paid $300,000 to bribe a Georgetown University coach to falsely designate his older son as a tennis recruit to secure his admission to the school.
He pleaded guilty in June to conspiracy to commit mail fraud and honest services mail fraud. Prosecutors, rather than seeking prison, agreed to seek only 21 months of home confinement, citing health issues involving his children.
U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns cited those issues in imposing the shorter term. Dameris' younger son has been treated for leukemia and his oldest child, the one who attended Georgetown, had brain surgery in high school to treat a tumor.
Stearns also ordered Dameris, 60, to pay a $95,000 fine. During a virtual hearing, Dameris, of Pacific Palisades, California, said he was pained that ""my actions may have caused anyone to have further distrust of the admissions process.""
Dameris is among 58 people who have been charged in the scandal, in which prosecutors said parents conspired with California college admissions consultant William ""Rick"" Singer to secure their children's college admissions.
The parents include ""Desperate Housewives"" star Felicity Huffman, who received a 14-day prison sentence, and ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin, who was sentenced to two months in prison.
Several college sports coaches have also faced charges, including former Georgetown tennis coach Gordon Ernst, who prosecutors said accepted bribes from Singer to facilitate the admission of students as purported tennis recruits.
Prosecutors said Dameris agreed from 2015 to 2016 to pay Singer $300,000 to bribe Ernst to designate his older son as a recruit.

The ministries of defence, territorial administration, security and national reconciliation will be headed by military personnel, as Mali begins an 18-month transition back to civilian rule, the presidency said in an announcement read out on state television. Civilians will hold 21 other posts.
It is not rare for military personnel to hold government posts in Mali, and they did so also under Keita, but the issue has become more sensitive since the coup, when West Africa’s regional bloc pushed for a purely civilian leadership in Bamako. 
The appointments follow the announcement last month of retired colonel Bah Ndaw as interim president and colonel Assimi Goita, who led the coup, as vice president. Veteran diplomat Moctar Ouane has been named interim prime minister.
Malian officials hope that the resumption of a functioning government will persuade Mali's neighbours to lift sanctions imposed since the coup that have crippled the agricultural, landlocked economy, which relies heavily on imports. 
It is not yet clear if and when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) will decide to lift the sanctions. 
As well as fearing that the coup could undermine their own power, presidents in the wider Sahel region are concerned that prolonged uncertainty could jeopardise a joint campaign against Islamist militants centred in northern and central Mali. 
A previous coup in Mali in 2012 helped hasten the fall of the desert north to al Qaeda-linked militants. A French intervention the following year drove them back, but jihadist attacks have risen again in recent years and spilled over into neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - Lithuania and Poland have decided to recall their ambassadors to Belarus for consultations in the hope of reducing regional tensions, the Lithuanian foreign minister said on Monday, days after they dismissed a demand from Minsk that they do so.
Belarus accuses the two neighbouring countries of meddling in its affairs by hosting exiled opposition leaders and refusing to recognise the victory of veteran leader Alexander Lukashenko in a disupted Aug. 9 presidential election.
Lukashenko's opponents accuse him of rigging the vote, which he denies. The former Soviet republic has been rocked by weeks of protests that have drawn a violent crackdown, prompting the United States and European Union to impose sanctions on Minsk.
""With the Belarusian side we have agreed that a temporary recall of the ambassadors (of Lithuania and Poland) for consultations would serve to reduce tensions and help maintain diplomatic representation at ambassadorial level"", Lithuanian Foreign Minister Linas Linkevicius said in a statement.
The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, and German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas were both consulted before the move, the ministry said.
Belarus recalled its ambassadors from Poland and Lithuania on Friday for consultations and asked the two EU member states also to cut staff at their embassies in Minsk. 

Lithuania said on Friday that neither it nor Poland would cut the embassy staff or recall their ambassadors.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Azerbaijan and Armenia accused each other on Monday of attacking civilian areas and said the death toll was rising from the deadliest fighting in the South Caucasus for more than 25 years.
NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg added his voice to calls for an immediate end to the clashes over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountain enclave that belongs to Azerbaijan under international law but is populated and governed by ethnic Armenians. [nL8N2GW3F5]
But prospects for a ceasefire appeared remote after fighting intensified at the weekend, with hundreds killed in clashes involving artillery, tanks and fighter planes since Sept. 27.
Azerbaijan said Azeri cities outside Nagorno-Karabakh had been struck, taking the fighting closer to territory from which pipelines carry Azeri gas and oil to Europe. 
In an interview shown on Monday by Turkey's state broadcaster, Azeri President Ilham Aliyev said Armenia must withdraw its troops from Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azeri territories for military action to stop.
""We don't have eyes on any other country's lands, but what is ours should be ours,"" he said, echoing comments he made in an address to the nation on Sunday. [nL8N2GW3GR]
Aliyev has ignored a ceasefire appeal by the United States, Russia and France, who have led mediation efforts in the intermittent conflict since the 1990s, and said in Monday's interview that any peacemaking must involve Turkey.
""Turkey must definitely be in any upcoming peace process. A peace process will surely be started. Clashes cannot go on forever, so the sooner the better,"" he said.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan showed no sign of backing down. In comments on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday, he called on servicemen demobilised last year to volunteer to fight. 
""I want to invite those people and tell them they are ... going to fight a war of survival for their fatherland,"" he said.
""NO MILITARY SOLUTION""
The fighting has increased international concern that other regional powers could be dragged into the conflict - Turkey has expressed solidarity with Azerbaijan while Armenia has a defence pact with Russia.
""There is no military solution,"" NATO's Stoltenberg said during a visit to Turkey, calling for a ceasefire.
The European Union appealed for a ceasefire last week and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Monday he had asked his foreign minister to travel to Europe to meet with allies to discuss developments in Nagorno-Karabakh.
On Monday, Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces carried out rocket strikes on its main administrative centre, Stepanakert, while Azerbaijan said Armenia fired missiles at several towns outside the breakaway enclave.
Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said 21 more servicemen had been killed, bringing its total military death toll to 223 since the fighting began. It also said 19 civilians had been killed.
""Stubborn battles are going on along the contact line between Nagorno-Karabakh and Azerbaijan,"" Artsrun Hovhannisyan, an Armenian defence ministry official. 
The Azeri prosecutor's office said 25 civilians and been killed and 127 wounded since fighting began. Azerbaijan has not provided details of military casualties.
Azerbaijan says its forces have made gains. A spokesman for Nagorno-Karabakh said the enclave's forces had retreated for tactical reasons to limit losses and inflict more damage on Azeri forces. Hovhannisyan said Azeri advances has been halted.
The clashes are the worst since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed, and are spreading beyond the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave itself. 
""The fighting has essentially put to bed the prospect of any near-term resolution to the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh,"" said analysts Alexander Stronell and Yohann Michel of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) in London.

Muscat stepped down as prime minister in January following allegations of government corruption made by activists and the political opposition who said he had protected people linked to the 2017 murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Muscat always denied wrongdoing and was never charged or convicted.
He became the leader of the Labour Party in 2008 and led it to a landslide victory in 2013, when he became prime minister.
Muscat won another landslide in 2017, riding an economic boom that saw Malta turn a budget deficit into a surplus and almost eliminate unemployment.
He was succeeded this year as party leader and prime minister by Robert Abela.
Muscat's resignation from parliament comes weeks after his former chief of staff, Keith Schembri, was briefly arrested in connection with a police investigation into alleged money laundering from the sale of Maltese passports. Schembri denies wrongdoing and has not been formally charged. 

Muscat also served in the European Parliament between 2004 and 2008.

BERLIN (Reuters) - European Union sanctions against 40 officials in Belarus are ""a small victory"" but should be widened, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said on Monday, adding she would press Germany's Angela Merkel to do more at a meeting on Tuesday.
Tsikhanouskaya fled her homeland for Lithuania amid a police crackdown in Belarus following an Aug. 9 presidential election, which official results said incumbent Alexander Lukashenko won, but which Tsikhanouskaya's supporters say was rigged.
Lukashenko denies doctoring the election result. EU leaders agreed last Friday to impose sanctions on 40 individuals including Belarus' interior minister and the head of its electoral commission.
""It's a victory but it's a small victory, and I'm sure - and I insist - that this list should be widened,"" Tsikhanouskaya said of the sanctions in an interview with Reuters ahead of a meeting with Merkel in Berlin on Tuesday.
She expected the encounter to be ""a warm conversation between two women - one of which needs help for my country, and one of which I'm sure is eager to help us,"" she said, speaking English. 
""I have some proposals of help from her side and I think we will discuss them,"" she added, without giving details. ""Germany does a lot, but I'm sure it can do more"".
Merkel, who said after the Aug. 9 election that it was neither free nor fair and Germany could not accept its result, has ruled herself out as a mediator, as she said Lukashenko had refused her requests for a phone call.
Tsikhanouskaya, who met French President Emmanuel Macron last week, was confident Lukashenko ""will step away"" and that new elections, ""fair and transparent"", would follow.
The two-month-old crisis has pushed Lukashenko back towards traditional ally Russia, which has propped up Belarus with loans and an offer of military support. Both have accused the West of meddling in Belarus.
The West has had to balance its sympathy for the pro-democracy movement with its reluctance to provoke Moscow.
Police in Belarus detained 317 people during protests in Minsk and across the country on Sunday, the Interior Ministry said on Monday.

Tsikhanouskaya said of the protesters: ""It's not safe, but they do this because they know what they are fighting for, what they are demonstrating for, and this matters.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Four people have died and up to 18 more are missing in floods and heavy rain in south-eastern France, local authorities said on Monday. 
Over the weekend, southern France was lashed by torrential rain and swollen rivers have swept away houses, bridges and parts of roads.
A spokeswoman for the Alpes Maritimes prefecture told Reuters that eight people were missing and about 10 more may be missing but she gave no further details. 
Authorities cannot give a more precise estimate for the death toll from the flooding as emergency services struggle to reach flood-hit villages as many roads have been washed away or are still blocked by debris. 
Over the weekend Storm Alex caused widespread damage in several villages around Nice on the French Riviera in what the city's mayor Christian Estrosi called the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century. 
Meteo France registered rainfall of 500 mm (19.69 inches) of rain over 24 hours in Saint-Martin-Vesubie on Saturday and close to 400 mm in several other towns - the equivalent of more than three months of rain at this time of the year.
French daily Ouest France on Monday reported that three bodies had been found, one in Saint-Martin-Vesubie - where one had been discovered earlier - one in Lantosque and one in Colomars.
Among those missing is a couple in their eighties who are believed to have still been in their house in the village of Roquebilliere as the surging Vesubie river engulfed it. Footage of the house collapsing into the river has dominated French TV news coverage of the flooding over the weekend. 
The couple's son told Nice-Matin newspaper that contrary to some media reports, his parents had not refused to leave the house, but that helicopters could not reach them because of high winds. 

""My parents are reported missing, but I know it is over. They are dead. I understood this when I received confirmation that they were in the house until the last moment. They departed together after a long and loving life, that is what I tell myself to soften the pain,"" Eric Borello told the paper.

The procedural decision is the latest development in a years-long case which saw the divisive former president detained in August.
Uribe and several allies are being investigated over allegations of witness tampering in an attempt to discredit accusations he had ties to right-wing paramilitaries. 
Uribe's lawyer had asked a judge to free him while the case continues, but the judge said last month she could not rule on the motion until the Supreme Court, which was previously in charge of the case, determined whether she had authority in the decision.
""The Supreme Court ratifies the power of Guarantees Judge #30 to resolve the request for liberty of ex-senator Alvaro Uribe Velez,"" the court said in a post on Twitter.
Uribe, a mentor to current President Ivan Duque, has insisted he is innocent. 
He resigned his senate seat after the house arrest order, leading the court to transfer the case to the attorney general's office, which critics say will be less rigorous. 
In 2012, Uribe accused leftist Senator Ivan Cepeda of orchestrating a plot to tie him to right-wing paramilitary groups.

But in 2018, the Supreme Court said Cepeda had collected information from former fighters as part of his work and had not paid or pressured former paramilitaries. Instead the court said it was Uribe and his allies who pressured witnesses.

Kurdish fighters have seized much of northern and eastern Syria from Islamic State with U.S. backing. They have since held thousands of militants in prisons, while their wives and children - numbering tens of thousands, many of them foreigners - are living in camps.
Al-Hol camp alone houses nearly 65,000 people, including about 28,000 Syrians, 30,000 Iraqis and some 10,000 other foreigners of many nationalities, according to U.N. estimates.
""A decision will be issued to empty the Syrians from the camp completely,"" said Kurdish leader Ilham Ahmed in a video published by the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led SDF forces holding the region.
""Those who want to remain in the camp, this would not be the responsibility of the administration.""
UNICEF said in August eight children had died in al-Hol, where it said children from 60 countries were languishing and COVID-19 infections among camp workers had worsened conditions. 
Badran Jia Kurd, a vice president of the Kurdish-led authority that runs the SDF region, said some Syrians had already left the camp and that the process would be sped up. 
He cited a need to reduce the burden on the camp and step up measures to curb security incidents which he said had risen. 
SECURITY THREAT
Kurdish leaders have repeatedly warned that the Islamic State fighters and their families pose a security threat and that they cannot detain the foreigners indefinitely, but foreign governments have hesitated to repatriate their citizens.
The United States said last week all known Americans allegedly supporting Islamic State and being held in Syria had been returned, some to face criminal charges. It urged European countries to account for their citizens.
Jia Kurd said that of the estimated 28,000 Syrians in the al-Hol camp, about 15,000 were from the mainly Arab areas of Raqqa and Deir al-Zor, which the SDF captured from Islamic State, and would be able to return if they chose to.

Many of the rest may not be able to leave if they have nowhere to go or do not want to return to territory under Syrian state rule, he added.

Delphine of Saxe-Cobourg was granted the title as a result of a court ruling on Oct. 1 after a DNA test showed the former monarch was her father, her lawyers said last week. She changed her surname from Boel to Saxe-Cobourg, her father's family name.
""If I had done this for the title, the money, all that I would have lost,"" she told reporters during her first news conference as a royal in Brussels. ""I'm still going to be Delphine, I'm not going to be hanging out in the streets and say please call me princess.""
Delphine said she felt at peace and was relieved to have her life story made public. Albert, who abdicated six years ago in favour of his son Philippe, had long contested her claim.
The royal court has not commented on last week's ruling although the former king had previously said he would not oppose court decisions that legally make Delphine his daughter.
However, she said her father and siblings, including King Philippe, refused to communicate with her. The lack of communication from her new family was hardest to understand for her and her two children, she said.
""I'm not expecting anything I'm just going to carry on with my work,"" Delphine said. ""However if suddenly they showed signs of life I would never turn my back to them.""

RAWABI, West Bank (Reuters) - A top Palestinian business executive said on Monday that new Gulf Arab ties with Israel, condemned by Palestinian leaders, could also be an opportunity to apply fresh pressure to halt Jewish settlement in occupied land.
Bashar Masri, a Palestinian-American who runs two of the Palestinians' largest holding companies, said the Palestinians must find a way to turn agreements Israel struck last month with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain into ""a positive thing for us"".
Under the U.S.-brokered diplomatic push, Israel agreed to suspend plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank.
Palestinian leaders have called Arab agreements to normalise relations with Israel a blow to their quest for an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem, territory Israel captured in a 1967 war.
Masri, 59, said the Palestinian message to the UAE and Bahrain should now be: ""Hey, why don't you pressure Israel, who you're talking to, to stop the settlements?"".
""I hope they can turn these agreements to pressure Israel into concessions for the Palestinians,"" he said. 
But Masri, chairman of Massar International, told Reuters he was uncertain that halting settlement expansion in the West Bank would be a priority for Gulf Arab states that agreed to official ties with Israel in part over shared concern over Iran.
Most countries view the settlements that Israel has built on occupied land as illegal. Israel disputes this.
Israel has hailed ties with the UAE and Bahrain as a major business opportunity, and Masri said Palestinian enterprises would not be inherently opposed to accepting investment from the two Gulf nations.
Massar International oversees and manages more than 30 subsidiaries and investments in finance, tech, agriculture, media and real estate, including Rawabi, the first planned Palestinian city in the West Bank. 
Masri said that now that emotions over the deals have calmed down - ""we burned the flags"" - Palestinians have ""no choice but to be optimistic"".

""Our enemies want us to give up hope. If we give up hope, they have exactly what they want, and there will be no Palestine, and no Palestinian people,"" he said.

Cisse, a popular politician who served as finance minister from 1993 to 2000, was kidnapped by gunmen while campaigning in the northern region of Timbuktu in March, while Petronin, who ran a charity for malnourished and orphaned children, was abducted near the northern city of Gao in late 2016. 
They are two high-profile examples of Mali's deepening security crisis caused by the persistent presence of jihadist groups bent on overthrowing state authority, despite the intervention of thousands of international troops and the arrest of scores of suspected insurgents. 
Multiple planeloads of prisoners have been flown to the town of Tessalit in northeast Mali, one regional and one Mali-based source said on condition of anonymity.
The release of Petronin and Cisse was secured when authorities agreed to free a large number of detained suspected militants, the sources said. It was not clear how many prisoners are set to be released, but one plane brought 70 to Tessalit on Sunday, the Mali-based source said.
Authorities were not available for comment in Mali, where groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State stage frequent deadly attacks on civilian and military targets in central and northern regions, and use the area as a base from which to carry out strikes in neighbouring Niger and Burkina Faso. 
A military coup that overthrew President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita in August has magnified concerns among regional leaders about the spread of violence in West Africa's Sahel region.

France's foreign ministry declined to comment on Monday. Representatives for the hostages could not be reached to confirm if they had been freed.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - New Green leader Annamie Paul, the first Black person to head a mainstream Canadian federal party, on Monday said her victory was a sign that politics could become more inclusive.
Paul, a 47-year-old Toronto lawyer, beat seven other contenders to win the leadership of the party late on Saturday.
""It is highly symbolic and highly important that I sit here today,"" she told a news conference in Ottawa. 
""What I bring is hope to all the people who have not seen themselves represented in politics to this point, hope it's possible we can have a more inclusive style of politics.""
Paul is the second person of color to head a federal party in Canada after Jagmeet Singh took over the left-leaning New Democrats in 2017.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has frequently said there is a need to address what he calls systemic racism in Canada.
Paul faces several challenges. The Greens have only three legislators in the 338-seat House of Commons and she herself is not a member of Parliament.
Paul will contest a special election in the parliamentary constituency of Toronto Centre later this month but that seat is likely to be retained by the ruling Liberals. She came in a distant fourth in a bid for the same seat in a federal election last year.
The Liberals, who have only a minority of seats in the House of Commons and rely on the support of other parties, look set to govern with the New Democrats and therefore do need the backing of the Greens.
Paul said Canada faced two great challenges: the coronavirus pandemic and global warming.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Right to work from home splits German coalition parties,"BERLIN (Reuters) - An initiative from Germany's Social Democrat labour minister to give people the right to work from home is facing opposition from Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives and business groups, though a survey shows most workers like the idea.
The coronavirus pandemic has interrupted work flows in many companies in Europe's largest economy, accelerating a trend to work partly from home and speeding up the digitisation of business organisation and communication.
But it has also created new problems such as working longer hours without getting credit for it and pushing up stress levels, especially among parents juggling childcare and working from home.
Hubertus Heil from the co-governing, centre-left SPD told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday that his draft law would give employees the right to work from home or somewhere else at least 24 days per year if the profession and work flows allow.
With the draft law, Heil wants to increase job satisfaction among employees and avoid home working automatically leading to longer working hours.
So employers must ensure that employees record their entire working time at home, or else face a fine of up to 30,000 euros.
In addition, accidents that happen while working from home should be regarded as work accidents which means the employer's insurance must fully cover the costs.
A survey conducted by several economic institutes showed that roughly two thirds of German employees welcome the proposal for such a legal right.
But a spokeswoman of Economy Minister Peter Altmaier from Merkel's conservatives said during a regular news conference that there were many unanswered questions and that Altmaier remained sceptical of the idea.
""Above all, we need less bureaucracy and not new state guarantees for everything,"" the spokeswoman cited Altmaier as saying.
Merkel's spokesman said the draft law would now be discussed between the labour ministry and the chancellery, adding that there were still a lot of issues to be resolved.
The VDMA engineering association said there was no need for a legal right to work from home.

""It only raises hopes that cannot be fulfilled in every case,"" VDMA managing director Thilo Brodtmann said.

YANGON (Reuters) - As surging coronavirus infections make election canvassing difficult in Myanmar, humble trishaw drivers are becoming unlikely champions for a nationwide ballot just a few weeks away.
Lockdowns have put the brakes on election activities, with parties focusing efforts on social media and trishaw drivers who spread the message on the street, festooning their bicycles and passenger seats with party flags, umbrellas and logos.
""It's like we are doing an election campaign on their behalf,"" said by Zaw Min, a trishaw driver kitted out in the red attire of the incumbent National League for Democracy (NLD) party.
""I hope our activity will be effective for the candidates.""
A handful of the three-wheeled passenger bikes popular in Myanmar's biggest city of Yangon displayed the colours of opposition parties running against the NLD.
Myanmar's COVID-19 infections have grown rapidly from a few hundred in mid-August to more than 18,781 and 444 deaths as of Monday, when 987 new cases and 32 fatalities were reported.
With authorities piling resources into fighting the virus, there are doubts about the viability of the Nov. 8 poll, which Myanmar's de-facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi last week said must go ahead and is ""more important than COVID"". 
The main challenger to Suu Kyi's NLD, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, and 23 other opposition parties have called for a postponement. 
The legislature's term ends on Jan. 31, but if no parliamentary election is held before then, a constitutional crisis is a possibility.
With social restrictions increasing, the trishaw's role in Myanmar goes beyond public transportation. 

""It is not an election rally, it is just to show our support,"" said driver Zaw Ko, who supports the NLD. ""Now the election gets closer even with these virus restrictions, I hope our activities can help our favourite party.""

The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it had received a request from Moscow on Oct. 1 for help in the case of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and was seeking clarification on what type of assistance Russia wanted.
Navalny fell ill on a flight in Siberia on Aug. 20 and was flown to Germany for treatment. German doctors say blood tests show he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. The OPCW has collected its own samples to test at Germany's request. 
Russia has said it has seen no evidence Navalny was poisoned, and denies any role in any attack.
The OPCW said in a statement on Monday its ""Technical Secretariat is ready to provide the requested expertise and that a team of experts could be deployed on short notice.""
The Navalny case is expected to be discussed on the sidelines of a conference of member states at the OPCW starting on Tuesday.

Russia has in the past threatened to quit the agency, which was established to enforce the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention. Moscow has accused it of pro-Western bias over its work in Syria, where Russia provides military backing to the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - When state workers accompanied by police painted over opposition graffiti on a wall in a Minsk courtyard in August, local residents swiftly painted it back.
The mural of two DJs who took part in protests against President Alexander Lukashenko has been erased and repainted more than a dozen times since then, a potent symbol of resistance that persists two months after a disputed Aug. 9 election.
It has become the centrepiece of what some local residents call the ""Square of Change"" and a microcosm of what they see as a grassroots struggle to force Lukashenko from power.
""It's become a symbol not only of our courtyard but of our entire country,"" said Nadezhda, 32, a programmer on maternity leave who lives nearby. She did not give her surname out of fear of reprisals as police continue to clash with protesters and arrest hundreds.
""If we abandoned it now it would be an admission we were in the wrong, that we should stop our protests...""
Lukashenko has said he won the election fairly and that anyone being jailed has broken the law. He has accused the West of organising the protests.
The standoff has changed the social fabric of the neighbourhood around the square and created a community of opposition-minded people, even as the leader of 26 years clings to power.
Largely strangers to each other until the protests broke out over the election, residents started to drape red and white opposition flags from their windows, chant ""Long Live Belarus!"" and play upbeat music from their parked cars.
The once-drab courtyard is now decorated with ribbons and balloons and has become a nightly venue for guitar-led, floodlit opposition concerts, tea parties and ""bachata"" dancing. People join in from neighbouring districts.
The two DJs featured in the mural gained cult status among Lukashenko's critics when they played ""I want changes!"" - a rock anthem of the Soviet ""perestroika"" period in the 1980s - at a pro-government rally. They were jailed for 10 days.
""We know they can come knocking at the door any moment,"" said Nadezhda. ""And it's impossible to live like that. Which means we have no choice but to go to the very end.""
One resident, Stepan Latypov, was arrested on Sept. 15 as he stood in front of the mural with several others to stop it being painted over.
He is being held on suspicion of involvement in mass protests and was accused on state television of planning to poison the police. His lawyer, Ilya Perkhalsky, said he was unable to comment on case details for legal reasons.
The Interior Ministry referred Reuters questions about Latypov and the courtyard protests to Minsk police. They could not immediately be reached for comment.
The political crisis is at an impasse, with protesters regularly coming out in large numbers even after Lukashenko was sworn in for a new term in a secretive ceremony. Many of his most prominent opponents have been jailed or fled.

""By now, no one is carrying placards with (exiled opposition leader Sviatlana) Tsikhanouskaya's name,"" said Yulia, 39. ""That is behind us. We are standing up for freedom. We want us and our children to live peacefully and there is no peace.""

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani police filed sedition charges on Monday against former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and dozens of his party leaders over comments he made criticising the interference of the military in national politics.
Last month, Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League and eight other opposition parties came together to accuse the military of meddling in politics and of rigging elections in 2018 that brought Prime Minister Imran Khan to power.
Sharif left Pakistan last November to get medical treatment after being granted bail from a seven-year jail sentence for corruption, though his daughter remains in the country. Sharif, a long-standing critic of the military, denies the corruption charges.
""We will ensure a court trial against the accused,"" government official Musarrat Cheema told Reuters regarding the sedition charges. 
In his recent speeches via video links from his London home, Sharif has said the interference of the military in politics was the root cause of all Pakistan's problems.
The sedition case filed against Sharif, his daughter and 44 top party leaders says he has sought in his speeches to isolate Pakistan internationally and have it declared a rogue state.
""Convict Nawaz Sharif has been openly inciting the public to commit treason,"" said the case, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, adding that it was aimed at maligning the armed forces and the judiciary.
The military, which has ruled Pakistan for half of its history since independence in 1947, denies meddling in politics or electoral wrongdoing. 
The opposition parties have formed a new alliance, known as the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), and announced a campaign of nationwide protests to dislodge Khan's government, saying it has been a failure on all fronts.
Sharif's close aide Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the sedition charges would not deter the opposition's campaign. 
""Arrest us, we're ready for that,"" he said. 

Sharif's third term as prime minister ran from 2013 to 2017, when he was removed by the Supreme Court amid revelations over his personal wealth, which he blames on the army generals after he fell out with them over the handling of Islamist militants.

Mourao said in a radio interview with Grupo Estado that Brazil should map the resources of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest by allowing exploration in order to draw private investment. But he said regulation was necessary to set environmental rules.
The vice president said the government's operations to monitor and control fires in the Amazon rainforest will be extended until the end of 2022.
Brazil is facing international criticism for the worst fires in a decade in the Amazon and other parts of Brazil, such as the Pantanal wetlands where much wildlife has been killed. 
Fires last month burnt recently deforested areas as well as virgin forest, a worrying trend that suggests the rainforest is becoming drier and more prone to fire. Fires are used by ranchers to clear land for new pastures.

In a response to a question, Mourao said he was unaware of discussions to merge the agriculture and environment ministries and dismissed criticism of the farm lobby. He said agribusiness was the most interested in protecting the environment.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - A drastic rise in COVID-19 infections has pushed Lebanon's hospitals to the edge, and experts warn they will soon be unable to cope as the country buckles under a succession of devastating crises.
Lebanon's healthcare system was already struggling before several hospitals were badly damaged by a massive explosion at the port of Beirut in early August. 
Now medical supplies are dwindling thanks to a shortage of dollars due to an ongoing financial crisis, doctors are emigrating in droves, and fears are growing that subsidies on medicines might soon be lifted.
""At the moment, COVID-19 in Lebanon is not under control,"" said Firass Abiad, who runs Beirut's Rafik Hariri University hospital, the largest coronavirus facility in the country. ""We are seeing a high positivity rate relative to testing.""
Lebanon registered a record 1,321 new daily infections over the weekend, bringing its cumulative total to more than 43,000 cases while the death toll stands at 398. 
The numbers are low by global standards, but intensive care units have reached a critical 82% of capacity, according to the World Health Organization. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread in Lebanon's overcrowded prisons, public hospitals and densely packed cities, where mask-wearing remains lax.
""If we continue with this exponential growth, I don't think we'll last more than a couple of weeks,"" said Dr Eveline Hitti, chair of the emergency department at the American University in Beirut's Medical Center.
Lebanon was praised for containing the spread early in the pandemic, averaging fewer than 100 daily cases until August. But as the country's woes began to multiply, concerns over the coronavirus took a backseat.
MELTDOWN
Lebanon is facing its worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. Its banking system has been paralysed since last year, its currency has crashed by 80%, and banks have severely restricted withdrawals. The financial meltdown was compounded by the explosion on Aug. 4 that wrecked a swathe of Beirut, killing nearly 200 people and damaging several hospitals.
The government has for years owed hospitals millions of dollars in arrears. Their unpaid bills are mounting. Doctors told Reuters that patients at some hospitals were struggling to pay bills as low as 50,000 Lebanese pounds – $6.25 at Monday's street rate.
Some hospitals have doubled prices to keep up with hyperinflation, while others have furloughed staff. ""It's not for profiteering reasons,"" Hitti said. ""It's a matter of survival.""
The COVID-19 spike began in June, after the airport reopened. But the port explosion made matters worse as thousands of people swarmed the devastated streets and hospitals, abandoning coronavirus precautions. 
The government reimposed a partial lockdown at the end of August, but it was only loosely observed by most Lebanese, exhausted by trying to survive in a country already on its knees. Restaurants, bars and shops are open.
""My children are going to go hungry if I close my shop or ask every customer who comes through my doors to wear a mask,"" said 47-year-old Mohammad Dagher outside his Beirut tyre shop.
The government imposed local lockdowns on Sunday in 112 municipalities, but whether these will be effective remains to be seen, as faith in the state continues to dwindle. 
For the country's most vulnerable, the malaise could turn into a death sentence.
Malak Samara, 34, has two sons in one of Lebanon's overcrowded prisons, where infections are beginning to spike. 

""I'm afraid I'm going to have to carry them out of the prison dead,"" she said. ""Have some mercy on us mothers.""

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's parliament passed into law President Joko Widodo's flagship ""Job Creation"" bill on Monday that aims to boost investment in Southeast Asia's biggest economy, but critics ranging from unions to environmental groups pledged protests. 
Seven parties backed the bill, while two voted against the legislation that the government says is needed to streamline complicated regulations hampering business and investment.
Global investors have been watching closely the bill's progress, particularly regarding controversial changes proposed to the 2003 labour law, citing a need for Indonesia to compete better for manufacturing relocating from China.
The new law would ensure the ""state's presence"" in the relationship between employers and workers, Airlangga Hartarto, chief economics minister, told parliament on Monday.
The bill will cut mandatory severance benefits paid by employers to 19 times monthly wages from 32 times now, in line with government proposals, a draft seen by Reuters showed. The state will also pay six months worth of wages to the person concerned.
""In net terms, the passage of the bill should be seen as a positive development.... (but) any positive payback from the adoption of such laws will take time to be felt,"" OCBC Bank economist Wellian Wiranto said, noting that despite the cut, severance payments still remain above some regional competitors.
A coalition of 15 activist groups, including trade unions, earlier condemned the bill and called on workers to join a planned national strike on Oct. 6-8.
Yusri Yunus, a spokesman for Jakarta Police, said that a permit for the protest had not been approved and due to the COVID-19 situation ""we advise all of them not to demonstrate"". 
NATIONAL STRIKE
While recent rallies against the bill have been relatively small, some vowed to press on with protests.
""We will continue to strike nationwide,"" said Nining Elitos, chairwoman of the labour group KASBI.
Ahmad Jumali, chairman of the Tanggerang chapter of the Federation of Metal Workers (FSPMI), also said workers planned to shut down production to protest the law. 
Workers opposing the bill argue that the legislation would be a ""red carpet for investors, widening the power of the oligarchy"" that will not only hurt labour protection but also taking land from farmers and indigenous communities.
The so-called ""omnibus"" bill, aimed at revising over 70 existing laws in a single vote, intends to speed up the pace of economic reform and improve the country's investment climate.
But there have been concerns about the threat to the environment in a country with one of the fastest rates of forest destruction in the world.
The new law means that environmental studies are only required for investments considered high risk.
Separately on Monday, 35 investors who manage $4.1 trillion in assets wrote to the Indonesian government raising environmental concerns over the bill. 

""We fear that proposed changes to the permitting framework, environmental compliance monitoring, public consultation and sanctioning systems will have severe... repercussions that... could impact the attractiveness of Indonesian markets,"" the letter read.

Tracie's Place Karaoke Bar and Restaurant in Hamilton, Ontario, 70 km south of Toronto, closed during the COVID-19 pandemic in March. It reopened three months ago amid strict protocols set out by the government for how they could operate.
The province of Ontario ordered most businesses to close in March, reopening in stages beginning in June. Karaoke bars were among the last businesses permitted to reopen, due to the possibility of spreading the virus through droplets while singing.
Owner Tracie England's solution? Installing a cubicle made of clear plastic shower curtains on stage.
""Doing it in the shower is a great way to stay sanitized and keep everything clean,"" she said.
Normally she has to rush people along because there is such high demand to get behind the mic. Now she plays a song between each singer, giving her a chance to clean down the shower stall. Shower curtains also separate the tables.
""Everything's been fabulous so far,"" England said.
The change appears to be going over well with customers so far. On a recent Friday night, Tracie's Place was at capacity.

MADRID (Reuters) - Madrid residents were largely going about business as usual on Monday despite a prohibition on non-essential travel in the first European capital to return to lockdown due to the resurgent coronavirus. 
Local police said 300 officers were manning 60 checkpoints, but commuters were pouring into the Spanish capital as normal and few had noticed extra controls. 
With 850 COVID-19 infections per 100,000 people, the Madrid area has Europe's highest rate, so 4.8 million people in the Spanish capital and nine satellite towns came under new lockdown measures from Friday night.
""I haven't seen any police controls. I don't quite understand this situation that they have created,"" said nutrition student Cristina Canete.
Worried about further economic damage, the conservative-led regional authority only reluctantly agreed to the new measures on orders of the socialist-led national government. 
It has launched a legal challenge. 
'NO CHANGE'
Another student, Ines Torres, said she had seen little evidence of checkpoints around the Moncloa neighbourhood, which is home to Madrid's biggest university and one of the main intercity bus terminals. 
""I live here and I haven't noticed any change, nothing,"" she said.
Under the new rules, residents can only cross city boundaries for work, school, health or shopping. Bars and restaurants must close at 11 p.m. instead of 1 a.m, while gatherings of more than six people remain banned.
The government has warned of fines for transgressors and some ""Madrilenos"" cancelled weekend leisure or family plans.
With contagion rates rising too in several other regions, authorities were imposing the same restrictions on some other places, including in parts of northern Castile Leon region.

Ethiopia is locked in a dispute with Egypt and Sudan over its $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Cairo has said could threaten its main supply of water.
""All flights have been banned to secure the dam,"" the director-general of the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority, Wesenyeleh Hunegnaw, told Reuters by phone. He declined to give more details on the reasons.

The structure is about 15 km (9 miles) from the Ethiopian border with Sudan on the Blue Nile - a tributary of the Nile river, which gives Egypt’s 100 million people about 90% of their fresh water.

Vorayuth Yoovidhya, whose whereabouts are unknown, was accused of crashing his Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) into a policeman in 2012 and dragging his body at high speed before fleeing the scene.
The issue has generated big interest in Thailand, amid simmering outrage about perceived impunity for the wealthy and connected.
Police spokesman Kissana Phathanacharoen said Interpol issued the notice last week after a Thai court in August approved an arrest warrant for reckless driving causing death and a new charge of drug use.
He said Interpol's members would help establish his whereabouts, ""so that he can be formally extradited back to us for further legal action"".
Vorayuth missed eight court summonses before authorities sought his arrest in 2017. He later disappeared and in July this year, anger erupted on social media when news broke that his case had been dropped, sparking calls for a boycott of Red Bull products. 
Vorayuth is a grandson of the late Chaleo Yoovidhya, who created the energy drink Krating Daeng, or Red Bull, and co-founded the international Red Bull GmbH brand with an Austrian partner. 
The new warrant followed a review of evidence previously not included in police reports, which suggested Vorayuth's car was travelling faster than previously thought, and that the suspect's blood test indicated cocaine use. 
Neither Vorayuth nor the immediate Yoovidhya family have commented on the charges. 
TCP Group, which owns the Thai Red Bull brand, said in July it is run by Vorayuth's uncle and not directly associated with Vorayuth, whose father has part ownership in the international brand.

LAREDO, Texas - Former U.S. Border Patrol agent Daniel Perales spent hours over the years crouched at the mouth of the Zacata Creek, a tributary of the Rio Grande, listening for the snap of carrizo cane as border crossers from Mexico arrived on the northern banks.
These days, he listens for the whistle of the Morelet's seedeater, a bird rare in these parts, and frets about the proposed construction of a border wall here.
""It would fragment the habitat of the birds, especially those that live along the river,"" said Perales, who spent nearly 30 years with the federal agency and oversaw 400 agents at the Laredo North Station before retiring in 2007.
Perales said he voted for President Donald Trump in 2016 and plans to do so again. But that hasn't stopped him from joining the ranks of residents in Laredo opposed to building a barrier here as part of Trump's promised wall spanning the U.S.-Mexico border.
""It's not necessary. You don't need a wall here,"" said Perales, adding that cameras and patrol roads were sufficient. 
Less than a month before the U.S. presidential election, resistance to the wall, a centerpiece of Trump's 2016 campaign, is flaring across parts of the approximately 2,000-mile border. Near construction sites in Arizona and California in recent weeks, members of Native American tribes have clashed with law enforcement and others over plans for building on lands the tribes consider sacred. Two weeks ago in front of a Laredo courthouse, military veterans against the border project mobilized to thwart a caravan of Trump supporters who had sought to drive over a 30-foot ""Defund the Wall"" street mural.
Amid an election upended by Trump's positive coronavirus diagnosis, the future of the wall hangs in the balance. Trump's Democratic challenger, former vice president Joe Biden, has said he would not build ""another foot of wall"" if elected.
Meanwhile, opposition to plans for a stretch of wall in the counties of Zapata and Webb, which includes Laredo, has united some strange bedfellows: the street artists, multimillionaire Republicans, Catholic nuns, military and border patrol veterans, conservationists and a local Native American tribe. 
In Webb County, CBP has issued contracts worth $1.05 billion to three construction companies to build approximately 69 miles of a 30-foot steel bollard wall, as well as construct roads and adding cameras and other surveillance technology.
Construction is slated to begin as early as January depending on the availability of land. 
In an August press release, CBP officials said the Laredo wall is necessary to ""impede and deny illegal border crossings and the drug and human smuggling activities of transnational criminal organizations."" In the Laredo sector, traffic has not abated during the coronavirus pandemic as it has in other sectors, government data show. 
In statements to Reuters, CBP spokesman Matthew Dyman said the agency is committed to protecting cultural and natural resources, such as wildlife corridors and culturally sensitive Native American artifacts or sites.
The agency is now surveying land for possible purchase. Dyman said it is ""always CBP's preference"" to obtain land voluntarily through negotiated offers but if that is not possible, a condemnation action - known as eminent domain - may be required. 
The majority of Americans oppose a substantial expansion of the border wall, according to a January 2019 Pew research poll, although the opinions tended to fall along party lines, with 82% of Republicans in favor and 93% of Democrats opposed.
Opposition in Laredo, which is predominantly Democrat but contains a substantial Republican contingent, appears more lopsided. More than two dozen cities, counties, and Native American tribes in the border region have passed resolutions opposing the project, including Laredo in 2017.
DECLARING INDEPENDENCE - AGAIN
A city of 262,000, Laredo sits in a former Spanish colony and Mexican territory, hugging the Rio Grande River. Here, partisan political divisions quickly evaporate when it comes to deciding on boundaries and the fate of the land.
Webb County is 95% Hispanic and many residents have family connections to Mexico. Business owners depend on cross-border trade. Some ranchers trace their property rights back to the 18th century Spanish land grants. The ancestors of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas formed their ties to the territory well before then.
In 1840, Laredo was the seat of the short-lived Republic of the Rio Grande, whose independence from Mexico lasted for 10 months before its cavalry was crushed by that country's Army.
""We've declared independence before — and we could do it again,"" said Margarita Araiza, executive director of the Webb County Heritage Foundation who traces her family's roots in Laredo back twelve generations to that 19th-century rebellion.
She worried the wall's construction could destroy or destabilize the city's 250-year-old historic sandstone buildings and sever its cozy relationship to the Rio Grande, where residents often fish, picnic, and stroll. 
""This is the reason this city was created, because of access to the river,"" said Araiza.
CBP spokesman Dyman said that no historic buildings would be directly affected by border wall construction based on current plans. 
Araiza is one of the founding members of the Laredo No Border Wall Coalition, a loosely organized group that seeks to halt the project. 
Working with a coalition of concerned landowners is the Laredo-based IBC Bank, whose chief executive officer, Dennis Nixon, was a top Trump donor in 2016. The proposed barrier could cut through the bank's 75 acres of waterfront property. 
""At a time when (America’s) number one trading partner is Mexico, what is the message we are sending to our friends in Mexico?"" said Gerardo Schwebel, executive vice president of the bank's corporate international division.
Not everyone in the city is opposed to the barrier. Supporters say the Mexican town of Nuevo Laredo, just across the river, is a hub for drug trafficking and human smuggling.
""No one wants to build a wall around their homes if they don't have to, but there's a need for that security,"" said Hector Garza, president of the National Border Patrol Council's local union chapter.
‘A BETTER WAY’?
The proposed border wall in Texas primarily cuts through private land, generating opposition and some alliances among occupants and landowners large and small. 
Felipe Antonio Perez, a 92-year-old retired carpenter, said he'd lived in his modest wooden house near the river bank in Laredo's historic La Azteca neighborhood for over sixty years. Standing beside a ""No Border Wall"" sign on his fence, he told Reuters he'd thrown away a government inquiry about surveying his land.
The oil-rich Fasken family, one of the top-fifty largest landowners in the United States with 85,000 acres in Webb County alone, co-founded the Rio Grande Landowners' Coalition to stop the wall project. 
""We feel there is a better way to secure the border and that putting up a 30-foot high wall to make a political statement is not the best use of taxpayers' money,"" said Bill Skeen, the family's real estate manager.
Also opposed are the sisters of the century-old Sacred Heart Children's Home for orphans, which overlooks the river.
""Put yourself in the place of an individual who has been orphaned - abandoned, abused, or whose parents have died -- the land and its natural beauty and its view becomes your refuge,"" said Beto Cardenas, the attorney representing the sisters in their negotiations with the government. 
The ancestral territory of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe of Texas extends on both sides of the river, said Chairman Juan Mancias as he surveyed riverside willow trees that the tribe uses to build sweat lodges on ranch land outside Laredo. Native burial grounds lie along the river, he said.
""The wall is a racial attack on our identity as people of the land,"" he said.
He said the tribe does not own riverfront land - it ""owns us."" But his people are committed to protecting it.

""My great grandchildren would be denied this,"" he said, looking across the landscape dotted with mesquite trees and purple sage. ""They would be denied who they are.""

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's bicycle makers feared for their future when the coronavirus pandemic forced them in March to shut for two months but 2020 now looks set to be a bumper year as people shun public transport and opt for healthier ways of getting around.
Portugal, Europe's largest manufacturer of bicycles, had to shut its nearly 40 factories and put their 8,000-strong workforce on furlough to help curb the spread of COVID-19, but is now struggling to keep up with booming global demand.
""When we closed on March 13, we thought it would be a catastrophe, we were scared,"" said Bruno Salgado, executive board member of RTE Bikes, which owns Europe's largest bike factory, in the city of Gaia (NASDAQ:GAIA), in northern Portugal.
""But it turned out to be a blessing in disguise for us,"" said Salgado, standing between two busy production lines at the factory, which produced 1.1 million bicycles last year. 
Worldwide, people have been trying to avoid crowded trains and buses during the pandemic, preferring to cycle, walk or jog to work and other destinations.
Cristina Latoeira, a civil servant in Lisbon, said it was the pandemic that had finally persuaded her to splash out 800 euros on the electric bike she had long dreamed of buying.
""It's the fear of being on very busy public transport, in winter, the fear of contagion that made me choose this mode of transport that I consider much safer,"" the 42-year-old said.
Like most other European countries, Portugal has recently seen the number of COVID-19 infections rise again after a summer lull.
EXPORT SURGE
Portugal exports about 90% of the bicycles it produces, with key markets in Germany, France and Italy. 
As lockdowns imposed to halt the spread of COVID-19 began to ease across Europe during the summer months, distributors around the continent ran out of stock, pushing Portuguese manufacturers to raise production and capacity.
RTE Bikes is now working at full steam, producing about 5,000 bicycles a day, up from an average of 3,000-4,000 this time last year, Salgado said.
João Maia, general manager at In Cycles, a rival firm which produced 87,000 bicycles in 2019, has seen demand double.
""At the moment, we export bicycles to all countries in the world, including countries that are supposed to be major bicycle producers"" such as Italy, Bulgaria and Romania, said Maia, as electric bikes were assembled in a production line behind him.
In Cycles plans to double its production lines to four from this month and already has orders for about 185,000 bicycles in 2021, Maia added.
Even before the pandemic struck, partly due to increased concerns over climate change and a move to healthier lifestyles, Portugal's production had jumped 42% in 2019 to a record 2.7 million bicycles - almost a quarter of all those built in the European Union, according to Eurostat data.
Despite this year's two-month factory shutdown, Gil Nadais, general secretary of the Portuguese bicycle manufacturers' association Abimota, told Reuters he expects the country will beat last year's record. 
Lisbon civil servant Latoeira certainly has no regrets.

""I had hesitated a lot, I was very anxious whether I should make this purchase because it is a bicycle, it can be stolen,"" she said. ""But it was worth it.""

OSLO (Reuters) - The laureate of the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize, one of the world's top accolades, will be announced on Friday in Oslo. Here is a look at how the award works:
WHO CAN WIN?
The prize should go to the person ""who has done the most or best to advance fellowship among nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies, and the establishment and promotion of peace congresses"", according to the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, who founded the awards.
Thousands of people can propose names: members of governments and parliaments; current heads of state; university professors of history, social sciences, law and philosophy; and former Nobel Peace Prize laureates, among others.
WHO DECIDES?
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which consists of five individuals appointed by the Norwegian Parliament. They are often retired politicians, but not always. The current committee is led by a lawyer and includes two academics.
They are all put forward by Norwegian political parties and their appointments reflect the balance of power in parliament.
HOW DO THEY DECIDE?
Nominations close on Jan. 31. Members of the committee can make their own nominations, no later than at the first meeting of the committee in February.
They discuss all the nominations, then establish a shortlist. Each nominee is then assessed and examined by a group of permanent advisers and other experts.
The committee meets roughly once a month to discuss the nominations. They usually make their decision at the final committee meeting, which tends to be at the beginning of October.
The committee seeks to get a consensus on its selection. If it can't, the decision is reached by majority vote.
The last time a member quit in protest was in 1994, because Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat shared the prize with Israel's Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Rabin.
WHO IS NOMINATED?
Nominations are secret for 50 years, but those who nominate can choose to divulge their choices.
The only thing the Norwegian Nobel Committee will comment on is the number of candidates. This year, there are 318 contenders - 211 individuals and 107 organisations. 
Those we know are nominated are Greta Thunberg and Fridays for Future, NATO, the European Court of Human Rights, Julian Assange, Edward Snowden and Chelsea Manning, the ""people of Hong Kong"" and jailed Saudi activist Loujain al-Hathloul.
Other possible contenders, if they are nominated, are Reporters Without Borders, the Committee to Protect Journalists, Angela Merkel, the World Health Organization and its director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.
IS DONALD TRUMP NOMINATED?
He may be, but we don't know. He is nominated for next year's prize, by a Norwegian lawmaker and a Swedish parliamentarian, separately, for helping broker a deal between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, and for peacemaking efforts in the Balkans.
WHAT DOES THE LAUREATE GET?
A medal, a diploma, ten million Swedish crowns ($1.10 million) - and immediate global attention.
South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the 1984 laureate, has said becoming a Nobel laureate was a double-edged sword. ""One day no one was listening. The next, I was an oracle,"" he is quoted as saying in his authorised biography.
WHEN IS THE CEREMONY?
It will take place on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death.

This year, due to coronavirus restrictions, it will be held in the Court of the University of Oslo, with around 100 guests only, rather than at the bigger Oslo City Hall, where it has been held since 1989.

At a time when established newspapers and television channels are routinely vilified and accused of producing ""fake news"" by U.S. President Donald Trump and other world leaders, the 94-year-old monarch's message was a rare tribute.
""The COVID-19 pandemic has once again demonstrated what an important public service the established news media provides, both nationally and regionally,"" she said in a message to members of Britain's News Media Association.
""As our world has changed dramatically, having trusted, reliable sources of information, particularly at a time when there are so many sources competing for our attention, is vital,"" the queen wrote.
The impact of social media on democracy, and particularly of the colossal flows of misinformation circulating among users, are the subjects of heated and unresolved debates in several major Western countries, especially the United States.

Under Britain's unwritten constitution, the monarch does not usually speak on political matters. The queen's decision to send a public message of support to the news media suggests she considers the subject to be uncontroversial.

One of the rockets landed near the Babylon hotel, which is used by Iraqi travelers and sometimes for government meetings, the military said in the statement.
The Iraqi military blamed “terrorist groups” for the attack and said the rockets were fired from an area in the western part of the capital.
Rockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified Green Zone, which houses government buildings and foreign missions including the U.S. embassy.
Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi pledged in a meeting with top diplomats to protect foreign missions and limit the possession of weapons to state forces following a U.S. threat to shut down its embassy in the city.
Washington blames such attacks on Iranian-backed militia groups. Iran has not directly commented on the incidents.
Iraq, often the scene of spillover violence from U.S.-Iran tensions, wants to avoid being drawn into any regional conflict.

CAIRO (Reuters) - In her village in Egypt's Nile Delta, 35-year-old Shaimaa Saleh has spent sleepless nights worrying how to raise almost $1,000 to save her unfinished three-storey home.
Like hundreds of thousands of others, and many dependents, she faces a deadline at the end of October by which residents of buildings without permits - mostly in poor areas - must apply to regularise their property for a fee, or face demolition.
Officials say that the law introduced last year is part of a crackdown on illegal buildings that violate safety standards, hinder traffic and development, and encroach on arable land.
It's part of a drive by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi to upgrade infrastructure and housing and deal with decades of haphazard construction that accelerated after a 2011 uprising.
But for some residents the demolition threat is a fresh blow after years of economic austerity, rising prices and, most recently, the fallout from the coronavirus.
""I have been struggling to make a living as a farm hand to feed my three children since my husband died in Kuwait last year,"" said Saleh, a resident of Defriya village in Kafr El-Sheikh province.
""I make around 1,500 pounds ($95.48) (a month) from work and my late father's pension. But the government wants 15,000 pounds to regularise my house.""
Her husband, who was a construction worker, started building the red brick house in 2014 without a permit and later added two unfinished floors, a typical construction in Egypt where informal housing has long been the norm. 
Reuters spoke to a dozen residents in three provinces who said they had struggled to the pay a settlement fee of between 50 and 2,000 pounds per square meter.
Egypt's state press centre did not respond to questions about their plight and the fees.
SPORADIC CLASHES
The government campaign has led to tensions in some communities. In Saryaqos, a village outside Cairo, bulldozers destroyed four informal buildings in late August, before the deadline expired, residents said.
Angry residents threw stones at the bulldozers and workers who were accompanied by policemen, according to four residents and a video posted online.
The housing and local development ministries declined to comment on complaints about demolitions before the deadline. 
Local authorities in Qalyubia province did not respond to questions about the incident, but a security official said 15 men had been arrested for rioting.
Egyptian authorities have detained several hundred people in recent days, a rights group has said, amid reports of small, scattered demonstrations against Sisi.
The president has complained that not enough people were coming forward to regularise their properties, and in televised remarks threatened to deploy the army in villages to demolish illegal houses if violations did not stop.
Some residents in Saryaqos told Reuters that they rushed to regularise their property after the incident.
Leilani Farha, who visited Egypt as U.N. Special Rapporteur on the Right to Housing in 2018 and now heads The Shift, a housing rights group, said the campaign risked indebting the poor.
""Many of the people who are building are of course not wealthy and don't have the resources to pay a fine. You cannot squeeze water from a stone,"" she said.
CONSTRUCTION BOOM
The campaign has accompanied a military-led construction boom of highways, bridges, new cities and industrial zones that not even the coronavirus pandemic has slowed.
Sisi, who recently ordered the government to build one million housing units, has said every Egyptian who wants a flat will get one.
Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly said the fees, which can be paid over three years, would be invested in improving infrastructure.
Officials say they are also battling to conserve limited arable land. Egypt's population hit 100 million this year, 97% of whom live on just 8% of the desert country's territory along the Nile. 
Entire settlements sprung up as builders exploited lax law enforcement in the turmoil that followed 2011. Egypt lost 90,000 feddans of farmland (37,800 hectares) as a result, Madbouly said.
But some residents said they are being squeezed for cash after the state tolerated their housing for years, while others said landlords had sold them apartments claiming they had been built legally.
Three small contractors and owners of high-rise buildings said they had to pay millions to settle their infringements and warned that this would undermine their businesses. One said he had four of his buildings demolished in March.
The government softened its stance in recent weeks by extending the settlement deadline initially set for Sept. 30 by one month and lowering the fees.

Authorities collected almost 7 billion pounds in fees by mid-September, a local development ministry statement said. Some 1.1 million applications for settlement have been received.

The Pulse Asia survey, conducted last month with in-person interviews with 1,200 adult Filipinos, found 91% of respondents approved of both his performance and his personality, up from 87% and 83% respectively in December.
The Philippines, for years among the world's fastest-growing economies, is forecast to see a 6.9% economic contraction this year, the World Bank has said, the biggest since the 1980s and worse than the government's projected 5.5% decline. 
Ronnie Holmes, president of Pulse Asia, said during a television interview that the overwhelming thumbs-up for Duterte showed the public blamed the decline on the impact of COVID-19 rather than government mishandling.
The survey was conducted in and around the capital Manila, where tight restrictions have been partly loosened to try to revive business activities. 
The Philippines leads Southeast Asia with the most number of cases https://tmsnrt.rs/3ngW4uH at 322,497 and is second to Indonesia in deaths.
The firebrand leader has promised free vaccines, prioritising first the poor and then the middle class, police and military personnel. 
Duterte, 75, is allowed only a single term as president but the chance of his allies succeeding him will be bolstered significantly if his popularity remains intact ahead of the 2022 presidential election.

While his opponents chide him for his authoritarian style and low tolerance of dissent, Duterte remains hugely popular because of his man-of-the-people style and a perception of strong leadership and success in fighting crime and corruption.

TOKYO (Reuters) - New Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is under fire for rejecting six scholars for membership in a science advisory body set up after World War Two, a move critics say violates the constitution's principle of academic freedom.
Suga, who took office last month after Shinzo Abe resigned, has enjoyed high support among voters who approve of his promises to deregulate, reduce mobile phone rates and digitalise services as he tries to revive the economy and contain COVID-19.
But Suga's rejection of the six scholars - some of whom are known for criticising past Abe policies - could stoke a furore that threatens his honeymoon with voters.
At issue is the influential 210-member Science Council of Japan (SCJ), set up after World War Two to provide independent scientific policy input. The body had included the six rejected scholars among 105 recommended for membership.
Half of the council's members are chosen every three years.
Among the policies the rejected scholars had criticised are Abe's reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution to allow troops to fight overseas, a historic shift for Japan's defence policies, and a 2013 state secrets act that sparked concerns about media freedom.
Suga told reporters on Friday that his decision was ""the result of an appropriate response based on the law.""
Since 1983, the prime minister has appointed members based upon SCJ recommendations, and there is no precedent for rejecting those recommendations, political analysts said.
""The constitution of Japan has a specific article just for academic freedom, which is ... a direct result of wartime control of academia and science by the militarists,"" said Sophia University professor Koichi Nakano.
The council, which tangled with Abe's government in 2017 after taking a sceptical stance on academic research with potential military uses, has demanded Suga explain his decision and appoint the six scholars.
""I don't know at all why I was not appointed,"" one of the scholars, Waseda Law School professor Masanori Okada, told Reuters. ""What I wrote (in the past) was that the government should act in accordance with the law. ... That is only natural.""
Some conservatives have blasted the SCJ for what they say is a China-friendly stance. Okada denied the group has any special relationship with Beijing.
University of Tokyo political science professor Shigeki Uno declined to comment directly on his rejection but stressed the importance of freedom of speech.
""The greatest strength of a democratic society is its ability to be open to criticism and constantly modify itself,"" he said in a statement to the media.

Opposition parties have attacked the decision and demanded a public explanation from Suga.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al Assad said the continued presence of Russia's major naval and air bases in his country help counter the influence of Western powers in the region as the battle to crush insurgents was winding down.
In an interview with Russia's Ministry of Defence TV channel Zvezda on the fifth anniversary of Moscow's intervention in Syria that tipped the conflict in his favour, Assad said Russia's two main bases were important to counter the West's military presence in the region.
""This global military balance needs Russia's role ..this needs (military) bases..we benefit from this,"" Assad said adding Syria needed such a presence that his military commanders say countered Washington's dominance in the region. 
Alongside the Hmeimim base, from which Russia launches air strikes in support of Assad, Moscow also controls the Tartus naval facility in Syria, its only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, in use since the days of the Soviet Union. 
Russia launched air strikes in Syria in 2015 and began cementing its permanent military presence in 2017, following a deal with the government in Damascus.
A Russian government document published last August showed that Syrian authorities have agreed to give Russia additional land and coastal waters in order to expand its military air base at Hmeimim. [L8N2FL5GB]
Assad said his army, before Moscow's military intervention, had been facing a ""dangerous situation"" with an armed opposition directly funded and equipped by Washington and other Western powers, alongside Saudi Arabia and Qatar who had seized main cities and towns.
Assad has been able with Moscow's massive aerial power and Iranian-backed militias' support to regain most of the territory he lost in a decade long conflict. 
Washington and backers of the Syrian opposition say the Russian and Syrian bombing of opposition-held areas amounted to war crimes and were responsible for the displacement of millions and the death of thousands of civilians.
Moscow and Damascus deny indiscriminate bombing of civilians and say they are fighting to rid the country of Islamist militants.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Hidden between the skyscrapers of Singapore's urban jungle sits Kampong Lorong Buangkok - the only surviving traditional village in this modern city-state of 5.7 million people. 
Made up of 26 single-story wooden houses, which were once ubiquitous across Singapore, the ""kampong"", the Malay word for village, has seen a boom in local visitors after borders shut due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Most kampongs disappeared during Singapore's rush to urbanise, but being stuck at home has left locals like 48-year old Jenn Lee, a day trader, craving for a bit of nostalgia to share with her son. 
""I think it's good that he does know that (there) is something like that here, it's not just overseas like Malaysia, or Thailand, or the Philippines,"" Lee said.
Singapore authorities have been trying to support local tourism through campaigns and have given citizens cash vouchers for staycations. 
Tour operators argue there is plenty to discover in the country of only 724 square kilometres (280 square miles).
Kyanta Yap, a guide at Let's Go Tour: Singapore, said their weekend visits to the kampong that cost S$200 ($147) for a group of up to three people, or S$250 for four-five, have been nearly fully booked since September. 
""We try to reinvent ourselves, so most of the industry, we try to come out with domestic tourism packages,"" said Yap.
Tourists get a chance to wander around the kampong, learn how to use a traditional coal-fired clothing iron and chat with residents about what they are growing in their gardens.
""Initially ... we were very uncomfortable, because tourists would start to come and look at us,"" said 52-year old resident Nassim, who now enjoys showing tourists around his yard.
The village also boasts some of the lowest rents in usually pricey Singapore. A landlord said some individual kampong rooms cost as little as S$6.50 per month. 

Average rental for a three-room state-subsidised apartment in Hougang, where the kampong is located, was S$1,650 earlier this year. Renting a room costs from around S$500, websites show.

Laschet, the premier of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, who presents himself as the Merkel continuity candidate, is slowly building a majority among the CDU's 1,001 voting delegates ahead of December's vote on the party leadership, the sources say.
His main CDU rival, plain-speaking businessman Friedrich Merz, remains more popular among voters, but Laschet hopes his own credentials as a tried-and-trusted manager with centrist views will more than compensate for his lack of personal charisma and catapult him into Germany's top job.
""(Laschet) is currently considered the most likely winner of the internal race,"" said one CDU lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Party sources said the new CDU leader will likely also be the chancellor candidate for the party and its Bavarian sister, the CSU, at the next election, which is due by Oct. 24, 2021. Germany has never had a chancellor from the CSU.
Laschet has been boosted by local election wins last month in his home state and also by a resurgence in support for Merkel, whose competent handling of the coronavirus pandemic has showcased her managerial style of leading from the political centreground.
In an Aug. 18 visit to North Rhine-Westphalia, Merkel said Laschet had ""the tools"" to run for chancellor -- the closest she has come to endorsing any of the contenders, who also include foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen.
His centrist views mean Laschet would be better suited to negotiate a possible future coalition government with the resurgent Greens, the CDU sources say. Opinion polls suggest the Greens are the most realistic coalition partner for the CDU/CSU.
STEPPING ONTO WORLD STAGE
Laschet, 59, has also been energetically polishing his international profile in the past eight weeks, holding private meetings with French President Emmanuel Macron - his third this year - and Pope Francis, and visited a refugee camp in Greece.
He has also visited Israel and met EU leaders in Brussels this year.
A French speaker of Belgian descent, Laschet has been particularly keen to cement relations with Macron, with whom he would have to work closely as chancellor in steering the European Union through some daunting challenges ahead.
At his last meeting with Macron at the presidential Elysee palace in Paris on Sept. 8, Laschet broke the ice by talking about Lebanese singer Fairuz, of whom he and the French leader are both fans, sources present at the meeting said.
The two men also discovered a shared admiration for German artist Anselm Kiefer, who lives near Paris.
    In an honour reserved for special guests, Macron invited Laschet into the Elysee gardens, where they discussed Lebanon, Turkey and tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.
    ""We've always found he has been supportive of the president's proposals,"" a French diplomat said. 
Laschet's spokesman said: ""Despite all differences in detail, Armin Laschet has always welcomed and supported President Macron's impulses for the European unification process.""
At the Munich Security Conference in February, Laschet apologised on behalf of the German government for taking ""too long to react"" to French calls for EU reform. 
But some in the CDU fear he may end up being led by Macron.
    ""I've told him he has to be clearer about what he wants in foreign policy,"" said one senior lawmaker.
OPPONENTS' WEAKNESS
However, his globe-trotting and his francophilia have done Laschet's domestic profile no harm.
He can count on the support of at least two other CDU state premiers, the party sources say. Together, these and his own state account for more than 40% of the delegates to the Dec. 4 party congress that will decide the leadership.
    In the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, too, some delegates are starting to lean towards Laschet and away from his main rival Merz, whom they backed heavily in a 2018 contest for the party chair, a senior party official said.
    Merz, 64, wants the CDU to distinguish itself more clearly from rival parties after sharing power with the left-leaning Social Democrats under Merkel. His opponents see him as a man from a bygone era.
Contacted for this story, Merz told Reuters: ""Two months before the party conference, I see my baseline position as extremely positive. But a lot can still happen in two months.""
Roettgen, 55, told Reuters: ""The current situation is that each of the candidates has a chance of being elected.""
Not everybody in the CDU was happy with the choice on offer.
    ""I'm not satisfied with any of the three candidates,"" said one senior CDU lawmaker, adding that he preferred Health Minister Jens Spahn, who backs Laschet.
""Spahn is loyal, Laschet would have to ask him to run for chancellor. He won't,"" the lawmaker lamented.

Political scientist Gero Neugebauer was also unimpressed: ""Laschet's strength is currently the weakness of his opponents.""

Negotiations between the Afghan government and Afghan Taliban that started last month are aimed at the warring sides agreeing to a reduction of violence and a possible new power-sharing agreement in Afghanistan.
Violence, however, has not abated even as Afghan negotiators have been engaged in direct talks for the first time ever.
Scores of Afghan soldiers and Taliban fighters have been killed in intensive clashes and suicide attacks have left dozens of civilians dead in recent weeks across the war-torn country. 
Ghani and his team will be stopping first in Kuwait to attend the funeral ceremony of the late Emir of Kuwait Sheikh Sabah Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah before travelling to Qatar on Monday, a close aide to Ghani told Reuters.
""Several meetings are planned to discuss efforts for deepening Afghanistan-Qatar ties and mutual cooperation in various areas,"" said the official adding that Ghani will also meet the Afghan representatives who are holding talks with Taliban.
""But it is clear that Ghani will not meet the Taliban officials as there has been no reduction of violence and they continue to kill innocent civilians,"" said a senior western diplomat overseeing the ongoing peace process.
The intra-Afghan talks are part of a February deal between the militants and the United States that has cleared the way for U.S. forces to withdraw from their longest war. 
But so far there has been no progress as the warring Afghans have become bogged down on processes and procedures, diplomatic sources said.

1063,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 05, 2020 02:11AM ET</span>","Yemen's war shifts focus to Marib, thousands of displaced at risk","MARIB, Yemen (Reuters) - In Yemen's gas-rich region of Marib, fighters loyal to the Saudi-backed government recited Koranic verses before launching a hail of mortar and machine gun fire towards rocky mountains, in a desperate bid to push back Houthi forces.
The commanding officer peered through his binoculars at the dust and plumes of black smoke thrown up by the firing, aimed at a group of elusive enemy Houthi snipers.
A few dozen kilometres (miles) away, hundreds of displaced civilians in makeshift camps waited for water, food and medicine from humanitarian groups - a further sign that despite United Nations peace efforts, the near six-year-old war grinds on.
""We have more than 1,500 families in this camp and they already moved three times ... because the fighting keeps following them,"" said Mohsen Mushalla, director of al-Sowaida camp some 15 km from Marib city.
""They don't have water, electricity, a hospital and the nearest town is 10 km away. Just bringing water is enough hardship,"" Mushalla added.
Fighting has raged for months in Marib, the last stronghold of the internationally recognised government.
It was ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014 by the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, prompting a Saudi-led coalition to intervene.
The war, which has caused the world's worst humanitarian crisis, has been in stalemate for years. The government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi has also fought separatists in the south who seek independence.
CEASEFIRE REMAINS ELUSIVE
Some diplomats and experts say that a Houthi victory in Marib, which would hand the group complete control of the northern half of Yemen, could have ""ripple effects"" on the conflict across Yemen and scupper U.N. efforts to secure a nationwide ceasefire.
Houthi forces have opened three frontlines in Marib region, advancing in recent months from the northern district of Madghal, the southern town of Rahabah and from the west in Sarwah.
The group has seized six districts and large parts of Sarwah, which lies 80 km from Marib city - the last line of defence before Yemen's biggest gas and oil fields. But progress has slowed and victory is not guaranteed.
""Marib is a military operation for both sides but it is a pressure tool for the Houthis on the negotiating table,"" said a diplomat involved in the talks.
""Luckily, the fighting has slowed down over the last two weeks, thanks to the Houthi-Saudi indirect talks and because the battle has been exhausting for both sides.""
Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks last year.
The Saudi-led coalition and Houthi officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the status of fighting in Marib or the broader conflict.
SWEEPING DESERT LANDSCAPES
The violence has escalated since U.N. Special Envoy to Yemen Martin Griffiths pressed both parties to agree on a ceasefire deal that would pave the way for broader negotiations to end the war that has killed more than 100,000 people. 
Earlier this month, Griffiths told the 15-member U.N. Security Council that he sent an advanced draft of the agreement to the parties, and warned the international community not to underestimate the political importance of Marib. 
The fighting in Marib has displaced nearly a million people, the U.N. said, and threatens around 750,000 refugees who have settled in the city since the war started in 2014.
""We know that any intensification of the conflict will put them (displaced civilians) at extreme risk and we're very worried that many of the people who live in Marib city will themselves become displaced by the conflict,"" Lise Grande, U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, told Reuters. 
In Marib city, giant billboards expressed support for President Hadi, while the red, white and black national colours flew in crowded streets. Vendors offered grilled corn on the cob.
""I fled the fighting in Aden, this city hosts refugees from all over Yemen ... we call on the international community to stop missile strikes on the city as only refugees and children suffer from them,"" said Nermeen al-Hashidi, a Marib resident.
In al-Sowaida camp, tents are set amid the towering hills of the desert, and children walk barefoot while others drink water directly from big white cisterns left in the fierce heat.
""I have a wife and five children living inside this tent,"" said Mohamad Abdullah Qassim, a refugee.

""The international organisations have provided us with it, but I'm not sure that they are very helpful. Other tents burned in a big fire next to us.""

The globally discredited treatment, which harms and stigmatizes members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans community has adherents in New Zealand, however.
A recent survey showed more than one in six respondents reported being subjected to the efforts of psychiatrists, psychologists or counsellors to stop them being trans or non-binary, Labour Party leader Tāmati Coffey said.
""Conversion therapy has been linked to severe adverse mental health issues, including depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation – that’s why it will be banned under a re-elected Labour Government,"" Coffey said in a statement.
""It is a practice that causes harm and is out of place in the kind, inclusive and modern country we are.""
Ardern's Labour-led government, which is in a coalition with the Green Party and the nationalist New Zealand First Party, is widely seen as winning in the election. 
In the past, Ardern has spoken in support of banning conversion therapy. Alhtough brought up a Mormon, she left the church because of its conservative view on the LGBT community, and in solidarity with her gay friends.
Several U.S. states, such as California, Colorado, New York and Washington have banned conversion therapy, which is sometimes performed by religious establishments and can include hypnosis and electric shocks, as a movement grows against it. 

Neighbouring Canada re-introduced a bill this month to criminalise such efforts.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's coronavirus hotspot of Victoria will look into ways to increase testing for the disease to control its spread in anticipation of easing of the state's stringent lockdown restrictions, officials said on Monday.
New daily coronavirus infections in Victoria, Australia's second most-populous state, fell to nine cases on Monday, down from 12 in the previous days. No deaths were reported. 
Melbourne, which has remained in a strict lockdown for nearly three months, is expected to see the bulk of its restrictions eased when the average for new daily cases over two weeks falls below five. 
According to the state's modelling, that could occur in late October. On Monday, the 14-day day rolling case average was 11.6, down from 11.9 the previous day. 
""We want everybody who has symptoms, regardless of their circumstances, to be able to get tested, we get their results and that's how we can protect them and indeed, the entire community,"" Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said in a televised briefing. ""There is some work going on in the next few days to see if we can increase the number of people who are eligible and increase the number of people who can get those tests.""
Victoria accounts for 90% of the country's 894 COVID-19 deaths. Since the start of the year, the state has conducted some 2.7 million tests. It had a population of about 6 million at the last census, according to government data.
Australia has one of the world's highest ratios of tests per capita and, despite the outbreak in Victoria, one of the lowest numbers of coronavirus cases.

The country has had just over 27,000 infections, according to health ministry data - less than the average daily number of cases for the United States in the past several months.

1066,By Bloomberg,"<span>Oct 04, 2020 08:36PM ET</span>",Free Cash for All Boosts Rising South Korea Star to Top of Polls,"(Bloomberg) -- Record government spending triggered by the coronavirus in South Korea has helped send a maverick regional governor to the top of polls to be the next president and fueled his push to make the country Asia’s first to introduce universal basic income.
Lee Jae-myung, who has served as governor of South Korea’s most populous province since 2018, warns that without across-the-board income support to address inequality, the stability of the country’s economy could be threatened.
“The capitalist system could fall apart if consumption and demand aren’t supported,” Lee, 56, said in an interview last week. The Gyeonggi governor’s move early in the pandemic to provide handouts to boost the regional economy surrounding Seoul helped prod the central government to take action at the national level.
Lee’s call for the introduction of a universal basic income may also be followed by other politicians with an eye on the presidency, potentially extending the era of expansionary fiscal policy long after the virus is gone. Lee, who grew up in poverty, said he firmly believes growing income disparity would make markets unsustainable, and universal basic income would “fix and further develop” capitalism.
The race is tight. A KStat Research survey last week showed 26% of respondents preferred Lee as the next president, just three years after he ran unsuccessfully against current President Moon Jae-in in the Democratic Party primaries. The poll showed Lee came in five percentage points better than ruling party leader Lee Nak-yon, who once served as Moon’s prime minister. Moon’s single, five-year term ends in 2022.
In another survey by Korea Research International released Saturday, however, the former prime minister took the lead with 26% of favorability rating, about three percentage points higher than the governor.
“I have confidence in my understanding of how society and the global economy work, and how their problems can be fixed.” Lee said. “I’m not going to compromise.”
While Moon initially made efforts to raise the minimum wage, the country’s income inequality still remains among the developed world’s highest, according to OECD data. Lee said far more needs to be done.
South Korea should start with an annual basic income of about 500,000 won ($430) and gradually move toward a monthly handout that’s as big over the course of 10 to 15 years, Lee said.
A Realmeter poll in June showed that 49% of South Koreans approved of the idea of universal basic income while 43% opposed it.
While Lee, who worked as a laborer for six years before becoming a law student at Chung-Ang University in Seoul, calls for more action, the government has already delivered record spending to support households and companies during the pandemic. Last month, Moon’s government provided 7.8 trillion won in stimulus for small businesses via a fourth extra budget. An earlier 12.2 trillion won extra budget provided cash handouts to all families in the spring.
Still, the call for a universal income isn’t limited to Lee or other progressives in Moon’s camp. The idea is also gaining support in the top opposition conservative group.
The newly named People Power Party recently introduced a pledge to seek a basic income. Its interim party leader Kim Chong-in is trying to build support by embracing some of the popular economic policies of the left with a tough stand on security that has been a bedrock position of the right.

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 04, 2020 08:26PM ET</span>",Azerbaijan's leader says no end to fighting until Armenia sets pullout timetable,"By Nailia Bagirova and Nvard Hovhannisyan
BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev demanded on Sunday that Armenia set a timetable for withdrawing from the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding Azeri territories, and said Azerbaijan would not cease military action until that happened.
In a televised address to the nation, Aliyev said Azeri forces were advancing in a week-long offensive to retake lands that they lost to ethnic Armenians in the 1990s.
""Azerbaijan has one condition, and that is the liberation of its territories,"" he said. ""Nagorno-Karabakh is the territory of Azerbaijan. We must return and we shall return.""
""My condition is the following: let them withdraw their troops, and the confrontation will be stopped, but this should not be in words, but in deeds,"" he added.
He said the international community had failed for three decades to enforce U.N. resolutions or put pressure on Armenia to return Azeri territories.
The content and tone of Aliyev's message made clear that Azerbaijan would not entertain calls for an immediate ceasefire, as Russia, the United States and European Union have urged.
Speaking immediately after Aliyev’s speech, Armenian Defence Ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said: ""I don't think that there is any risk for Yerevan (the Armenian capital), but anyway we are in war.""
The clashes are the worst since the 1990s, when some 30,000 people were killed and are spreading beyond the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave. They have raised international concern about stability in the South Caucasus, where pipelines carry Azeri oil and gas to world markets.
The conflict threatens to drag in other regional powers as Azerbaijan is supported by Turkey, while Armenia has a defence pact with Russia.
Hundreds of people have been killed in the past week of fighting between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces, including more than 40 civilians.
Earlier on Sunday, Azerbaijan said Armenian forces had fired rockets at its second city of Ganja, killing one civilian and wounding 32, and also launched a missile attack on the Azeri industrial city of Mingachevir. Azerbaijan threatened to retaliate by destroying military targets inside Armenia.
Both Armenia's and the breakaway region's defence ministries said they denied the Azeri claim of the Armenian attack on Mingachevir in Azerbaijan. 
Turkey's Foreign Ministry said: ""The attacks of Armenia targeting the civilians in Ganja...are a new manifestation of Armenia's unlawful attitude. We condemn these attacks.""
Armenia denied it had directed fire ""of any kind"" towards Azerbaijan. The leader of Nagorno-Karabakh said his forces had targeted a military airbase in Ganja but later stopped firing in order to avoid civilian casualties. 
FIGHTING SPREADS
Until now, the main fighting has been between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, but it now threatens to spill over into a direct war with Armenia itself.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire in a conversation with Armenia's foreign minister and said Moscow was ready to help seek a solution to the conflict via the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).
Azerbaijan, however, says it has lost patience with the OSCE's failure to resolve the conflict.
Nagorno-Karabakh once again came under Azeri bombardment on Sunday and an official there said the civilian death toll over the past week had risen to 18, including casualties in the enclave's capital of Stepanakert and nearby Shushi.
Azerbaijan says it has lost 24 civilians, and Armenia two.
Aliyev said on Twitter his forces had captured the town of Jabrail and several villages in what, if confirmed, would be a significant advance on the southern edge of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan dismissed the claim as ""yet another fabrication"". Independent verification was not possible.

Nagorno-Karabakh leader Arayik Harutyunyan said his forces would target military units located in the large Azeri cities.

The three tankers, which began arriving last week, brought some 820,000 barrels of fuel to the South American country, where severe shortages of gasoline -- as well as unreliable power, water and cooking gas supplies -- have led to a wave of protests in the neglected interior in recent weeks.
The shortages come as state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela's once-formidable 1.3 million barrel per day (bpd) refining network has all but collapsed, although two refineries have for the past week been producing around 50,000 bpd of gasoline. 
Maduro last week announced a new rationing plan, set to begin on Monday, in which authorities would distribute fuel according to motorists' license plate numbers. 
""Tomorrow, October 5, the plan to normalize and restart the gasoline distribution situation begins,"" Maduro said in a Sunday state television address. ""We have in the last week managed to produce the gasoline and other products Venezuela needs, in addition to the good quantity of gasoline that has arrived from abroad."" 
The Faxon entered Venezuelan waters on Saturday and docked at the Guaraguao fuel port, which is connected to the Puerto La Cruz refinery, on Sunday afternoon, according to the person familiar with the matter. The other tankers are docked at refineries in the west and central regions of Venezuela.
Iran and Venezuela have intensified economic cooperation this year as the United States ramped up sanctions on both countries' oil industries.

NAPA, Calif. (Reuters) - Wildfires in California have burned more than 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) in 2020, over twice the previous record for any year and an area larger than Connecticut, the state's fire agency reported on Sunday.
The most-populous U.S. state has suffered five of its six largest wildfires in history this year as heat waves and dry-lightning sieges coincided with drier conditions that climate scientists blame on global warming. 
At least 31 people have died in this year's fires and over 8,454 homes and other structures have been destroyed, Cal Fire said in a statement.
California's previous record burn area was nearly 2 million acres in 2018 when the state had its most deadly and destructive wildfire that killed at least 85 civilians and destroyed nearly 19,000 structures in and around the mountain town of Paradise.
""There's no words to describe what is taking place and what continues to take place,"" said Cal Fire spokesman Scott McLean. ""It goes to show how dry the state is and how volatile the vegetation is.""
California suffered a prolonged drought from around 2010 to 2017, causing diseases and insect infestations that killed millions of trees. That followed a century of fire suppression that also built up brush and dead trees, turning some forests into tinderboxes.
City real-estate prices and second-home construction have seen the growth of communities in peripheral, wildland areas that have naturally burned for millennia. 
In the world-famous wine country of Napa County, the so-called Glass Fire has damaged over a dozen wineries. Vineyards worked through the night on Saturday to pick grape varieties that can resist smoke damage. Some crops heavily exposed to smoke may be a write-off.

Firefighters were expected to get a break from cooler temperatures in Northern California this week, with a chance of rain, Cal Fire said.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Twitter users are flooding the #ProudBoys hashtag on social media with images of LGBTQI+ pride, displacing posts made by neo-Nazis and white supremacists using the tag.
Proud Boys, a far-right group founded in 2016, calls itself a ""white chauvinist"" organization but is considered a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center.
The group was in the news after U.S. President Donald Trump declined to condemn them during Tuesday's presidential debate, instead telling them to ""stand back and stand by,"" which many group members took as an endorsement. Trump later denounced the group in a Fox News interview.
On Sunday the #ProudBoys hashtag began trending in North America as LGBTQI+ users included it on photos of their significant others or wedding days and other pride imagery.
""Look at these cute lil #ProudBoys,"" Bobby Berk, a host of the popular Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) show Queer Eye, wrote on Sunday, alongside a photo with his husband. ""Retweet and make this hashtag about love, not hate.""
The official Twitter account of the Canadian Armed Forces in the United States shared an image of a serviceman kissing his partner, captioned with emojis of the Canada flag and rainbow pride flag and the hashtag #ProudBoys.
""If you wear our uniform, know what it means. If you're thinking about wearing our uniform, know what it means,"" the organization said in a follow-up tweet. ""Love is love.""
An internal report from the Canadian military in November 2018 found 53 members were found to have made discriminatory statements or were linked to hate groups including the Proud Boys and anti-immigrant group Soldiers of Odin.

The new lockdown would potentially entail harsher restrictions including the closure of pubs and a ban on all social contact outside household groups, the newspaper said https:// 
According to the documents seen by The Guardian, the draft plan called the 'COVID-19 Proposed Social Distancing Framework' is designed to simplify the existing localized restrictions.
The plans have not yet been finalised and signed off by No.10 officials and several of the measures could still be relaxed, according to the newspaper. 
Britain gradually came out of a national lockdown over the summer, but many areas including major cities such as Manchester and Glasgow are currently subject to local restrictions.
In an interview on Sunday British Prime Minister Boris Johnson denied a suggestion that the local restrictions were not working given infection rates were still rising in the affected areas and there was no end in sight to the measures.
The three-tier system is aimed at improving people's compliance with the rules, the Guardian said, stating that many citizens do not have a clear understanding of the rules that apply to them. 
The levels are intended to be 'minimum standards' and specific local circumstances would also be taken into account, the newspaper said, citing a government source.

The government had last week announced a tightening of restrictions on socializing in northeast England, in response to high and increasing COVID-19 infection rates in the region - the latest in a series of local measures.

Prime Minister Jean Castex's office said there had been no improvement in the Paris region since the capital passed all three of the government's criteria for being put on the highest level of alert mid last week.
Working from home should be prioritised ""now more than ever"" in the Paris area and university lecture halls should be no more than half full, Castex's office said in a statement.
The reinforced restrictions will take effect from Tuesday.
""These measures, indispensable in the fight to curb the virus' spread, will apply to Paris and the three departments immediately surrounding it, for a duration of two weeks,"" it said. 
For a city to be placed on maximum alert, the incidence rate must exceed 100 infections per 100,000 among elderly inhabitants and 250 per 100,000 among the general public, while at least 30% of intensive care beds are reserved for coronavirus patients.
A week ago, restaurants and bars were shut down for a fortnight in Marseille, the southern city at the epicentre of the second wave, prompting protests and an unsuccessful legal challenge.
Restaurants in Marseille will be allowed to reopen early under the same new protocols.

Five of the bodies were discovered in northwestern Italy, including four washed up on the shore between the towns of Ventimiglia and Santo Stefano al Mare, near the French frontier. Some of the corpses might have been swept down the coast from France.
Two more were found in France, including a shepherd found by an Italian search and rescue team. The other body was found in a vehicle that had been swept away by flash-flooding in the village of Saint-Martin-Vésubie.
It brings to nine the total number of people found dead after fierce rains and howling gales lashed the border area on Friday. French firefighters said another 21 people were missing, eight of them known to be as a direct result of the storm.
The bad weather caused millions of euros of damage, with several road bridges swept away in Italy, and streets in some towns littered with debris, mud and overturned cars. 
Officials in the Piedmont region reported a record 630 mm (24.8 inches) of rain in just 24 hours in Sambughetto, near Switzerland - more than half its annual average rainfall. 
In Limone Piemonte, a three-storey house was swept off its foundations and into a river. In the nearby village of Tanaro, floodwaters destroyed the local cemetery, sweeping away dozens of coffins.
In France, almost 1,000 firefighters were drafted into the Alpes-Maritimes region to look for the missing and re-establish communications. More than two dozen primary and secondary schools in the area are closed until further notice, local authorities said.
Up to 500mm of rain fell in less than 10 hours, a volume not seen since records began, Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Saturday.

Israel generally shies from public censure of Turkey, with which it maintains trade and diplomatic relations despite the pro-Palestinian stance of Ankara's government for more than a decade.
Briefing Gulf Arab reporters as a follow-up to Israel's founding of ties with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, Defence Minister Benny Gantz described Turkey and Iran as ""denying promotion of peace and supporting regional aggression"".
Iran - Israel's chief enemy - and Turkey have criticised the U.S.-brokered Sept. 15 normalisation deal between Israel and the Gulf powers, seeing a betrayal of the Palestinian cause. 
Citing Turkey's actions in northern Syria and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as its Libya intervention and contacts with Palestinian Hamas militants, Gantz said: ""All of this pushes away from stability"".
""Definitely the question of Turkey is a very complicated one, because Turkey is part of NATO,"" Gantz told the Zoom conference, which was organised by The Arab Council for Regional Integration, a group that encourages Israeli-Arab outreach.
""So we must take all the options that we have in our hands and try to influence it through international pressure to make sure that they are pulling their hands from direct terrorism.""
The Palestinians have been dismayed by Israel's diplomatic inroads in the Gulf, which side-step long-stalled talks on their statehood goal in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in Gaza.
Israel, like the United States, has argued that the deals with the UAE and Bahrain could usher in a Palestine deal too. 

""We just want to make sure that we find the right balance between maintaining our security and enabling Palestinian sovereignty,"" Gantz said.

The Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) said it will notify international oil companies to bar vessels without valid certificates after the three months expire.
Most of the vessels that use Nigerian waters are owned by foreign companies. They mostly transport crude oil for international oil companies. 
The regulator said the new regime would also apply to vessels whose licences have already expired.
The government is pushing to boost revenue and increase it foreign exchange earnings after the new coronavirus pandemic triggered a collapse in the price of oil, Nigeria's main export.
Levies -- import duties and shipping charges including taxes -- are big revenue earners for Nigeria, which relies on international trade, especially oil exports.
Danish shipping and oil group A.P. Moller-Maersk (CO:MAERSKb) and French shipping group  Bourbon  (PA:GPBN) are among international shipping companies active in Nigeria.

The assault took place nearly one year after a far-right gunman attacked a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle on the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas denounced the Hamburg attack as anti-Semitic and called on Germans to show more civil courage.
""This is not an isolated incident, this is disgusting anti-Semitism and we must all oppose it!,"" Maas said in a tweet.
A police spokesman said the 29-year-old attacker was accused of causing grievous bodily harm. The attacker seemed to have acted alone so there was no further threat, he added.
The motive was unclear, the police spokesman said.
The 29-year-old victim suffered serious head injuries after the suspect assaulted him with a shovel, German media reported.
The suspect was wearing military clothes reminiscent of the outfit of the neo-Nazi attacker in Halle, the media reported.

The right-wing gunman attacked the synagogue in Halle on Oct. 9 last year and shot two bystanders after failing to enter the building. The suspect Stephan B. confessed to the crime and is standing trial.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people marched through the centre of the Belarusian capital Minsk on Sunday to demand that authorities free political prisoners, prompting police to turn water cannon on them.
The march is the latest in a series of rallies in Belarus since an Aug. 9 election in which President Alexander Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory. His opponents say it was rigged to hand him a sixth term in power.
More than 100,000 people rallied in Minsk, the opposition news channel Nexta said on the messaging app Telegram. Official estimates are usually lower.
The crowd, waving white flags with a red stripe, which have become the symbol of the Belarusian opposition, marched to the beat of drums towards detention centres, pictures and videos posted on social media showed.
""Let them out,"" the crowd chanted by the walls of Okrestina detention centre, where some protesters and Lukashenko's opponents are believed to be held.
Lukashenko is struggling to contain nearly two months of street protests that pose the biggest challenge to his 26-year rule. More than 13,000 people have been arrested and some later freed, while major opposition figures have been jailed or exiled. 
Belarusian police on Sunday used water cannon mounted on armoured police vehicles to disperse protesters and detained scores of protesters, Interfax news agency reported and videos on social media showed.
Armed policemen in black helmets holding batons cordoned off streets in central Minsk, while some metro stations temporarily closed their doors for commuters.
The authorities temporarily ordered slower internet speed, which was restored late on Sunday. Telegram channels, the main means of communication and distribution of photos and videos from the protests, asked residents of Minsk to unlock their Wifi networks if protesters march nearby.
Other cities in Belarus also saw rallies against Lukashenko on Sunday.
The political crisis in Belarus has caused broad repercussions for Minsk and its ally Moscow. The European Union and the United States has imposed sanctions on senior Belarusian officials, but spared Lukashenko.
The crisis has also raised the possibility of more sanctions against Moscow if it helps Lukashenko. The rouble has already dropped steeply at the prospect.

Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and was inaugurated in late September in a ceremony held without any prior announcement, bringing more protests and condemnation from the European Union, the United States and Britain.

The deal, ratified on Saturday in the South Sudanese capital, Juba, was focussed on resolving conflicts in the western Darfur region and southern states of Blue Nile and South Kordofan. 
Groups from other regions also signed, but some in the east say the two factions that participated in the ""eastern track"" of the peace process do not represent political forces on the ground.
The deal is aimed at ending decades of conflict in Sudan and uniting the country behind a political transition following the ouster of former leader Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.
However, the two most active groups in the west and the south did not sign, and analysts say that during negotiations, local communities were not widely consulted by military and civilian authorities now sharing power.
Politics in eastern Sudan are volatile because of violent tribal tensions that affected Port Sudan and Kassala recently, positioning by regional powers including wealthy Gulf states, and anger over a long-running economic crisis and the failure of public services.
Workers at the southern port, Sudan's main sea terminal for containers, and at Suakin port to the south, were on strike over the peace deal, said Aboud el-Sherbiny, head of the Port Sudan Workers Union.
""We demand the cancellation of the 'eastern track' and the agreement that was signed yesterday in Juba because this track expresses an external agenda,"" he said.
""We will take escalatory steps if this demand is not met.""

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's presidential candidates faced off late on Saturday in the first all-party campaign debate in almost two decades, but analysts chided the runners as having forgotten how to hold a proper discourse after a tepid event.
The landlocked Andean nation is headed for elections on Oct. 18, a re-run of a fraught vote last year that sparked deadly protests and led to the resignation of leader Evo Morales. The leftist did not participate in election debates since 2002.
In a televised debate focused on the country's economic future, the seven presidential candidates largely stuck to laying out their policy platforms, with few clashes or exchanges between the runner, despite a background of political tensions.
""We are not used to debating,"" one analyst wrote in local media in response to the event. ""A debate must have a confrontation on a specific issue... It ended in a boring way with each of the candidates just repeating their script.""
Gonzalo Chávez, another political analyst, said the fact Morales had eschewed debates while in power between 2006-2019 had weakened the space for political discourse.
""There was great expectation of a tough debate, but there was no such thing,"" Chávez said.
Bolivia's 7 million voters will go the polls in a fortnight, with the ballot overshadowed by a tough economic outlook and the coronavirus pandemic, which has hit the country hard.
The candidate for Morales' socialist MAS party, Luis Arce, currently leads polls ahead of centrist Carlos Mesa, though forecasts indicate there would need to be a second-round run-off between the pair. Morales himself is living in Argentina.
There is another debate planned for Sunday night, though the candidate for MAS is not yet confirmed to attend.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia razed a U.S.-built building on its largest naval base to allow for further expansion and will relocate the demolished facility, Cambodia's government said on Sunday, denying reports of Chinese involvement in the redevelopment.
The Pentagon had said it was concerned about reports that the U.S.-funded Cambodian Navy tactical headquarters facility at Ream had been demolished and had asked the Cambodian government for an explanation. The building, roughly 30 metres (100 feet) long, had housed several small patrol boats.
""Cambodia razed the US-built facility at Ream Naval Base, for the building requires renovations,"" Prime Minister Hun Sen's office said in a Tweet.
Defence ministry spokesman Chhum Socheat said the facility was being moved to a new location at Koh Preap near the port of Sihanoukville to make way for an expansion of the naval base at Ream because ""a lot of ships will need to dock"".
Nikkei Asia quoted a senior Cambodian naval official as saying China was helping with the expansion, but Chhum Socheat said China was not helping.
Last year the Pentagon asked Cambodia to explain why it turned down an offer to repair the base, saying the decision had raised speculation of possible plans for hosting China's military. 
The Cambodian government has repeatedly denied reports that China had reached a secret deal with Cambodia to let it place forces at the base, saying that hosting foreign forces would be against Cambodia's constitution.
Cambodia is one of China's closest allies in Southeast Asia and has received billions of dollars of Chinese aid as well as political backing for Hun Sen in the face of Western criticism.
Cambodia has been wary of superpower rivalry since being devastated by fighting between U.S. and Chinese proxy forces in the 1970s that culminated in the Khmer Rouge genocide.

BISHOFTU, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Thousands of people from the Oromo, Ethiopia's largest ethnic group, celebrated their thanksgiving festival in Bishoftu city amid tight security on Sunday after the authorities said they had seized weapons and foiled attacks in previous days.
The Irreecha festival has been the scene of violent protests before by the Oromo, who have long complained of political exclusion. Recent unrest, including the killing of a popular singer in June and the arrest of prominent Oromo politicians, heightened concern of violence at the two-day festival. 
On the eve of the festival, forces from both regional and federal police, as well from the army, descended on Bishoftu in large numbers. 
There were at least 10 checkpoints by the main lakeside site of the celebrations, and only those with special badges could enter. 
""Irreecha has been a platform used by people to express their anger and outrage...that is why this time around they deny people to celebrate this year,"" said Abdi Fikadu, 26, a health professional.
On the eve of celebrations, police officials in Bishoftu stopped a group of youths at a bar singing and dancing to songs by Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, the musician killed in June, a Reuters witness said. Others were prevented from attending the festival. 
Dawit Dugama, 25, came all the way from Addis Ababa along with nine friends to take part the festival. They were told they could not join the crowds without a badge. 
""We were told that we can't be part of the celebration because we don't have badge. This is the government's way to suppress peoples' voices,"" he said.
At the festival in 2016, more than 50 people were killed in a stampede triggered when police used teargas and shot in the air to disperse anti-government protesters. 
The festival passed without incident in the capital Addis Ababa on Saturday, again amid very tight security.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed thanked organisers and participants for celebrating peacefully in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Sunday.
Police and intelligence services foiled what they said were plans to incite violence in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia ahead of the festival, state-affiliated Fana Broadcasting reported on Friday. 
A day earlier, Oromiya's regional police arrested 503 people on accusations they planned to cause violence during the festival and seized guns and hand grenades.

Dressed in traditional white costumes, some wearing masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19, people marched chanting slogans while flashing the Oromo protest gesture.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Sunday that the COVID-19 pandemic was the latest crisis to prove that market forces alone and ""trickle-down"" economic policies had failed to produce the social benefits their proponents claim.
In an encyclical on the theme of human fraternity, Francis also said private property cannot be considered an absolute right in all cases where some lived extravagantly while others had nothing.
Called ""Fratelli Tutti"" (Brothers All), the encyclical's title prompted criticism for not using inclusive language after it was announced last month.
In Italian, Fratelli means brothers but it is also used to mean brothers and sisters. The Vatican said it was taken from the ""Admonitions"", or guidelines, written by St Francis of Assisi in the 13th century to his followers and could not be changed.
The pope says in the first line of the 86-page encyclical that St. Francis had ""addressed his brothers and sisters"" that way. In the document, he uses the term ""men and women"" 15 times and speaks several times about defending the rights and dignity of women.
Encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal writing but they are not infallible.
The encyclical, which Francis signed in Assisi on Saturday, covers topics such as fraternity, immigration, the rich-poor gap, economic and social injustices, healthcare imbalances and the widening political polarisation in many countries.
The pope took direct aim at trickle-down economics, the theory favoured by conservatives that tax breaks and other incentives for big business and the wealthy eventually will benefit the rest of society through investment and job creation.
""There were those who would have had us believe that freedom of the market was sufficient to keep everything secure (after the pandemic hit),"" he wrote. 
Francis denounced ""this dogma of neo-liberal faith"" that resorts to ""the magic theories of 'spillover' or 'trickle' ... as the only solution to societal problems"". A good economic policy, he said, ""makes it possible for jobs to be created and not cut"".
'EMPIRE OF MONEY'
The 2007-2008 financial crisis was a missed opportunity for change, instead producing ""increased freedom for the truly powerful, who always find a way to escape unscathed"". Society must confront ""the destructive effects of the empire of money"".
Francis repeated past calls for redistribution of wealth to help the poorest and for fairer access to natural resources by all.
""The right to private property can only be considered a secondary natural right, derived from the principle of the universal destination of created goods,"" he said.
A Vatican official said the pope was referring to those with massive wealth. 
The pope wrote that the belief of early Christians - ""that if one person lacks what is necessary to live with dignity, it is because another person is detaining it"" - was still valid.
Those with much must ""administer it for the good of all"" and rich nations are obliged to share wealth with poor ones. But he said he was ""certainly not proposing an authoritarian and abstract universalism"".
Some ultra-traditionalist Catholics have accused Francis of secretly backing a perceived plot for a ""One-World Government,"" a debunked conspiracy theory.
Without naming countries or people, Francis condemned politicians who ""seek popularity by appealing to the basest and most selfish inclinations"" or who enact policies of ""hatred and fear towards other nations"".
Addressing racism, a key issue in the United States following the Black Lives Matter movement, Francis 
said: ""Racism is a virus that quickly mutates and, instead of disappearing, goes into hiding, and lurks in waiting.""

He repeated calls for the abolition of nuclear weapons and the death penalty, positions which have been assailed by conservative Catholics, particularly in the United States.

PARIS (Reuters) - Voters on the South Pacific archipelago of New Caledonia were on course to reject breaking away from France after nearly 170 years of colonial rule in a referendum on Sunday, partial results showed.
With votes from 249 out of 304 polling stations tallied, the partial results showed the ""no"" camp ahead with 54.8% support and expanding its lead as results came in from the capital, Noumea, traditionally a bastion of pro-Paris loyalty.
If the ""no"" vote is confirmed, it would be the second failed attempt by pro-independence supporters to gain full sovereignty in the past two years.
A surprise ""yes"" vote would deprive Paris of a foothold in a region where China is expanding its influence and dent the pride of a country whose former empire once spanned sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific Ocean
Tensions have long run deep between pro-independence indigenous Kanaks and descendants of colonial settlers who remain loyal to Paris. 
More than 180,000 long-term residents of New Caledonia are registered to vote ""yes"" or ""no"" on the question: ""Do you want New Caledonia to gain its full sovereignty and become independent?""
Sunday's referendum was the second of up to three permitted under the terms of the 1998 Noumea Accord, an agreement enshrined in France's constitution and which set out a 20-year path towards decolonisation.
Turnout was high - the partial results showed 86% of eligible voters had cast a ballot - after a stronger-than-expected independence vote in the 2018 referendum. 
New Caledonia, an island chain some 1,200 km (750 miles) east of Australia and 20,000 km (12,500 miles) from Paris, enjoys a large degree of autonomy but depends heavily on France for matters such as defence and education.
Its economy is underpinned by annual French subsidies of some 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) and nickel deposits that are estimated to represent 25% of the world’s total, and tourism.
The territory has, however, largely cut itself off from the outside world to shield itself from the coronavirus. It has registered only 27 cases of COVID-19.
If the ""no vote"" wins, a third referendum can be held within two years if a third of the local assembly votes in favour.

Sheikh Nawaf assumed power after the death last Tuesday of his brother Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad. The late emir balanced his nation's ties between larger neighbours Saudi Arabia and Iran and kept a strong relationship with the United States, which led a coalition that ended Iraq's 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait.
""He will be remembered as a great man and a special friend to the United States,"" U.S. Defence Secretary Mark Esper said in comments tweeted by the U.S. Embassy during his visit.
Kuwait's state news agency said Sheikh Nawaf also received Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who had lauded the late emir for fostering ""moderation and balance"".
Sheikh Nawaf, 83, is expected to uphold the OPEC member state's oil and foreign policy, which promoted regional detente.
He has yet to name a crown prince to help guide state affairs at a time when low crude prices and COVID-19 have hit state finances and amid tensions between foes Riyadh and Tehran.
The emir has up to a year to name an heir but analysts expect a decision in coming weeks as senior al-Sabah dynasty members jostle for position. Parliament must approve the choice.
""An appointment would end this competition and send a signal of stability,"" Dr. Mohamed Alfili, a professor of constitutional law at Kuwait University, told Reuters.
Among mooted candidates are Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmad, a former defence minister; Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad, a former premier; and Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Jaber, deputy chief of the National Guard.
Another potential contender is Sheikh Mohammed Sabah al-Salem, a former foreign minister and the only candidate under discussion from the less powerful al-Salem family branch.
Kuwaiti sources say Meshal, the eldest among them, appears most likely to get the role.

Saudi Arabi's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman called Sheikh Meshal on Saturday to offer his condolences, the Saudi state news agency reported.

President Sooronbai Jeenbekov's supporters look likely to win a significant number of seats in the legislature in the Central Asian country, a close ally of Russia.
But the current pro-presidential ruling coalition is certain to be upset due to internal splits in the two major political groups, testing the president's ability to forge new political alliances.
""There is less and less democracy, systemic opposition is virtually non-existent,"" Nasyrbek Attokulov, a 50-year-old university lecturer, said after casting his ballot in Bishkek. 
The campaign was marred by allegations of vote-buying, and an August opinion poll ordered by the U.S.-backed International Republican Institute showed that 15% of respondents favoured the idea of voting against all parties.
A total of 16 parties are contesting 120 seats in the single-chamber parliament. If none of them wins more votes than the ""Against all"" option, a new election would have to be called.
The economy and corruption topped voters' concerns. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development expects Kyrgyzstan's gross domestic product to plunge 9.5% in 2020 due to the pandemic and take years to recover.
""The economic situation is terrible,"" said a businessman, who identified himself only by his first name Kanat, speaking at a polling station where officials let in voters in small groups after measuring their temperature as a coronavirus precaution.
""We need to establish the rule of law.""
The country of 6.5 million people has a history of political turmoil: in the past 15 years, two presidents have been toppled by revolts and a third is in prison after falling out with his successor.
Further instability would be a concern to Russia. Moscow operates a military airbase in the former Soviet republic and is already dealing with major crises involving its allies Belarus and Armenia.
Two parties that won more than a half of the seats in the 2015 election have split ahead of Sunday's vote, and some of their MPs including Jeenbekov's closest allies are seeking reelection under new banners.

Results of the election are likely to be known on Sunday night or on Monday, but given the fractured nature of the parties, it could be days or weeks before a government is formed.

Many of the demonstrators who flocked to the massive main square of the capital's historic center waved Mexican flags while some chanted ""Lopez out,"" according to video footage on news sites and social media.
Though polls show the leftist president remains popular, his management of the economy and record on security have upset many Mexicans, as has his tendency to polarize political debate between his supporters and critics.
Before becoming president in December 2018, Lopez Obrador was renowned for leading massive protests against the government and he said this week such displays of discontent by ""conservative"" critics showed he was shaking up the country.
Estimates of the number of demonstrators at Saturday's peaceful protest varied. 

Authorities in Mexico City, which Lopez Obrador's party governs, said 8,000 took part, while one of the opposition groups behind it, which has called for Lopez Obrador to resign, said more than 150,000 participated.

New legal routes will be created for those who are at genuine risk of harm, and foreign criminals and asylum seekers who are not at risk will be deported, the report added.
""Currently, everybody that comes to our country and makes an asylum claim, they are treated the same, irrespective of the route through which they have entered our country - and that simply isn't right,"" Patel said in an interview with the London-based newspaper.
Earlier this week, the British government came under fire after media reports revealed it had studied housing asylum seekers on disused oil rigs, banishing them to camps in Moldova or Papua New Guinea, or building floating walls in the sea to keep them out.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalan authorities sent more than 3,000 Honduran migrants back to their home country over the past few days, they said on Saturday, dissolving much of a caravan heading north even while dwindling groups continued the trek toward the United States.
Thousands of caravan members had crossed into Guatemala from Honduras without authorization last Thursday, pushing past troops at the border as they sought to escape poverty exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. 
As many as 2,800 people crossed the border in the initial incident, according to Guatemala's government. 
Since then and on Saturday, 3,586 migrants had ""opted to return,"" the government said. 
Still, some appeared to press on toward Mexico. By Saturday evening, some 150 migrants were at a shelter in Tecun Uman, close to the Mexico border, while about 200 migrants were on the road in the Izabal region, between Honduras and Peten, Guatemalan migration authorities said.
Vice Minister of Foreign Relations Eduardo Sanchez called on the government of neighboring Honduras to step up efforts to stop the flow of migrants headed to the United States, calling the caravan a health risk amid the pandemic. 
Honduras has not ""assumed the responsibility to take preventative actions to avoid the problem,"" Sanchez said in a statement. 
Honduras' Vice Foreign Minister Nelly Jerez said the government was working to prevent people from migrating illegally, including efforts to improve the economy and security.
On Saturday morning, the Honduran migration institute said it had registered 533 people who returned after setting out for Guatemala. 
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has taken steps to curb illegal immigration to avoid clashing with his U.S. counterpart, Donald Trump, has suggested that the caravan's departure from Honduras had been timed to coincide with the U.S. election. 
Mexican migration authorities have warned that any migrants who were to knowingly put others at risk of infection could face jail.

Trump insulted and threatened Mexico repeatedly in his 2015-16 election campaign and has made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority during his presidency.

In late September, President Bah Ndaw, a retired colonel appointed president of the transition, named veteran diplomat Moctar Ouane as interim prime minister.
The men will be tasked with overseeing an 18-month transition back to civilian rule after the Aug. 18 overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.

Since winning power with an election campaign built on a promise to get Brexit finished and start fixing regional imbalances and ageing infrastructure, Johnson's leadership has been forced to take a different course by the COVID-19 outbreak.
His efforts to control the spread of the virus have been widely criticised, and the deal on trade with the European Union he hoped to secure easily is now in serious doubt. Both have caused public confidence in his leadership to fall.
But looking ahead to the next Queen's Speech - in which the monarch sets out which laws the government intends to pass in the coming year - Johnson's office promised to return to the priorities that helped him win an 80-seat majority in December.
""We were elected to get Brexit done and unleash Britain’s potential,"" the office said in a statement issued to coincide with the Conservative Party annual conference.
“The Prime Minister has been clear that we will not be blown off course in our plans to build back better and that’s just what our next Queen's Speech will do.”
No date has been set for the Queen's Speech, which typically happens once a year. Although it is read by Queen Elizabeth, the speech is written by the government and often used to signal what policy priorities it has for the next 12 months.
Jacob Rees-Mogg, who is in charge of parliamentary business for the Conservatives, has written to the cabinet asking for ""bold and ambitious"" plans, the government statement said.

The speech will include bills on criminal justice, planning and animal welfare, the government said.

The street protests, just three days after parliament approved an edict to limit the scope of such demonstrations, kept pressure on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over his handling of the coronavirus crisis and over allegations of corruption, which he denies.
The new law bans Israelis from holding demonstrations more than 1 km (about half a mile) from their homes and forces stricter social distancing, a measure the government said was aimed at curbing COVID-19 infections. Critics have called it a blow to freedom of speech.
Most protests on Saturday night were small and scattered throughout the country, though a crowd of thousands gathered in Tel Aviv. A small number of protesters scuffled with police and tried to block city streets. About fifteen people were arrested, a police spokesman said.

Israel has shut down much of its economy and instructed people to stay within a kilometre of their homes whenever possible in an effort to contain a second-wave surge in coronavirus infections.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah on Saturday accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz but asked him to stay on as a caretaker premier until he designates a successor to oversee parliamentary elections on Nov. 10, state media said.
The monarch dissolved parliament last Sunday at the end of its four-year term in a move that under constitutional rules meant the government had to resign within a week. 
A new government will pave the way for the November vote, as the country grapples with the rapid spread of COVID-19 infections over the last month for which the last government had been widely criticised.
King Abdullah appointed Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz in the summer of 2018 to defuse the biggest protests in years over tax increases sought by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce Jordan’s large public debt.
The monarch told Razzaz in a letter accepting his resignation that mistakes were made in the handling of the pandemic, echoing medical fears the health care system could come to the brink of collapse if the community spread gets out of control.
Jordan reported 1,099 new cases on Saturday bringing the cumulative total to 14,749 infections with 88 deaths. 
The monarch hopes a wider shake-up and a new assembly can ease popular disenchantment over economic hardships worsened by the blow of COVID-19 and limits on civil and political freedoms under emergency laws.
The authorities have arrested hundreds of teacher activists after dissolving their opposition-led elected union last July and detained scores of dissidents for criticism on social media
Jordan’s economy is expected to shrink by 6% this year as it tackles its worst economic crisis in many years, with unemployment and poverty aggravated by the pandemic.
The elections will however not usher political reforms because of a law that keeps intact a system that limits the representation of those of Palestinian origin in favour of native Jordanians who are the backbone of the country’s political establishment.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - India's federal police will investigate the alleged gang rape of a young woman in northern Uttar Pradesh state whose death sparked nationwide protests, the local government said in a statement on Saturday.
The 19-year-old Dalit woman died of her injuries earlier this week, triggering protests by both opposition political parties and the public in New Delhi and elsewhere against atrocities against a community often ostracized under India's centuries-old caste system.
India is one of the world's most dangerous places for women, with a rape occurring on average every 15 minutes based on federal data. In December 2012, the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman sparked nationwide outrage and led to a tough new anti-rape law.
The chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party, has asked federal police, the Central Bureau of Investigation, to investigate the alleged rape, which occurred in its Hathras district, a government statement said.
Uttar Pradesh's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has faced criticism in recent days for not allowing media and opposition parties to speak with the family of the dead woman.
Public criticism grew after the family of the victim said her body had been cremated by police without their consent, an allegation officials deny. [nL4N2GR3LN]
On Saturday, hundreds of police officers barricaded a highway connecting the capital New Delhi to Hathras. Several opposition leaders also drove out to meet the victim's family.

In India's eastern Kolkata and Bhubaneswar cities, political parties and women organisations marched in protest against the incident and demanded justice for the woman, video footage from ANI news agency showed.

""Fariba Adelkhah has come out (of prison) on leave with an electronic ankle bracelet,"" Saeid Dehghan said in a tweet, without giving any other details of the release. 
There was no immediate official statement on the case from Iran's judiciary.
France had in June demanded that Adelkhah, 61, an anthropologist held since 2019, be released immediately, saying her detention was harming trust between the two countries.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
In March, Iran granted temporary release to British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe along with thousands of other prisoners following concerns over the spread of the coronavrirus in prisons.
In March, Iran and France carried out a prisoner swap, exchanging academic Roland Marchal for engineer Jalal Ruhollahnejad. 
However, since then there had been little sign that Adelkhah would be released and she was sentenced in May to six years in prison on security-related charges.
Relations between France and Iran have improved over the last year but remain tense due to Iran’s nuclear activities, its ballistic missile programme and regional activities.

The election for regional governments saw 38% of eligible voters turn out, as novel coronavirus case numbers around the country soar. The turn-out was even higher than the 34% recorded in the previous regional elections four years ago.
One third of seats in the Czech parliament's upper chamber, the Senate, were also contested, with 37% of voters arriving for the first round. The final round is scheduled in one week.
""I would like to thank all my fellow citizens. It is amazing that they were not afraid and they voted,"" Babis said.
Support for his party in opinion polls had ticked lower amid criticism over his perceived reluctance to bring back tough measures to fight the pandemic and over other policy inconsistencies hurting public trust.
Earlier this week, the government called a state of emergency from Oct. 5 and imposed measures including limiting gatherings and banning musicals and operas to curb the coronavirus before it overwhelms the health system.
The Czech Republic's spike in virus cases was the second-largest in Europe in September when adjusted for population, with more than 40,000 cases logged during the month.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia told residents on Saturday to stay away from a pristine beach in the Far East due to unexplained water pollution that Greenpeace said was evidence of an ""ecological disaster"" and had caused some surfers to break into a fever and vomit. 
The cause of the pollution off the coast of Kamchatka region was not immediately clear. Authorities said preliminary tests had found elevated levels of oil products and the chemical phenol and Greenpeace told them to urgently find the source. 
""The only thing it is possible to say now is there are contaminative substances in the water. Final tests are not ready yet,"" Kamchatka's regional governor Vladimir Solodov said. 
Greenpeace suggested the pollution could have happened weeks ago. 
It said the pollution was noticed over the course of several weeks by people on Khalaktyrsky beach, a section of Pacific coastline covered with black volcanic sand that is dozens of kilometers long and popular with tourists.
""The water... has changed colour and become unsafe for people's health. For several weeks people who were in contact with the water have experienced negative consequences,"" it said in a statement. 
After getting into the water, people have complained of sore throats, worsening eyesight, dry eyes, nausea, physical weakness, vomiting and fever, it said. 
Dead octopuses and other sea life could be seen washed up on the beach in videos posted on Instagram and reposted by Greenpeace. Reuters could not immediately confirm that the videos showed current environmental damage from the scene.
""The fact that dead animals can be found along the entire coastline confirms the seriousness of the situation,"" Greenpeace said.
Local authorities said on Saturday they had inspected the beach and that the animals had washed up because of a storm. 
Earlier this week, the region's acting natural resources minister Alexei Kumarkov said tests showed levels of oil products and phenol were 3.6 and 2.5 times higher than the norm.

The Faxon, carrying around 234,000 barrels of fuel, was directly north of Venezuela's northeastern Sucre state as of 9:37 a.m. local time (1:37 p.m. GMT) on Saturday, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The second vessel, the Fortune, had docked at western Venezuela's Amuay port on Friday, the data showed. 
The flotilla was the second group of fuel tankers Iran has sent this year to Venezuela, a once-prosperous OPEC nation now experiencing gasoline shortages due to years of underinvestment and lack of maintenance at its refineries, and U.S. sanctions on state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela.
The shortages have led to snaking, sometimes days-long lines outside PDVSA gas stations. Together with unreliable water, power, and cooking gas supplies, the shortages have prompted a new wave of protests as discontent intensifies in Venezuela's near-abandoned interior.
Washington sanctioned PDVSA last year as part of its push to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen an economic collapse in his six-year tenure and is accused of human rights violations, corruption and rigging his 2018 re-election. Maduro says the United States is seeking to steal Venezuela's oil riches.
Iran's oil industry is also under U.S. sanctions over the country's nuclear program, and the growing cooperation between the two countries this year has alarmed U.S. authorities. But the three tankers - just like a flotilla of five tankers that Iran sent between May and June - arrived without incident.

The first tanker in the current group, the Forest, docked at central Venezuela's El Palito port on Tueday.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - A French attempt to relaunch peace talks over Nagorno-Karabakh showed no sign of a breakthrough on Saturday as Azerbaijan blamed Armenia for re-igniting their decades-old conflict.
Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave inside Azerbaijan, said Azeri forces had again launched rockets towards its main city, Stepanakert, a week after the opposing sides began pounding each other with tanks and missiles.
The clashes are the worst since the 1990s, raising the risk of a wider regional war that could draw in Russia and Turkey amid deepening concern about stability in the South Caucasus, where pipelines carry Azeri oil and gas to world markets. 
""Fierce battles continue along the entire front,"" the Azeri defence ministry said on the seventh day of fighting with ethnic Armenian forces.
French President Emmanuel Macron spoke on Friday with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia - which backs Nagorno-Karabakh - and said later in a statement he had proposed a new way to restart talks. 
""The president of Azerbaijan placed the entire responsibility on the leadership of Armenia for the break-off of negotiations and the armed confrontation,"" Aliyev's press service said. Armenia says it was Azerbaijan that reopened the conflict by launching a major offensive on Sept. 27.
Armenia had said on Friday it was willing to engage with Russia, the United States and France - co-chairs of the so-called Minsk Group of the OSCE security organisation - on renewing a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh.
But Aliyev told Al Jazeera in an interview on Friday that the Minsk group had failed for the past three decades to make progress over the dispute.
He said Azerbaijan was not ignoring ceasefire calls, but this could only be achieved if ethnic Armenian forces withdrew from Azeri territories - a reference to Nagorno-Karabakh and seven surrounding regions they have controlled since the 1990s.
""(The) conditions must be that they withdraw from the territories. We need our territories back by peaceful means and we demonstrated for 28 years our willingness to have a peaceful settlement,"" Aliyev said.
Some 200 people have been reported killed in the past week and the toll may be considerably higher, as Azerbaijan has not disclosed its military losses.
Violence first broke out over Nagorno-Karabakh in 1988, when both Armenia and Azerbaijan were still part of the Soviet Union, and some 30,000 people were killed before a 1994 ceasefire.
The International Committee of the Red Cross voiced alarm at civilian deaths and injuries, including of children.

""People have been in touch with the ICRC, terrified for themselves and their families and at a loss as to where to go or what to do to stay safe,"" it said. It added it was concerned about the risk of a surge in COVID-19 cases from people hiding for hours in shelters or crowding together with poor sanitation.

The encyclical, titled ""Fratelli Tutti"" (Brothers All), will be released on Sunday. It covers solidarity among people in the post-pandemic world.
The title has prompted criticism, particularly in the English-speaking world, where it was seen as not being inclusive.
In Italian, fratelli means brothers but it is also used to mean brothers and sisters, as is the masculine plural in other romance languages.
The Vatican said the title was taken from the first two words of guidelines, known as ""Admonitions"", written by St Francis to his followers in the 13th century and thus could not be changed.
The pope always uses ""brothers and sisters"" to open his weekly general audiences on Wednesdays and his Sunday blessing.
Encyclicals are the most authoritative form of papal writing but they are not infallible.
Because it deals with social issues, ""Fratelli Tutti"" is what is known as a social encyclical, as opposed to those about Church doctrine.
When he was elected in 2013, the Argentine pope took his papal name after the saint to show his closeness to the poor. St. Francis is known as ""The Little Poor One"" because he renounced his wealthy family to serve the needy.

The pope signed the encyclical after saying Mass in the crypt where the saint in buried in the basilica of the hill town in Umbria.

Obaidullah Shinwari, the Nangarhar provincial council's member, said 52 people were injured in the blast.

Ministry of Interior spokesman Tariq Arian blamed the insurgent Taliban for the attack, saying in the last two weeks they had carried 650 attacks which had killed 69 civilians and wounded 141 people.

Afghan government negotiators are holding talks with the insurgent Taliban in their political capital of Doha in attempts to end decades of conflict, but calls by the government and international community for a ceasefire or reduction in violence have so far been rejected by the Taliban. 
Violence has escalated since a reduction in violence period that led up to the United States signing a troop withdrawal with the group, designed to usher the way to peace negotiations, in February. 

The Ministry of Interior also said in a Tweet that Afghan forces had killed a key member of the Taliban and arrested five others on Friday night in northern Balkh province.

Some 4.8 million people are barred from leaving the capital area, while restaurants and bars must shut early and reduce capacity by half. 
The new restrictions, which started on Friday evening, are not as strict as the previous lockdown in March, when people were barred from leaving their homes. 
However, authorities advised residents not to move around unless absolutely necessary. Travel is banned except for work, school, health or shopping. 
""There are fewer people then we're used to, shops are empty, bars are empty, there's a feeling of sadness,"" said Valerio Rojo, director of the Circulo de Bellas Artes cultural organisation.

""Today, we had a reservation through Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG) and they cancelled just an hour before saying they were not going to travel because of the restrictions."" 
The latest measures ordered by the Socialist-led central government were reluctantly imposed by the conservative-led Madrid government, which said they would cripple the economy. 
Madrid's bars and restaurants must close at 11 p.m. instead of 1 a.m, while restaurants, gyms and shops must cut capacity by half. Gatherings of more than six people remain banned. 
Near the Plaza Mayor square, usually packed with tourists on a Saturday lunchtime, waiter Luis stood, menu in hand, trying to drum up business.
""No one is walking past here,"" he said. ""I don't know how much longer we are going to keep our jobs."" 
With 850 cases per 100,000 people, according to the World Health Organization, the Madrid area has Europe's worst rate.

Eric Ciotti, a member of French parliament who is from one of the worst affected villages in the area, Saint-Martin-Vésubie, said several villages were cut off as they are located in steep-sided valleys of the mountainous region. 
Meteo France said that rains of 450 mm (17.7 inches) of rain were registered over 24 hours in some areas - the equivalent of close to four months of rain at this time of the year.
There was more rainfall than on Oct. 3 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes, Jérémy Crunchant, the director of civil protection, told France Info. 
Venice, a long-delayed flood barrier system successfully protected the lagoon city from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing big relief following years of repeated inundations.

1115,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",East Asia allies likely to bide time as U.S. election looms over Pompeo trip,"By Humeyra Pamuk and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A warm welcome and expressions of solidarity against China likely await U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo next week when he visits East Asia for the first time in over a year, but the looming U.S. election means Asian allies will think twice before making concrete promises to Washington.
Pompeo heads for Japan, Mongolia and South Korea on Sunday at a time when U.S. ties with Beijing are at their worst in decades in the face of the coronavirus, which originated in China and has now infected President Donald Trump, his wife Melania and millions of other Americans.
An Oct. 6 gathering of Pompeo and his counterparts from Australia, Japan and India, dubbed the ""Quad,"" will likely be the highlight of the trip, even though the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, David Stilwell, conceded on Friday that the meeting would probably not produce a joint statement of intent, despite shared worries about China. 
Trump, who tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday night, has blamed China for unleashing the virus that has killed more than a million people around the world, and has made a hard line against Beijing a central part of his Nov. 3 re-election bid.
Most Asian allies have been pleased with Washington's toughness toward their regional rival, but have not so eagerly welcomed Trump and Pompeo's highly charged recent rhetoric and remain wary of going too far in openly antagonizing China.
""Everyone knows that the U.S. is the number-one security partner, but China is their number-one trading partner,"" said Miyeon Oh, an Asia security specialist at the Atlantic Council. ""The U.S. government is telling Asian countries, 'We are not asking you to make a choice,' but in the end, they are asking them to make a choice."" 
The U.S. election is another factor. Trump could lose to Democrat Joe Biden, or win re-election and potentially harden his stance on China. Until the results are in, Asian leaders are unlikely to make any significant moves.
Both Japan and South Korea will attempt a balancing act during Pompeo's trip, Oh said, careful not to stick their necks out too far to upset China, while also expressing support for the United States, in case Trump wins.
Pompeo may, however, be asked in private to dial down the tone.
""There are very, very powerful political leaders, business leaders who do not trust China, who want the U.S. to work with Japan and India and Australia to counter China, but they want to keep making money off China and they don't want such a confrontational approach,"" said Mike Green, an Asia expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies.
""I think with Pompeo behind the scenes they're going to say, basically 'Speak softly; carry a big stick, but speak softly.'""
BALANCING ACT
Pompeo has led the rhetorical assault on China, accusing Beijing of covering up the COVID-19 outbreak and of using nefarious means to attempt to displace the United States as the world's leading power, while brutally oppressing religious minorities and political opponents. 
He has also infuriated Beijing, which has been an important player in U.S.-led attempts to persuade North Korea to denuclearize, by increasing U.S. engagement with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province that it has vowed to reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary.
Rising tensions over Taiwan have led some analysts to speculate China might be tempted to take advantage of a contested U.S. election to realize this goal and have also generated suggestions that Pompeo should consider an unannounced stop in Taipei to underline U.S. support.
If he did, he would be the most senior U.S. official to visit the island since Washington switched recognition to Beijing from Taipei in 1979. China would see such a move as an enormous provocation. 
Asked about such rumors on Friday, Stilwell did not specifically dismiss them, but said U.S. policy toward Taiwan had not changed and he had no additional travel to announce. 
Randall Schriver, until last year the top Pentagon official dealing with East Asia, said the fact there was bipartisan support in Washington for a tougher line on Beijing that would also prevail in the case of a Biden administration meant Pompeo could have more robust conversations.
The United States has accelerated efforts to cut back reliance on China for medical and security-related supply chains and lobbied hard to get allies to cut cooperation with telecoms giant Huawei and other Chinese technology firms.
While the Quad meeting may not yield a specific action plan, the very fact of its meeting would serve as a warning to China and play to its fears that it might one day grow into a formalized grouping as NATO had to contain the Soviet Union, Green at CSIS said.
Japan, which is embroiled in a dispute with China over ownership of islands in the East China Sea, has a new prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, who took office this month and has little diplomatic experience. 
He has to contend with maintaining working ties with Japan's bigger neighbor and U.S. demands for a tougher stance.
""If Japan takes a total confrontation approach ... there would be an uproar in Japan - Japanese public opinion is divided and it would shake the basis of the new Suga government,"" said Akio Takahara, a China specialist at the University of Tokyo.
South Korea, another U.S. ally engaged in bruising talks with the Trump administration over shared defense costs, has been skeptical of the Quad. It has responded coolly to the idea of South Korea joining the grouping or a more formal alliance.

""We are willing to engage in discussions on specific issues, but if that's a structured alliance, we will certainly think very hard about whether it serves our security interest,"" its foreign minister, Kang Kyung-wha, said this month.

1116,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>",Flood barrier successfully protects Venice from high tide,"VENICE, Italy (Reuters) - A long-delayed flood barrier system successfully protected Venice from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing big relief to the lagoon city after years of repeated inundations.
""Today, everything is dry,"" mayor Luigi Brugnaro said on Twitter. ""Pride and joy.""
The network of 78 bright yellow barriers that guard the entrance to the delicate Venetian lagoon lifted from the sea bed as the tide, driven by strong winds and rain, started to climb.
City officials had forecast a tide of 130 cm (4.27 ft), well below the devastating the 187 cm tide that battered Venice last November, but enough to leave low-lying areas deep under water.
However, when the expected peak came shortly after midday, the famed St. Marks Square, one of the first places in Venice to flood, remained largely dry.
The multi-billion-euro flood defence system, known as Mose, was due to come into service in 2011, but the project was plagued by corruption, cost overruns and prolonged delays.
It was finally tested in July and engineers deemed it was ready to use in bad weather.
Venice's floods, ""acqua alta"" (high water) in Italian, are caused by a combination of factors exacerbated by climate change - from rising sea levels and unusually high tides to land subsidence that has caused the ground level of the city to sink.

Mose is designed to protect Venice from tides of up to 3 metres, well beyond current records, but some experts worry it will be overwhelmed by the sort of rising seas that recent climate-change models have predicted.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has called for new European Union sanctions against Russia over the poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny with an internationally banned nerve agent.
Navalny emerged in recent weeks from a coma after suddenly falling ill during a flight in Siberia and being air-lifted to Berlin for treatment. German doctors say he was poisoned with Novichok, a Russian nerve agent.
Germany, France and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny's illness. Russia says it has seen no firm evidence he was poisoned and denies involvement in any attack on him.
""I am convinced that there will be no longer any way around sanctions,"" Maas told news portal t-online in an interview on Saturday.
""Sanctions must always be targeted and proportionate. But such a grave violation of the International Chemical Weapons Convention cannot be left unanswered. On this, we're united in Europe,"" Maas added.
Germany currently holds the rotating presidency of the 27-member bloc. EU leaders will discuss their reaction and possible sanctions against Russia at their next summit on Oct. 15-16.
""If the result of the German, Swedish and French laboratories is confirmed, there will be a clear response from the EU. I'm sure about that,"" Maas said.
The Navalny case has worsened relations between Moscow and a number of Western countries. Germany has faced calls to halt the nearly-completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is meant to bring more Russian gas directly to Germany. 
Asked if European sanctions against Russia should include Nord Stream 2, Maas said there were more than 100 European companies involved in the project, half of them in Germany.
""So many European workers would suffer from a construction freeze,"" Maas said.

Nord Stream 2 is led by Russia's state gas giant Gazprom (MCX:GAZP), with half of the funding provided by Germany's Uniper and BASF's Wintershall unit, Anglo-Dutch company Shell (LON:RDSa), Austria's OMV and France's Engie.

1118,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Canadian warship sails near Taiwan at time of heightened China tension,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Canadian warship has sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, the island's defence ministry said on Saturday, a voyage that comes at a time of heightened military tension between China and Taiwan and which could anger Beijing.
China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own territory, has stepped up its military activity around the island in the past few weeks, including sending fighter jets to cross the unofficial mid-way line buffer in the strait.
Taiwan's defence ministry said the Canadian corvette had sailed into the Taiwan Strait from the South China Sea and was heading in a northerly direction after leaving the waterway.
Taiwan's armed forces monitored the ship while it was in the strait, it said, adding that the situation was normal. The ministry did not elaborate.
Canada's navy has sailed through the Taiwan Strait before, including in September of last year.
The U.S. Navy has also been conducting regular passages through the strait. 
China tends to denounce such sailings. In August, its military labelled the guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin's sailing through the strait an ""extremely dangerous"" move.
China-Canada relations have soured since Canada arrested the chief financial officer of Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies, Meng Wanzhou, in late 2018.
She was arrested on a warrant from the United States charging her with bank fraud for misleading HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran and causing the bank to break U.S. sanctions law. China has demanded her release.
Soon after Meng's detention, China arrested Canadian citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig, charging them with espionage.

1120,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 03, 2020 04:21AM ET</span>",Salvini in court to head off migrant trial; Italy's right rallies round,"CATANIA, Italy (Reuters) - Italy's far-right leader Matteo Salvini went to court on Saturday to try to persuade a judge not to charge him with illegally detaining migrants at sea - a crime that carries a maximum 15-year prison term.
The high profile case centres on an incident in July 2019, when Salvini, the then interior minister, blocked more than 100 people aboard a coastguard ship for six days as he waited for European allies to agree to take them in.
Salvini, who heads the anti-immigrant League party, has looked to leverage maximum political gain from the legal battle, saying he had been acting in the national interest by slowing the flow of undocumented migrants from across the Mediterranean.
""Moving forward with my head held high, with confidence, certain to have always acted in the defence of the homeland and for the security of Italians,"" Salvini wrote on Twitter before entering the courtroom in eastern Sicily.
Judge Nuzio Sarpietro is presiding over the closed-door hearing and could order subsequent sittings. Corriere della Sera newspaper said he might want to interview Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte before deciding whether or not to indict Salvini.
It is not clear when a decision might come.
Magistrates on Sicily have put together a case arguing that Salvini effectively kidnapped the migrants, keeping them at sea in blazing summer weather until European allies buckled and agreed to resettle them.
Salvini has said the group was well treated on the coastguard ship and has stressed that Conte and the entire government backed his decision. The League leader pulled out of the coalition just two weeks later and is now in opposition.
Salvini has assembled all the League's parliamentarians in Catania ahead of the hearing in a show of solidarity, organising three days of debates on the future of Italy. Other prominent right-wing politicians also turned up to show their support.
""It is the duty ... of any minister to do what the majority of Italians have asked of him and defend the laws and borders of the nation,"" tweeted Giorgia Meloni, head of the Brothers of Italy party, posting a photograph of herself alongside Salvini.
The upper house Senate voted in February to lift Salvini's parliamentary immunity and let magistrates press charges. If the case eventually goes to trial and Salvini is found guilty he would be forced to step down as a senator.
Salvini was interior minister for a year and during that time focused much of his energy in trying to prevent migrants crossing the Mediterranean in search of a better life in Europe.

The numbers of newcomers fell dramatically while he was in office. They have risen in recent months but are nowhere near the levels seen in 2016, when more than 180,000 migrants reached Italy.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia said on Friday it would work with Russia, the United States and France on renewing a ceasefire in Nagorno-Karabakh as the death toll rose on the sixth day of fighting over the breakaway enclave in the South Caucasus.
Azerbaijan, which is fighting ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh, has not responded to a call for a ceasefire on Thursday by the three countries - co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group, which mediates in the crisis.
Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, ruled out talks with Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh on Tuesday, and Azerbaijan's ally Turkey said on Thursday the three big powers should have no role in peacemaking.
""It is obvious that Armenia is not interested in resolving the conflict through negotiations and is trying to annex the occupied territories,"" Azerbaijan's Foreign Ministry said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a statement he had spoken on the phone successively with the prime minister of Armenia, Nikol Pashinyan, and Azerbaijan's Aliyev, and had proposed a new method to restart talks within the Minsk group.
Macron said work would start from Friday evening, as he upped his efforts to broker mediation in his role as co-chair of the OSCE Minsk group.
The Armenian government said Pashinyan and Macron agreed that any use of foreign fighters and terrorists in the conflict was unacceptable, and Macron called for an immediate ceasefire.
Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of using foreign mercenaries in military operations.
Pashinyan also talked to Russian President Vladimir Putin.
In a third phone call in the six days since fighting broke out, Putin and Pashinyan expressed serious concern about the involvement of what the Kremlin termed illegal armed groups from the Middle East in the fighting.
Putin reiterated the need for an immediate ceasefire.
The senior U.S. diplomat for the region, Philip Reeker, will travel to Turkey, a NATO ally, on Saturday for talks on the situation in the Caucasus and other issues, the State Department said on Friday.
More fighting was reported overnight and throughout Friday. Nagorno-Karabakh's defence ministry reported 55 new military casualties, taking the death toll among its forces to 147. 
SHELLING
Eleven civilians have been reported killed and at least 67 wounded in the mountainous enclave, which is part of Azerbaijan but is run by its mostly ethnic Armenian inhabitants. 
The Azeri prosecutor's office said 20 civilians had so far been killed and 55 wounded in Armenian shelling. Azerbaijan has not reported on casualties among its military forces.
The OSCE called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to enable the repatriation of the remains of fallen servicemen.
Clashes broke out on Sunday between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh. The enclave is not recognised internationally as independent, and has been the subject of conflict since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
The fighting is more serious than at any time since a war in the 1990s in which 30,000 people were killed, and has deepened concern about stability in the South Caucasus, a region where pipelines carry Azeri oil and gas to world markets.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said European Union leaders discussed the crisis at a summit in Brussels and said a ceasefire was needed as soon as possible.
Armenia's Foreign Ministry said the country was ""committed to a resolution of the conflict through peaceful means.""
""We will continue to adamantly repel Azerbaijan's aggression but, at the same time, are also ready to engage with the OSCE Minsk Group co-chairs on a ceasefire based on the agreements of 1994-1995,"" it said, referring to an earlier ceasefire.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday that a lasting ceasefire could be achieved only if ""Armenian occupiers"" withdrew from Nagorno-Karabakh. Aliyev has said Armenia's demands over Nagorno-Karabakh are unacceptable.
""EVERYONE ... IS AFFECTED""
Pashinyan told U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien by telephone that a ceasefire would be impossible unless ""mercenaries and terrorists"" are removed from Nagorno-Karabakh.
France has accused Turkey of sending Syrian mercenaries to the tiny enclave and Russia has expressed concern about the alleged deployment of fighters from Syria and Libya. Turkey and Azerbaijan have dismissed those accusations.
Each side accused the other of mounting new attacks on civilian targets on Friday, including by firing across their shared border which is well to the west of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
All-out war over Nagorno-Karabakh would risk drawing in regional powers Russia, which has a military base in majority Christian Armenia, and Turkey, which has said it will stand by mainly Muslim Azerbaijan. 
Civilians across the region are increasingly worried.
Cahanquba Quliyeva, a 28-year-old architect in Baku, the Azeri capital, said she was worried her husband and brother would be called up to fight. ""We only saw this in the movies. And now we are going through that ourselves in real life,"" she said.

In Yerevan, food technologist Eduard Vlasyan, 30, said: ""At the moment this is a full-scale war. If we give Karabakh to them, they will demand Armenia next time.""

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 11:11PM ET</span>",'Thanks for the chaos': Madrid returns to lockdown,"By Belén Carreño and Emma Pinedo
MADRID (Reuters) - Some 4.8 million Madrid residents will be barred from leaving the area from Friday evening, making it the first European capital back into lockdown due to surging coronavirus cases.
Restaurants and bars in the Spanish capital and nine satellite towns will shut early and slash capacity by half in what has again become Europe's worst infection hotspot.
The new restrictions, to start at 10 pm (2000 GMT), are not as strict as the previous lockdown from March, when people were barred from leaving their homes. However, authorities advised residents not to move around unless absolutely necessary. 
""Madrilenos"" were exasperated at political wrangling between the central and regional governments, and anxious about whether the measures would work.
""We have been eight months with masks and without nightclubs and parties, and there is still contagion. Then what kind of impact will these restrictions make?,"" said Sonny van den Holstein, owner of Sanissimo restaurant.
""People are confused, they hesitate to go out ... they are in fear,"" he said, as a customer called to cancel a reservation.
The conservative-led Madrid area authority reluctantly complied with the order from the Socialist-led central government to ban travel except for school, work, health or shopping.
Famous for its late-night carousing and usually lively tourist flow, Madrid's bars and restaurants must close at 11 p.m. instead of a previous 1 a.m curfew, while restaurants, gyms and shops are having capacity cut by half.
Gatherings of more than six people remain banned indoors and outdoors, but parks and playgrounds can this time stay open.
LEGAL CHALLENGE
The measures widen a confinement already in place in poorer parts of the city with high infection rates. 
People who do not comply will face fines.
Other busy European cities have tightened measures in recent days, including limiting numbers in restaurants and making face masks compulsory in more places. 
But none have gone as far as Madrid. The new lockdown will last at least 14 days and could be extended if needed. 
Conservative regional head Isabel Diaz Ayuso has launched a legal challenge, fearing economic damage and accusing central government of exceeding its mandate by ordering the measures.
With Madrid's international airport Barajas staying open, Diaz Ayuso tweeted her anger at the prime minister: ""From tomorrow one will be able to get to Madrid from Berlin but not from Parla. Thanks for the chaos, Pedro Sanchez."" 
Parla is a periphery town south of Madrid.
In its appeal, the region argues that the measures do not adequately fight the pandemic and would cost 750 million euros ($879 million) per week to the local economy.
But Sanchez said the only goal was saving lives and protecting health. ""All decisions are made based on scientists' citeria,"" he said at a summit in Brussels. 
With 850 cases per 100,000 people, according to the World Health Organization, the Madrid area has Europe's worst rate.
Spain recorded a total of 789,932 coronavirus cases as of Friday, a rise of 11,325 since Thursday. There have been 32,086 fatalities. Daily deaths are now around their highest levels since early May but far below the late March record of nearly 900.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will maintain restrictions on non-essential travel with the United States until the coronavirus outbreak in both nations is much less serious, a senior government official said on Friday.
The comments by Canadian Public Safety Minister Bill Blair suggest that the ban on non-essential travel could stay for months to come, given spiking cases of COVID-19. 
The measures, first imposed in March, are due to expire on Oct 21. They do not affect trade.
Blair told reporters that Canada would keep the restrictions in place ""until the conditions on both sides of the border ... change very substantively, until we can be assured based on the advice we receive from our public health officials"" that the measures could be lifted safely.
The United States on Friday reported 7,260,465 cases of the new coronavirus, up 47,046 from the previous count. A second wave is sweeping Canada, where health officials are reporting almost 2,000 new cases a day compared to just 300 in July.
The U.S. embassy in Ottawa was not immediately available for comment.
Canadian officials earlier announced they would ease some restrictions next Thursday to allow for more family reunifications, and plans to allow some new international students to attend learning institutions.
When the measures were first introduced they prompted protests from people separated from family members.
""We recognize that travel restrictions should not keep loved ones apart. In these challenging times, we know those challenges are best met with the strength and support of those we love by our side,"" Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino told reporters.

As of Oct. 8, Canada will allow the entry of certain extended family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents, including those in an exclusive dating relationship of at least one year.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Friday of ""fabricating lies"" and trying to take the world back to the ""jungle age"" after Washington blamed Beijing and U.N. agencies for ""the murder of millions of baby girls.""
The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) on Friday said it regretted the accusations by U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, which were made at a U.N. General Assembly meeting on Thursday on the anniversary of a landmark 1995 women's conference.
UNFPA Executive Director Natalia Kanem told reporters that any coercion of women was ""against our practice and policy.""
""We accord the highest priority to voluntary sexual and reproductive health, rights, and procedures,"" she said. ""We have invited reviews of, in the case of UNFPA, our practice and procedures in the country of China, and for the past four years, the United States has not visited our programs.""
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration cut funding in 2017 for UNFPA, saying it ""supports ... a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."" The United Nations said that was an inaccurate perception.
DeVos and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who issued a statement on Thursday, both accused China of subjecting Uighurs and other minorities to forced abortion, forced sterilization, and involuntary implantation of birth control devices.
A spokesperson for China's U.N. mission in New York said in a statement that the remarks were ""sheer fabrication.""
""Some U.S. politicians lie and cheat as a habit,"" the spokesperson said. ""They maliciously create political confrontation and undermine multilateral cooperation. The United States, going against the trend of the times, is becoming the biggest destroyer of the existing international order and trying all means to take the world back to the 'jungle age.'"" 

Long-simmering tensions between the United States and China have hit the boiling point at the United Nations over the coronavirus pandemic, spotlighting Beijing's bid for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to Washington's traditional leadership.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Early voting began in New Zealand on Friday with Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Jacinda Ardern seen securing a second term in office on the back of her success in handling the coronavirus pandemic and other crises.
Voters can head to the polls with about 450 advance polling stations opened across the country in the lead-up to election day on Oct. 17.
The election commission said advance voting has become steadily more popular. It accounted for 47% of all votes in 2017 and could reach as much as 60% this time round.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message, Ardern said she voted early on Saturday. 
""Voting opens today! We got in nice and early, you should too! No lines, lots of space, quick and easy,"" Ardern said. 
A photo posted on her Facebook page shows Ardern and her partner, Clarke Gayford, walking into a polling place.
New Zealanders are also voting on two other issues - legalising recreational cannabis and euthanasia - topics that have split opinions in the country.
Ardern’s Labour Party, governing in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, faces the conservative National Party in what has been a pandemic-dominated campaign.
Ardern’s rise to become New Zealand’s most popular prime minister, buoyed by her response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has left the country largely unscathed, has boosted her prospects in the election.
The 40-year-old also won support at home and global admiration for her response to last year's attack by a white supremacist on two mosques and a fatal volcanic eruption.
If the prime minister’s high ratings in opinion polls are mirrored in the election results, Labour would govern on its own, without needing a coalition. But a recent poll suggested Ardern might need a coalition partner to form a government as her rival National Party leader Judith Collins is clawing back support.

Preliminary results will be announced on Oct 17.

JUBA (Reuters) - Sudan’s power-sharing government and several rebel groups are due to formalise a peace agreement on Saturday aimed at resolving decades of regional conflicts which left millions displaced and hundreds of thousands dead. 
Three major groups signed a preliminary deal in August - two factions from the western region of Darfur and one from the southern region - after months of peace talks hosted by neighbouring South Sudan.
Another powerful rebel group, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement-North led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu, which had not participated in initial peace negotiations, agreed last month to hold new talks hosted by South Sudan. 
Tut Gatluak, the South Sudanese chief mediator, told Reuters ahead of Saturday's ceremony in Juba that the goal is to sign deals with all armed groups. 
""The parties will sign their final agreement ... and from there, we shall continue engaging with the other holdout groups of general Al-Hilu and Al-Noor,"" he told Reuters on Friday.
Leaders from Kenya, Ethiopia, Chad, Egypt as well as the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia will also attend the event, he added. 
Sudan has been wracked by simmering conflicts for decades. After the oil-rich south seceded in 2011, an economic crisis fuelled protests that led to the overthrow of veteran president Omar Hassan al-Bashir in 2019.
Sudan's new civilian and military leaders, who have shared power since then, say ending conflicts is a top priority to help bring democracy and peace to a country in crisis.
The deal sets out terms to integrate rebels into the security forces, be politically represented and have economic and land rights. A new fund will pay $750 million a year for 10 years to the impoverished southern and western regions and the chance of return for displaced people is also guaranteed. 
Analysts have welcomed the agreement but questioned its inclusiveness and comprehensiveness because of how prominent the role of armed groups and the military is. 

Jack Mohamoud Jack, the spokesman of the al-Hilu faction, said his group will not participate in the ceremony, but is ready to start separate negotiations with the Sudanese government.

GUATEMALA CITY/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Friday said he suspected political interference behind a new migrant caravan in Central America, promising to keep his country out of the U.S. presidential race as the group splintered and some began turning back.
More than 2,000 migrants, many wearing face masks against the coronavirus, barged past Guatemalan troops at the Honduras-Guatemala border on Thursday. Some said they were seeking to escape poverty aggravated by the pandemic.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has taken steps to curb illegal immigration so as to avoid entanglements with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump, suggested that the caravan's departure from Honduras had been timed to provoke.
""It is very weird, very strange,"" Lopez Obrador told a news conference. ""It's a matter that I believe is linked to the U.S. election.""
He said he did not have definitive evidence to support that claim, but his words turned up pressure on the migrants. They split into three groups on Friday, amid a growing realization that even making it to Mexico would be a risky journey.
Eager to avoid upsetting Trump, who insulted and threatened Mexico repeatedly in his 2015-16 election campaign and has made cracking down on illegal immigration a priority during his presidency, Lopez Obrador has since last year used thousands of troops to reinforce Mexico's border regions.
A surge in migration and caravans resulted in threats from Trump to impose tariffs on Mexican trade in 2019.
National Guard militarized police this year broke up a migrant caravan, with authorities detaining and quickly deporting participants. 
""SHORT OF FOOD""
A few hundred migrants at the Guatemalan-Honduran border turned back on Friday morning, according to a Reuters witness. Many said they were worn out, short of food and worried that a tough reception awaited them further along the road.
""We're going back ... because the (Mexican) president said we weren't following the rules and that we were breaking many laws,"" said Nelson Aguilera, who joined the caravan in Honduras with his wife and daughter on Thursday.
Lopez Obrador said his government had made a ""major effort"" to avoid becoming caught up in the U.S. presidential election, noting that Mexico and immigration were far down the list of issues being debated in the campaign this year. 
Guatemala has invoked special powers to give security forces more latitude to break up the caravan, while Mexico tightened border sanitary checks and said it could imprison anyone who endangered the health of others for up to 10 years.
Authorities in Guatemala said on Friday morning 108 migrants had gone back to Honduras, and that rest of the caravan had split into two. One group headed for Guatemala's Peten region, and the other for the Mexican border city of Tapachula, they said.
Social pressure has been building in Central America, where strict lockdowns have battered local economies and spread hunger, while some restrictions on freedom of movement that slowed traditional migrant flows toward the United States have recently been relaxed.

Adding to their discomfort, many of the migrants had to spend Thursday night in the open because churches and other shelters remain closed because of coronavirus risks.

Jarrad Berkihiser's retirement will be effective Oct. 30, Mayor Danene Sorace told a press conference, without providing any reason for the decision or taking any questions from reporters.
""I do recognize that there will be many conversations in the days and weeks ahead about the future leadership and direction of the Lancaster City Police Brueau,"" Sorace said.
""For now, today is about the chief's retirement and honoring him and his 26 years of service.""
The move comes less than a month after a police officer shot and killed 27-year-old Ricardo Munoz, sparking protests in the city of about 60,000 people that lasted a few nights. 
Police body camera footage from the Sept. 13 incident appeared to show Munoz cursing, and running at the officer with a knife in his right hand. The officer shot and killed Munoz, who died at the scene.
Munoz had been out on $1 million bail after being charged with aggravated assault last year, court records showed.
In the wake of the shooting, Sorace had called on the governor and state legislators to work together to come up with better protocols for responding to 911 calls involving people who may have mental health issues.
On Friday, Sorace said she and Berkihiser had over the years worked together on steps to improve the police force, including reforming its use of force policy, implementing de-escalation training and hiring its first social worker.
""Significant progress has been made,"" she said.

The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) published images which it said showed that the Cambodian government last month demolished a building that the United States had built at Ream Naval Base.
Last year the Pentagon had asked Cambodia to explain why it turned down an offer to repair the base, saying the decision had raised speculation of possible plans for hosting China's military. 
The Cambodian embassy in Washington and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The Cambodian government has denied reports that China had reached a secret deal with Cambodia to let it place forces at Ream, saying that hosting foreign forces would be against Cambodia's constitution.
The base is southeast of the port city of Sihanoukville, center of a Chinese-led casino boom and a Chinese-run Special Economic Zone.
Cambodia is one of China's closest allies in Southeast Asia and has received billions of dollars of Chinese aid as well as political backing for authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen in the face of Western criticism.
Cambodia has been wary of superpower rivalry since being devastated by fighting between U.S. and Chinese proxy forces in the 1970s that culminated in the Khmer Rouge genocide.

1133,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",Washington hits Belarus with sanctions as Minsk retaliates against EU measures,"(Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on eight Belarusian officials on Friday, accusing them of involvement in rigging President Alexander Lukashenko's re-election victory in August or the violent crackdown on protests that followed. 
The move came after the European Union announced sanctions on 40 people, including the interior minister and the head of the election commission, achieving a breakthrough on the issue at summit talks in the early hours of Friday morning. 
Lukashenko was spared, in line with the EU's policy of punishing powerbrokers as a last resort. He denies electoral fraud and says the protests are backed from abroad.
Lukashenko's government announced retaliatory sanctions against unidentified officials, recalled its ambassadors to Poland and Lithuania for consultations and nudged both countries to reduce the size of their embassy staff in Minsk. 
Lukashenko is grappling to contain nearly two months of street protests that pose the biggest challenge to his 26-year rule. More than 13,000 people have been arrested, and major opposition figures jailed or exiled. 
""The United States and our international partners stand united in imposing costs on those who have undermined Belarusian democracy for years,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The U.S. sanctions also targeted Belarusian Interior Minister Yuri Karaev and his deputy. Those under sanctions are subject to asset freezes and a ban against Americans doing business with them. 
Washington had originally been expected to impose sanctions in concert with Britain and Canada, which went ahead on Tuesday with travel bans and asset freezes on Lukashenko, his son Viktor and other senior officials.
Washington has had sanctions on Lukashenko since 2006 but the president was spared in the latest round of measures.
LUKASHENKO SPEAKS TO PUTIN
The crisis has pushed Belarus back towards traditional ally Russia, which has propped up Lukashenko's government with loans and the offer of military support. Moscow sees its ex-Soviet neighbour as a strategic buffer against the EU and NATO.
Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone on Friday, expressing confidence that ""the problems that have arisen will soon be resolved"", the Kremlin said.
Lukashenko's government announced it had drawn up a list of people who were banned from travelling to Belarus in retaliation for the EU sanctions. It did not name the officials or the countries they were from.
""...we are imposing visa sanctions against the most biased representatives of European institutions, including the European Parliament and the states - EU members,"" foreign ministry spokesman Anatoly Glaz was quoted by the official Belta news agency as saying. 
""The list is symmetrical in many ways. We have decided not to make it public for now."" 
Russia's foreign ministry said the Belarusian sanctions would apply in Russia as well. 
Lukashenko's government also asked the Polish and Lithuanian embassies to reduce their staff. Both countries refused. 
""We are not going to summon our ambassadors for consultations, and we will definitely not do anything to reduce personnel,"" Lithuanian Foreign Affairs Minister Linas Linkevicius told reporters. 
""We are not interested in reducing our communications channel,"" he said. ""If the advice becomes a request, then we will take appropriate measures.""
The Belarusian authorities have detained journalists or stripped them of their accreditation as part of the crackdown on the unrest that followed the Aug. 9 election. 
On Friday, the foreign ministry announced it was stripping journalists working for foreign media organisations of their accreditation, and asked them to reapply for their permits. 
""I would like to make it clear that it is in no way some attempt to cleanse the news reporting field,"" Glaz was quoted by Belta as saying. 
The EU sanctions had been held up by Cyprus due to an unrelated dispute with Turkey. The delay dented the credibility of the EU's foreign policy, diplomats said. 
""That we could now agree to those sanctions is an important signal because it strengthens the hand of those who are protesting for freedom of opinion in Belarus,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists. 
Merkel will meet on Tuesday with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main electoral opponent who fled into exile after the vote in the ex-Soviet republic, fearing for her family's safety. 

French President Emmanuel Macron met Tsikhanouskaya on Tuesday, pledging European support for the Belarusian people.

1135,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 01:20PM ET</span>","No breakthrough in Brexit talks, but some progress made","By Gabriela Baczynska and Elizabeth Piper
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she had no breakthrough to announce on Friday as a week of EU talks with Britain ended, but remained optimistic that sealing a deal on a post-Brexit trade relationship was still possible before the end of the year.
Her words were echoed by Britain's chief negotiator, David Frost, who said that while progress had been made in some areas, the main differences between the two sides remained, with the gap on fisheries ""unfortunately very large"".
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was more blunt, telling the European Union it was up to the bloc to show common sense.
Both Johnson and the EU have set a mid-October goal for reaching a trade agreement, but the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier suggested talks would continue up until the end of the month.
There are still major hurdles to ensuring smooth ties after Dec. 31, when a standstill post-Brexit transition ends, and a chaotic split without a new agreement in place would jeopardize an estimated trillion euros worth of annual trade.
Barnier noted fresh progress on aviation safety and safeguards of fundamental rights but said there was none on personal data protection or carbon pricing.
""Serious divergences"" persisted, he said, citing a need for level playing field guarantees of fair competition, including on state aid, ""robust"" mechanisms to solve disputes, including ""effective remedies"", and an agreement on fisheries.
""I can't announce a breakthrough,"" Merkel told an earlier news conference after two-day talks among the 27 national EU leaders in Brussels. ""As long as negotiations on Brexit are ongoing, I'm optimistic.""
Johnson again said Britain only wanted a deal similar to the kind that the EU had handed other countries such as Canada.
""It's up to our friends and partners to be common-sensical,"" he told BBC regional journalists.
His chief negotiator, Frost, rammed home London's point that he believed the EU needed to show more ""realism and flexibility"" to reach an agreement, saying: ""I am concerned that there is very little time now to resolve these issues ahead of the European Council on 15 October.""
BORDER
Johnson will speak to the head of the EU's executive, Ursula von der Leyen, on Saturday to agree next steps after the bloc launched a legal case against Britain over moving to undercut their Brexit divorce treaty.
Speaking after the summit on Friday, von der Leyen said it was time to ""intensify"" Brexit talks with time available by the end of the year to put a new deal in place running out.
""Where there's a will, there's a way,"" she said. 
""We have made progress on many, many difficult fields but the main ones all remain very much open,"" she added, naming guarantees on a level playing field of fair competition as a key sticking point. ""There is still a lot of work to do.""
The issue of Northern Ireland has also come to the fore again, after Britain introduced its Internal Market Bill, which London admits would break international law by breaching some provisions relating to the sensitive Irish border it had agreed under the earlier divorce deal.
Ireland's prime minister, Micheal Martin, told the summit that Britain must respect those arrangements. The EU insists there will be no trade deal if London undercuts the agreement.
Referring to another major sticking point in the trade talks, Merkel also said the UK's new deal on fisheries with Norway announced this week ""shows... agreements can be found"".
The deal includes access to each other's waters, as well as annual fishing quotas negotiations. The latter has long been favoured by Britain but so far rejected by the EU, where fisheries is politically sensitive for France.
An EU diplomatic source said Merkel's comment suggests that positions may be inching closer after the sides discussed a compromise that would also include a ""phasing-out"" or ""transition"" mechanism for fish quotas.
Under this idea, Britain would increase its quotas in time, rather than overnight from Jan. 1, 2021, when it says it becomes an ""independent coastal nation"" in control of its own waters.

But Frost described the gap on fisheries as ""unfortunately very large and, without further realism and flexibility from the EU, risks being impossible to bridge"".

Prior to her self-immolation, Irina Slavina wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page: ""I ask you to blame the Russian Federation for my death."" She worked as editor-in-chief at Koza Press, a small local news outlet that advertised itself as having ""no censorship, no orders 'from above'"".
A day before her death, she wrote on Facebook that police officers and investigators had searched her apartment, writing that they were looking for ""brochures, leaflets and accounts"" from the Open Russia opposition group, which is financed by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky.
She said they seized notebooks, her laptop and other electronics, as well as her daughter's laptop and her husband's mobile phone. 
Russia's Investigative Committee said it was opening a preliminary inquiry after a woman self-immolated in Nizhny Novgorod, a city of 1.3 million around 400 km (250 miles) east of Moscow. It did not name Slavina in its statement. 
The committee's local branch in the Nizhny Novgorod region later said that Slavina's self-immolation had nothing to do with the searches carried out at her apartment on the previous day.
It said she was only a witness in the criminal case for which the searches were being carried out. 
Members of Russia's opposition said Slavina had been under pressure from the authorities. 
""Over the past years security officials have subjected her to endless persecution because of her opposition (activities),"" opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov wrote on Instagram. 
""What a nightmare,"" Ilya Yashin, another Kremlin critic, wrote on Twitter. ""All of these cases of police amusing themselves, these shows of men in masks - these are not games. The government is truly breaking people psychologically.""

Aguila Saleh, leader of a rival parliament in eastern Libya, no longer faces EU travel bans and asset freezes imposed four years ago, the EU said, confirming a Reuters report on Sept. 9 that the so-called de-listing was planned.
""The de-listing of speaker Saleh was agreed in light of his recent constructive engagement in support of a negotiated political solution to the Libyan crisis,"" an EU statement said.
After months of inaction, European powers see a chance to reassert their role in Libya - which has been in turmoil since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi - after a ceasefire in August and to counter growing Turkish and Russian military involvement.
The EU supports the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) based in the capital Tripoli.
But Saleh is seen to have gained clout as a negotiating force relative to another eastern powerbroker, Khalifa Haftar, who commands the rebel Libyan National Army (LNA).

The EU now sees Saleh as pivotal figure in a push to bring the two sides of the Libyan conflict together.

The mVoter2020 app, launched on Tuesday and aimed at improving voter awareness, labels at least two candidates belonging to the Rohingya ethnic group as “Bengali”, a term that implies they are immigrants from Bangladesh and is rejected by many Rohingya. 
The app was not available to download for mobile and a web version was inaccessible on Friday, bringing up an error message that read ""Server is temporarily closed"". 
Marcus Brand, the country director of the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (International IDEA), which is based in Stockholm and helped develop the app, said he understood it had been removed while discussions were ongoing but did not have further details.
Brand said the group was advising the removal of contentious words used to identify candidates' ethnic background.
“We are advocating the electoral authorities to remove this information from the app in order to ensure candidate security and… increase the integrity of the process,” he told Reuters, adding he hoped the app would go back online soon.
The app was developed by Myanmar's Union Election Commission (UEC), with support from STEP Democracy, a European Union-funded project implemented in Myanmar by International IDEA, and the U.S.-based Asia Foundation. 
Pierre Michel, public diplomacy adviser to the EU's Myanmar mission, told Reuters the EU ""should have been warned about the inclusion of discriminatory data"" in the app and was ""considering all options"" as to how to respond.
The UEC and Asia Foundation did not respond immediately to requests for comment.
Brand said International IDEA's role was to digitize candidate registration forms for a database and that it did not have “technical nor editorial control” over the app's content. The UEC requires applicants to submit citizenship documents that classify them by their race and religion.
""We do not generally think that advertising the ethnic and religious identification of candidates is advisable in the Myanmar context,” Brand said.
Activist group Justice for Myanmar said in a statement on Wednesday that the app risked “inflaming ethnic and religious nationalism during the election”.
Aye Win, one of the Rohingya candidates, told Reuters he was informed by the UEC on Friday that he was being disqualified, although it was not clear if this was related to the app.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Political journalist Attila Rovo began work on Friday at Hungary's latest experiment in independent journalism - a crowd-funded online news service called Telex.
Operating from a small apartment near the Danube and financed solely by donations from more than 34,000 readers, Telex is an attempt to break free from what Rovo and other critics describe as growing government influence over Hungary's media via owners supportive of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
Rovo, 40, has worked for the state radio and three privately-owned websites over the past decade. He was fired from the radio in 2011, shortly after Orban's government took control of state media. He quit all three websites due to what he said was state meddling that threatened his journalistic integrity.
The last website was Index, then the largest independent news site in Hungary. Rovo's career there ended on July 24 when the staff of Index resigned en masse over what they called an ""open attempt to exert pressure"" on the site after its owner sacked their editor-in-chief.
""We started to feel like the frog in a pan of cold water that's slowly being cooked... The frog says it's OK, it is still OK, but then the water suddenly starts boiling,"" said Rovo.
Telex is being set up by 60-70 former Index journalists, with Rovo as its new deputy editor-in-chief.
The European Union and pro-democracy groups have long accused Orban's nationalist government of curbing media and other freedoms, a charge it denies.
In a report this week, the European Commission said state advertising was being channeled to pro-government outlets, leading to ""indirect political influence over the media"".
""Independent media outlets face systematic obstruction and intimidation, while a trend of economic takeover of such outlets raises additional concern,"" the EU executive said.
Government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said in an emailed comment to Reuters that the EU report was ""absurd and untrue"".
""THE AIR IS GETTING THINNER""
Rovo said he had not experienced direct political interference over content at Index.
But after pro-government businessman Miklos Vaszily acquired significant control over Index's funding this year, Rovo said financial pressure had increased, for example in threats to cut editorial jobs despite strong sales. 
When the editor-in-chief was dismissed, it was time to leave, the soft-spoken Rovo added. 
In emailed comments to Reuters, Vaszily said that after he acquired a 50% stake in Indamedia - the company that controls Index's funding - he took no part personally in its operational decisions or in any negotiations between Indamedia and Index.
He said Indamedia had demanded greater cost efficiency from Index due to the worse than initially expected impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the outlook for advertising revenues.
As journalists set up their computers in the new Telex office, editor-in-chief Veronika Munk said they had enough funds for several months - including a promised donation of 200,000 euros from Czech media group Economia - and that the eventual aim was for Telex to become subscription-based.
Despite the challenges, Rovo said, journalists in Hungary are free to write what they want without fear of being jailed but that they need to escape the pressures exerted by the owners of media outlets and funding channels.

""They (the government) are gradually tightening (control), the air is getting thinner. And you don't even know who is doing it, as it is not a politician, or the prime minister, or a party... but people who act on their behalf.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Jangling keys on a long chain, Paris bookseller Jerome Callais opens his green wooden crates mounted on a wall overlooking the Seine, resigned to another slow day's trade in the absence of the tourist crowds he relies on.
Callais is one of more than 200 ""bouquinistes"" who sell secondhand books and engravings along a three-kilometre (1.8-mile) stretch of river embankment - a tradition going back centuries that is now under threat from the coronavirus. 
While the job was never lucrative Callais, who is campaigning to add the bouquinistes to UNESCO's world heritage list, said the dearth of out-of-towners along the main tourist drag from Notre-Dame cathedral to the Louvre museum had left him struggling to sell anything.
""I sold a book for 16 euros today, I’ve got another customer who’s going to owe me the money later, and that’s a great day for me,"" he said.
Before the pandemic struck, Callais said a third of his customers were foreign tourists and another third came from elsewhere in France: ""We’re totally dependent on tourism.""
Even after France's lockdown was lifted in May, many fellow bouquinistes concluded that re-opening was pointless, he added.
In August, the government said the pandemic had cost France up to 40 billion euros ($47 billion) in lost tourism revenues.
It provided some aid for the tourist sector but, as booksellers, the bouquinistes were not eligible. They got some support from a solidarity fund, but that ended in July, a finance ministry official said.
Books have been sold on the banks of the Seine since the 16th century. 
Spots are now allocated for five-year periods by the city council. The booksellers pay no rent but must open at least four days a week and, in normal times, bountiful summers would make up for slower sales in the winter.
""Once you’ve sampled life on the riverbank it's a bit like a drug... We come for the human interaction, the exchanges, the sharing of knowledge,"" Callais said.
""We (also) suffered a lot with competition from internet... companies which sell books but which aren’t booksellers. They’re machines to make cash. There’s no poetry in them.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union imposed sanctions on Belarus' interior minister and the head of its electoral commission but spared President Alexander Lukashenko, the bloc said in its Official Journal on Friday.
Publishing the names of the 40 individuals that EU leaders agreed to sanction early on Friday in response to an Aug. 9 election that the West says was rigged, the EU list included commanders, security officials and prison directors. 
Lukashenko is not on the EU's list, however. Despite pressure from the EU's Baltic states, diplomats said Brussels was sticking to its policy of punishing powerbrokers as a last resort, so as to push for new elections. 
Interior Minister Yuri Karaev and his deputy are the most senior officials to be targeted, which was first reported by Reuters on Sept. 7. The draft list faced a series of delays as the EU's decision-making became entangled in internal conflicts.
EU leaders broke the impasse following a summit dinner in the small hours of Friday in Brussels.
The EU's Belarus sanctions aim to support pro-democracy protests in Minsk against Lukashenko, whom opponents say has illegally prolonged his 26-year rule through a fraudulent vote.
The EU travel bans and asset freezes also include top security officials such as Alexander Valerievich Bykov, commander of rapid response forces and whom the EU accuses of ""arbitrary arrests and ill-treatment, including torture, of peaceful demonstrators.""
Electoral commission chairwoman Lidia Mikhailovna Yermoshina is also now under sanctions, accused of intimidating voters and distorting the vote result.

Belarus earlier announced retaliatory sanctions against the EU.

The OPCW, established to oversee the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, concluded in a report in April that Syrian Air Force airplanes and helicopters had dropped bombs containing poisonous chlorine and sarin nerve gas on a village in the western Hama region in March 2017.
Syria and its military ally Russia have consistently denied using chemical weapons during the decade-old civil war.
Between 2015 and 2017, a joint United Nations-OPCW team known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) found that Syrian government troops had used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs on several occasions, while Islamic State militants were found to have used sulphur mustard.

MINSK/MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Alexander Lukashenko's government announced that it had drawn up a list of people banned from entering Belarus in retaliation for sanctions imposed by the European Union on Friday.
After hours of summit talks, EU member states agreed to sanction about 40 Belarusian officials accused of rigging the Aug. 9 presidential election that handed Lukashenko a sixth term and sparked a wave of mass protests and strikes.
Belarus did not name the officials on its sanctions list or which countries they were from. 
The two-month-old crisis has pushed Lukashenko back towards traditional ally Russia, which has propped up Belarus with loans and an offer of military support. Both have accused the West of meddling in Belarus. 
Lukashenko and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone on Friday, expressing confidence that ""the problems that have arisen will soon be resolved"", the Kremlin said.
The EU sanctions had been held up by Cyprus due to an unrelated dispute with Turkey. The delay dented the credibility of the EU's foreign policy, diplomats said. 
""That we could now agree to those sanctions is an important signal because it strengthens the hand of those who are protesting for freedom of opinion in Belarus,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told journalists.
Merkel will meet on Tuesday with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main electoral opponent who fled into exile after the vote in the ex-Soviet republic, fearing for her family's safety. Lukashenko denies doctoring the election result. 

French President Emmanuel Macron met Tsikhanouskaya on Tuesday, pledging European support for the Belarusian people.

1146,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 08:45AM ET</span>","Australia to discuss security, economic recovery at 'Quad' meeting with Japan, India, U.S.","By Kirsty Needham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's foreign minister said she will travel to Japan to meet counterparts from the ""Quad"" group of the United States, India and Japan next week to discuss regional security, economic recovery, disinformation and supply chains.
The high-level meeting will be closely watched by China, which warned on Tuesday against ""exclusive cliques"" that target third-parties.
The meeting in Tokyo on October 6 is the first standalone meeting of the Quad ministers, after an inaugural meeting a year ago in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations. 
""This will be another important step forward for this grouping of Indo-Pacific democracies,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said in a statement confirming her travel. 
""We will discuss strengthening cooperation to support regional responses to the health and economic dimensions of COVID-19, including on vaccines, supply chains and quality infrastructure investment.""
China is expected to be discussed in the meeting, which is not a formal alliance but a network to share perspectives on stability in the region.
Payne said the meeting comes ""at an important time in the Indo-Pacific, when our shared interests are under unprecedented pressure, including as the region responds to COVID-19"".
Critical minerals will be discussed, as Australia seeks to create a market for its rare earths, which are a key component in global technology manufacturing, but currently dominated by supply from China.
Foreign ministers will issue individual statements at the end of the meeting, but won't issue a joint communique.
The first quadrilateral dialogue of officials was held in 2007, followed by a joint naval exercise, but was abandoned the next year when Australia withdrew amid Chinese complaints the Quad was an attempt to contain China's rise.
The group was revived in 2017 with official-level talks.
India, previously seen as cautious about the revival of the Quad, has this year been involved in border clashes with China. At least 20 Indian solders were killed while China suffered an unspecified number of casualties in a bloody hand-to-hand clash at the border in June.
Australia's diplomatic relations with China worsened this year after Canberra led calls for an international inquiry into the coronavirus pandemic, and Beijing imposed trade sanctions on Australian beef and barley.
Payne said India, Japan and the United States were ""vital Indo-Pacific partners"" for Australia.
Payne, India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are also expected to meet with new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.
Indian media has speculated that India will invite Australia to participate in the annual Malabar naval exercises with Japan and the United States, but no invitation has yet been made.

Australia last joined Malabar in 2007.

LUCKNOW (Reuters) - Galvanised by the alleged gang-rape of a young woman who died of her injuries earlier this week, political parties representing India's downtrodden Dalit community held small protests in several cities on Friday.
In Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, the capital of the state where the crime took place, police baton-charged more than 100 activists from the Samajwadi Party, who held placards demanding justice for the dead woman.
Later in the day, the Bhim Army, a party championing Dalit rights, plans a protest at the historic Jantar Mantar monument in central Delhi.
The family of the dead woman has accused four high caste Hindu men, who have been arrested but not charged by police. Caste still plays an influential role in the politics of Uttar Pradesh, where the current state government is led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party. 
While the family say the woman died as the result of a brutal sexual assault, senior state police officer Prashant Kumar told ANI News on Thursday the woman died due to a neck injury. ""No sperm was found in samples,"" said Kumar.
Bhuri Singh, the uncle of the victim, said her ""dying declaration said she was raped"".
The 19-year-old victim, who was allegedly attacked on Sept. 14 in a field near her home in Hathras district in Uttar Pradesh, died on Tuesday. The incident has sparked nationwide anger and protests.
India is one of the world’s most dangerous places for women with a rape occurring every 15 minutes, federal data shows. In December 2012, the gang rape of a 23-year-old woman sparked nationwide outrage and led to a tough new anti-rape law.
Public criticism mounted and protests flared in recent days after the family of the latest victim said her body was cremated by police without their consent, an allegation officials deny.
On Friday, members of a regional opposition party, the Trinamool Congress, were stopped close to the victim's house while some leaders were roughed up by police officers, video footage from ANI showed.
And in the eastern city of Kolkata, activists from the main opposition Congress Party also protested. On Thursday, police barred Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi, siblings and leaders of Congress, from visiting the dead woman's family in their village.

Health Minister Olivier Veran said on Thursday the Paris region was set to be placed on maximum COVID-19 alert from as soon as Monday as cases rise.
Restaurant owners fear new closures could force them out of business. Bars and restaurants in the French capital must close by 10 pm under current coronavirus restrictions.
""It's a great concern for our jobs, for our wages, for our future,"" Andrea Vincenzi, who manages La Ville de Provins restaurant in northern Paris near the Gare de l'Est railway station, told Reuters.
Veran said the Paris region had passed all three of the government's criteria for being put on the highest level of alert. In the past 24 hours, the coronavirus infection rate had surpassed 250 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.
Double Michelin-starred chef Philippe Etchebest urged fellow restaurant and bar owners to protest against the possible closure of their establishments, calling on them to stand outside their venues on Friday before lunch service and make some noise.

Veran has ordered bars and restaurants in the southern city of Marseille to shut for two weeks.

1151,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Macron launches crackdown on 'Islamist separatism' in Muslim communities,"By Michel Rose
PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Friday to fight ""Islamist separatism"" which he said was threatening to take control in some Muslim communities around France. 
France has struggled with homegrown Islamist militancy for years but Macron's government is increasingly worried by broader signs of radicalisation - often non-violent - within Muslim communities, French officials say. 
They cite the refusal of some Muslim men to shake women's hands, swimming pools that impose alternate time slots for men and women, girls of as young as four being told to wear full-face veils, and a proliferation of 'madrassa' religious schools.
More than 250 people have been killed on French soil over the past five years in attacks by Islamist militants or individuals inspired by jihadist groups.
""What we need to fight is Islamist separatism,"" Macron said during a visit to the impoverished Paris suburb of Les Mureaux. ""The problem is an ideology which claims its own laws should be superior to those of the Republic."" 
France follows a strict form of secularism, known as ""laicite"", which is designed to separate religion and public life. The principle was enshrined in law in 1905 after anti-clerical struggles with the Catholic Church.
In recent decades, the growing desire among French Muslims to express their religious identity has shifted the focus of balancing religious and secular needs onto Islam. 
Many French Muslims, though, have long complained of discrimination and marginalisation that have contributed to poverty and social alienation within their communities.
LEGISLATION 
At the heart of the matter is the question of what it means to be French in a country with Europe's largest Muslim minority - numbering around 5 million or 7-8% of the population.
Macron says assertive Islamist religious practices are ""separatist"" because they threaten in his view to secede from French institutions and rules, his advisers say. 
A bill tackling Islamist separatism will be sent to parliament early next year, the president said.
Among the measures in the draft law, Macron said home-schooling will be severely restricted to avoid having children being ""indoctrinated"" in unregistered schools that deviate from the national curriculum. 
Prefects - local representatives of the central government - will be given the power to annul decisions by mayors to restrict school cafeterias or swimming pools to women or men only.
There was no immediate reaction from Muslim communities.
Less than two years before the next presidential campaign, Macron is keen not to leave himself open to attacks from the far right and traditional conservative right-wing parties on law-and-order issues such as crime and immigration. 
Macron said Islam and radical Islamism should not be conflated and that he wanted to build an ""enlightened Islam"" in France.
The teaching of Arabic will be encouraged in France and an Institute of Islamology will be created, he said. But foreign imams will no longer be able to train clerics in France and there will be tighter controls on the financing of mosques.
""There is a crisis of Islam everywhere, which is being corrupted by radical forms,"" Macron said. But he added that France had a responsibility in how the practice of Islam had evolved in France. 

""We have created our own separatism,"" he said, citing the ghettoisation of some minority neighbourhoods.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - One-fifth of Russians now approve of poisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, according to an opinion poll published on Friday, a figure more than twice as high as a year ago but one accompanied by a doubling of disapproval of his activities. 
A vocal opponent of President Vladimir Putin, Navalny, 44, fell ill on a domestic flight in August and was airlifted to a Berlin hospital. Germany says he was poisoned with a rare nerve agent. Russia says it has seen no evidence he was poisoned.
His case has attracted attention worldwide and at home, with Western leaders demanding an explanation from the Kremlin over what happened. 
According to the poll by the Levada Centre, conducted in late September, 20% of respondents approve of Navalny's activities, while 50% do not. In 2019, his approval rating was 9%, but the percentage of those who disapproved of him was also lower, at 25%.
Of those who had heard about Navalny's poisoning, 55% said they did not believe it was a deliberate act
Russia's diplomatic mission to the EU last month quoted a previous survey putting Navalny's popularity at only 2% and commented that it would make no sense for Moscow to have poisoned a political opponent with so little support.
Navalny's chief of staff, Leonid Volkov, responded at the time: ""It's as if they're saying 'If his rating was 20%, then we would have poisoned him.'""
The Kremlin this week accused Navalny, who has vowed to return to Russia, of working with the CIA after Navalny said he believed Putin was behind the suspected poisoning.
""The problem for those in power is that discrediting Navalny doesn't automatically translate into some kind of affinity towards the Russian authorities,"" said political analysis firm R.Politik on Telegram. 
""It's a false dichotomy: Putin or Navalny. Many don't like either.""

Putin's approval rating dipped to 59% in April, a two-decade low, but had recovered to 69% as of Friday, Levada polling data showed.

The king has recovered and will continue resting at the palace, Bernama reported, citing the palace comptroller Ahmad Fadil Shamsuddin.
The king's return to the palace could result in some movement in a power struggle over the country's premiership, after opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim sought a meeting with him to replace Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister. 
Anwar said last week that he had secured a ""strong, formidable"" majority from lawmakers in parliament to oust Muhyiddin. But he has to convince the king that he has the numbers to form a government.
The king had agreed to meet Anwar last week but the appointment was cancelled as the king was unwell. 
The king plays a largely ceremonial role in Malaysia but he could appoint a prime minister who in his view is likely to command a majority in parliament. He could also dissolve parliament and trigger elections on the premier's advice.
The political turmoil comes just seven months after another power struggle that led to Muhyiddin getting the premiership and could delay efforts to stabilise an economy that is reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

No major political party has come out in support of Anwar but the leader of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest party in the ruling coalition, said there were ""many"" in his party who supported Anwar.

EU leaders said their industry needed to be more competitive, autonomous and resilient after the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the bloc's dependence on Chinese components in the production of drugs.
In their decision following a two-day summit in Brussels, the leaders told ""the Commission to identify strategic dependencies, particularly in the most sensitive industrial ecosystems such as for health, and to propose measures to reduce these dependencies.""
There is also mounting concern that the 27-nation bloc is lagging the United States in the design and manufacture of batteries and in digital cloud storage.
The EU has set digital and green technologies as priorities and wants to help shift the economy using much of its 750-billion-euro ($890-dollar) fund for kick-starting growth after the pandemic.
Leaders named the European Battery Alliance, the Internet of Things and Clean Hydrogen Alliance as projects for the EU to focus on. They also called for the development of new industrial alliances, including on raw materials, micro-processors, telecommunication networks, low-carbon industries, and Industrial Clouds and Platforms.

The leaders agreed that ""a significant part"" of the 1.8 trillion euros that will be available to EU countries under the bloc's budget for 2021-27 and the linked recovery fund should be go towards supercomputers and quantum computing, blockchain, human-centred Artificial Intelligence, microprocessors, 5G networks, secure communications and cyber protection.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysians took to social media on Friday to lambast politicians for violating social distancing protocols and refusing to self-isolate, after the country recorded its second-highest spike in daily coronavirus cases following a state election last week.
The Southeast Asian country has reported a steady climb in cases after an increase in travellers to Sabah, on Borneo island, ahead of its state polls last Saturday.
Malaysia recorded 287 new cases on Friday, the highest daily rise since it started tracking the spread of the pandemic.
Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's government has been criticised for failing to impose controls such as mandatory screening for travellers from Sabah prior to the election, and for allowing people to cut short a 14-day home quarantine order if they tested negative for the virus.
Muhyiddin's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but health officials have defended not announcing control measures sooner, saying authorities did not want to discourage Sabah voters from returning home to cast their ballots.
However, health ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said on Friday that the spike in Sabah could have been mitigated by compliance with guidelines set by the ministry on minimising physical contact.
""The issue now is the non-compliance to SOP at every level,"" Noor Hisham said at a news conference, referring to the ministry's guidelines.
""We are not blaming (anyone), but we are reminding... we hope that all of us learn this lesson so we do not repeat this mistake again.""
From the early stages of the pandemic, Malaysia's health ministry prescribed guidelines to minimise the spread of the virus, which included wearing face masks, maintaining a distance of at least 1 metre between people and washing hands regularly with soap.
The hashtags #PoliticiansCauseVirus and #MinisterCluster were trending on Twitter in Malaysia on Friday after ministers and political figures were reported attending public events upon their return from campaigning in the state.
At least two politicians tested positive on the campaign trail, while cases linked to travel to Sabah have been recorded in all 13 Malaysian states. 
""Why didn't you quarantine yourself for 14 days?"" Twitter user @safiqshahid asked Federal Territories Minister Annuar Musa who posted photos of himself at a business congress after returning from Sabah this week. 
In a statement, Annuar's press secretary denied that the minister had breached quarantine rules, saying he had already completed self-isolation and tested negative days before the election. 
Some Twitter users also raised concerns over risks posed by national elections, which could be called as early as this year amid uncertainty over the stability of the ruling alliance, which has only a two-seat majority in parliament. 
Muhyiddin is facing a leadership challenge from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who said last week he had secured the support from a majority of lawmakers to form a government.

Malaysia has reported 11,771 coronavirus cases so far, including 136 deaths. The economy has contracted for the first time since the 2009 global financial crisis.

LONDON (Reuters) - For thousands of new students in Britain, their first weeks of university have been all too similar to their final weeks of school, marked by lockdowns, isolation and staring at a screen.
COVID-19 outbreaks have hit nearly 50 universities in the last few weeks, forcing students to self-isolate in halls of residence just days after their arrival.
Unions said ministers had failed to plan for what they said was an inevitable rise in cases as large numbers of students come together in halls, lectures and seminars.
Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU) is one of the worst hit, with 1,700 students stuck in residences self-isolating.
First-year students, or 'freshers', living in shared university flats have drawn attention to their plight by posting messages on windows saying ""Send beer"" and ""9K well spent"", a reference to annual tuition fees of 9,250 pounds ($11,900). 
Evelyn Sweeney, president of MMU student union, said students were worried about COVID and whether they would be able to go home in the weeks ahead or at the end of term in time for Christmas.
""When you've just come to university for the first time, probably in a new city that you don't know, it's a scary situation,"" Sweeney said in an interview.
The union is providing practical help, such as food and toiletries, and emotional support, she said. MMU has given residents a two-week rent rebate and a 50 pound grocery voucher, but she said the government had failed them.
""I feel that they've been thrown in the deep end, and students know that,"" she said. 
Education minister Gavin Williamson said this week colleges were ""very well prepared"" to handle any COVID-19 outbreaks.
He said testing was being ramped up and universities were making sure that self-isolating students were properly cared for, and could access food, medical and cleaning supplies.
""COMPLETELY PREDICTABLE""
Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union (UCU), which represents more than 120,000 lecturers and other staff, said this week there had already been outbreaks at 49 universities. 
""This was completely predictable,"" Grady said, criticising the government for encouraging the continuation of face-to-face teaching and effectively exempting universities from its advice to the rest of the population to work from home if possible.
""We are calling for default online learning where possible. We think that needs to be in place at least until Christmas.""
Many of this year's new intake had already suffered in the exams fiasco in the summer, which saw grades decided by an algorithm before an outcry led to a U-turn by Williamson.
As they prepared to head to college, some felt they were already being scapegoated for a rise in cases.
Health minister Matt Hancock raised concerns last month about one million students returning to university, with the message ""Don't kill your granny"".
Prime Minister Boris Johnson changed tack this week.
""I want to pay a particular tribute to the students who are experiencing a first term back at university unlike anything they could have imagined,"" he said, adding that plans were being put in place to allow them to return home safely for Christmas.
But some students had more immediate concerns.
Joe Haslam, studying physics at Leeds University in northern England, said he was waiting to find out if he had COVID-19.

""The tests we had were home tests, so we all had to sit as a flat in the kitchen swabbing each other - so it was an unusual freshers' bonding experience,"" he said in a clip posted on Twitter.

The protesters in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast accused Turkey's army of standing by as Islamic State militants besieged Kobani in plain view just across the Syrian border in October 2014. The protests led to the deaths of 37 people.
As well as ordering the formal arrest of 17 people, the Ankara court released three other detainees subject to judicial supervision, the state news agency Anadolu reported. A party source said the same. They were among 82 people ordered detained a week ago.
Turkish authorities said the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, incited the protests and that the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) supported them. The HDP, the third largest party, denies links to terrorism.
Also on Friday, the Interior Ministry said the mayor of northeastern province Kars, Ayhan Bilgen, who was among those remanded in custody, was removed from his position and replaced by the provincial governor.
This means the authorities have now removed all of HDP's provincial mayors who were elected in March last year. The party now holds six town and district municipalities, compared to the 65 it won in total last year.
Bilgen had said two days ago that he would resign from his position, in an apparent effort to prevent Ankara from appointing an official in his place.
Two HDP lawmakers have been ejected from parliament since elections in 2018 after being convicted on terrorism charges. Eleven others were ejected in the previous term.
Former HDP leaders Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag have been in jail since 2016 on charges related to the Kobani protests.

More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the PKK took up arms against the state in 1984.

NEVADA CITY, Calif. (Reuters) - Jeannie Weber could probably rebuild her ruined house in the foothills of California's Sierra Nevada mountains. But as wildfires rage with increasing frequency, it doesn't seem safe.
Her home in Berry Creek was gutted in September, not two years after a wildfire destroyed the home of her brother Aaron in the town of Paradise and he was forced to flee with his family.
The Weber siblings are among tens of thousands of displaced Californians - refugees in their own country now scattered from coast to coast.
""It scared me so much,"" Jeannie Weber, a 43-year-old massage therapist, said. ""I want a place where it doesn't burn.""
Climate change has brought warmer weather that dries out the land and drives hot winds to fan flames, scientists say, and a rise in populations living near forests has compounded the risk.
The number of acres burned by wildfire in California has increased fivefold since the early 1970s, scientists said in a study published last year by the American Geophysical Union.
Weber said she is unlikely to live again on her 5-acre wooded plot, where she once grew fruit and vegetables, but could park a trailer on the land or build a cabin to visit.
""I'll never give up on my Berry Creek home,"" said Weber, who was staying with four dogs at a hotel in the Gold Rush-era town of Nevada City.
Since August, fires have killed about 40 people in California, Oregon and Washington, destroyed nearly 6 million acres, and forced more than a half-million to either flee their homes or be prepared to do so.
Deadly infernos in northern California alone had already displaced tens of thousands of people in 2017 and 2018. Housing prices rose in places to which people fled. Poverty and long-term homelessness increased, straining social service nets. 
""I would call them climate migrants,"" said Jacquelyn Chase, an urban planning professor at California State University, Chico. ""Even if they don't see it like that, climate has displaced them.""
With climate change expected to drive more extreme weather across the United States, including stronger hurricanes hitting coastlines and droughts that parch the U.S. West, federal officials have urged Congress to develop a program to help states resettle people.
""Literature we reviewed and experts we interviewed suggest that in the coming decades many other communities will need to consider migrating because of changes in the climate,"" the U.S. Government Accountability Office said in July.
FIRE TOOK EVERYTHING
When the Camp Fire raged through Paradise and nearby communities in California's Butte County in 2018, 85 people were killed and 56,000 fled their homes, crowding hotels, parking lots and campgrounds across several counties. 
About 20,000 of those who fled, roughly the population of Paradise itself, were displaced long term, said Richard Hunt, a housing and economic development consultant.
Hardest hit were renters and lower income property owners who did not have fire insurance. For poor families and retirees who had settled in Paradise because it was relatively inexpensive, the fire took everything.
Some settled in neighboring counties, but others are scattered across the United States, Chase's research showed.
The college city of Chico felt the effects of that displacement immediately.
Home prices rose by 21 percent in the two months following the fire. The homeless population rose by 16%, more than the 12.7% increase in the state overall, a striking difference in a small city.
""We had about 10 years of population growth all overnight,"" consultant Hunt said.
In neighboring Glenn County, the median home price soared by 47% in those same two months, and in Tehama County to the north by 58%, Hunt's research showed. 
Even though Chico's population swelled after the 2018 fire, the overall population of Butte County, where Paradise, Chico and Berry Creek are located, dropped by 16,000 as others fled the region, Hunt said.
Chase and a colleague followed about a third of those left homeless by the Camp Fire. Some resettled as far away as Florida and Vermont on the eastern coast and others went north to the Canadian border. 
Some survivors of the 2018 blaze plan to return, though only 360 of the thousands of homes destroyed have been rebuilt and reoccupied, Hunt said. As of July, about 1,000 property owners had taken out building permits to work on homes in Paradise. 
Unlike Jeannie Weber, her Berry Creek neighbor Katrina Mulvaney said she and family members definitely plan to return to the deep woods plot of land where they had lived in trailers and small buildings that were burned last month and will now have to be replaced.
Mulvaney is distressed by the relentless wildfires but sees few better options elsewhere.
""Half the state is on fire,"" the 21-year-old self-employed herbalist said. ""Go to another country, they're on fire too. You can't really get away from it at this point.""
LONG-TERM TRAUMA
For many, the trauma of losing their homes and, in some cases loved ones, could haunt them for years, said environmental epidemiologist Irva Hertz-Picciotto of the University of California, Davis. 
After the Tubbs Fire ravaged parts of Santa Rosa in 2017, killing 22 people and destroying more than 5,600 buildings, Hertz-Picciotto and her colleagues interviewed survivors. 
About 60 percent reported experiencing at least one mental health symptom, including trouble sleeping, heightened anxiety, loss of appetite or depression, according to her preliminary data. Some also reported a change in their use of alcohol and drugs. About 20 percent experienced four or more of these symptoms.
As survivors settle into new communities, many bring their trauma with them.
After losing their home of 21 years in Paradise, Joe and Enid Baggett purchased a new house in a neat suburb of Sacramento, not far from where their son lives with his family. 
But two years later, they still haven’t had the heart to fully furnish it. They did buy a kitchen table but in the living room, only a mattress lies on the floor. 
Joe Baggett, a 68-year-old lawyer, retired from his practice after the shock left him with trouble focusing. Shortly after the fire he found himself dazed in a supermarket, unable to process what a clerk was saying to him as he reeled from the loss of the town and community they'd grown to love. 

""It's gone,"" he said. ""It's not like our house burned. The entire world burned.""

1160,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 02, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>","In battleground Wisconsin, some Latinos feel ignored by Biden","By Tim Reid and Dan Simmons
MILWAUKEE (Reuters) - Cesar Hernandez says he has made thousands of phone calls since June urging Latinos in the battleground state of Wisconsin to support Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.
It's a tough sell, admits Hernandez, especially where he lives on the South Side of Milwaukee, the heart of Wisconsin's Latino community. He said Biden's Spanish-language ads on Hulu and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) aren't connecting with the neighborhood's voters, many of whom would prefer a more personal touch.
""Latinos have seen almost nothing from Biden here,"" said Hernandez, 25, who works for the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Turnout Project, a national group working to mobilize Democratic voters. ""There is very little enthusiasm for him.""
As the race to the Nov. 3 election enters the home stretch, appeals to Latino voters have taken on new urgency for Biden and incumbent Republican President Donald Trump. Both campaigns are pouring resources into the battleground states of Florida and Arizona, as well as increasingly competitive Nevada, whose large Latino populations could determine the outcome in those states.
Even in Wisconsin, where 87% of the population is white, the state's 230,000 eligible Latino voters could prove critical. Trump won the state by just 22,000 votes in 2016.
A string of recent polls show Biden ahead in Wisconsin. The polling aggregation website RealClearPolitics has Biden leading Trump by an average of 5.5 percentage points from six polls conducted in September.
Trump has visited the state five times this year. His campaign has opened an office on Milwaukee's South Side, where authentic taco outlets jostle with bilingual tax preparers and a Puerto Rican barber shop. The windows of the campaign storefront are plastered with Trump signs and its shelves bear merchandise such as ""Latinos for Trump"" hats.
The Biden campaign said in statements to Reuters that its outreach efforts to Latinos in Wisconsin and nationally were unprecedented in scale.
It said it had a full-time Latino outreach director in Wisconsin and dozens of staff organizing in predominantly Latino communities. It is running Spanish-language phone and text banks and has ads on multiple platforms, including Spanish-language radio and Spanish-language mailers. Dozens of virtual roundtables, rallies and other events targeting the Latino community have been held, the Biden campaign said. 
""The campaign has communicated with tens of thousands of Latino voters about the clear choice in this year’s election,"" said Jen Molina, Biden's national Latino media director.
But Reuters interviews with 30 Latino residents and activists on Milwaukee's South Side suggest those efforts may be falling short, reflecting what some call an ""enthusiasm gap"" for Biden among Latinos nationwide that has been noted by pollsters and analysts.
Several residents interviewed said the only contact they've had with the Biden campaign are phone texts in English soliciting donations. Fifteen of 24 Latino voters interviewed said they would vote for Biden, albeit with little fervor. Some said he was too old and seemed more focused on Black voters and their concerns about social justice.
""It's like he's not listening to us,"" Hernandez said, adding that many feel Biden is taking them for granted. ""We're not being heard.""
Others blamed the novel coronavirus pandemic. With cases surging in Wisconsin, Biden's team has stuck to a mostly virtual campaign; plans for a campaign office in Milwaukee's South Side were scrapped, said Darryl Morin, a Biden campaign volunteer focused on turning out Latino voters.
Trump's Wisconsin team, meanwhile, has continued door-to-door campaigning and in-person outreach, a strategy that Morin said resonates with Latino voters.
""I completely get why people feel there has been a lack of presence"" from Biden's campaign, Morin said. ""Sometimes it's frustrating the degree we are having to limit the operations. Only one side is continuing to go out in person - the Trump campaign.""
BATTLEGROUND STATE WORRIES
Nationally, Biden leads Trump among registered voters who identify as Hispanics: 53% said they would back the Democrat, while 30% said they would vote for Trump, slightly more than backed the Republican in 2016, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling in September.
But Biden's 23-point advantage is smaller than the 39-point lead Clinton had over Trump among Hispanic voters on Election Day four years ago. 
If his campaign fails to make up that ground, it could prove ""disastrous"" for Biden in closely contested states with significant Latino populations, said Jaime Regalado, an expert on Latino voters at California State University in Los Angeles.
Trump's anti-immigrant policies and harsh rhetoric about migrants are widely unpopular with Latinos. Yet polls show many trust him on the economy. In Florida, a must-win state for Trump, he has made inroads with conservative Cuban-Americans with the false claim that Biden and the Democrats are ""socialists."" In battleground Arizona, Trump held a ""Latinos for Trump"" roundtable with voters in Phoenix last month.
The Biden campaign says its virtual events in Wisconsin focused on the Latino community have involved high-profile officials, including Michelle Lujan Grisham, the first Latina Democratic governor of New Mexico. Last month, a virtual bus tour with Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus held an event in Wisconsin.
Biden's running mate, U.S. Senator Kamala Harris, met last month with representatives of Voces de la Frontera, Wisconsin's biggest immigrant-rights group, which has endorsed the Democratic ticket. Voces says it has staff and volunteers working across the state to register 23,000 new voters by Election Day.
SOUTH SIDE MICROCOSM
The South Side of Milwaukee is a microcosm of Biden's broader struggles.
Jose Vasquez, 71, a community leader, said it didn't matter how many text messages, virtual events or phone calls the Biden campaign said it has made.
""You can hand out a thousand fliers, but if you're not knocking on a single door or talking face-to-face with a single person, you have little impact,"" he said in an interview.
Vasquez, a retired school principal, said he wants to see more from Biden on issues Latinos care about, such as a visit to Puerto Rico, which still needs massive aid after a 2017 hurricane, or a trip to the southern border with Mexico to discuss immigration reform.
Democrats had planned to hold Biden's nominating convention in Milwaukee this summer but were forced to host the four-day event virtually because of the pandemic.
SWITCHING TO TRUMP
A third of the two dozen Latino residents interviewed by Reuters in Milwaukee were enthusiastic Trump supporters.
Among them is Mayra Gomez, 41, a lifelong Democrat. The Puerto Rico native said she began looking at the president after receiving an unsolicited Facebook message from a conservative group urging Latinos to break away from the Democratic Party. 
Gomez said she was attracted to Trump's law-and-order message and his economic policies. She said she'll vote for him in November, and is urging family and friends to do the same.
""Remember, Trump's not a politician. He’s a businessman,"" Gomez said. ""What he says may sound funny, but he’s actually speaking the truth.""
The Biden campaign says it is ramping up efforts as the election nears.

On Sept. 26, Todos con Biden, a national coalition of Latino organizers and volunteers working to elect Biden, held its first outdoor event in Wisconsin. At a park on Milwaukee's South Side, it handed out 500 campaign yard signs.

At the summit, Cyprus withdrew its opposition to sanctions on Belarus while other EU leaders assured Cyprus the bloc would punish Turkey if it continues oil and gas exploration in disputed areas of the Mediterranean.
Cyprus had insisted that the bloc impose sanctions on Turkey, but was satisfied by a compromise agreeing to review Turkey's behaviour in December and impose sanctions then if its ""provocations"" have not stopped.
""It is not constructive to continue to use the language of sanctions and describe the steps taken by our country to defend our rights and those of Turkish Cypriots as illegal,"" the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a written statement.
""While there were some positive elements in the decisions regarding our country, many areas were divorced from realities,"" it said, adding that the outcome showed EU-Turkey relations had been ""taken hostage"" by Greece and Cyprus.
It said Greek and Turkish Cypriots needed to be brought together to establish a mechanism to coordinate their hydrocarbon activities and ensure the just sharing of revenues between the two sides of the divided island.

""As long as this is not achieved, the Turkish Cypriot side will continue with its hydrocarbon activities by means of (Turkish energy company) TPAO,"" it added.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's ""Bad Student"" campaigners toured Bangkok high schools in a truck on Friday in a protest cheered on by pupils to demand education reform and an end to the harassment of students and of school rules they say are outdated.
The school demonstrations are part of an anti-government protest movement that has been growing since July and is also demanding greater democracy. Some campaigners seek reforms to the powerful monarchy too.
""Stop the harassment of students, cancel outdated rules, and give us comprehensive education reform,"" said Laponpat Wangpaisit, an activist from the group that calls itself ""Bad Student"" outside one Bangkok school.
From behind school gates, pupils cheered the protesters, sang songs mocking school rules and gave the three-finger salute of pro-democracy campaigners. At one school, pupils put a sign on the gate saying: ""Teachers at this school harass students.""
The protesters were later due to go to the education ministry to demand the resignation of the minister if he does not agree to their demands. The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the protests.
Student campaigners complain that Thailand's school system is geared more towards instilling obedience than education.

Concerns over the harsh treatment of pupils have risen this week after the emergence of closed-circuit camera footage of teachers hitting very young children. The clips prompted outrage and calls for measures to be taken against the schools.

Potential unrest in the impoverished mountainous nation could add to the woes of the Kremlin, which faces sanctions over the suspected poisoning of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, a political crisis in Belarus and conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Hundreds of people staged an ""independence march"" protest in the capital Bishkek on Sunday after a video surfaced online in which a pro-presidential party leader spoke of a need to integrate more closely with Russia.
President Sooronbai Jeenbekov, who met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Sochi on Monday, suggested the protesters were working against the 6.5 million population of the former Soviet republic, which hosts a Russian military air base.
""Forces opposed to the stability and development of our country have stepped up their activity on the eve of the election,"" he said.
The country has a history of instability: in the past 15 years, two presidents have been toppled by revolts and a third is in prison after falling out with his successor.
A vote against all parties was the most popular choice of respondents to a rare nationwide opinion poll conducted on behalf of the U.S.-backed International Republican Institute in August. The poll also showed 53% of respondents believed the country was headed in the wrong direction.
Respondents chose unemployment and the COVID-19 pandemic as their top concerns. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development expects Kyrgyzstan's gross domestic product to plunge 9.5% this year, its worst performance in 20 years.
Many of the 16 parties contesting 120 seats in the unicameral legislature are new and two of the three parties which led the IRI poll are now defunct.
One of them is the Social Democratic party which won most seats in the previous vote and backed Jeenbekov but split after a rift between him and ex-president Almazbek Atambayev.
Kyrgyz political analyst Mars Sariyev said government opponents were trying to promote voting against all. If they succeed, ""there will be protests and repeat elections"", he said.

If more people vote against everyone than for any one party, Kyrgyz law stipulates the vote must be repeated.

""If there is no swearing-in debate in parliament, we will go to elections. Actually, countdown would end on February 10th and therefore we would hold elections on Sunday February 14th"", Torrent said. 
Spain's Supreme Court upheld on Monday a ruling barring Torra from public office for 18 months, after he refused to comply with a decision by the country's electoral committee to remove a banner supporting jailed separatists from his government palace during a national election campaign in 2019.
Catalonia's separatist drive has dominated Spanish politics for several years, particularly since the regional assembly made a short-lived declaration of independence in October 2017, following a referendum declared illegal by judges.

Catalonia's 7.5 million people are split over independence, with the latest opinion poll showing 42% in favour and 50% against.

LAGOS/ABUJA (Reuters) - Fuad Adeyemi, an imam in Nigeria's capital Abuja, respects those who believe that a 22-year-old man accused of sharing a blasphemous message on WhatsApp should be punished. But he thinks the death sentence is too harsh.
He was referring to a ruling handed to Yahaya Aminu Sharif by a sharia court in the northern state of Kano in August. On the same day, the court sentenced a 13-year-old boy, Omar Farouq, to 10 years in prison, also for blasphemy.
The sentences caused an international outcry and sparked a broader debate in Nigeria about the role of Islamic law in a country roughly evenly split between a predominantly Muslim north and mainly Christian south.
""They should review the judgment ... and reduce the punishment,"" said Adeyemi, clad in a white robe and sitting on the concrete floor of a half-built Abuja mosque where moments earlier he had led more than a dozen men in prayer.
Sharia, or Islamic religious law, is applied in 12 of Nigeria's 36 states, raising questions about the compatibility of two legal systems where sharia courts operate alongside secular ones.
Kola Alapinna, a lawyer representing both Sharif and Farouq, told Reuters that appeals against the convictions had been lodged at the Kano state high court, although no dates for the hearings had yet been set.
He said the move was made on the grounds that sharia courts of appeal do not have criminal jurisdiction. Any further appeals should, he added, be held in secular courts up to the Supreme Court, the country's highest legal authority.
""We are a secular country,"" said Alapinna, one of a team of lawyers working on behalf of the Lagos-based Foundation for Religious Freedom rights group, referring to the country's secular constitution.
""Nigeria is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious nation where everybody is welcome.""
The convictions were condemned by some rights groups, the United Nations and the head of Poland's Auschwitz Memorial.
In Nigeria, they divided opinion on social media and in the street.
""How does Sharia law even exist alongside Nigeria's Constitution?"" posted a Twitter user called Obi.
In Abuja, Nigeria's capital city built in the middle of the country to promote unity, insurance executive Hamid Abubakar took a different view. 
One of dozens of Muslim men who gathered beside a busy road to perform prayers outdoors, Abubakar said he believed the punishments were ""in order"", and sharia's role in Nigeria should be respected. He also warned against Western interference. 

""People should not come to others' faith and push their thinking,"" he said.

ADDIS ABABA, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Police in Ethiopia's Oromiya region have arrested 503 people on accusations they planned to cause violence during an annual thanksgiving festival this weekend and seized guns and hand grenades, the state-run news agency reported. 
State-affiliated Fana Broadcasting also reported on Friday that police and intelligence services had foiled what they said were plans to incite violence in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia ahead of the Irreecha festival of the Oromo, the country's largest ethnic group.
The latest arrests happened a week after Ethiopia's attorney general said about 2,000 people had been charged over deadly violence after the killing of popular Oromo musician Haacaaluu Hundeessaa in June.
Ethiopia News Agency, quoting Oromiya region police commissioner Ararsa Merdasa, said on Thursday officers seized guns and hand grenades during the arrests, ahead of a celebration in the capital Addis Ababa on Saturday and in Bishoftu in the Oromiya region of Ethiopia on Sunday.
In the violence following the musician's killing in June, at least 166 people were killed. More than 9,000 people were arrested, including some politicians from Oromiya, Ethiopia's most populous province and the home of the murdered singer.
Long-suppressed frustrations frequently explode into ethnic violence.
Last year's Irreecha festival in Addis Ababa was held peacefully amid tight security. But in 2016, a stampede, triggered by a clash between police and protesters, at the capital's celebrations left more than 50 dead.
Ethiopia, Africa's second most populous nation, is one of the continent's fastest growing economies and is due to hold elections next year.
Decades of frustration over government repression and democratic reforms by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who took office in April 2018, have emboldened regional power-brokers keen to challenge the ruling party.
Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his peacemaking, which ended two decades of hostility with neighbouring Eritrea.

But his critics have accused him of heavy-handed tactics - such as mass arrests or the detention of political opponents - similar to those of the regime that preceded him.

YANGON (Reuters) - From a quarantine centre in northern Myanmar, aspiring lawmaker Maw Htun Aung, wearing a bright yellow surgical mask, lays out his plan for an upcoming general election in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) broadcast.
The 37-year old is running his campaign from one of the state-run facilities in which about 45,000 people across the Southeast Asian country have been quarantined, one of a multitude of challenges confronting political parties as Myanmar pushes ahead with the Nov. 8 vote, despite a growing novel coronavirus outbreak.
Maw Htun Aung, serving mandatory quarantine after travelling within the country, is canvassing by telephone but says nothing can replace face-to-face contact with voters.
“I want to listen to their voices, expectations. I want to answer their questions and explain to them in person,” he said. 
Myanmar's coronavirus infections have rocketed from a few hundred in mid-August to more than 13,000, with more than 300 deaths, triggering strict lockdowns.
The outbreak has raised questions about the viability of the election as authorities pour resources into fighting the virus and lockdowns leave candidates unable to campaign as normal and international observers shut out of the country. 
A government spokesman and representatives of the ruling National League for Democracy (NLD) did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.
FACEBOOK CAMPAIGN 
The main challenger to leader Aung San Suu Kyi’s NLD, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party, and 23 other opposition parties have called for the polls to be postponed. But Suu Kyi said in a broadcast this week the election was ""more important than COVID"".
The parliamentary term is constitutionally bound to end on Jan. 31 and if no election is held before then it would be without a legislature, raising the possibility of a constitutional crisis.
Myanmar’s electoral agency said it would increase the number of polling stations to prevent overcrowding but it has given few other details about measures it is taking. A spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment. 
With domestic travel and big gatherings banned and lockdowns in the commercial capital of Yangon as well as the western state of Rakhine, many candidates have moved campaigns online.
It is a far cry from the jubilant rallies during the 2015 election campaign that brought the NLD to power, the first civilian government in half a century.
Suu Kyi remains hugely popular and looks set to win, though probably without the same level of support she got in 2015, as frustration with her government grows in ethnic minority areas.
But Richard Horsey, a Myanmar-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, said the reliance on social media would give a ""huge incumbent boost"" to the NLD and Suu Kyi, whose Facebook page is the most popular in the country. 
In places where the internet is limited or curbed, including Rakhine State, where authorities restricted access while government troops battle ethnic minority insurgents, little campaigning is going on.
“We have too many obstacles,” said Myo Kyaw, the general secretary of a party in the state, the Arakan League for Democracy. “We cannot go in person, we cannot communicate via social media.” 
‘NOT FREE AND FAIR’
Flights into Myanmar are banned and the government has not said how foreign journalists can enter to cover the vote. The European Union has said it will not send an observer mission while the U.S-based Carter Center is hiring only Myanmar citizens.
Myanmar journalists are not exempt from stay-at-home orders and the government had announced no plans to help media cover the election, said Zeyar Hlaing, a Press Council member.
Ye Myo Hein, an analyst at the Tagaung Institute of Political Studies, said absence of observers could impact the polls' fairness, while opposition candidates have complained that coronavirus restrictions are not being enforced fairly.
Monywa Aung Shin, a senior NLD official, stirred controversy by telling media that authorities would not punish his party's supporters for rallying in breach of the ban. He did not answer phone calls seeking comment.
""We don’t even have a chance to put up signboards,” said Htoot May, an independent candidate in Yangon.

""It will not be free and fair,"" she said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealanders will soon be able to travel to Australia without having to self-quarantine as COVID-19 infections slow and Canberra seeks to revive its ailing economy, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said on Friday.
New Zealand citizens and residents would be allowed to travel to Australia's most populous state of New South Wales and its remote Northern Territory (NT) from Oct. 16, without having to undergo the two-week quarantine required of Australians returning from other nations, McCormack said.
Australia closed its borders in March to all non-citizens to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has claimed 890 lives in the country and brought much of the economy to a standstill.
""I have just gotten off the phone with (NT) Chief Minister (Michael) Gunner who says the fish are biting and the beers are cold, and he wants to see as many of his New Zealand cousins and friends as possible,"" McCormack told reporters in Canberra.
New Zealand has effectively eradicated COVID-19, reducing the threat of additional infections in Australia from New Zealand visitors. Only 14 cases have been reported in NSW in the past two weeks - all of them people in hotel quarantine - while the Northern Territory has had no new cases since early August.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said those who travelled to Australia would have to quarantine on their return. She also said New Zealand would not open its borders to Australians for now.
The travel route will provide a badly needed boost to Australia's economy, which shrank 7% in the three months ended June, the most since records began in 1959. 
New Zealand tourists spent A$2.6 billion ($1.86 billion) in Australia during 2019, according to government estimates. 
The NSW capital Sydney is Australia's biggest tourist drawcard, while the Northern Territory boasts Outback attractions like Uluru.
McCormack said Canberra was also considering allowing residents of other countries that have no COVID-19 outbreaks to also enter Australia, although he declined to say which countries were under consideration.
Australia's second-most populous state Victoria accounts for 90% of national COVID-19 deaths and remains in partial lockdown.

Victorian officials said seven people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the past 24 hours, down from 15 on Thursday and near the four-month low of five cases reported on September 28.

Police said the lawyer, Lim Tean, who leads a small opposition party that unsuccessfully contested an election this year, was also being investigated for stalking and had not complied with earlier notices to attend police interviews.
""The police had no choice but to arrest Mr Lim Tean in order to conduct the investigations,"" police said in a statement, adding that they rejected allegations by Lim that the arrest was politically motivated.
The prime minister's press secretary referred Reuters to the police statement and did not have further comment.
In a trial likely to be watched closely next week, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong is suing financial adviser Leong Sze Hian over a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post in which he shared a story linking Lee to Malaysia's 1MBD state fund money-laundering scandal.
Lee's lawyers at the time said the allegation was ""false and baseless"" and Leong subsequently deleted the post. 
Over hearings spanning three days, the prime minister is set to take the stand to give evidence and be cross-examined. Leong was set to be represented by Lim but it was not immediately clear how Lim's arrest might change that. 
Human rights lawyer M Ravi, Lim's defence counsel, posted an image on Facebook of Lim being detained by police at his office and said Lim had protested against his arrest as ""politically motivated"". Ravi said Lim would ""contest the allegations vigorously"".
""The police reject his allegations that the investigations are politically motivated. Mr Lim Tean's alleged victims had filed police reports alleging serious offences by him against them, and the police have a duty to investigate the allegations,"" police said in their statement.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU leaders broke a diplomatic deadlock on Friday and imposed sanctions on Belarus after hours of summit talks, assuring Cyprus that the bloc would also punish Turkey if it continues oil and gas drilling in disputed areas of the Mediterranean.
The deal on sanctions against about 40 officials accused of rigging August's presidential election in Belarus means the EU can make good on a promise to support pro-democracy protesters in Minsk and regain some credibility after weeks of delays.
""The European Union is taking action against those who stand in the way of democracy,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said after fraught discussions among the 27 EU member states that dragged past midnight. ""I think that is an important signal.""
While Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions on Minsk to show support for pro-democracy demonstrations there, the impasse in the EU, where decisions are taken by unanimity, has dented the credibility of the bloc's foreign policy, diplomats say.
Cyprus, one of the EU's smallest countries, had blocked the action against Belarus for a month, insisting that sanctions also be imposed on its neighbour Turkey for oil and gas exploration along the coast of the Mediterranean island.
Germany pushed back against a tough stand on Turkey, fearing it would disrupt efforts to cool tensions with EU member Greece.
Turkey, both a candidate to join the EU and a member of NATO, has slid towards authoritarianism under President Tayyip Erdogan but remains a strategically located partner that the EU cannot ignore. 
In a sign that the diplomatic stand-off is easing at least between Athens and Ankara, NATO announced on Thursday that the two alliance members had set up a ""military de-confliction mechanism"" to avoid accidental clashes at sea.
'CLEAR SANCTIONS THREAT'
The compromise struck at the summit that satisfied Cyprus was an agreement to review Turkey's behaviour in December and impose sanctions then if its ""provocations"" have not stopped.
""The EU issues a clear threat of sanctions against Turkey should it continue to violate international law,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Twitter after the meeting.
European Council President Charles Michel described it as a ""double strategy"" towards Ankara, offering closer relations on trade and other fronts but holding out the threat of sanctions if it fails to de-escalate tensions in the Mediterranean.

""It was the most that Merkel would bear,"" said an EU diplomat after the talks. ""She felt the Union should give Turkey a chance for another few weeks. But Turkey has been put on notice and the ball is in its court.""

GUATEMALA CITY/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Guatemala invoked special measures for security forces on Thursday, after thousands of Central American migrants crossed the border without authorization as part of a caravan aiming to reach the United States.
President Alejandro Giammattei's declaration gives security forces additional powers to disperse public gatherings in six of Guatemala's departments, as more Central American migrants are expected to try to enter the country in the coming days.
On Thursday morning, more than 2,000 caravan members, many wearing face masks, barged past armed Guatemalan troops at the border, as they sought to escape poverty exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic.
Guatemalan officials expressed concern about contagion.
""We're talking about a caravan in the middle of a pandemic. The situation is complicated because they broke the health protocols and we don't know who has entered (the country),"" said Guatemala's migration director Guillermo Díaz. 
One member of the caravan died in Guatemala on Thursday after falling from a trailer and getting trapped under its wheels, the Guatemalan Red Cross reported. 
The caravan is the biggest since the coronavirus pandemic hit Central America in March, triggering strict government shutdowns that battered already precarious economies, leading to rises in unemployment and poverty.
It is likely to face challenges crossing through Mexico, where President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has deployed the National Guard to the border with Guatemala and dispersed previous caravans under pressure from the United States.
Republican President Donald Trump has made cracking down on unauthorized immigration a key part of his platform, ahead of the U.S. presidential election in a month's time. 
Members of the caravan said they were fleeing dire conditions in Honduras, which is experiencing the worst economic decline in its history.
""No one migrates because they want to, it's out of necessity,"" Carlos, a Honduran migrant who asked not to use his last name, told Reuters via WhatsApp after reaching Guatemala. ""We don't have any money to eat.""
Migration experts said the pandemic has exacerbated long-standing social issues in Central America.

""This new caravan is yet another effect of the pandemic, but even more than that, it's a result of social inequalities that are on the rise,"" said Misael Hernandez, a migration expert at the Colegio de la Frontera Norte.

Kim praised the speed of reconstruction work in Kimhwa County in the country's southeast during the visit with Kim Yo Jong, KCNA reported. He said of the storms and other natural disasters, ""This year has been one of unprecedentedly hardships.""
The younger Kim, considered the de facto second in command, is believed to be in her early 30s and is the leader's only close relative with a public role in politics. She became prominent with her harsh rhetoric against South Korea.
Summer storms and floods have hit North Korea hard, destroying thousands of homes and raising concerns of a worsening of the country's chronic food shortages.
While praising the recovery, Kim said he ""felt regretful"" that new houses in the area were of a ""monotonous"" design. Earlier, state media had called the cookie-cutter houses a model of the ""socialist fairyland"", advertising the regime's recovery efforts after thousands of homes were destroyed by floods.
Kim's comments were the latest official criticism in the tightly controlled country, where socialist glorification in the norm.
In recent weeks state media said Pyongyang had discovered ""faults"" in its efforts to battle COVID-19, and Kim offered a rare apology for North Korea's killing a South Korean official in waters off the west coast of the peninsula. 
On Friday, the ruling party newspaper Rodong Sinmun featured Kim's tour, showing lines of houses with red roofs and beige and white walls. 

Kim said that although speed was important, he wished ""artistic harmony with the surrounding environment and diversity had been appropriately combined"", KCNA said.

ASUNCION (Reuters) - Paraguay's Congress declared a national emergency on Thursday as forest fires raged, burning vast swaths of the Chaco dry forest, home to sprawling cattle ranches, jaguars and many indigenous tribes.
The emergency declaration boosts funds for fire-fighting and opens the door to requesting international aid to tame the blazes, which have sprouted up throughout the country.
Authorities said two firefighting aircraft had arrived in the country and would douse the most heavily impacted regions.
Regional neighbors Argentina, Bolivia and Brazil are also struggling to contain fires that threaten to reach historic levels amid drought and dry weather.
In Paraguay, the National Emergency Secretariat (SEN) said it had detected 5,231 fires in 24 hours, most in the heavily forested Chaco region. 
SEN chief Joaquin Roa called the region a ""breeding ground ...for forest fires,"" with no rain expected and air temperatures soaring.
""All the fires that have been generated are controlled but we have not won the battle, we cannot lower our guard,"" Roa said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Chinese ambassador to Washington said on Thursday that China's relations with the United States were facing ""severe difficulties"" and the two countries should lose no time in putting them on the right track.
Ambassador Cui Tiankai told a virtual ceremony to mark China's National Day that Beijing was willing to develop relations with Washington with ""goodwill and sincerity.""
""The China-U.S. relationship is experiencing severe difficulties rarely seen in the past 41 years of diplomatic ties,"" Cui said.
He said there were those who were trying to stoke up economic decoupling of the two countries and ""incite ideological confrontation and a new Cold War.""
""This seriously undermines the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people. ... We believe that a sound and stable China-U.S. relationship is in the interests of both countries,"" he said.
""We are willing to develop our relations with the U.S. with goodwill and sincerity, and the two countries should lose no time in taking bilateral relations onto the right track, of no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect, and win-win cooperation.""
Cui's comments come at a time when China-U.S. relations have sunk to the lowest point in decades in the run-up to President Donald Trump's Nov. 3 re-election bid. The world's two biggest economies have clashed over issues ranging from trade, technological and security rivalry to human rights and the coronavirus, which began in China.
In an address to the U.N. General Assembly last week, Trump demanded China be held accountable for having ""unleashed"" COVID-19 on the world, while Chinese President Xi Jinping called for enhanced cooperation over the pandemic and stressed that Beijing had no intention of fighting ""either a Cold War or a hot war with any country.""

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - The presidents of France, Russia and the United States called on Thursday for an immediate ceasefire between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces around Nagorno-Karabakh, but Turkey said the three big powers should have no role in peace moves.
France, Russia and the United States are co-chairs of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe's (OSCE) Minsk Group, set up in 1992 to mediate in the decades-old conflict over the mountainous enclave in the South Caucasus.
They appealed for peace as the death toll rose in the heaviest clashes since the 1990s around Nagorno-Karabakh - part of Azerbaijan, but run by its mostly ethnic Armenian inhabitants.
""We call for an immediate cessation of hostilities between the relevant military forces,"" the joint French, Russian and U.S. statement said.
They urged the ex-Soviet republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan to ""commit without delay to resuming substantive negotiations, in good faith and without preconditions"" under what is called the Minsk process.
But in a speech to the Turkish parliament just before the three countries' statement, President Tayyip Erdogan said he opposed their involvement.
""Given that the USA, Russia and France have neglected this problem for nearly 30 years, it is unacceptable that they are involved in a search for a ceasefire,"" Erdogan said. 
He said a lasting ceasefire could be achieved only if ""Armenian occupiers"" withdrew from Nagorno-Karabakh.
His comments are likely to fuel tension with his NATO allies as fears mount that the conflict could draw in regional powers Russia, which has a military base in majority Christian Armenia, and Turkey, a close ally of mainly Muslim Azerbaijan.
The conflict moved closer to the Armenian capital of Yerevan late Thursday as the government reported four ""enemy"" drones downed near the city. 
Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on social media that the four drones appeared in Armenian airspace in the provinces of Kotayk and Gegharkunik, and Armenian air defence forces had destroyed them. A Reuters witness in the city saw a glowing object in the sky. 
MOUNTING DEATH TOLL
Dozens of people have been reported killed and hundreds wounded since Sunday in fighting that has renewed concern about stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.
Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a 1991-94 war that killed 30,000 people, but is not recognised internationally as an independent republic.
Azerbaijan's civilian death toll has risen to 19, with 55 wounded, its prosecutor general's office said. Azerbaijan has not reported on casualties among its military forces. 
Nagorno-Karabakh has said 103 of its troops have been killed and more than 200 wounded, while 11 civilians have been reported dead and more than 60 wounded. 
Armenia said two French nationals working for France's Le Monde newspaper had been wounded during Azeri shelling of the town of Martuni in Nagorno-Karabakh. 
The Nagorno-Karabakh region's foreign ministry said the two journalists had been operated on by local doctors. An Armenian government source said they were in critical condition and had been transported to Yerevan.
French President Emmanuel Macron and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on the need for a ceasefire in a telephone call late on Wednesday. Their joint statement with U.S. President Donald Trump was issued hours later on Thursday.
Macron's office said he and Putin had shared ""concern regarding the sending of Syrian mercenaries by Turkey to Nagorno-Karabakh"". 
A Kremlin statement did not mention this. But the Russian news agency TASS quoted the Kremlin as saying the alleged deployment of fighters from Syria and Libya to Nagorno-Karabakh was extremely dangerous.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his Turkish counterpart had spoken by phone and expressed their willingness to cooperate closely to stabilise the situation, Lavrov's ministry said.
Turkey has said it will ""do what is necessary"" to support Azerbaijan, but has denied sending mercenaries. 
Macron, whose country is home to about 600,000 people of Armenian origin, has accused Turkey of ""warlike"" rhetoric.

A German government source said EU leaders would discuss the conflict at an ongoing summit meeting.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's ruling Labour Party promised to deliver more homes and replace a 30-year-old law blamed for high housing costs and impeding urban development, as it looked to tackle a hot election issue ahead of early voting starting on Saturday.
Labour would replace the Resource Management Act (RMA), and continue its plan to deliver more than 18,000 public houses by 2024, party leader and Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a policy announcement on Friday. 
“Overly restrictive planning rules are one of the causes of high house prices,"" Ardern said, adding she was determined to remove unnecessary barriers to the supply of land and infrastructure for housing.
New Zealand's house prices have soared nearly 90% over the past decade, analysts have said, due to an acute housing shortage of over a 100,000 homes. 
Successive governments have failed to ease the red tape around land approval, making land artificially scarce. For private developers the costs and consent process are significant hurdles, making properties unaffordable.
Ardern's flagship affordable housing project KiwiBuild also faltered and to date has just built about 600 homes, with nearly 1,000 under construction.
The housing crisis is creating a policy headache for Ardern as she seeks a second three-year term in the Oct. 17 polls.
Opinion polls suggest she is on track for a comfortable win, although the opposition National Party has been clawing back support.
Early voting for the election starts on Saturday.
Ardern also said the party would support first home buyers with loans and introduce regulations for property management services. 
The party said it would bring up its core recommendations in the next parliamentary term if elected. 

The opposition National Party has said the state housing waiting list has risen under Ardern, and claims it has a plan to deliver cheap homes faster.

Schools have been closed since March 23.

In the first phase of the testing program, workers from some 468 public health clinics will fan out over the city to administer tests over the course of 15 days.

Arising from the Larry Nassar gymnastics sex abuse scandal, the Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act calls for increased funding for the U.S. Center for SafeSport and more athlete representation on the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) board and sport National Governing Bodies (NGB).
If both fail to follow up on reforms, new mechanisms would be in place to allow Congress to dissolve the USOPC board and decertify NGBs. 
The bill, introduced by Republican senator Jerry Moran and Democrat senator Richard Blumenthal, followed an 18-month investigation that found Nassar, the former team doctor for USA Gymnastics, was able to assault hundreds of girls and women because of a lack of transparency and accountability among U.S. Olympic officials, coaches and trainers.
""The very institutions charged with protecting these athletes failed countless times, choosing to ignore or cover up abuse rather than defend and protect athletes and survivors,"" Moran and Blumenthal said in a joint statement.
""Today, the House passed our Olympic reform legislation advancing critical changes and effective safeguards to protect our Olympic, Paralympic and amateur athletes.""
The Nassar scandal, which triggered lawsuits and mass resignations within the USOPC and USA Gymnastics over the organizational failures to adequately respond to the abuse, has now led to Congressional oversight, which will receive regular reports and audits.
The bill also calls for the creation of a commission to study broader issues within the Olympic and Paralympic movements.

Following recommendations from an independent report, the USOPC begun last year to introduce the first wave of reforms including increased athlete representation.

About two months after the explosion that injured thousands and ravaged the Lebanese capital, questions remain about why and how the cargo was abandoned in Beirut. 
Authorities have blamed it on the huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate, used for fertiliser but also for explosives, going up in flames after being stored in poor conditions at the port for years. 
There have also been accusations of negligence against Lebanese authorities. Nearly 20 people have been detained in Lebanon after the blast including port and customs officials. 
Lebanon's public prosecution asked Interpol to issue warrants to detain the owner and captain, state news agency NNA said on Thursday, without naming them.
Boris Prokoshev was captain of the Rhosus ship when it arrived in Beirut in 2013, and he had identified Igor Grechushkin, a Russian businessman in Cyprus, as the owner. A security source and a judicial source said they were the two for whom Lebanon asked for arrest warrants on Thursday.
Russia's national Interpol bureau declined to comment.
Grechushkin, 43, was questioned in Cyprus in August. Attempts by Reuters to reach Grechushkin were unsuccessful. 
Cyprus police spokesman Christos Andreou said, regarding an Interpol request on Thursday: ""We have not received such a request.""
Prokoshev, who is in Russia, said he had not heard anything about it and that he has not been contacted by investigators before.
He has told Reuters that 2,750 tonnes of the chemicals ended up in Beirut after the ship's owner told him to divert to Beirut to pick up extra cargo in 2013. He has also said Lebanese authorities paid little attention to the ammonium nitrate, which had been stacked in the hull in large sacks.
The Rhosus had loaded ammonium nitrate in Georgia, shipping records show, before making the unscheduled stop in Lebanon. 
But it never left, becoming tangled in a legal dispute over unpaid port fees and ship defects.
Beirut port authorities impounded the vessel after it arrived in late 2013 due to outstanding debts, according to a state security report which Reuters revealed in August. In 2014, the ship was deemed unseaworthy and its cargo was unloaded in October and warehoused in what was known as Hangar 12, the epicentre of the explosion. 

The ship sank near the port's breakwater in February 2018, the report said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The CIA and National Security Agency directors opposed U.S. spy chief John Ratcliffe's decision to declassify and send to a top Republican lawmaker unverified Russian intelligence that may have been fabricated, according to current and former U.S. officials.
The disclosure that CIA Director Gina Haspel and NSA Director Paul Nakasone opposed the material's release comes after Democrats and former U.S. intelligence officials alleged Ratcliffe made it public for the political purpose of helping President Donald Trump as he pursues a tough re-election fight. 
Three U.S. officials and a former U.S. intelligence official said Haspel resisted the material's release, with two saying she worried that its disclosure could reveal the methods by which it was obtained.
Nakasone, whose agency intercepts worldwide communications, also opposed the materials' release to Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), said two sources, one of whom acknowledged that the Army general had the same concern as Haspel.
Moreover, a U.S. official said, the material Ratcliffe supplied to Graham in a letter the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman released on Tuesday was ""selective"" and misrepresented intelligence reporting.
The sources requested anonymity because of the issue's sensitivity.
The CIA and the NSA declined to respond to requests for comment. ""We won't comment on internal IC (intelligence community) deliberations,"" said a Ratcliffe spokeswoman, who did not respond to charges the intelligence was politicized.
In his letter, Ratcliffe said a Russian intelligence analysis alleged that Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, approved a plan to create “a scandal” by tying Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian hacking of Democratic National Committee computers.
Ratcliffe, a former Texas congressman who the Senate narrowly confirmed in May as director of national intelligence, provided the material despite noting that it was unverified by U.S. intelligence agencies and ""may reflect exaggeration or fabrication.""
The material contradicted a 2017 U.S. intelligence report and the bipartisan findings of a Senate Intelligence Committee investigation that Russia used hacking and other means in an operation designed to sway the 2016 vote to Trump. Russia denies election interference.
The Senate Intelligence Committee reviewed the material and discarded it as unreliable, said a congressional source.
""When you look at the sourcing it tells you it's not something to be taken seriously,"" said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Another source said that U.S. agencies believed the material reflected Russians ""talking to themselves about things, and what they think those things are, and what those things mean."" A more significant meaning should not be drawn, the source said. 
Graham said in a statement on Tuesday that the veracity of the material was ""not the question,"" but whether the FBI investigated the information just as it investigated links between the 2016 Trump campaign and Russia.
The FBI investigation was taken over by former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who found no evidence of a conspiracy between Moscow and the campaign.
Graham, a critic of the FBI probe and Trump loyalist facing a re-election fight, cited the material from Ratcliffe on Wednesday as he chaired a judiciary committee hearing featuring former FBI Director James Comey.
The materials' release raised questions about the motives and timing of its publication.
Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, House Intelligence Committee chairman, on Wednesday accused Ratcliffe of ""selective declassification"" of ""intelligence which he acknowledges may be fabricated"" for political purposes, the release of which may have compromised U.S. espionage methods. 

""I cannot remember an instance where the intelligence community declassified information that may or may not be accurate,"" said John Mossman, a former senior CIA official who also served as a Republican staff director for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

WASHINGTON, October 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday reversed a Clinton administration-era policy that required major U.S. sources of hazardous air pollution like arsenic and lead to maintain pollution control technology throughout the lifetime of their operation, enabling them to meet less stringent standards.
The agency finalized its 2018 proposal to reverse the 1995 ""once in, always in"" policy, which locked in so-called maximum achievable control technology standards (MACT) for major pollution sources like industrial plants and refineries for the lifetime of those facilities, even after they reduced emissions. 
The EPA said the change will ease costs for companies without undermining air quality by holding their facilities to less stringent regulatory standards as soon as they have reduced pollution back below a certain limit.
""This action reduces regulatory burden and provides a level of fairness and flexibility for sources that reduce HAP emissions below major source thresholds,"" according to the final rule issued by the EPA.
Environmental groups said the change creates a ""loophole"" for big industrial plants to pollute more, threatening low income communities that are often near such plants.
""The guidance was specifically designed to secure public protection from especially hazardous air pollutants - which in many cases are carcinogenic, or neurotoxic even in very small quantities - in keeping with the requirements of the Clean Air Act,"" the Sierra Club said in a statement.
The Environmental Defense Fund indicated it would sue the EPA after the new rule is signed.

The 1995 rule had resulted in the elimination of 1.7 million tons of hazardous air pollution over two decades, according to a 2017 EPA fact sheet.

(Reuters) - Cyber insurers and other financial institutions that facilitate payments to hackers to end cyberattacks risk running afoul of sanctions rules, the U.S. Treasury Department warned on Thursday.
The warnings, which referenced malicious programs known as ransomware, came in advisories from Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)and Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).
Hackers use ransomware to take down systems that control everything from hospital billing to manufacturing. They stop only after receiving hefty payments, typically paid in cryptocurrency.
The warnings add another layer of concern for cyber insurers, who have been ramping up rates and trying to curb exposure to vulnerable customers because of surging costly ransomware claims in recent years. 
Cyber policies often cover ransom, data recovery, legal liabilities and negotiators fluent in hackers’ native languages.
Ransomware payment demands have increased during the pandemic as people work remotely and hackers target online systems. 
The average ransomware payment jumped by 60% to $178,254 between the first and second quarters, according to Coveware a firm that helps negotiate and facilitate cyber ransom payments.
Sophisticated insurers and financial institutions are already aware of the sanctions concern, said Sumon Dantiki, a King & Spalding LLC lawyer who advises on national security and cyber matters.
""Will victims who are insured still decide to make the payments?"" Dantiki said. ""This type of public advisory could affect the calculus there.""
OFAC cited cyberattacks dating to 2015 that were traced to hackers in North Korea and Russia, both sanctioned countries.
The United States can impose economic and trade sanctions on countries that sponsor terrorism or violate human rights. Financial institutions that engage with them or some individuals can face prosecution and penalties.

A second FinCEN report pointed to a growing industry of forensics firms that help organizations respond to cyberattacks, including processing the payment.

1194,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 05:26PM ET</span>",Biden campaign to start in-person voter outreach as U.S. election nears,"By Trevor Hunnicutt and Michael Martina
(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's campaign said on Thursday it would launch an in-person voter-canvassing operation in several battleground states, shifting tactics in the final weeks of a race upended by the coronavirus pandemic.
Some of Biden's Democratic allies have expressed concern the campaign has been too cautious about getting boots on the ground for voter mobilization in the states that will decide the Nov. 3 election.
The campaign had put safety first in light of the pandemic, choosing to forgo door-knocking in favor of remote contacts even though President Donald Trump's campaign has been running an extensive in-person effort.
But in coming days, the Biden team will send several hundred volunteers to Nevada, Michigan, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania to focus on contacting voters who may be difficult to reach by phone or computer, with plans to expand the effort to more states ahead of the election.
""We’re now expanding on our strategy in a targeted way that puts the safety of communities first and foremost and helps us mobilize voters who are harder to reach by phone now that we're in the final stretch,"" said Biden’s campaign manager, Jen O’Malley Dillon, who had dismissed criticism of Democratic field organizing.
Democratic allies worried the lack of an in-person ground game could be a misstep given the close margins in several battleground states that helped the Republican Trump narrowly defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016.
""Trump's running a full-blown get-out-the-damn-vote operation and the Democrats are doing a virtual get-out-the-vote effort by Zoom,"" said Brad Crone, an independent political consultant in North Carolina. ""There's a world of difference.""
Some Biden supporters in Florida – a huge prize with 29 electoral votes – also have been uneasy about the campaign's quiet presence there, particularly with recent polling in the state showing Trump making gains with crucial Latino voting groups. On his first campaign trip of the year to the state last month, Biden barely interacted with voters.
""We need to door-knock,"" said Jose Parra, a Florida-based strategist who heads the Hispanic-focused communications group Prospero Latino. ""Even if it only manages to move 10,000 votes, that could be the difference in a state as close as Florida.""
Both Florida and North Carolina are among states that will see an expanded voter-canvassing operation in coming weeks, according to a person familiar with the matter.
RAMPING UP SCHEDULE
The Biden campaign maintained that its remote outreach was engaging voters and had already resumed dropping pamphlets at homes.
Biden has consistently led Trump in national opinion polls, although the race is closer in the battleground states. Other indicators show Biden and Democrats generating momentum as voters begin to cast early and mail-in ballots. 
A Reuters/Ipsos poll in late September found 82% of registered Democrats and 81% of registered Republicans were ""completely certain"" they would vote, eliminating a traditional enthusiasm gap favoring Republicans. 
Spurred by opposition to Trump, a record-breaking surge of fundraising by Biden has also buoyed Democratic hopes for November. In August, Biden and the national Democratic Party outraised Trump and the Republicans by $364.5 million to $210 million, translating into a blitz of television advertising.
Biden has begun to crank up his campaign schedule. The former vice president last week made his first trip of the general election to North Carolina, where polls show a dead heat with Trump, who racked up five visits there in a month's time between late August and late September.
Biden and his wife, Jill, took a train trip through Ohio and western Pennsylvania on Wednesday after the debate in Cleveland, the kind of multi-stop battleground-state tour that some of his backers had pushed.
Trump’s campaign, which for months has knocked on doors and hosted large rallies, often over the objections of local elected officials and public health experts, said its rival's efforts were too little, too late.

""You can’t just parachute in a month before the election and hope to make up ground,"" Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.

Both countries are alarmed by the threat posed by Islamist militant groups in North Africa and the Sahel, and Algeria is weighing a more active military role against them outside its own borders. 
Esper and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune held ""talks on Libya and the Sahel and both parties agreed to maintain cooperation and coordination,"" a statement from Algeria's presidency said. 
In a statement, the Pentagon said Esper voiced support for expanding military relations with Algeria during the meeting. 
""The two leaders discussed security throughout North Africa and the Sahel and ways to advance our strategic military and diplomatic partnership,"" the Pentagon said.
Esper's visit is the first by a U.S. Defense Secretary to Algeria since Donald Rumsfeld's in 2006 and he is also the most senior American official yet to meet Tebboune.
Tebboune took office in December after mass protests last year led the army to push his predecessor Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down after 20 years in power. 
The new president has proposed changes to the constitution aimed at mollifying the opposition protest movement, but the reforms would also give the army new powers to intervene in neighbouring states. 
""Mark Esper wants to discuss the Algerian army's possible role in the region once the new constitution is passed as it allows peace-keeping operations overseas,"" a Western diplomat in Algeria familiar with the matter told Reuters. 
An Algerian source said the talks were expected to focus on Libya, where nine years of chaos after the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi have created space for militants, and Mali, where French troops are trying to help quell an Islamist insurgency. 
""Algeria has an influence in Mali. It showed it can help. The Americans understood that French military intervention did not curb terrorism,"" a senior Algerian security source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. 

""As for Libya, it is well known that Algeria maintains good ties with all the players including tribes and personalities,"" the senior source told Reuters.

Supreme Court President Arturo Zaldivar said six out of 11 of the judges declared such a referendum constitutional, although some qualified their support on certain conditions.
Lopez Obrador has proposed holding the referendum in tandem with mid-term elections in June, though it is not clear that it will be allowed to proceed on the same day.
An opinion poll conducted by newspaper El Universal in August showed overwhelming support among the public for allowing ex-presidents to face trial for crimes committed on their watch.
Lopez Obrador said earlier this week if the court rejected his bid, he would immediately set about trying to reform the constitution to find another way of pursuing the matter.

ROME (Reuters) - The Vatican's number two said on Thursday after talks with Mike Pompeo that the two sides' positions on China remained far apart and firmly asserted the Holy See's right to pursue an accord with Beijing denounced by the U.S. Secretary of State.
Pompeo met Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Foreign Minister Archbishop Paul Gallagher on Thursday on a visit to Rome marked by Vatican irritation over Pompeo's public criticism of a Holy See accord with Beijing on the appointment of bishops. 
Vatican officials have said they were ""surprised"" by Pompeo's comments, made last month, and particularly that they were published in a conservative U.S. Catholic publication that has called Pope Francis' pontificate a failure.
Parolin, second only to the pope in the Vatican hierarchy, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a book launch on Thursday night. He was asked if the positions were still distant.
""Yes, even though the purpose of the meeting was not to bring the positions closer,"" he said.
In an article and a series of tweets in September Pompeo accused the Vatican of putting its ""moral authority"" at risk if it renewed an agreement with China over the appointment of bishops. It sparked a minor diplomatic crisis.
Vatican officials suggested Pompeo was trying to drag the Catholic Church into the U.S. presidential election by denouncing its relations with China. Pompeo has denied this.
""He (Pompeo) explained his reasons for making those statements and we explained our reasons why we intend to move ahead on the path we have already chosen,"" Parolin said.
Parolin said the Vatican ""asserts (the right to move forward) with a choice that has been thought through, reflected on, prayed over, a choice the pope has made, therefore the freedom to move forward.""
The Vatican's two-year-old accord with Beijing gives the pope final say over the appointment of Chinese bishops. Parolin said the Vatican would renew it when it expires this month.
Vatican officials say the agreement is not perfect but establishes a dialogue with Beijing after decades during which Chinese Catholics faithful to the pope were driven underground.
Parolin said Pompeo had expressed ""understanding for the way the Holy See approaches these issues.""
President Donald Trump has campaigned on his hard line on China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. He is also associated with conservative Protestant and Catholic movements, many of which have been critical of Pope Francis.

In an address to a symposium on Wednesday, Pompeo did not directly address the Vatican agreement with Beijing but described China as the world's worst abuser of religious rights.

KIGALI (Reuters) - The family of Paul Rusesabagina, the former hotelier portrayed as a hero in a film about Rwanda’s 1994 genocide, on Thursday called on the United States, the European Union and Belgium to appeal for his release from prison in Rwanda.
Rusesabagina, a political dissident who lived in exile in Belgium and the United States, was charged with terrorism and other offences last month after he returned to Rwanda and was arrested in August. 
His case has attracted widespread international attention partly because his story of protecting Tutsi guests during the genocide was made into a popular Hollywood film. 
Rusesabagina, who says he was tricked into returning to Rwanda, has been denied his choice of defence lawyers, his family and their lawyer told an online news conference. Instead, Rusesabagina's defence team was appointed by the government of Rwanda. 
""This is unprecedented,"" said Peter Robinson, an American lawyer who has previously defended people accused at the International Criminal Court and international war crimes tribunals for Rwanda. ""They are preventing Paul from being defended by lawyers of his choice."" 
The foreign ministry and the justice ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Robinson said the family had appointed him and six other lawyers to defend Rusesabagina. But their local lawyer -- one of the six - has not been permitted to see Rusesabagina and his government-appointed lawyers have not communicated with Rusesabagina's family, he said.
Robinson urged the United States, Belgium and European Union to put pressure on the Rwandan government to free Rusesabagina, who is a Belgian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States. He received the United States’ highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2005.
Rwanda has said that Rusesabagina's trial will be quick, fair and public. But his family want him freed. 
""We ask Belgium to protect its citizen and bring him home as quickly as possible,"" Rusesabagina’s youngest daughter Carine Kanimba, said. Rusesabagina’s eldest daughter Lys Rusesabagina appealed for her father to stand trial in Belgium.
Rusesabagina told The New York Times during an interview conducted after his arrest that he had been tricked into boarding a private jet he thought was bound for Burundi and arrested when it touched down in Rwanda.
Rusesabagina has been charged with crimes including terrorism, financing terrorism, arson, kidnap and murder. He has told a court that he backed opposition groups but denied any role in violence. On Friday, a Rwandan court will rule on Rusesabagina's appeal against the denial of bail.

""My dad is surrounded by people who want him to fall, from the gunmen around him to his lawyers pretending to defend him. He is fighting alone out there,"" Rusesabagina's son Tresor Rusesabagina said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A Belgian artist who has fought a seven-year legal battle to prove that Belgium's former King Albert II is her father secured a literally crowning success in court on Thursday when she officially became a princess.
Belgium's appeals court granted Delphine Boel the title ""Princess of Belgium"" after the former monarch's DNA test proved that he was her father, Boel's lawyers said in a statement, adding Boel was ""fully satisfied"" with the ruling.
The DNA test revealed in January that Albert II is the biological father of Boel, putting an end to Boel's long-running paternity claim.
Albert, who abdicated six years ago in favour of his son Philippe, had long contested Boel's claim.
As well as being recognised as a princess, Boel will change her surname to her father's, Saxe-Cobourg. Her two children Josephine and Oscar will also receive royal titles and the right to be referred to as his or her royal highness.
""A legal victory will never replace the love of a father, but does offer a sense of justice, further reinforced by the fact that many children who have gone through the same ordeal will find strength to face them there,"" Boel's lawyers said.

The court's sudden ruling came as a surprise. Its decision had been scheduled for Oct. 29.

""On Monday evening I received a positive test result for COVID-19. I travelled home by train on Tuesday morning without seeking advice. This was ... wrong and I am sorry,"" she said in a statement.

WINDHOEK (Reuters) - Namibian President Hage Geingob said on Thursday that the southwestern African country must take care in its efforts to reverse the legacy of racist white minority rule, so as not to be seen as grabbing wealth.
Speaking at a virtual session at an event organised by international organisation Horasis, Geingob said Namibia's status as an upper middle income country belied the fact that some 80% of its population, mostly Black, was living in poverty, while whites who make up less than 5% of Namibia's 2.4 million people were wealthy.
""We are proud to be an upper middle income country ... But that is forgetting that we are coming from an apartheid background where Blacks were left out,"" he said.
Namibia, an ex-German colony, was run by South Africa during the time that the latter was controlled by the white minority apartheid regime. It only achieved independence in 1990.
""Distribution is an issue, but how do we do it?"" Geingob said. ""We have a racial issue here, a historical racial divide. Now you say we must grab from the whites and give it to the Blacks, it's not going to work. That is not our purpose here.""
He did not give further details, but the 79-year-old leader in the past drafted a policy that Namibia would make it mandatory for white-owned businesses to sell a 25% stake to Blacks, only for the country to later rescind it as unworkable. 
A similar policy worked in South Africa, but in its neighbour Zimbabwe, expropriation of white-owned land by the government two decades ago triggered an economic crisis.
The country's economy, which heavily relies on diamond mining and tourism, is set to contract by a record 11.1% this year according to the statistics office, owing to the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic this year and a brutal drought last year. 

Geingob said he hoped to revive the economy with investments in wind and solar energy, as well as fisheries.

1202,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 02:31PM ET</span>",UK judge to give Assange's U.S. extradition verdict early next year,"By Michael Holden and Estelle Shirbon
LONDON (Reuters) - A British judge said on Thursday she would give her decision early next year on whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to the United States to face 18 charges including espionage.
U.S. authorities accuse Australian-born Assange, 49, of conspiring to hack government computers and of violating a secrecy law with Wikileaks' release of confidential official communications in 2010-2011.
To admirers, Assange is a champion of free speech who exposed abuses of power. Critics say that by publishing unredacted documents, he recklessly endangered the lives of intelligence sources in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.
Judge Vanessa Baraitser told London's Old Bailey Court at the conclusion of his extradition hearings that she would deliver her verdict on Jan. 4. 
Assange's legal travails in Britain date to 2010, when he began fighting an attempt to extradite him to Sweden to answer questions about allegations of sexual assault, which were later dropped. 
In June 2012, he sought refuge in the Ecuadorean embassy where he remained for seven years. He was dragged out in April last year and served a jail term for violating bail, but has remained in prison after the U.S. extradition process began.
'FIGHT FOR TRUTH'
Those hearings began in February for a week and were due to resume in May, but the coronavirus lockdown meant they were then postponed until September.
Assange's legal team argue that the charges are politically motivated, his mental health is at risk, conditions in U.S. prisons breach Britain's human rights laws, and he and his lawyers were spied on while he was in the Ecuadorean embassy.
The U.S. legal team has countered that many of Assange's defence arguments are issues which should be addressed in a trial, and have no bearing on extradition.
""It’s a fight for Julian’s life, a fight for press freedom and a fight for the truth,"" Assange's partner Stella Moris, with whom he had two children while in the embassy, said outside the court.

Assange made headlines in 2010 when WikiLeaks published a U.S. military video showing a 2007 attack by Apache (NASDAQ:APA) helicopters in Baghdad that killed a dozen people, including two Reuters news staff. The site later published vast troves of U.S. military records and diplomatic cables.

In a statement, the department said the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia on Tuesday also ruled in favor of setting up a trust for the government for any future earnings from Snowden's book, which had been the subject of a federal lawsuit.
A lawyer for Snowden did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In September 2019, the U.S. government sued Snowden, who resides in Russia, over his publication of ""Permanent Record"", a book which the United States says violated non-disclosure agreements he signed when working for both NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency. 
The United States alleges that Snowden published the book without first submitting it to U.S. agencies for pre-publication review, in violation of agreements he signed when working for the agencies. U.S. authorities did not seek to block publication of Snowden's book but rather to seize all proceeds.
Last December, a federal court in Virginia found that Snowden did breach his obligations to the CIA and NSA but reserved judgment on possible remedies. In an order issued on Tuesday, the court entered a judgment in the U.S. government's favor for more than $5.2 million. 

The civil litigation over the book is separate from criminal charges prosecutors filed against Snowden under a 1917 U.S. espionage law.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada has reintroduced a bill on Thursday that will criminalize LGBT conversion therapy, a federal minister said after an earlier effort to ban the practice failed as the parliament was discontinued due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Conversion therapy is any practice designed to change a person's sexual orientation, which especially harms and stigmatizes those belonging to the lesbian, gay, bisexual or trans community.
Federal Minister of Justice David Lametti said the new bill will include five amendments to Canada's Criminal Code to include offences such as causing a minor to undergo conversion therapy, causing any person to undergo the therapy against their will, and profiting off from the practice.
The bill was previously introduced in the House of Commons in March.
""Conversion therapy is harmful, degrading, and has no place in Canada … I hope that all parties will do the right thing by supporting this bill,"" Prime Minster Justin Trudeau told reporters on Thursday.
Trudeau's Liberal Party promised to ban the practice during an unveiling of the party's election platform last year.
The bill was presented in the House of Commons on Thursday though no voting date has been set. 
Some 20% of sexual minority men in Canada have undergone some form of conversion therapy, according government data. Lower income, indigenous and trans people are disproportionately exposed to the practice, the data shows.
The bill will not apply to those seeking guidance and support from counselors or faith leaders.

Canadian cities such as Vancouver in British Columbia and Calgary in Alberta are banning the practice within their borders, a government statement said.

The allegations, first reported by ARD public television, was the latest blow to the reputation of German police, who are under pressure to take tougher action against those in its ranks with far-right sympathies.
In September, officials in the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) suspended 29 officers for sharing pictures of Adolf Hitler and doctored depictions of refugees in gas chambers on their mobile phones.
NRW's interior minister said on Thursday disciplinary steps had been taken against another police officer and three members of the BfV domestic security agency who were suspected of exchanging xenophobic and Islamophobic videos in a chat group.
In a country with painful memories of the World War Two genocide of millions of Jews by the Nazi regime, some politicians have called for a national commission to investigate the extent of racism within the police and security services.
Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, a conservative ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, has resisted such calls.
ARD TV's Monitor programme discovered racist exchanges involving more than 25 policemen in Berlin through two whistleblowers, including an officer who was a member of the chat group.
A police spokesman said such messages are punishable by law.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium's new premier arrived for a European Union summit on Thursday fresh from his swearing-in ceremony, exultantly bumping elbows with fellow leaders as he told them his country finally had a proper government after 652 days.
Summits of the 27-nation EU had become used to a ""caretaker"" Belgian prime minister since December 2018 when the ruling coalition collapsed, leading to Belgium's longest ever stretch without a government.
But Alexander De Croo, a Flemish liberal who had served as acting finance minister in the caretaker government since an inconclusive election 16 months ago, was sworn in on Monday just five hours before sitting down with EU leaders.
""I'm very happy to be here and to meet my colleagues for the first time, I'm happy to announce in Belgium we finally have a new government,"" he told them.
Belgium's deep decentralisation and linguistic divide between Flanders and the French-speaking Wallonia have often delayed forming a government. After a 2010 election, the country took a world record 541 days to assemble one.
During the latest hiatus, interim premier Sophie Wilmes was criticised for her handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the country that is home to EU institutions and NATO.
Beyond containing the pandemic, which has killed more than 10,000 people in the country of 11 million, De Croo's seven-party coalition will face the challenge of reviving an economy that contracted by 14.5 percent in the second quarter of 2020.
""Our country, our economy, our companies cannot afford new generalised lockdowns,"" de Croo told Belgian lawmakers on Thursday, promising environmental reforms, a rise in minimum pension payments, and an extension of paternity leave.
As he seeks a vote of confidence in the Belgium parliament on Saturday, his government has attracted attention for being the country's first gender-balanced one. Wilmes became Belgium's first female foreign minister while women were appointed as interior and defence ministers for the first time too.

Green EU lawmaker Petra de Sutter became the first transgender federal minister, landing a deputy premier job in charge of state-owned companies and public administration.

Protesters waved the Iraqi flag and chanted ""free revolutionaries, we will continue the path.""
Some sang patriotic songs while clapping.
""We are here to start the revolution again ... We haven't forgotten about the blood of the martyrs,"" said Abbas Younis, 25, wearing an Iraqi flag as a cape and a surgical mask. 
More than 560 people, mostly unarmed demonstrators but also some members of the security forces, have been killed since a wave of popular unrest began on Oct. 1, 2019, with both security forces and unidentified gunmen shooting people dead.
Protesters, most of them young, are demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty.
The protests have shaken the country out of two years of relative calm following the defeat of Islamic State insurgents.
Infighting between political parties clinging to power has fuelled the crisis and threatens to cause more unrest.
Last year's protests caused the resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who was replaced in May by Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who pledged to investigate the deaths and incarceration of hundreds of protesters.
But protesters on Thursday said they are giving the new government an ultimatum to meet their demands by Oct. 25.
""Our demands are simple and legitimate ... we demand the killers of the protesters be prosecuted,"" said Mustafa Makki.
Dressed in combat trousers and wearing a shirt with an image of a killed protester and a necklace made out of an empty tear gas canisters, the 24-year-old said he had four bullet wounds, and one of them had cost him his vision in his left eye. 
""Within 25 days if the government doesn't meet our demands we will hold a general strike,"" Makki added.
Kadhimi in July called an early general election for June 6, 2021, roughly a year ahead of when it would normally be held, a key demand of the protesters. But Iraqi's parliament must still ratify the election date and amend the election law.
In separate statements on Thursday, Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi and Iraqi President Barham Salih pledged to meet the demands of the protesters.

""We affirm our loyalty to our people and to the roadmap imposed by the blood and scarifies of its youth,"" Kadhimi's statement said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwaiti opposition figures proposed electoral reforms and a pardon for dissidents in recent meetings with the prince who has since become the new emir, they said, seeking to improve stormy ties with the government that have sometimes flared into unrest.
The opposition figures, both liberals and Islamists, presented the proposals to Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah last month while he was still crown prince and before the death on Tuesday of late ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad, they said.
The Kuwaiti government did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Sheikh Nawaf was sworn in as emir at parliament on Wednesday.
Political stability in the oil producing state traditionally depends on cooperation between the government and the outspoken parliament, the oldest legislature in the Gulf Arab states and one often dominated in the past by opposition groups.
It has the power to pass and block legislation, question ministers and submit no-confidence votes against senior government officials, actions that have in effect stalled economic reforms or led to cabinet reshuffles.
While the government tolerates criticism to a degree rare among Gulf Arab states, the emir has the last say in state affairs and criticising him is a jailable offence.
Sheikh Sabah in 2012 broke the hold of opposition groups on parliament by using executive powers to amend the voting system, sparking some of the largest protests in the country's history.
""We look forward for a political detente with Sheikh Nawaf who has shown some positive signs, including by meeting with opposition leaders,"" said Ahmad Deyain, secretary general of the opposition group Kuwaiti Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Movement. 
""A pardon for the exiles would be a good start especially with the upcoming (parliamentary) elections,"" he added.
""BREAKTHROUGHS""
Under the old electoral system, voters were allowed to cast ballots for up to four candidates, which the opposition has said allowed alliances that partly made up for the absence of political parties, which officially are barred. 
The voting system introduced in 2012 allows votes for only a single candidate, which the opposition says makes alliances difficult.
Among those in self-imposed exile are lawmakers who took part in the storming of parliament by protesters and opposition MPs in 2011 over alleged government graft and mismanagement.
Others include Kuwaitis who openly criticised the emir, who the constitution says is above politics, or other Gulf rulers. 
Opposition figures said they presented the new emir with a proposal entitled ""Kuwait Document"" that calls for a reformist government, the launch of an anti-corruption campaign, greater judicial independence and changes to the electoral law.
""Starting the discussion is already a good step; I expect that we will continue on that path, which could lead to breakthroughs in several issues including reconciliation with some political blocs,"" Mohammad Al-Dallal, a current MP from the opposition Islamic Constitutional Movement, told Reuters. 
Courtney Freer, research fellow at LSE Middle East Centre, said the new emir would start with economic reforms, including an anti-corruption drive, as most Kuwaitis wanted that.
""The big question for the opposition is whether the new emir will change the electoral law,"" Freer told Reuters.
Parliamentary elections are due this year.
Abdul Hameed Dashti, a Shi'ite MP in exile in Geneva since 2016, was sentenced to jail in absentia on in several cases, including charges of insulting Saudi Arabia and Bahrain.

Double Michelin-starred Philippe Etchebest, who frequently appears on TV cooking shows, pressed restaurateurs and their staff to stand on the street outside their venues on Friday before lunch service and make some noise.
""We will not die in silence,"" he said on BFM television. ""The government must understand that restaurants are not to blame for COVID and that closing our venues only moves the problem elsewhere,"" he said.
Etchebest, who regularly acts as a spokesman for the industry and has been consulted by President Emmanuel Macron, said closing restaurants and bars would encourage people to gather in private homes, where he questioned whether social distancing rules were respected at all. 
Health Minister Olivier Veran has already ordered bars and restaurants in the southern city of Marseille to shut for two weeks and said Paris could be placed on the maximum alert level from Monday, meaning similar measures there.
Like other European countries where infection rates have surged in the past month, France has once again been tightening restrictions on public life, hoping it will be enough to contain the disease and avoid a second national lockdown.

Opposition parties led by congress chief Juan Guaido have said they will not participate in the vote on the grounds that it is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party. 
The EU last week sent a mission to Caracas and on Wednesday issued a statement saying conditions do not exist for a free and fair election.
Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday the EU's statement ""reflects a biased position on the conditions in which the Venezuelan people will choose the new National Assembly on December 6,"" and called on the EU to play ""a positive and respectful facilitation role.""
Maduro had asked the United Nations and the EU to send electoral observation missions. Officials say the EU needs at least six months to organize and observation group.

Two-time presidential candidate Henrique Capriles for weeks urged the opposition to fight for better conditions, but on Wednesday night said a delay was necessary to ensure a free and fair vote.

The FSB security service said it had detained two people with the help of the police for a theft that took place last month at a cathedral in the Iversky monastery in Novgorod region, some 350 km (220 miles) northwest of Moscow. 
The two individuals, who the FSB said were part of a criminal gang, had stolen golden ornaments and an icon depicting the Virgin Mary at a monastery on Mount Athos in Greece, an important Orthodox spiritual centre. The icon, it said, dated back to the 17th or 18th century. 
Irina Volk, the spokeswoman of the Interior Ministry, said Putin had given the icon to the monastery, located on an island on Lake Valdayskoye, as a gift in 2001. 
She said the burglars had reached the island by boat, before digging a passage below the monastery's gates. Once on its territory, they smashed one of the cathedral's windows and broke in to steal the icon, the altar cross and other gold ornaments. 
Footage released by the ministry showed armed FSB officers entering a suspect's residence and pinning him face down on the floor with his hands cuffed behind his back. 
Volk said the altar cross and the icon had been recovered in one of the suspects' garage and that the items would soon be returned to the monastery. 
Icons are an integral part of Russian Orthodox culture and are present at places of worship and used during religious celebrations.

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>","Kremlin says Navalny works with CIA, after he accuses Putin of poisoning","BERLIN/MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin accused opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Thursday of working with the CIA, after Navalny said he believed President Vladimir Putin was behind the suspected poisoning that put him in a coma in Germany.
The accusation from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov appears to be the first time the Russian authorities have directly accused Putin's highest-profile critic of working with a foreign intelligence agency.
It raises the stakes should Navalny fulfil a pledge to return to Russia, and may add to pressure on Western leaders, especially German Chancellor Angela Merkel, to take action over his case.
Navalny responded by saying he would sue Peskov over the accusation, challenging him to present evidence to back it up.
Navalny, 44, emerged in recent weeks from a coma after suddenly falling ill in during a flight in Siberia and being flown to Berlin for treatment. German doctors say he was poisoned with novichok, a rare Russian nerve agent.
""I believe that Putin is behind the crime and I don't have any other versions of what happened,"" Navalny told Germany's Der Spiegel magazine in an interview published on Thursday.
Peskov said Navalny's allegations against Putin were unacceptable, groundless and insulting.
""It's not the patient working with western intelligence, it's western intelligence working with him. That would be more accurate. There is such information. I can even say definitely - specialists of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency are working with him currently,"" the Kremlin spokesman told reporters on a conference call.
In response, Navalny wrote in a post on his website: ""Firstly, I am suing Peskov.""
""And secondly, I demand the publication of proof and facts, demonstrating my 'work with CIA specialists'. Show it on television at prime time. You have my permission.""
YOU KNOW YOU ARE DYING
Germany and other Western countries have demanded an explanation from the Kremlin for Navalny's illness. Russia says it has seen no firm evidence he was poisoned and denies involvement in any attack on him.
Navalny has posted on social media about his recovery, but the interview with Der Spiegel was the first he has given to a major news organisation since regaining consciousness.
He told Der Spiegel he would return to Russia, adding: ""My task is now to remain fearless. And I have no fear! If my hands are shaking, it's because of the poison, not out of fear. I will not give Putin the gift of not returning.""
Navalny was accompanied to the magazine's office by security guards, who insisted on choosing which bottle of water he should drink.
Describing the moment that the poison began to take effect, Navalny said: ""You don't feel any pain but you know you're dying."" He said he was making a steady recovery and was now relearning how to balance on one leg.
Navalny has tormented the Kremlin for years with online videos in which he details the lavish lifestyles and undeclared wealth of senior officials he castigates as ""swindlers and thieves"". In a country where opposition figures have little access to traditional politics, his anti-corruption campaign has become one of the few successful outlets for popular discontent. 
He and his wife are currently living in a rented flat in Berlin, but he said he would only resume posting videos once he was back in Russia. ""I do not want to be the opposition leader in exile.""
The politician, who was visited at his hospital bedside by Merkel, said he felt a personal bond to Germany and was impressed by Merkel's knowledge of Russia.

""My impression is that Merkel needs no advice from me,"" he said. ""But any Russia strategy must account for the depth of madness that Putin has now reached.""

After nine years of civil war, ordinary Libyans are learning to cope with fuel and electricity shortages and a funding crunch that means salaries are delayed by weeks or more. The country is rich in oil, but exports have been blocked for months by the fighting.
""My daily life is basically a series of hardships,"" Maghreby, 48, told Reuters. ""You're forced to seek out daily basic supplies such as bread, water, gas fuel and have to deal with power cuts as well.""
Maghreby, with a greying beard and wearing a cream shirt, was at work in the garage with one of his sons, surrounded by electrical cables and tools.
Libya is split between warring rivals in the west, where Misrata is located, and the east and south. 
The internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in the west is backed by Turkey. The Libyan National Army (LNA) under commander Khalifa Haftar in the east has support from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. 
The two sides have been deadlocked since June when the GNA repelled a 14-month LNA assault on the capital Tripoli. The LNA has retained its hold on most of Libya's oil facilities and had blockaded exports since January.
However, last month Haftar announced an end to the blockade and some exports have resumed, allowing revenue to start flowing to state institutions again. 
Maghreby has to provide for four children - two girls and two boys aged between 12 and 18.
A banking crisis and lack of liquidity mean he only receives his monthly salary of 900 Libyan dinars ($655) every couple of months.

""There's a lack of public transport and you have to secure your own, so you're constantly working all day, from morning to night and 24 hours never seem to be enough to cover your basics, not even luxuries,"" he said.

The ruling came just two days after he was acquitted in a separate fraud trial over the listing of Bankia when he was the bank's chairman - a decision which was a factor in the High Court judges' ruling. 
The 71-year-old Rato had served nearly two years of his sentence after being found guilty in 2018 of embezzlement in a trial over the misuse of Bankia credit cards, a scandal dubbed the Black Card case.
The High Court said on Thursday its reasons for the semi-release - known as an open permission regime - included his advanced age, the low risk of reoffending, health issues, and the fact that he had asked for forgiveness in the credit cards case.
A court spokesman said such regimes usually allow prisoners to leave the prison during the day or even serve the rest of the sentence at home while being tracked electronically.
Rato, who as former head of the International Monetary Fund wielded financial power across the globe, was serving time at Soto del Real prison on the outskirts of Madrid, a facility sometimes called the VIP's prison.
On Tuesday, he was cleared of falsifying accounts and all other charges in a trial relating to Bankia's ill-fated 2011 listing. His lawyer did not reply to a request for comment.

Rato, who still faces another legal case for tax fraud, served as Spain's Economy Minister between 1996 and 2004, IMF chief between 2004 and 2007, and Bankia chairman between 2010 and 2012.

Sergeant Matt Ratana was killed after the suspect, despite being handcuffed behind his back, produced a revolver and shot him several times at a south London custody centre, Croydon Coroners’ Court was told.
The 54–year-old officer was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Det. Supt. Nick Blackburn told the court the 23-year-old suspect had been arrested after officers found drugs and ammunition on him. The man was taken to Croydon Custody Centre and was handcuffed in a holding room when he produced the gun and shot Ratana several times.
Police said the suspect then turned the gun on himself and remains in critical condition in hospital.
A provisional post mortem examination found Ratana died from a gunshot wound to the chest.
“The murder of Police Sergeant Matt Ratana has deeply shocked and saddened all of us at the Metropolitan Police as it has the whole nation,” Blackburn said.
The inquest, which Ratana’s son joined remotely from Australia, was adjourned for police to carry out their murder inquiry. They are not treating it as terrorism.
Ratana, a keen rugby player, was originally from the Hawke's Bay area of New Zealand.
A second man was arrested in Norwich, eastern England, on Saturday and is being questioned on suspicion of supplying a firearm. 

The killing of an officer is rare in Britain and the murder drew messages of shock and sympathy from the prime minister and other senior politicians.

(Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired off one appeal after another for a ceasefire between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces, but the new eruption of their old conflict highlights Moscow's declining leverage and the rising influence of Turkey.
Russia's repeated calls - the latest one issued jointly on Thursday with U.S. President Donald Trump and France's Emmanuel Macron - have been met with a volley of defiant rhetoric from Ankara, which has thrown its weight more than ever before behind its ally Azerbaijan.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday it was unacceptable that Moscow, Paris and Washington were involved in seeking a solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, having neglected problems there for 30 years.
The situation presents a sharp contrast with 2016, when Russia was instrumental in halting a previous flare-up of fighting after just four days.
The difference is that Erdogan, who has bolstered Turkey's already close links to Azerbaijan by investing heavily 
there and buying Azeri gas, has said Ankara backs its ally ""with all its resources and heart"" in its ambition to recover lost territory.
""Azerbaijan has got more or less explicit Turkish support and feels, I think, more confident and capable of sustaining a longer conflict and is less inclined to or less vulnerable to peace enforcement from Russia,"" said Laurence Broers, Caucasus programme director at Chatham House think-tank in London.
""I think there's a sense in which Russia's services at the moment are not needed by Baku. It’s going for it.""
RUSSIAN FRUSTRATION
Russia has an urgent interest in finding a solution to the violence over Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave inside Azerbaijan that is populated overwhelmingly by ethnic Armenians and broke away from Baku's control as the Soviet Union collapsed in the early 1990s.
Moscow has good relations with both Armenia and Azerbaijan, and no desire to see a full-scale war break out on its southern doorstep with the potential to drag in neighbours such as Turkey and Iran.
Putin and his foreign minister Sergei Lavrov have been issuing statements and working the phones. Since fighting broke out on Sunday, the Kremlin has made public two conversations between Putin and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, although none with Azeri President Ilham Aliyev or with Erdogan.
Russian frustration was evident on Wednesday when Lavrov had told the Azeri and Armenian foreign ministers to halt ""provocative warlike rhetoric"". Soon afterwards, his ministry condemned what it said was the presence of Syrian and Libyan fighters in the conflict zone and demanded the withdrawal of ""foreign terrorists and mercenaries"".
That appeared to point the finger at Turkey, which denied a Reuters report on Monday that it was sending in fighters from areas of Syria's north that it controls.
The potential for a devil's brew of fighters from different war zones is a source of alarm for Moscow, which has struggled for decades with Islamist insurgents in its own southern regions of Chechnya and Dagestan.
""What we're seeing is a sort of bleeding together of Middle East conflict dynamics with the South Caucasus,"" said Neil Melvin, director of international security studies at the RUSI think-tank in London.
WORKING WITH ERDOGAN?
Melvin pointed to two scenarios for a possible halt to the conflict. 
While Azerbaijan has little chance of over-running Armenian forces entirely, it might score sufficient tactical gains to be able to declare victory and then use them as leverage in talks.
Failing that, a further escalation could force some kind of international intervention. In that case, with the United States distracted by the Nov. 3 presidential election and Russia struggling to gain traction by itself, Putin might be forced to engage with Erdogan.
Russia and Turkey are already backing opposite sides in conflicts in Syria and Libya, but the two leaders have a pragmatic relationship and have overcome past crises, such as Turkey's downing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border in 2015.
""Putin has been trying for the last few years to dance tango with Erdogan in the field of anti-American policy, to split Turkey from NATO, to sell Turkey its weapons, sell its gas to Turkey, and so on,"" said Russian analyst Dmitry Oreshkin.
""In that sense Putin openly and consistently treads softly with Erdogan, and in some people’s opinion too softly.""
Melvin said talking to Turkey might be the most viable way to achieve immediate progress, but it would require Putin to accept that Russia's influence had diminished in a strategically important area of the former Soviet Union.

""This may be what ultimately Erdogan's strategy is, to use the conflict to springboard Turkey to have a larger regional role,"" he said. ""But it's a very dangerous game.""

BEIRUT/TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Lebanon and Israel have agreed to a framework for U.S.-mediated talks aimed at ending a long-running dispute along the border between the two nations that have fought several conflicts.
Still in a formal state of war, Lebanon and Israel have contested their land and maritime borders for decades, namely over an area in the sea on the edge of three Lebanese offshore energy blocks. Israel said the talks would cover the sea border. 
Washington has mediated between the two sides.
""This is a framework agreement, not a final one,"" Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri told reporters, less than a month after the United States imposed sanctions on his top aide for corruption and financially enabling Hezbollah, the Iran-backed Lebanese group which Washington deems a terrorist organisation.
The heavily armed Hezbollah and Israel, sworn enemies, last fought a war in 2006.
The announcement comes with Lebanon facing its worst crisis since its 1975-1990 civil war. The country's financial meltdown was compounded by a massive port explosion that wrecked a swathe of Beirut in August, killing nearly 200 people.
Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz confirmed the two sides would hold U.S.-brokered talks on the maritime border, a major point of contention. He said negotiations were expected to start after Oct. 9.
The U.S. State Department said it ""welcomes the decision by the governments of Israel and Lebanon to begin discussions on the maritime boundary"", adding that the framework agreement for talks had taken three years of diplomacy to achieve.
It follows deals signed last month, brokered by Washington, between Israel and two Gulf Arab states to normalise relations.
Berri, a Hezbollah ally and influential Shi'ite leader in charge of the border file, said talks would be held under the auspices of the United Nations at a U.N. base in Naqoura near the boundary with Israel, known as the Blue Line.
He told a news conference in Beirut that Washington would push for agreement as soon as possible.
Berri mentioned the land and maritime border at the news conference, while Israel and the United States only mentioned the maritime boundary. One reason previous efforts to launch talks floundered was the two sides disagreeing over which frontier to discuss, analysts say.
A Lebanese official source suggested Berri was prompted to make the announcement now because of the economic crisis and U.S. sanctions imposed last month on his right-hand man, Ali Hassan Khalil. A Western diplomat echoed this.
Berri denied being swayed. ""I, Berri, cannot be softened by force,"" he told reporters.
In 2018, Beirut licensed a group of Italy's Eni, France's Total and Russia's Novatek to carry out Lebanon's first offshore energy exploration in two blocks. One of them, Block 9, contains waters disputed with Israel.
Berri said he had asked French President Emmanuel Macron, who has been at the centre of foreign efforts to help Lebanon out of crisis, to press Total not to delay exploration for gas in the offshore area.

As well as the maritime border row, the two countries disagree over a border wall Israel started building in 2018. A U.N. peacekeeping force monitors the boundary since Israel's military withdrawal from south Lebanon in 2000, ending a 22-year occupation.

Decorated with amber and gold, the Amber Room was part of the Catherine Palace near St Petersburg, but was last seen in Koenigsberg, then a Baltic port city in Germany but now the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad.
It was from Koenigsberg that the Karlsruhe steamer set sail in 1945 with a heavy cargo, before being sunk by Soviet warplanes off the coast of Poland.
Divers from the Baltictech group say they have found the wreck of the Karlsruhe.
""We have been looking for the wreckage since last year when we realised there could be the most interesting, undiscovered story lying at the bottom of the Baltic Sea,"" diver Tomasz Stachura said in a statement.
""It is practically intact. In its holds, we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."" 
The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War Two.
Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people on board.
""All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination. Finding the German steamer and the crates with contents as yet unknown resting on the bottom of the Baltic Sea may be significant for the whole story,"" said diver Tomasz Zwara.
The Amber Room was constructed in Prussia and then given to Tsar Peter the Great of Russia in 1716 as a present.

The Germans dismantled it and took it to Koenigsberg during the war where it then disappeared during Allied bombing raids on the city. Many believe it was destroyed. Russian craftsmen have constructed a replica Amber Room in the Catherine Palace.

The Madrid region's COVID caseload of 735 per 100,000 people is double the average in Spain, which has recorded almost 770,000 cases - the highest in Western Europe - and nearly 32,000 deaths.
Under the new regulations, all non-essential travel into and out of Madrid and nine nearby cities will be suspended in the coming days, but the precise start of the lockdown has not yet been announced.
""It's been very chaotic in all senses and this is basically because of the region's leaders,"" architect Jean-Pierre Moncardo complained. ""They did absolutely nothing during summer, they took no action and they prioritised business ... We are victims of improvisation."" 
People will only be allowed to cross municipal borders for work, school, doctors' visits or shopping.
Teacher Ignacio Rey accepted the need for tough measures to curb infection in what has become Europe's worst COVID-19 hotspot, but hit out at the seeming lack of a coherent plan. 
""It's a bit desperate, not knowing what's going to happen from one day to the next,"" he said. ""But I understand that given how the cases are going in Madrid, lockdown is the only solution.""
French national Sixteene Tripier-Rollin shared his concerns that the measures were rolled out in a hurry and said they lacked any grounding in science.
""We don't have scientific data and we are just told, 'you have to do this,' but we don't have any explanation, so we are a bit scared and don't really understand what's happening."" 
Earlier this year Spain imposed one of Europe's toughest lockdowns, helping it bring down the contagion. But infections have soared since the nationwide confinement ended in mid-June, with cases now rising by more than 10,000 a day.
Retiree Pilar, who didn't give her last name, said sealing off the city was a step too far. They should lock down sick people but let healthy people continue their normal lives, she said.

Regional authorities said that although they would comply with the central government's decision to enforce a lockdown they would also appeal it in the courts, so the back and forth and uncertainty for residents may not be over.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny ""constitutes a threat to international peace and security,"" Britain, France, Germany, Estonia and Belgium wrote in a letter to the United Nations Security Council, seen by Reuters on Thursday. 
""We call on the Russian Federation to disclose, urgently, fully and in a transparent manner, the circumstances of this attack and to inform the Security Council in this regard,"" they said in the letter sent to the 15-member body late on Wednesday.
Navalny was flown to Berlin in August after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight. He received treatment for what Germany said was poisoning by a potentially deadly nerve agent, Novichok, before being discharged in September.
The letter to the Security Council said that on Sept. 2 the German government confirmed that tests had shown ""unequivocal proof that Mr Navalny had been poisoned by a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group, which was developed by the Soviet Union and subsequently held by its successor state"" Russia.
Russia has denied any involvement in the incident and said it has yet to see evidence of a crime. The Russian mission to the United Nations did not have an immediate comment on the letter.
The European members of the Security Council and Britain noted that last November the Security Council adopted a statement reaffirming that any use of chemical weapons ""anywhere, at any time, by anyone, under any circumstance is unacceptable and a threat to international peace and security.""
""As such, we consider that the use of a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok group in the abhorrent poisoning of Mr Alexey Navalny constitutes a threat to international peace and security,"" they wrote. 
The letter was sent as Russia takes the monthly presidency of the Security Council for October. 

The United States did not sign the letter, but on Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The Russian Government must provide a full accounting for the poisoning of Alexei Navalny and hold those involved responsible.""

KIGALI (Reuters) - A special U.N. tribunal in Tanzania should quickly try elderly tycoon Felicien Kabuga on charges of financing the 1994 Rwandan genocide, survivors said on Thursday, after France's top civil court ruled he could be handed over for prosecution.
""The case of Kabuga should be speedy,"" Naphtal Ahishakiye, the executive secretary of genocide survivor organization Ibuka told Reuters by phone. He lost his parents and three brothers in the genocide. ""He is elderly, I think a quick trial would enable the victims get justice."" 
But the tribunal in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha faces both legal challenges and bureaucratic delays as it prepares for trial, experts told Reuters.
Emmanuel Altit, Kabuga's defence lawyer, said he would fight for Kabuga to be tried at The Hague branch of the U.N. Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, instead of its Arusha branch. The body was set up to handle final appeals and other remaining cases from the Yugoslav and Rwanda war crimes tribunals, which are being wound down.
""We will go to court to tell the judges that a transfer of Felicien Kabuga to Arusha would entail such risks that his rights would be violated as a result of the transfer,"" he told Reuters.
He declined to elaborate, but one line of argument might be that the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak in Tanzania is unclear since the government has not updated its case numbers for months, saying the pandemic is over. 
Kevin Hughes, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office at The Hague tribunal, declined to comment on questions about when Kabuga might be tried or where he might be held in custody.

U.N. prosecutors accuse Kabuga, a former tea and coffee tycoon, of importing machetes for ethnic Hutu militias that slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Tutsis and moderate Hutus. 
Kabuga’s arrest in Paris in May ended a manhunt lasting more than two decades. He has denounced the charges, including genocide and incitement to commit genocide, as ""lies.""
At the time of Kabuga's arrest, sources in The Hague tribunal said getting the case to court would require a lot of work because the file hadn't been updated in many years. 
A French court ruled on Wednesday he could be sent to Arusha for trial. 
Rwandan authorities did not comment on the court's decision, and a spokesman for the Arusha tribunal declined to comment.
Survivors have complained about some Arusha tribunal decisions, particularly where jail terms were cut on appeal.

Genocide survivor Ahishakiye said he would be satisfied with a trial in Tanzania as long as it was fair. A previous judge had angered survivors by reducing the sentences for some convicts, he said. ""We condemned it,"" he said. ""We beseech the current leadership of the court to ensure that does not happen again.""

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government came under fire on Thursday after newspapers revealed it had studied housing asylum seekers on disused oil rigs, banishing them to camps in Moldova or Papua New Guinea, or building floating walls in the sea to keep them out.
The main opposition Labour Party said the plans, revealed in leaked papers published by several newspapers, showed the government was ""lurching from one inhumane and impractical idea to another"" and had ""lost control and all sense of compassion"".
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government has said it is studying how to deal with small boats carrying migrants across the Channel from France, including looking at policies used in other countries.
It did not comment on any of the specific proposals reported in the newspapers, but Johnson's spokesman said he did not recognise some of the ideas, without elaborating.
The proposals, which newspapers said had been studied by Britain's Home Office, or interior ministry, include building a camp for asylum seekers at Ascension Island, a British overseas territory in the South Atlantic.
The Financial Times said officials had sounded out the maritime industry over building temporary ""marine fencing"" to block migrant boats in the Channel. The Guardian newspaper reported that Johnson's office was driving the discussion, and had asked officials to consider sending asylum seekers to Moldova, Morocco or Papua New Guinea.
The top civil servant at the Home Office, Matthew Rycroft, who faced questions from a parliamentary committee, said discussions had taken place ""in the realm of the brainstorming stage of a future policy"" but did not confirm specific plans.
Immigration has been a hot issue for years in Britain, and one of the major drivers of the successful 2016 referendum campaign to leave the EU. But sending asylum seekers to a remote location would be a big departure for a European country.
CLOUD CUCKOO-LAND
The country best known for housing asylum seekers off shore is Australia, which has sent people intercepted at sea to camps in Nauru and Papua New Guinea for processing since 2012, a practice condemned by rights groups and the United Nations.
Labour described such proposals for Britain as both absurd and cruel. Meg Hillier, a Labour lawmaker, noted that Ascension Island has no functioning air strip, and said the idea of sending migrants there was ""in the realms of cloud cuckoo-land"".
Human rights groups accuse the UK government of exaggerating the problem of migration across the Channel, to drum up support. They say the numbers reaching Britain by sea, about 5,000 this year, are tiny compared with migrant flows in many other places.
The Times said other ideas being considered included putting asylum seekers on disused ferries or oil rigs moored off the coast, or building a processing centre on a Scottish island - a suggestion rejected by Scotland's devolved government.

""They can rest assured that any proposal to treat human beings like cattle in a holding pen will be met with the strongest possible opposition from me,"" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter.

Although Japan has one of the most generous parental leave policies in the world, just 7% of eligible fathers take childcare leave, according to government data, far short of a national target of 30% by 2025.
Under the plan, companies would be obliged to inform their employees that men can take paternity leave if they wish to, the Nikkei said. Managers would confirm in person whether employees want to, it said.
The changes will be included in a bill to change the current law on childcare, which is set to be debated in parliament next year.
Companies are already obliged to let employees take leave if they wish to do so, but the new proposal would put a larger duty on the company to encourage workers to take time off, the Nikkei said.
A labour ministry official told Reuters that there were ongoing discussions on how to raise the number of fathers who take paternity leave, without elaborating further.
The government is trying to end the stigma around men taking paternity leave. In January Shinjiro Koizumi, the environment minister, made headlines when he said he would take two weeks of leave over three months.
Looking to boost the low birthrate in a country with one of the world's most elderly populations, new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has already pushed to make infertility treatments covered under health insurance.

Eighteen other migrants were injured, 10 of them seriously, in the violence late on Wednesday evening involving migrants from Pakistan and Afghanistan, according to Ale Siljdedic, spokesman for the Bihac regional police. The migrants were fighting each other, not local police, he said.
Bosnia has become a key transit route for migrants and refugees from Asia, the Middle East and North Africa since European Union countries shut their borders to new arrivals in 2015. Many migrants have made their way to Bosnia's northwest hoping to slip into EU member Croatia just to the west. 
There are up to 10,000 migrants in Bosnia at present, a quarter of whom sleep rough in the woods, abandoned buildings and by roadsides, keen to move on westwards from a country with few resources to provide for their essential needs. 
Regional authorities in northwest Bosnia have begun closing migrant centres in towns, saying they are overcrowded and that other regions in the country should share the migrant load. 
On Wednesday night, they moved 350 people from Bihac to the Lipa camp, which was already full with some 1,000 people. The newcomers were deposited outside the camp, leaving them to spend the night in the cold, said the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), which operates seven camps in Bosnia. 
The EU delegation in Bosnia condemned the migrants' transfer to an emergency camp at Lipa that was already at full capacity.
""As a result, hundreds of people are left in harsh weather conditions without shelter and access to basic assistance. These irresponsible actions put lives at risk,"" it said in a statement.
It urged Bosnia's national authorities to intervene to prevent a humanitarian crisis from unfolding and ensure shelter for all those in need including unaccompanied minors.

In a statement, the U.S. Department of Justice said two alleged U.S. Islamic State supporters made court appearances in Florida on Wednesday for charges of providing the group material support. That brings the total number of U.S. citizens back in custody from Syria and Iraq to 27, and among those, 10 face charges, it said.
Two other Americans facing similar charges faced U.S. court action in Minnesota and Washington on Sept. 16, the department added.
""The United States has brought back every American supporter of ISIS known to be held by the Syrian Democratic Forces against whom we have charges,"" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Demers said, calling the effort a ""moral responsibility."" 
The Kurdish-led SDF in northeast Syria is backed by the United States.
The department also urged other countries, especially those in Western Europe, to act and said it would help them take ""responsibility for their citizens who left to take up arms in support of ISIS's reign of hate and intolerance."" 
Europeans make up about one-fifth of the 10,000 ISIS fighters held by Kurdish militias in Syria, but many European nations have hesitated to repatriate citizens linked to the group for fear of a public backlash.
U.S. officials have said that Islamic State is evolving from a militant group with aims to hold territory in the Middle East to a global network that hopes to inspire extremist ideology and attacks elsewhere.
The Trump administration, meanwhile, has moved to draw down U.S. troops sent to help defeat Islamic State fighters in Iraq and is weighing a possible reduction of its diplomatic presence in the country.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Arab leaders headed to Kuwait on Thursday to offer condolences for the death of its ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad, who worked to unify a polarised region, as Kuwaitis waited for the new emir to name a crown prince to help guide state affairs.
Jordan's king, the presidents of Egypt and former occupier Iraq, and Oman's sultan were among those paying respects to Emir Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the brother and successor of Sheikh Sabah, who died on Tuesday aged 91.
Gulf power Saudi Arabia, with which Kuwait has its closest but most complex relationship, was represented by Mansour bin Mutib, an adviser to King Salman, who had surgery in July and whose son Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is de facto ruler.
Bahrain, who joined Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in boycotting neighbouring Qatar in a row that Sheikh Sabah tried in vain to end, sent its crown prince.
Qatar's emir was the only Gulf ruler to attend Wednesday's funeral rites for Sheikh Sabah, who was admired around the world for his humanitarian efforts and pursuit of moderation and balance in a region mired in conflict.
Sheikh Nawaf, who lacks his brother's diplomatic heft, is likely to uphold U.S.-allied Kuwait's foreign policy but may struggle to navigate between a new generation of Sunni Muslim Gulf leaders who have taken a more hawkish approach, especially against Shi'ite rival Iran, with which Kuwait maintained ties.
NEW CROWN PRINCE
The focus now for the low-profile Sheikh Nawaf will be naming a crown prince at a time when low oil prices and COVID-19 have hit the finances of the OPEC member state, which has a cradle-to-grave welfare system.
""He is the world's oldest crown prince at 83 so it is uncertain how long his reign will last and makes it crucial whom he will appoint as (the next) crown prince,"" said Courtney Freer, fellow researcher at LSE Middle East.
Under the constitution, the emir has up to a year to name an heir but analysts expect a decision in the coming weeks as dozens of senior al-Sabah dynasty members jostle for position. Parliament must approve the choice.
""The choice of crown prince will indicate the emir's ability to control differences within the family...and clarify to the people whether there will be a continued smooth transition of power,"" said Haitham Abu Hossein, a small business owner.
Among the mooted candidates are the late emir's eldest son Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmad, 72; his nephew Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad, 79; and his brother Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Jaber.
Kuwaiti sources and a diplomat told Reuters this week that Meshal, deputy chief of the National Guard, appears most likely to get the role that traditionally manages the government's often difficult relationship with the parliament.

Last year, business-minded Sheikh Nasser Sabah, who lost his job as defence minister in late 2019 amid ruling family infighting over alleged government corruption, was seen as front runner and the sources said he remains a strong contender.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have called for an end to ""structural racism"", saying it holds back young people of colour, in their latest foray into politically sensitive issues usually avoided by the British royal family.
In an interview for The Evening Standard newspaper, Harry said Britain could be a better place if white people understood more about those ""of a different coloured skin""
""For as long as structural racism exists, there will be generations of young people of colour who do not start their lives with the same equality of opportunity as their white peers,"" the couple wrote in an article for the paper.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made several comments on race issues since stepping down from their roles as working members of the royal family at the end of March and moving to California.
Harry, 36, told the Standard he had been awakened to the issues facing Black and other ethnic minorities since meeting Meghan, whose father is white and mother is African American.
""I wasn’t aware of so many of the issues and so many of the problems within the UK and also globally as well. I thought I did but I didn’t,"" he said.
""It is not about pointing the finger, it is not about blame. I will be the first person to say, again, this is about learning,"" Harry told the paper.
""And about how we can make it better. I think it is a really exciting time in British culture and British history, and in world culture,"" added Harry, who is Queen Elizabeth's grandson and sixth-in-line to the throne.
""A BEAUTIFUL THING""
The interview, carried out by video from their new home, coincides with the start of Black History Month in Britain which celebrates the contribution of Black people to the nation.
However, the Sussexes have faced accusations in the British media that they are not respecting the tradition that the royal family does not comment on political matters.
Last week, they encouraged Americans to vote in the November presidential election, with Harry saying it was ""vital that we reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity"".
Critics said his comments could be understood as a call to vote against U.S. President Donald Trump. Buckingham Palace said the remarks represented Harry's personal views. 
The paper said Harry had accepted in the interview that their views ""may seem controversial"".
In June, Meghan, 39, said she was sorry that children had to grow up in a world where racism still existed and that events in the United States after the death of George Floyd were ""devastating"".

Asked about the ongoing Black Lives Matters protests, Meghan told the paper they had been inflammatory for a lot of people, but added: ""When there is just peaceful protest and when there is the intention of just wanting community and just wanting the recognition of equality, then that is a beautiful thing"".

Alexander Lukanin, a 64-year-old scientist from the Siberian city of Tomsk, was detained on Tuesday after returning from China were he had been working at a local university, according to MBKh Media, a news outlet founded by Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky. 
Lukanin's apartment was also raided by the FSB security service, MBKh Media reported, citing one of the scientist's friends. 
A message sent by Reuters on Thursday to Lukanin's email address went unanswered. There was no immediate comment from the Russian or Chinese authorities.
Under Russian law, illegally transferring technology to a foreign country can lead to up to three years in prison.
Interfax news agency quoted a source as saying Lukanin had been detained for allegedly passing technology to China but that he was not being accused of passing state secrets, something that could carry a heavier prison term.
A number of Russian scientists have been arrested and charged with crimes such as treason in recent years for allegedly handing sensitive material to foreigners, including Chinese nationals. 
Kremlin critics say the arrests often stem from unfounded paranoia.
In February, Valery Mitko, a scientist heading the Arctic Academy of Sciences in St. Petersburg, was charged with treason after he was accused of passing state secrets to China.
Like Lukanin, Mitko had travelled to China to work at a university. 
Despite the misgivings of some nationalist politicians, Russia has increasingly prioritised closer ties with China, especially since its relations with the West collapsed because of its annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014.

Under Britain's Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS), postgraduate applicants from abroad already require security vetting to study subjects where their knowledge could be used in weapons programmes, according to a government website.
The Times report said the list of subjects would be expanded to include areas related to cyber-security and aircraft, among others.
Asked to comment on the report, the Foreign Office said the government had implemented a recent expansion of ATAS to cover military technology, to ensure Britain's safeguards were keeping up with ever-changing global threats.
""As an open country, we welcome foreign students, including from China, where they add to the academic richness of our world-leading universities,"" a spokeswoman said in a statement.
""But we will not accept collaborations which compromise our national security and ATAS is one of the robust procedures we have in place to protect national security and counter foreign interference.""
According to the Times, the measures were expected to block hundreds of Chinese students from entering Britain, while visas for those already enrolled would be revoked if they were deemed to pose a risk.

According to the ATAS website, applicants from countries belonging to the European Economic Area and from Switzerland are exempt from the scheme, meaning they do not require vetting to study the affected subjects.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican on Thursday released its most detailed-ever financial figures and, as it comes under scrutiny by the faithful over financial scandals, said it might have been swindled in some of its investment deals.
The Vatican economy minister, Father Juan Antonio Guerrero, said the Vatican's total net assets in 2019 were about 4 billion euros, which is believed to be the first time any such figure has been given.
He spoke in an interview with Vatican media as the Vatican released a 12-page consolidated financial statement for the Holy See, the central administration of the Roman Catholic.
It includes Vatican departments that oversee the governing of the 1.3 billion-member worldwide Church, its media operations and its embassies abroad.
It does not include the Vatican bank and the Vatican museums, which are both big money-makers.
The 4.0 billion figure, which Guerrero gave in passing in the interview without providing details, is all-encompassing, while the detailed consolidated statement regarded only the Holy See.
The consolidated financial statement was the first since 2016.
The Vatican has been caught up in a scandal involving the purchase by its Secretariat of State of a luxury building in London through intermediaries it has accused of being unscrupulous. 
One of the key figures involved in the London deal, Italian Cardinal Angelo Becciu, was fired by Pope Francis last week under separate accusations of embezzlement and nepotism.
""It is possible that in some cases, the Holy See was, apart from being badly advised, was also swindled,"" Guerrero said.

The consolidated financial statement showed that the Holy See had a deficit of 22 million euro in 2019 after extraordinary expenses that year, down from a deficit of 50 million euros in 2018.

Talks between trade unions and employer organisations broke down early on Thursday, handing the job of finding a solution to the Social Democrat-Green government. The government needs the backing of the Left Party as well as two small centre-right parties to pass its budgets.
Prime Minister Stefan Lofven had promised the two centre-right parties that if the unions and employers fail to agree new practices, the government would adopt proposals made by a commission to ease first-in-last-out rules, which critics say hamper companies' ability to adapt to changing conditions.
Left Party leader Jonas Sjostedt said he would try to bring down the coalition if that plan goes ahead.
""Stefan Lofven cannot remain as prime minister if he plans to put forward the proposals... which would tear up employment security for all wage-earners in Sweden,"" Left Party leader Jonas Sjostedt wrote on Twitter.
The Left Party would need the backing of the opposition Moderates, Sweden Democrats and Christian Democrats to pass a vote of no-confidence in the government - support it would be likely, though not certain, to get.
However, a vote of no-confidence could usher in a right of centre administration, something the Left Party does not want.
The government urged the unions and employers to resume talks, but Employment Minister Eva Nordmark said it would stick to its ""January Agreement"" with the centre-right parties and press ahead with the proposed changes if they did not.
Nordmark gave no timeframe for introducing the new rules.
Sweden's complex political situation stems from an election in 2018, when neither the centre-left nor centre-right blocs gained enough seats in parliament to form a majority government.
To secure a second term as prime minister, Social Democrat Lofven had to cut a deal with the Centre Party and the Liberals that included a raft of business-friendly reforms, including looser labour market rules.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Three Indian soldiers were killed on Thursday in what an army spokesman described as an unprovoked firing of weapons by Pakistani forces at the border in the disputed region of Kashmir, in a fresh eruption of tensions.
Firing frequently erupts along the Line of Control, or the ceasefire line in Kashmir, which both the nuclear-armed countries claim in full. 
Indian army spokesman Rajesh Kalia said Pakistan had launched unprovoked firing in the Nowgam sector early on Thursday, killing two Indian soldiers and wounding four.
Another Indian soldier was killed in overnight firing by Pakistan troops in the Poonch sector. ""Our troops responded strongly to the enemy fire,"" Kalia said.
There was no immediate comment from Pakistan.
New Delhi says Pakistani troops open fire to help militants sneak into India's side of Kashmir to join a decades-long armed revolt there. Pakistan says it only gives moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people fighting for self-determination.
India and China are separately locked in their most serious military face off along their border which is also disputed.

1238,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>","Mexico, plagued by cartel wars, on cusp of legal cannabis 'green rush'","By Drazen Jorgic
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - For Guillermo Nieto, a Mexican businessman who grew up smoking pot, the cannabis greenhouse on his family's vast farmlands in Guanajuato state is part of a bigger dream. One that involves deep-pocketed pharmaceutical companies.
Nieto and several Mexican businessmen have spent years positioning themselves for a time when the country opens up what would be the world's biggest legal cannabis market in terms of population, where the drug can be lawfully cultivated and sold. 
Mexico finally outlined rules in July covering cannabis for medical use, and the sign-off is expected in coming weeks.
A bigger prize may also be close for Nieto and foreign companies; Senate majority leader Ricardo Monreal told Reuters he expected a law to be passed before December for recreational use of the drug, allowing regulated private firms to sell it to the public.
""It's going to generate a market,"" said Nieto, wearing a smart blue shirt, blazer, and bright marijuana-leaf print yellow socks. ""We are expecting to create jobs and revenue for the government. We think it could really help our economy."" 
Indeed the legal cannabis industry is already a multi-billion-dollar global trade, and some big players, including Canada's  Canopy Growth  (NYSE:CGC) and The Green Organic Dutchman, and a unit of California-based Medical Marijuana Inc, told Reuters they were eager to tap the new Mexican market.
Business aside, Nieto says the new regulations will have a profound social impact on the conservative nation of 126 million people, where drugs are a sensitive subject due to a long and painful history of violence perpetuated by feuding cartels. 
""The first thing that will happen is that no Mexican will die or go to jail because of this plant,"" Nieto said. 
""With that, everyone wins."" 
Dario Contreras Sanchez aims to set up a business making products like soaps and pain-relieving oils from cannabis that he would grow legally near his family's hacienda in Durango state, where the powerful Sinaloa Cartel has held sway for decades.
He believes farmers near him who cultivate the plant for narcos would want to sell their produce lawfully - if the government permits them.
""Most of the people want to work legally,"" said Contreras Sanchez, whose sister married into the family of former Mexican drug lord Amado Carrillo Fuentes. 
However Mexicans are by no means unified on this issue.
While a growing cannabis industry promises to be a money-spinner, it faces resistance from campaigners who are worried that regulations for both medical and non-medical cannabis will heavily favor big, often foreign corporations. 
They fear legislation will shut out small family producers and fail to offer a path to legalization for many farmers who make a living by feeding Mexico's illegal narcotics trade.
'GREEN RUSH' FRONTIER
The initial regulations covering medical use permit entrepreneurs such as Nieto to grow marijuana on behalf of pharmaceutical companies and allows foreign businesses to import medical cannabis products into the country.
However Mexico's Supreme Court, which has effectively legalized cannabis by ruling prohibition is unconstitutional, has given the government until Dec. 15 to draft new legislation for the recreational use of cannabis. 
Monreal, Senate leader of the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party, told Reuters that lawmakers were currently ironing out the finer details of the legislation.
He said his party, which has a majority in both houses of Congress with its allies, should have no problems passing the law, which he added would decriminalize possession of a ""certain amount"" of marijuana.
Monreal said the law would not allow Dutch-style cafes in the first stage of liberalization, but the public would be able to buy marijuana from privately run and strictly regulated ""sales and distribution centers"".
However he added the Senate was divided over whether to allow industrial cultivation of hemp, a cousin of cannabis plants used in products ranging from food and clothes to building materials, citing opposition from industries that fear hemp will displace their goods.
Depending on what laws Mexico passes, Latin America's second-largest economy could morph into a hot new frontier in the so-called ""green rush"" spreading across Canadian and American farmlands, spurred by growing global investment buzz around legal marijuana.
Globally the legal marijuana industry was valued at $17.7 billion last year by consultancy Grand View Research, and is expected to reach $73.6 billion by 2027.
POT GIANTS PLAN MOVES
Large cannabis companies, which have pharmaceutical facilities to test products, said they were eyeing both the medical and non-medical marijuana sectors.
Canopy Growth, the world's biggest pot company, told Reuters it aimed to contribute to ""the responsible development of this new market"" and would review the upcoming regulations.
The Green Organic Dutchman said it ""looks forward to participating in the Mexican cannabis market"" through its subsidiary, TGOD Mexico, adding it was monitoring the situation.
Raul Elizalde, co-chief executive of HempMeds Mexico, a distributor and subsidiary of California-based Medical Marijuana Inc, said it had held talks with some Mexican pharmaceutical companies about a joint venture about, initially, medical cannabis. However it may launch its own pharma business in the country should the new medical regulations require it.
Elizalde said most companies would hold off making investment decisions until they see what laws the senate passed in December, in case they also amend the medicinal rules.
""It's much better to wait and see if this will change,"" he said.
To start with, big Canadian companies are likely to see Mexico as a place to export their cannabis products, while U.S. players, hamstrung by federal laws that prohibit marijuana exports, may franchise their brands in Mexico, said Avis Bulbulyan, CEO at cannabis consultancy Siva Enterprise.
Further down the line, Mexico's inexpensive land, relatively cheap labor force and favorable weather would likely make it a top destination for companies to grow and export cannabis raw materials and products.
""It's on a lot of people's radar,"" Bulbulyan added. 
'NO SOCIAL JUSTICE'
Not everyone is happy with how the new industry is shaping up, however.
The coalition that led the cannabis legalization drive through the courts, made up of pro-marijuana activists and parents of ill children seeking cannabis-based pain relief, say the new medical regulation helps big businesses rather than patients.
Lawmakers legalized the use of medicinal marijuana in 2017, while the Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that recreational marijuana should be permitted.
As it stands, the medical regulation would bar people like Margarita Garfias from growing cannabis for personal use to relieve pain. Farmers could only cultivate marijuana through partnerships with pharmaceutical companies that can conduct product trials, tie-ups which are out of reach for most. 
Garfias, the mother of a wheelchair-bound 16-year-old son with multiple disabilities, said families who live in fear and have faced getting criminal records for trying to help their children feel short-changed.
""The regulation doesn't help with this, nor with social justice nor human rights for patients,"" added Garfias, who said her home-grown cannabis-derived medicine had reduced her son's epileptic fits and hospitalizations.
Mexico's health ministry referred queries about the regulation to the regulator, COFEPRIS, which said the rules were focused on ensuring the population was not put at risk.
""Medicines must have quality, safety and efficacy,"" it said.
Activists say lobbying by corporations could shut small producers out from both the medical and non-medical markets, and thus fail to significantly dent the illicit narcotics trade.
""We are very pessimistic,"" said Tania Ramirez, drugs policy director at Mexico United Against Crime, an organization that spearheaded the legalization drive through the courts.
Monreal, the MORENA senator, said no law was perfect but that legalization would transform Mexico, from emptying its jails of small-scale pot smokers to helping farmers shed the yoke of deadly cartels.

""The most important thing for Mexico and its legislators is that they dare to knock down this decades-old taboo.""

Lebanon's banking system has been paralysed since last year, as a liquidity crunch left the nation unable to repay its massive debts. Lebanon's pound crashed, while banks severely restricted dollar withdrawals, blocked transfers and cut card spending limits abroad down to as little as $15 a month. 
This left many Lebanese students around the world struggling to pay fees or meet daily expenses.
Many Lebanese remain sceptical banks will deliver even with a new law, after a year in which the banks have tightened controls on transfers even without legislation in place.
The street value of the Lebanese pound -- officially pegged at 1,500 to the dollar -- has plunged to about 8,000. Dollars have grown scarce on the black market.
Parliament passed a law on Wednesday, the first of a two-day session, allowing students or their guardians to make a one-off transfer of up to $10,000 at the rate of 1,515 to the dollar. It applies only to students who began studies abroad before 2020.
It takes effect after publication in the official gazette. 
Several students have had to cancel or defer plans to start studies abroad this academic year, as banks refused to let them transfer dollars to pay fees.
At the start of the economic crisis, banks had pledged to transfer dollars for urgent needs, such as medical or college fees. But clients say most requests were blocked. 

""There's no money in the country. So where will these dollars come from?"" said a Lebanese student in France, whose parents' savings in Lebanese pounds had lost value.

From before dawn, people gathered along the river bank clutching bunches of white lotus flowers as a symbol of purity. Many wore face masks to ward against coronavirus and the crowds also included Buddhist monks in bright saffron robes.
As the barge carrying the golden Buddha passes, people traditionally pray for good fortune and then throw their flowers, which eventually cover much of the statue. 
A flotilla of boats, some ornately decorated, escorted the barge as it made its way slowly down the river. 
Other activities were also held, including a speed boat contest and a carnival. 
Thailand has suffered relatively few infections during the global coronavirus pandemic compared to many other countries, allowing authorities to lift many restrictions on social gatherings. 

Known in Thai as ""Khao Phansa"", the period of Buddhist Lent is a time when monks stay in their temples to meditate.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's tougher rules on foreign funding for non-profits will severely crimp their activities, the chiefs of some bodies said on Thursday, after human rights group Amnesty International suspended its work in the country, citing government harassment. 
Last month's changes to the law governing overseas contributions include a ban on transfers of money to other groups and a spending limit of 20% on administrative costs, such as staff and offices. 
""This is a climate where you can clearly see patterns in which the space for civil society is shrinking,"" Amitabh Behar, chief executive of the Indian arm of Oxfam, a grouping of 20 international NGOs, told Reuters.
""It's being stifled, and the message is very depressing for the not-for-profit sector."" 
India has an estimated 3 million registered non-profits, but since 2017 it has cancelled permission for more than 6,600 charities to receive overseas funding, as successive governments have stepped up scrutiny.
On Tuesday, London-based Amnesty International said it was halting work in India, accusing the government of a ""witch-hunt"" and blocking its bank accounts.
India's home ministry said the group was circumventing the rules on foreign contributions by illegally receiving money from the British arm.
""The chilling effect is coming from multiple corners and this only brings it home directly to us,"" Behar added, referring to Amnesty's closure.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has said the rule changes were needed to beef up accountability for the receipt and use of foreign funding, as few groups met basic statutory requirements or used the funds properly.
The government has said it launched criminal investigations into dozens of groups over misappropriation of such funds.
The new ceiling on administrative spending, lowered from a figure of 50%, presents a challenge as the category usually includes staff costs, the non-profit groups said.
Large non-profits typically work with dozens of smaller partners to carry out programmes and projects, and being unable to transfer funds to them would disrupt the sector, the Indian arm of ActionAid said.
""This would restrict the number of ... social workers and organisations serving the vulnerable, and restrict grants given to small organisations already on the FCRA approved list,"" said Sandeep Chachra, executive director of ActionAid Association.
He was referring to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), dating from 1976, a time of national emergency declared by then prime minister Indira Gandhi, who was seen as using the law to target critics of a civil rights clampdown. 
Today, more than 22,400 bodies registered under the law are authorised to use foreign contributions to pay for cultural, economic, educational, religious or social programmes, the home ministry says.
Over the three years to 2019, they have received 581 billion rupees ($8 billion) in such funds.

BARAKALDO, Spain (Reuters) - At the Cruces hospital just outside the Spanish city of Bilbao, the sound of power drills and hammers rings out as a construction crew gets to work on a new intensive care ward in preparation for a potential winter surge in COVID-19 cases. 
""Winter is going to be a high-risk time for us as more people will be staying at home in enclosed spaces, raising the risk of infection,"" said Dr Alberto Martinez Ruiz, the hospital's head of anaesthesiology and recovery. 
During the epidemic's first peak in March, when the virus spread unchecked through Spain's population, the hospital struggled to accommodate an unprecedented surge in critically ill patients.
""Our experience of the COVID epidemic was of a terrible avalanche of patients in a short time,"" Dr Ruiz recalled. ""In March we were admitting up to seven or eight patients a day.""
Irregular spaces like gyms were hastily transformed into wards, rapidly increasing capacity to more than 80 beds from 32.
""From one day to the next they all filled up. That allowed us to save lots of lives,"" Dr Ruiz said.
Imposing one of Europe's toughest lockdowns helped Spain bring down the contagion and gave the health service a chance to regain its footing. But infections have soared since the nationwide confinement ended in mid-June, with cases now rising by more than 10,000 a day.
Spain has logged nearly 770,000 cases, more than anywhere else in Western Europe, and almost 32,000 deaths. 
Hospitalizations are on the increase too but the number of severe cases remains far lower than during the first wave and ICUs across the country have plenty of spare capacity for now.
The average age of patients admitted to Cruces is now between 60-65, around 10 years lower than during the first wave. 
""Patients are being admitted earlier than expected but in a much more staggered fashion,"" Dr Fermin Labayan, head of Intensive care at Cruces, told Reuters. ""We don't have the same pressure.""
With the new ward boosting capacity to more than 200 critical beds and just 14 patients currently admitted, the medics feel the hospital should be able to cope even if severe cases begin to spiral and they now have of experience of which treatments are most effective.

""We are mentally quite tired... But we are prepared,"" Dr Labayan said.

SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In front of a single lighted mirror, 'Kylie Minono' meticulously applies shades of foundation, powder, and eye and lip liner, transforming into her drag queen persona with each stroke. 
""It's exciting to be able to step into a world of hope and positivity with my drag,"" said Minono, a nonprofit worker in San Francisco whose legal name is Kyle Levinger.
After years of stepping into drag for benefits and fundraising shows, Minono is bringing her act to the 2020 election campaign, joining the nonpartisan, nonprofit Drag Out the Vote organization to help register Americans to vote.
""With so much at stake in the federal election as well as state and local elections, to me it was so important to work with the community to get people to register to vote, to remind people to vote, because our votes are our voice,"" Minono said.
The organization has recruited about 300 'Drag Ambassadors' across 45 states. In some states, including California, its ambassadors will work at the polls on Election Day. 
They are targeting their efforts at lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) voters with drag shows, said founder Jackie Huba. The shows are both live and virtual, to tap into the significant online followings of some drag queens.
""Now here's the sad fact: 1 in 5 LGBTQ adults is not registered to vote. And 100 million people did not vote in the 2016 election. We really need to fix this,"" Huba said.
Huba, who also performs in drag as 'Lady Trinity', drew inspiration from Jaremi Carey, 'Phi Phi O'Hara,' who featured on TV show ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" and led a benefit for Puerto Rico hurricane relief.
At a recent outdoor drag brunch show in the Castro neighborhood of San Francisco, Minono and fellow Drag Ambassador 'Afrika America' - both wearing face coverings due to the coronavirus pandemic - stepped onstage to encourage the audience to participate in democracy.
They pointed to posters with a digital QR code that allowed attendees to use their smartphones to virtually check their voter registration status and sign up if they were not already registered.

""You don't even have to touch us. We don't have to touch you, which is the best part,"" said Afrika America, who when not performing as a drag artist works as a flight attendant.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam said on Thursday that military drills conducted this week by Beijing in the South China Sea will hurt negotiations on a regional maritime code of conduct (COC) for the disputed waters. 
The exercises could complicate efforts to restart talks on a long-awaited code between China and the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told a regular briefing.
China on Monday began five military exercises simultaneously along different parts of its coast, including two exercises near Paracel Islands also claimed by Vietnam.
""The resumption of code of conduct (COC) negotiations after a long pause because of the (coronavirus) pandemic is the priority of ASEAN countries and China,"" Hang said.
Vietnam shared that priority and ""looks forward to ""concluding the COC in an effective, comprehensive way"", in line with international law, Hang said.
China, which has for years been locked in maritime disputes with other coastal states in the South China Sea, has in recent months boosted its presence and held exercises in disputed parts of the strategic waterway, at a time when other claimants are battling coronavirus outbreaks.
The United States has accused China of bullying its neighbours, while Beijing says Washington and its Western allies have been interfering and endangering security by sending naval vessels to the region. 
In August, Vietnam said the presence of Chinese bombers on the Paracel islands ""jeopardises peace"".
Hang said on Thursday that Vietnam demanded that China respect its sovereignty and does not repeat such drills in the area. 
The COC has been a stated goal of ASEAN and China for nearly two decades, but regional security experts have questioned China's sincerity towards concluding it and doubted whether a legally binding agreement can be forged.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong riot police patrolled the route of a banned anti-government march on Thursday, preventing crowds from gathering as Chief Executive Carrie Lam cheered the city's ""return to stability"" at China national day celebrations. 
Protesters wanted to march against Beijing's imposition of a sweeping national security law on June 30 and demand the return of 12 Hong Kong people China arrested at sea in August on their way to self-ruled Taiwan. 
Police had banned the protest, citing coronavirus-related restrictions on group gatherings and violence at previous marches. Shoppers and passersby still broke into pro-democracy chants sporadically, but there was no sign of large crowds.
""It's China's national day but this is Hong Kong’s death day,"" said Jay, a woman dressed in black, the city's protest attire, as she walked past police.
""Hong Kong people are under a lot of pressure but we have to try and keep fighting for freedom.""
Officers, in their hundreds, conducted stop-and-search activities and kept cordoning off areas, while warning people not to linger. The streets of the prime Causeway Bay shopping area were filled with police and reporters.
Police sent away any people who looked suspicious to them: one teenager playing protest songs into a woodwind instrument; a man dressed in black and holding a yellow balloon - colours associated with pro-democracy supporters; a woman holding a copy of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily anti-government tabloid. 
Earlier in the day, Lam attended a flag raising ceremony with other senior Hong Kong and mainland officials in an exhibition centre surrounded by police and security barriers.
""Over the past three months, the plain truth is, and it is obvious to see, that stability has been restored to society while national security has been safeguarded, and our people can continue to enjoy their basic rights and freedoms,"" Lam said.
Late on Wednesday, police said they had arrested five people for inciting participation in illegal assemblies online. 
Anti-government protests, which often turned violent in 2019, have been smaller and fewer this year due to coronavirus restrictions on group gatherings and fears of arrest under the new security law.
The law punishes anything China sees as subversion, separatism, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison.
""The government is using the national security laws and the pandemic to suppress our hearts,” said 52-year-old Mandy as she was shopping with her husband. 
""People are in no mood to celebrate. 
'NATIONAL MOURNING'
Four members of the League of Social Democrats, led by veteran activist Leung Kwok-hung, known as Long Hair, marched holding a banner reading “There is no national day celebration, only national mourning."" 
Groups of four are the largest allowed under coronavirus restrictions. 
A sore point for democracy supporters has been the capture of 12 Hong Kong people by Chinese authorities, now in detention in the mainland city of Shenzhen, having been arrested for illegal border crossing and organising cross-border crimes.
All were suspected of committing crimes in Hong Kong related to last year's protests. 
Stickers demanding their return were plastered on shop windows in the area where police was trying to prevent protests.
China's national day is resented by many democracy supporters who say Beijing is eroding the wide-ranging liberties the former British colony was promised when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
For pro-Beijing supporters, it is an opportunity to drum up patriotism in China's most restive city.

At the ceremony, Lam praised China's success in curbing the coronavirus and its economic recovery, calling it ""a rare bright spot"" which ""has shown once again the shift of the global economic focus from the West to the East.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will call on China to finalise a stalled investment agreement by the end of the year and again criticise Beijing over its security crackdown in Hong Kong, according to a draft summit statement seen by Reuters.
EU leaders, who are set to discuss their policy towards China at the two-day summit from Thursday, will also renew demands that Beijing make good on promises made in 2019 to open up Chinese markets to European companies.
EU leaders, who have labelled China a ""systemic rival"", will urge China ""to deliver on previous commitments to address market access barriers, to make progress on overcapacity and engage in negotiations on industrial subsidies at the World Trade Organization,"" according to the draft summit statement.
China and the EU have agreed to finalise an investment accord that was under negotiation for more than six years by the end of 2020, but Brussels says Beijing is reluctant to open up its economy. 
Caught in a geopolitical standoff between United States and China, the EU, the world's largest trading bloc, is leveraging its limited power without resorting to a trade war, restricting Chinese investments in Europe until Beijing changes course.
The EU's chief executive and chairman told President Xi Jinping on Sept. 14 to ""tear down barriers"" to European investment in China, asserting that Europe would no longer be taken advantage of in trade.
The EU is China's biggest trading partner, and China is the EU's second-biggest.
EU leaders will also reiterate they have ""serious concerns about the human rights situation in China, including developments in Hong Kong and the treatment of people belonging to minorities"".

The West has denounced Beijing's new security law for the former British colony, saying China is reining in basic freedoms enshrined in the ""one country, two systems"" principle that governs Hong Kong's autonomy.

DAX, France (Reuters) - Residents of the purpose-built village near Dax in southwestern France shop for groceries, get pampered at the hair salon and enjoy music recitals just like anyone else.
But this is no ordinary gated community - each of its 105 permanent residents has Alzheimer's disease.
The village offers the care of a nursing home in an environment dressed up as the outside world to soften any sense of painful rupture with the past, preserving a measure of autonomy and daily routine that may help slow the advance of dementia.
Madeleine Elissalde, 82, was among the first to move in when the village, the first in France and modelled on one in the Netherlands, opened in June. She says she likes the surrounding countryside and the shared house she lives in.
""It's like being at home,"" Elissalde said. ""We're well looked after."" 
For a while after she was diagnosed, Elissalde lived with her daughter before moving in with another of her children. The moving around seemed to compound her memory loss, her family said.
But now that her daily reference points are more constant, her family say the memory loss has stabilised and she is able to live a more independent life than she would in a nursing home.
SLOWING THE DISEASE?
""Her memory loss is less severe,"" Elissalde's grand-daughter Aurore said as the two took shelter from the rain. ""She's happy, she's rediscovered her enjoyment of life."" 
Each resident pays nearly 24,000 euros a year in fees. More than half the 6.7 million euro running costs are subsidised by public authorities. 
Researchers from France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research are paying close attention. They want to know whether the village model can alter the clinical trajectory of the disease and whether it offers value for money. 
The village has a cafeteria, a library and music room. Its shop provides fresh fruit and vegetables, and flour and chocolate for baking cakes. There are no nurses in white coats.
""We don't have a till,"" said Christine Surelle, who volunteers in the shop. ""Our currency of exchange is smiles.""
Her store is as much a place for human contact as it is a place to obtain essential necessities, she said.

""It's to maintain their sociability, to maintain a contact with the old world they once knew, to ensure there is no brutal break with the past.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - On Aug. 12, Ivan Kolos posted a video denouncing Belarus's veteran leader, Alexander Lukashenko, and urging fellow police officers to stop using violence against demonstrators and to side with the people. 
Hours later, Kolos fled Belarus under cover of the night for fear of arrest.
The 27-year-old from the southeastern city of Gomel said that within 20 minutes of the video starting to make waves in Belarus, officers were at his door demanding his police badge. 
He said he refused to let them in but dropped his badge from the balcony of his apartment to officers below. 
That night, he and his wife slipped out of their apartment block and sped by car to Russia. After a week in Russia, during which they changed SIM cards repeatedly to avoid detection, he said they travelled to Ukraine and then on to Poland. 
""I was moved by a sense of justice. I saw how police officers, my colleagues, were carrying out crimes against their own people,"" Kolos said from Warsaw, referring to allegations of police torture of people detained during mass protests against Lukashenko, which the government denies.
""That's why I recorded this video,"" he told Reuters.
The Gomel police station confirmed to Reuters that officers had gone to Kolos's home after he failed to show up at work on Aug. 12 but had not sought to arrest him. 
It added that when Kolos' five-year contract had ended this year, he had been given a one-year extension instead of the usual five years because he was a ""mediocre worker"". 
The loyalty of the police, security forces and army is vital to Lukashenko's hopes of clinging to power as mass protests continue over an Aug. 9 election which opponents say was rigged so that he could be declared the winner.
A battle is under way for the hearts and minds of law enforcement officers -- with Lukashenko praising their ""impeccable service"" and handing out medals, and the opposition trying to persuade officers to defect.
A series of interviews conducted by Reuters with Kolos, opposition groups and an interior ministry spokeswoman suggest that Lukashenko is retaining their loyalty so far.
NO SIGN OF MASS DEFECTIONS
Reuters has no independent information about the scale of defections but, though several other police officers have made videos similar to the one posted by Kolos, there is no sign of the vast majority breaking rank. 
Andrej Stryzhak, a human rights advocate who founded an organisation known as Bysol to help people affected by ""political repressions"", said 700 law enforcement officers had come to opposition groups seeking help after quitting.
Stryzhak based his estimate on a count of how many appeals for assistance Bysol and a similar organisation had received from disgruntled officers. 
Official figures for police numbers are rarely published, but Belarusian media outlet Tut.By estimated in July that the former Soviet republic had at least 39,000 police officers, 11,000 interior ministry troops and 45,000 army troops plus other personnel. 
""If you add this all together, this (number of defections) is a very small number of people,"" Kolos said. 
In response to questions from Reuters, Belarusian interior ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova said 11% fewer police officers had resigned in the first eight months of 2020 than in the first eight months of 2019. She declined further comment.
""BLACK BOOK""
The opposition has tried a variety of tactics to persuade police officers to quit.
Groups such as Bysol typically offer up to 1,500 euros ($1,746) in financial assistance and help in relocating or finding a new job.
Anonymous hackers have leaked personal data of more than 2,000 police officers, hoping the loss of privacy will expose them to criticism and encourage them to resign.
Some opposition activists have also used photographs taken during rallies to identify officers they accuse of violence, and have built up profiles of them in a ""black book"" that can be seen on the Telegram messenger service containing phone numbers, addresses and other data. 
The veracity of the data could not be independently verified by Reuters.
Many security officers have taken to wearing masks and balaclavas at demonstrations to hide their identity, but protesters try to pull them down.
""This is basically the scariest thing for them,"" said Anna Krasulina, opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya's spokeswoman, suggesting police felt vulnerable when they were more than ""just a black mask without surnames."" 
Kolos said some officers were too afraid of reprisals to quit and others had a financial incentive to stay as they would have to pay retrospectively for their police schooling if they quit. Others genuinely support Lukashenko, he said.
Although the number of defections appears lower than the opposition hoped, Stryzhak said those who had come to Bysol for help included higher-ranking officers. He did not say how many.

""This is only the beginning of the process,"" he said. ""Secondly, what's important is not only the quantity but also the quality of the personnel leaving the system.""

MADRID (Reuters) - ""You cannot lock down everybody,"" the chief of the Madrid region said on Thursday, pushing back against the Spanish government's plan to confine the capital city to tackle a surge in COVID-19 cases.
The health ministry said late on Wednesday that the central government was overriding regional authorities and would impose a lockdown of the city of over 3 million people and some surrounding towns in the coming days. 
The ministry published the decision in an official journal and said regional and local authorities would have 48 hours to comply once a separate official order was published, though it did not say when that would happen.
But Madrid region chief Isabel Diaz Ayuso rejected the move, saying the committee that took the decision had no legal authority to do so without a consensus.
""You cannot lock down everybody,"" Diaz Ayuso said on esRadio. ""I'm sure the Madrid (region) plan is the best: quick tests, quarantines and life goes on.""
Diaz Ayuso said on Thursday she would challenge the health ministry order in courts amid a widening rift between the Socialist-led central government and conservative-led regional administration on the response to the pandemic.
""Legally, we are evaluating with lawyers of the region, how we can do things,"" she said.
Other regions such as northeastern Catalonia, Andalusia and Galicia have also opposed the new restrictions. 
The new curbs would apply to the capital city, with more than 3 million people, and nine surrounding municipalities with populations of at least 100,000 each. 
The ten municipalities would see borders closed to outsiders for non-essential visits, with only those travelling for work, school, doctors' visits or shopping allowed to cross. A curfew for bars and restaurants moved to 11 p.m. from 1 a.m.
Madrid has 735 cases per 100,000 people, one of the highest of any region in Europe and double the national rate in the country, which has has recorded 769,188 cases - the highest in Western Europe - and 31,791 deaths.

The region has imposed a partial lockdown in 45 mainly poorer areas.

No group claimed responsibility for the attack in the southern province of Helmand though officials blamed the Taliban, who have a heavy presence in the area.
The bomber rammed the truck into a post manned by pro-government militia members, said Omar Zwak, spokesman for the provincial governor. Seven soldiers and four civilians were killed, he said.
In another attack late on Wednesday, a suicide bomber was killed and six civilians were wounded in a blast in the southeastern province of Khost, police said. There was no claim of responsibility.
The talks between the government and the Taliban began in mid-September in Doha, the capital of Qatar, following a February deal between the militants and the United States that has cleared the way for U.S. forces to withdraw from their longest war.
But the talks between the Afghans have become bogged down on processes and procedures, diplomatic sources say.
The Taliban political spokesman, Mohammad Naeem, told Reuters negotiators had not met for the last two days. He did not say why.

The fires threatened 22 settlements and engulfed an area of about 18,000 hectares (70 sq miles), the service said in a statement, adding that 120 people were evacuated.
Local authorities said there were a total of 146 fires, 82 of them were extinguished. 
Most of the fires are located near the area controlled by pro-Russian separatists and local Ukrainian authorities have stated that the fires may have been caused by shelling from the separatists.
The Ukrainian presidential office called on law enforcement bodies to find the cause of the fires.
""The reasons for such a large-scale spread of fire must be clearly established,"" the office said in a statement.
""We also take into account the information about provocative shelling that could have been carried out from the temporarily occupied territory... and could have caused at least some of these fires in such weather conditions,"" it added.
Last month the Ukrainian military accused pro-Russian separatists of violating a ceasefire with government forces.
The simmering conflict between Ukrainian troops and Russian-backed rebels has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014. Major combat ended with a truce agreed in the Belarus capital Minsk in 2015, but sporadic clashes still regularly kill civilians, Ukrainian soldiers and separatists.
Earlier this year, one person died and nine were hospitalized in a similar forest fire that swept through the Luhansk region, destroying 80 dacha holiday cottages and 30 houses in two villages.

This spring, forest fires around the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant in the north of the country and elsewhere pushed pollution levels in Ukraine's capital Kyiv to the worst in the world.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Indian police imposed emergency laws on Thursday in a village where a woman from the lowest rung of the country's caste system was allegedly raped and killed, barring gatherings of more than five people after clashes erupted following her cremation.
The 19-year-old victim died from her injuries on Tuesday, having been attacked and gang-raped on Sept. 14 in a field near her home in Hathras district, 100 km (62 miles) from Delhi, authorities said.
Police have arrested four men in connection with the crime.
Clashes between protesters and police erupted in the district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday after police cremated the woman's body.
The victim's brother told Reuters the cremation was carried out against the wishes of her family, who had wanted to perform their own funeral rites. Local officials deny this.
Twenty-five people were arrested in connection with the unrest, according to a police information report. An eye-witness told Reuters police had wielded batons during the clashes. 
India is the one of the world's most dangerous countries for women, with a rape occurring every 15 minutes, according to federal data - figures that rights groups say vastly underestimate the scale of the problem. 
This latest case has caused widespread outrage and protests across India due to the backgrounds of those involved. 
While the victim came the Dalit community - who face frequent discrimination and violence - the four men arrested were all from a higher caste, her brother told Reuters.
The victim and her brother are not being identified due to laws against naming victims of sexual violence. 
Orders preventing the gathering of more than 5 people have been imposed in Hathras, Vikrant Vir, the top police official in the district, told Reuters on Thursday. 
Priyanka and Rahul Gandhi, leaders of the opposition Congress Party, along with Chandra Shekhar Aazad, a popular Dalit politician who founded the Bhim Army to campaign for the rights of the community, all planned to visit the district on Thursday, according to media reports.
Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, ranks as one of the most unsafe states for women in the country.
Under the emergency laws, police will stop members of political organisations from entering Hathras, Vir said.

1256,By Reuters,"<span>Oct 01, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",Trump plans to slash refugee admissions to new low,"(Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Wednesday it intends to allow only 15,000 refugees to resettle in the United States in the 2021 fiscal year, setting another record low in the history of the modern refugee program.
The State Department said the proposal reflected the Trump administration's prioritizing of the ""safety and well-being of Americans, especially in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic."" 
The refugee cap was cut to 18,000 last year, but only roughly half that many refugees were let in as increased vetting and the coronavirus have slowed arrivals.
The president typically sets yearly refugee levels around the beginning of each fiscal year. Under U.S. law, the president must consult Congress before finalizing the annual number of refugees it plans to accept but the determination is ultimately set by the White House.
The proposal includes specific allocations for refugees who suffered or fear persecution on the basis of religion, for refugees from Iraq who helped the United States; and for refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, Cuba, and Venezuela.
Trump's Democratic challenger in the Nov. 3 presidential election, Joe Biden, has pledged to raise refugee admissions to 125,000 a year if he defeats Trump in November. 
However, Biden has not said how quickly he would raise the cap and advocates say the program could take years to recover after Trump-era reductions.
Tens of thousands of refugees are in the pipeline for arrival to the United States, many with applications far along in the approval and vetting process. 

Krish Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle recently arrived refugees, called the cuts ""a complete abdication of our moral duty and all that we stand for as a nation"" in a post on Twitter late on Wednesday.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Over the past week, 190 countries addressed the United Nations General Assembly, nearly all of them represented by presidents, prime ministers and ministers. Only nine of them were women.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that women watching ""have a perfect right to feel that they are not represented, and their voices are not valued."" He also told world leaders last week: ""Gender inequality remains the greatest single challenge to human rights around the world.""
The General Assembly will convene again on Thursday for a high-level meeting to mark the 25th anniversary of a landmark conference on women - where then-U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton declared that ""women's rights are human rights"" - and push for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.
Chinese President Xi Jinping, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and other world leaders are due to speak on Thursday. 
At the 1995 conference in Beijing 189 countries agreed to make a priority the ""full and equal participation of women in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life at the national, regional and international levels, and the eradication of all forms of discrimination on the grounds of sex.""
Many diplomats have lamented that the world would struggle to agree such a strong declaration now. A main point of contention in recent years has been long-agreed international language on women's sexual and reproductive health and rights.
""On women's rights issues at the global level, the fear now is that 25 years after Beijing there is a counteroffensive to reduce the magnitude of women's rights,"" French U.N. Ambassador Nicolas de Rivière said on Wednesday. ""We want to avoid that and we are aiming at further progress and not regression.""
'HIDDEN WAR ON WOMEN'
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has led a push at the United Nations against the promotion of sexual and reproductive health and rights for women because it sees that as code for abortion. It has opposed such language in U.N. resolutions. 
Trump told world leaders last week that ""America will always be a leader in human rights"" and that his administration is advancing ""opportunity for women"" and ""protecting unborn children."" U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is due to take part in Thursday's U.N. meeting. 
In May, Washington accused the United Nations of using the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to promote access to abortion through its humanitarian response to the deadly global outbreak. The United Nations rejected the accusation.
The Trump administration cut funding in 2017 for the U.N. Population Fund because it said it ""supports, or participates in the management of, a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization."" The U.N. said that was an inaccurate perception.
""Women's rights to health care services, including those related to sexual and reproductive health, must be protected,"" U.N. human rights chief Michelle Bachelet tweeted on Monday, which was international safe abortion day. 

Guterres also said the world needs to end a ""horrifying increase in violence against women and girls"" during the COVID-19 pandemic, describing it as a ""hidden war on women"" and adding: ""Preventing and ending it requires the same commitment and resources that we devote to other forms of warfare.""

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hondurans formed a caravan headed towards the United States on Wednesday, seeking to improve their living conditions as coronavirus has killed over 2,000 people and paralysed the economy in the Central American nation, local media reported.
The migrants, mostly young men and women carrying backpacks and small children, departed from a bus terminal in the northern city of San Pedro Sula headed toward the Guatemalan border, according to local television.
""I'm leaving with my husband and my two children. There is no work here. There is nothing to do, and if you find a job they only pay you 100 lempiras ($4) a day,"" said a woman who identified herself as Cristina to local television program Hoy Mismo.
Wednesday's group marks the first caravan to depart Honduras in 2020, as the nation suffers the largest recorded economic decline in its history after six months of strict lockdown measures aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
In October 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered soldiers to the border with Mexico in response to caravans of Central American migrants who were moving north to the United States.
Trump, who railed against unauthorized immigration in his successful 2016 presidential campaign, claimed that the troops were needed to the secure the border against the migrants but critics said the move was a political stunt in the lead up to U.S. congressional elections that November.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has held off on joining Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions on Belarus in hopes the European Union can overcome an internal dispute, paving the way to coordinated U.S. and EU sanctions, four sources said on Wednesday.
The EU vowed in August to impose sanctions on Belarus for alleged fraud in its Aug. 9 election and for human rights abuses since, but Cyprus, one of its smallest members, has prevented that.
Cyprus has maintained it will not agree to the Belarusian sanctions unless the EU also puts sanctions on Turkey because of a separate dispute over Turkish drilling for oil and gas in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Six sources told Reuters last week that Britain, Canada and the United States planned to impose sanctions on individual Belarusians in a coordinated move. Only London and Ottawa followed suit on Tuesday.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, three sources said on Wednesday that Washington refrained because it believed the EU might achieve consensus at this week's European Council meeting.
One source familiar with the matter told Reuters that a U.S. package, including human rights sanctions, was essentially ready, but the timing of any announcement was uncertain.
The sanctions aim to impose consequences for the disputed election, which the opposition says was stolen, and for the treatment of protesters in Belarus, where President Alexander Lukashenko has ruled for 26 years.
More than 12,000 people have been arrested since Lukashenko, who denies electoral fraud, was named the election's landslide winner. Major opposition figures are either in jail or in exile.
A Cyprus source said there was a ""political agreement"" on Turkish sanctions at an informal EU foreign ministers' meeting in Berlin in August and Cyprus remained ready to implement it, although it was not clear precisely what the source meant.
""It's not a question of softening or hardening of (Cyprus') position, the source said.
After the meeting, Germany's Foreign Ministry said ministers agreed on their ""solidarity with Greece and Cyprus"" but stressed that constructive dialogue with Turkey was vital to resolve ""contentious issues in the eastern Mediterranean.""
The U.S. State Department did not directly address why it had not joined Britain and Canada in imposing sanctions, but said it welcomed their having done so and noted U.S. sanctions already applied to 16 Belarusians, including Lukashenko.
""We are coordinating closely with our European partners to promote accountability for those involved in human rights abuses and repression in Belarus,"" said a State Department spokesman on condition he not be identified.
He said Washington backed an independent look at ""Belarus' fraudulent election, the human rights abuses surrounding the election and the ongoing violence by Belarusian authorities"" and repeated U.S. calls for the authorities to cease violence against peaceful protesters and to engage with the opposition.

The embassy of Cyprus in Washington and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Authorities removed it swiftly, but a brass plaque proclaiming Thailand belongs to the people and not the king has rapidly become the emblem of a pro-democracy protest movement - appearing everywhere from t-shirts to key rings to tattoos.
The 11-inch (28 cm) plaque was removed in darkness less than a day after activists cemented it near Bangkok's Grand Palace last week, demanding reforms to curb the powerful monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn, until recently a taboo subject. 
But reproductions of the plaque, featuring the three-finger salute used by Thai anti-junta activists since a 2014 coup, have since proliferated.
""If you thought you could just make the plaque disappear, you were wrong,"" said Anchalee Suebsang-in, 27, an office worker who posted t-shirt designs featuring the plaque on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page within hours of hearing it had gone. She soon had over 1,000 orders.
""It can still appear anywhere, like on T-shirts, right over our hearts,"" Anchalee told Reuters. 
The plaque reads ""...this country belongs to the people and is not the property of the monarch as they have deceived us.""
It resembles another plaque commemorating the end of absolute monarchy in 1932 that was removed from outside a royal palace in 2017.
The palace did not comment on the plaque and has made no comment on more than two months of anti-government protests.
Some protesters want to reduce the king's powers and control over palace finances and key army units along with the broader protest movement's goals of removing former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha as prime minister and drawing up a new constitution. 
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri declined to comment on the merchandise with plaque designs. 
Anchalee sold each T-shirt for 247.50 baht, a nod to the year 1932 - or 2475 in the Buddhist Era calendar. 
Smaller trinkets like keychains go for 112 baht, referring to Section 112 of the criminal code that prohibits insulting the king and which the protesters want scrapped. 
ROYAL FIELD
The plaque, placed on the area next to the palace known as Sanam Luang - the Royal Field - was the work of the United Front of Thammasat and Demonstration (UFTD) protest group. They declined to identify a specific artist.
Even before the plaque was removed, they published digital files on the internet so anyone could reproduce it.
""The plaque wasn't just planted on Sanam Luang, but also in the hearts of the people, so it's no surprise that it would reappear everywhere,"" UFTD leader Parit ""Penguin"" Chiwarak told Reuters.
Thai activists in Germany placed a replica plaque outside the king's residence there.
Sellers said they would donate the profits to the UFTD protest group, while some would also contribute a separate fund set up to help pay expected legal expenses. Several leaders have already been charged over earlier protests. 
The protesters challenge Prayuth's legitimacy, saying elections last year were engineered to keep him in power. He says they were democratic.
The plaque has not only reappeared in physical form. It is available as Instagram filters that allow users to place it anywhere. 
""They tried to censor history and take it away from the people, but they can't catch up with us,"" said game design student Tarathorn Boonngamanong, 22, whose filters have been viewed more than 4 million times.
The proliferation of the plaque reflected the scale of the challenge to the monarchy as taboos were broken by protesters, said James Buchanan, a lecturer at Bangkok's Mahidol University International College.
""They feel like they're taking the first steps towards really challenging or limiting the power of the monarchy,"" he told Reuters.
For Mai and Berm, two friends who have sold over 2,500 plaque key chains on Facebook, the plaque symbolises a promise for change. 

""We can't achieve that now, but it shows that we're determined to get there,"" said Mai, 24, declining to give his full name due to fears of reprisal.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is targeting only about one percent of the 400,000 Chinese students in the United States over China's bid to gather U.S. technology and other information, a top White House said official said on Wednesday.
Matt Pottinger, the deputy White House national security adviser who has been a leading figure in the development of President Donald Trump's China policy, said the vast majority of Chinese students were welcome.
""It's a surgical approach,"" Pottinger said in a online event hosted by the Ronald Reagan Institute, referring to the administration's policy of denying student visas to Chinese nationals it considers a security risk.
""President Trump has taken action to target roughly one percent of that massive number, to target military-affiliated Chinese researchers who are in some cases here under false pretenses or even false identities,"" he said.
Other cases involve individuals who have come to the United States to gain access to ""technologies that would be useful to Chinese military advancement or to the repression of their own people,"" he added.
Pottinger said the overwhelming majority of Chinese students were ""people that we're glad to have here, and many will stay here and start great businesses.""
The U.S. action against Chinese students has come at a time when China-U.S. relations have sunk to the lowest point in decades in the run-up to Trump's Nov. 3 re-election bid. The world's two biggest economies have clashed over issues ranging from trade and human rights to Hong Kong and the coronavirus.
The U.S. State Department said this month the United States had revoked visas of more than 1,000 Chinese students and researchers deemed security risks. China called this a violation of human rights.
Washington said the action followed a May 29 proclamation by Trump in response to China's curbs on democracy in Hong Kong.

The large number of Chinese students studying in the United States bring significant revenue to U.S. universities, although the COVID-19 pandemic severely disrupted returns to campus this fall.

Joyce Echaquan, a 37-year-old mother of seven, checked into a hospital in Joliette, Quebec, on Saturday to get treatment for stomach pains. She died on Monday. 
She captured disparaging remarks made by hospital staff on her phone during her stay there and posted them on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Live. The videos sparked a wave of criticism and protest in a country which has a long history of abuse against its indigenous people.
""Like all Quebecers I was shocked by the racism she was subjected to,"" Quebec Premier Francois Legault told reporters in Quebec City on Wednesday. He said a provincial task force on racism would issue recommendations in the coming weeks, and a nurse had been fired over the incident.
In the video shared by media outlets and reviewed by Reuters, nurses can be heard in French calling Echaquan ""stupid as hell,"" and suggesting she was only good for sex.
Echaquan's family said Joyce had a heart problem.
""I have seven children who no longer have a mother,"" Carol Dube, Echaquan's husband, told Radio-Canada on Tuesday.
Echaquan's death comes amid ongoing concerns over treatment of indigenous people in Canada, who make up about 5% of Canada's nearly 37 million population. A 2019 Quebec government report found systemic discrimination against indigenous people accessing public services.
In June, a video showing a forceful arrest of a Canadian indigenous leader by Royal Canadian Mounted Police over an incident involving an expired license plate was criticized by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.
Federal Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said Echaquan's death ""is not an isolated event.""
'Justice for Joyce' protests are planned in cities across the country in the coming days, including one in Montreal on Saturday that organizers estimate will draw over a thousand attendees. 

""There are many indigenous people that are in the hospital that don't have a telephone to record such a situation,"" said Claudette Dumont-Smith, executive director at the Native Women's Association of Canada.

Such a decision would reflect Suga's intention to focus on measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and cushion the economic blow from the pandemic, several government and ruling party lawmakers said, according to the paper.
Public opinion polls have shown strong support for Suga since he took office two weeks ago, prompting speculation that he could take advantage of it and call a snap election soon.
Suga won the leadership race for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) last month, taking over as prime minister after Shinzo Abe resigned citing health reasons. A lower house election does not have to be held until October 2021. 
In an interview with the Nikkei business daily published on Thursday, LDP heavyweight and Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai also quashed speculation of an early general election.

""There are serious issues before us right now,"" he was quoted as saying. ""The prime minister has made the right decision to focus on resolving those problems.""

An earlier wide-reaching judicial reform bill was pulled this year after opponents said measures such as surveillance rules were a risk to privacy.
Ricardo Monreal, who leads the ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party in the upper house, said he hoped a revised version of the bill could be discussed during the current session of Congress, which runs until December.
In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, Monreal said it was important that any new law governing surveillance of calls and electronic communications should protect the privacy of citizens and end practices of political espionage prevalent in Mexico.
""Right now, everyone does it as if it were a sport,"" Monreal said. ""Firm judicial criteria must be established.""
Clearer rules governing the use of surveillance technology could make it easier to convict criminal suspects and facilitate security cooperation with the United States. 
However, the earlier justice reform bill was questioned by civil rights groups. The bill proposed allowing private communications to be used as evidence and limiting legal challenges to avoid extradition delays for criminal suspects, many of whom are U.S.-bound.
Many of the criticisms of the earlier bill focused on measures that rights groups feared would lead to wider use of pre-trial detention and torture during interrogation. 
Monreal said constitutional changes were needed to clean up Mexico's system of justice, including reforming the way judges are chosen.

""We are close to making constitutional changes, we are close to making reforms that allow progress to another level of justice in Mexico,"" he said, while acknowledging ""resistance"" to the proposals that meant the bill might not pass during the current session of Congress.

""We are very concerned by assessments that Russian anti-corruption activist Alexei Navalny was poisoned in August 2020, by a chemical nerve agent from the Novichok family,"" the committee's Republican chairman, Senator Jim Risch, and its Democratic ranking member, Senator Bob Menendez, wrote in a letter to Trump.
The request - which followed a similar request from leaders of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Sept. 8 - added to growing international support for a response to Navalny's poisoning. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier on Wednesday her country would discuss a response with European partners.
The Kremlin critic was discharged from Berlin's Charite hospital last week following 32 days of treatment after falling ill on a Russian domestic flight. Germany says he was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent. Moscow has said it has seen no evidence that Navalny was poisoned.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter from Risch and Menendez. The deputy U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Cherith Norman-Chalet, told the U.N. Security Council earlier this month that it would work with allies to hold accountable those responsible for poisoning Navalny.

LONDON (Reuters) - Widespread reopening of schools after lockdowns and vacations is generally not linked to rising COVID-19 rates, a study of 191 countries has found, but lockdown closures will leave a 2020 ""pandemic learning debt"" of 300 billion missed school days.
The analysis, by the Geneva-based independent educational foundation Insights for Education, said 84% of those 300 billion days would be lost by children in poorer countries, and warned that 711 million pupils were still out of school. 
""It's been assumed that opening schools will drive infections, and that closing schools will reduce transmission, but the reality is much more complex,"" said IfE's founder and chief executive Randa Grob-Zakhary. 
The vast majority - 92% - of countries that are through their first wave of COVID-19 infections have started to reopen school systems, even as some are seeing a second surge. 
IfE found that 52 countries that sent students back to school in August and September – including France and Spain – saw infection rates rise during the vacation compared to when they were closed. 
In Britain and Hungary, however, infection levels dropped after initial school closures, remained low during the holidays, and began rising after reopening.
Full analysis of these 52 countries found no firm correlation between school status and infections - pointing to a need to consider other factors, IfE said.
""The key now is to learn from those countries that are reopening effectively against a backdrop of rising infections,"" Grob-Zakhary said.
The report said 44 countries have kept schools closed. 
It found countries are developing strategies for schools during the pandemic - including some, such as Italy, France, which order temporary school closures on a case-by-case basis.
Other measures include policies on masks, class rotations and combining remote with in-school lessons. 

""This first real global test highlights what school life looks like in a COVID-world,"" said Grob-Zakhary. ""Understanding how countries undergoing a massive second wave are dealing with this new reality in the classroom is essential to guide future reopening decisions and to help schools remain open.""

1267,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 05:31PM ET</span>",France and Turkey at odds as Karabakh fighting divides NATO allies,"By Nvard Hovhannisyan and Nailia Bagirova
YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - NATO allies France and Turkey traded angry recriminations on Wednesday as international tensions mounted over the fiercest clashes between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces since the mid-1990s.
On the fourth day of fighting, Azerbaijan and the ethnic Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh accused each other of shelling along the line of contact that divides them in the volatile, mountainous South Caucasus.
Dozens have been reported killed and hundreds wounded in fighting since Sunday that has spread well beyond the enclave's boundaries, threatening to spill over into all-out war between the former Soviet republics of Azerbaijan and Armenia.
The re-eruption of one of the ""frozen conflicts"" dating back the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union has raised concerns about stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets, and raised fears that regional powers Russia and Turkey could be drawn in.
Armenian defence ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan tweeted video of huge explosions from artillery fire, accompanied by dramatic pounding music and captioned ""Takeover of an Azerbaijan position"". 
Azerbaijan released footage showing its forces firing volleys of rockets at enemy emplacements, as well as grey smoke rising from inside Nagorno-Karabakh as it was battered by Azeri artillery. Photographs taken in the Azeri town of Terter showed people taking cover in dug-outs, and damaged buildings which residents said had been struck by Armenian shells.
CONCERN ABOUT TURKISH ROLE
Some of Turkey's NATO allies are increasingly alarmed by Ankara's stance on Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region inside Turkey's close ally Azerbaijan that is run by ethnic Armenians but is not recognised by any country as an independent republic.
Echoing remarks by President Tayyip Erdogan, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Wednesday Turkey would ""do what is necessary"" when asked whether Ankara would offer military support if Azerbaijan asked for it.
Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, later thanked Turkey for its support but said his country did not need military assistance. Fighting would cease if Armenian forces immediately ""leave our lands,"" he said.
Cavusoglu also said French solidarity with Armenia amounted to supporting Armenian occupation in Azerbaijan. 
French President Emmanuel Macron, whose country is home to many people of Armenian ancestry, hit back during a visit to Latvia. He said France was extremely concerned by ""warlike messages"" from Turkey ""which essentially remove any of Azerbaijan's inhibitions in reconquering Nagorno-Karabakh"".
""And that we won't accept,"" he said.
MOSCOW OFFERS TO HOST TALKS
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow was willing to host the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan for talks, his ministry cited him as saying. 
He held separate phone conversations with both foreign ministers, and the ministry said he called for a ceasefire and a halt to ""provocative warlike rhetoric"".
Lavrov said Russia would continue to work both independently and together with other representatives of the Minsk group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to mediate in the conflict.
France has said it wants the Minsk Group - which is led by Moscow, Paris and Washington - to address the conflict. European Union leaders will also discuss it at a summit later this week, a German government source said.
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave, broke away from Azerbaijan in the 1990s in a war that killed an estimated 30,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands. 
CASUALTIES
In Wednesday's clashes, Armenian media said three civilians had been killed and several wounded by shelling in the town of Martakert in Nagorno-Karabakh.
Nagorno-Karabakh's own defence ministry said it could report 23 more casualties on Wednesday as fighting continued.
One person was killed and three wounded by Armenian fire on the town of Horadiz in southern Azerbaijan, the Azeri Prosecutor's office said, bringing the total number of Azeri civilians killed to 15 since fighting began on Sunday.
Azerbaijan said ethnic Armenian forces attempted to recover lost ground by launching counter-attacks in the direction of Madagiz, but Azeri forces repelled the attack. 
Armenia said the Azeri army had been shelling the whole front line during the night and two Azeri drones were shot down over Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakh's administrative centre. It was not possible to independently confirm the report.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, said he was not considering asking for Russia's help at this point under a post-Soviet security treaty, but did not rule out doing so.
The Kremlin said Russia's military was closely following developments.

Armenia says one of its SU-25 warplanes was shot down by a Turkish fighter jet on Tuesday but the report was denied by Turkey and Azeri officials.

SULAIMANIYA/MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iran-backed militias launched rockets targeting U.S. troops that landed near Erbil airport in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq, a Kurdish security agency said on Wednesday, hours after Iraq's premier pledged to protect foreign missions.
Iraqi Kurdistan's counter terrorism service blamed the attack on the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella grouping of mostly Iran-backed Iraqi Shi'ite militias that is part of Iraq's armed forces.
""Six rockets were launched from the borders of the Sheikh Amir village in Nineveh province by the Popular Mobilisation Forces who were targeting (U.S.-led) coalition forces in Erbil International Airport,"" the service said.
Four rockets landed at the edge of the airport compound and two did not explode, it added in a statement.
The Kurdish interior ministry condemned the attack, which it said took place at 8:30 p.m. (1730 GMT). It did not directly blame the PMF but said the rockets were launched from an area under the jurisdiction of the PMF's 30th Brigade.
Spokesman Colonel Wayne Marotto of the U.S.-led coalition said initial reports were that indirect fire did not land on coalition forces in Erbil. ""There was no damage or casualties. Incident is under investigation,"" he said on Twitter.
No group claimed immediate responsibility for the attack, which occurred hours after Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi pledged in a meeting with top diplomats to protect foreign missions and limit possession of weapons to state forces following a U.S. threat to shut down its embassy in Baghdad.
""Those who carry out attacks on foreign missions are seeking to destabilise Iraq and sabotage its regional and international relations,"" Kadhimi told 25 foreign emissaries, including the U.S. ambassador, earlier on Wednesday.
Sirens were heard inside a nearby military base housing U.S. troops, Kurdish media said. A rocket fell 200 metres away from a Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) base, spokesman Mohamed Qadiri told Reuters. It was not clear if the KDPI was an intentional target.
Media reports had suggested Washington could move diplomatic staff to Erbil, with the Kurdistan Region long seen as a safe haven from the violence gripping the rest of Iraq and far from the reaches of the Iran-backed Iraqi militias the United States blames for increasingly regular attacks on its interests.
Kurdish Prime Minister Masrour Barzani condemned the attack and called on Kadhimi to hold those responsible accountable.
""I strongly condemn tonight's rocket attack in Erbil. The KRG will not tolerate any attempt to undermine Kurdistan's stability and our response will be robust,"" Barzani, who leads the Kurdistan Regional Government, said on Twitter.
""I have spoken to PM Mustafa al-Kadhimi on the importance of holding the perpetrators accountable,"" he said.
The United States has made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy, two Iraqi officials and two Western diplomats said, a step Iraqis fear could turn their country into a battle zone.
Rockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic compound.
In recent weeks rocket attacks near the embassy have increased and roadside bombs targeted convoys carrying equipment to the U.S.-led military coalition. One roadside attack hit a British convoy in Baghdad, the first of its kind against Western diplomats in Iraq for years.
On Monday three children and two women were killed when two militia rockets hit a family home, the Iraqi military said. Police sources said Baghdad airport was the intended target.

Washington blames such attacks on Iranian-backed militia groups. Iran has not directly commented on the incidents but groups believed to be connected to Iran-aligned militias have claimed responsibility for some attacks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of two types of fighter jets and several Patriot missile systems to Switzerland as the country modernizes its military, the Pentagon said on Wednesday.
On Sunday, voters of the neutral nation approved a referendum allowing the government to spend $6.46 billion on new jets as it seeks to replace its aging fleet of 30 F/A-18 Hornets, which will go out of service in 2030.
The Swiss government plans to decide next year among the Eurofighter from Airbus, the Rafale from France's Dassault, Boeing (NYSE:BA)'s F/A-18 Super Hornet, or the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F35-A.
In a move that would ease the way for the export of either of the U.S. jets, the State Department approved the potential sale of 40 F-35A's spare parts, munitions and training for a total estimates cost of $6.58 billion. 
The State Department also approved the potential sale of 40 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet jets, spares munitions and training as well as related equipment for an estimated cost of $7.45 billion.
The notification process alerts the U.S. Congress that a sale to a foreign country has been approved, but it does not indicate that a contract has been signed or negotiations have concluded.
In addition, the State Department approved the potential sale of five Patriot missile systems and related equipment for an estimated cost of $2.2 billion. Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX) Corp makes the Patriot system.
The Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale.

Dozens of opposition parties say they will boycott the election, arguing it will be rigged in favor of President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialist party, though one group within the opposition has said it is seeking better conditions for possible participation.
""The EU's policy vis-à-vis Venezuela remains unchanged: the conditions are not currently there for a free, fair and democratic electoral process to take place,"" the EU said in a statement, adding that it would not be able to send an electoral observer mission in the current conditions without a delay. 
""The possibility of postponing the legislative elections in order to open a space for dialogue and change those conditions was discussed."" 
One person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the EU representatives requested the government delay the vote by at least six months, and that there was no immediate response from the government. 
Maduro, who had previously requested the EU send observers for the vote, argues the opposition does not want to participate because it does not value democracy. Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Maduro's government has ignored laws passed by the National Assembly since an opposition coalition won control in a late 2015 vote. Legislative elections are due every five years under Venezuela's constitution. 

During their visit to Caracas, two representatives of the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrel met with two top socialist party officials as well as opposition leader Juan Guaido, civil society representatives and religious leaders.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, expressed frustration with the Pentagon at a hearing on Wednesday over the lack of details surrounding President Donald Trump's plans to withdraw thousands of troops from Germany. 
In July, the Pentagon announced that it would withdraw about 12,000 of 36,000 troops from Germany, in fallout from Trump’s long-simmering feud with Berlin over military spending, but said it will keep nearly half of those forces in Europe to address tension with Russia. 
Two senior Pentagon officials appeared before a House Armed Services Committee hearing, where lawmakers pressed them about the cost of the troop withdrawal, how long it would take and how much the administration had coordinated with European allies before making the decision.
They got few answers during the sometimes contentious 2-1/2 hour hearing. 
""What the hell is going on, so we can exercise our oversight?,"" said Democratic Representative Adam Smith, the committee chair.
James Anderson, the acting undersecretary of defense for policy at the Pentagon, said the military did not yet have details and would share plans as they are developed.
Anderson, when asked whether U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper had provided Trump the plan to draw down troops or if the president had made a decision and then directed the Pentagon to do it, said he was not privy to those conversations.
""Then why are you here?"" Democratic Representative Bill Keating said. 
The top Republican on the committee, Representative Mac Thornberry, said it appeared that the troop reduction was a result of White House officials - not the Pentagon - trying to get the president to agree on a troop cap in Germany.
Trump has faulted Germany, a close U.S. ally, for failing to meet NATO’s defense spending target and accused it of taking advantage of the United States on trade.

""The light of the 21st century now hugs the Acropolis, a celebration that goes beyond borders and languages. The values born here spread all over the earth as the right answer on how to organise society,"" Mitsotakis said.
""The Acropolis is a mine of memory, an eternal compass. Democracy and the principles of classical Athens need more light in our days,"" he said.
It was in the fifth century BC under the rule of Pericles when construction of the site's most important remains, including the Parthenon, one of the world's greatest cultural monuments, was completed. 
An enduring symbol of ancient Greece and Athenian democracy, the Parthenon was seriously damaged during a siege by the Venetians in 1687 when gunpowder stored at the temple was hit by a cannonball and exploded.

Funded by the Onassis Foundation, the new lighting system better exposes the geometry of the site's monuments and their relief, illuminating the rocks of the hill, the Acropolis walls and the temples with different intensities.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A suspect already jailed on suspicion of carjacking was charged on Wednesday with opening fire on two Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies as they sat in their patrol car, an attack that was caught on videotape.
Footage of the Sept. 12 ambush on the two deputies was broadcast widely and became part of the U.S. presidential race after both candidates called for the gunman to be dealt with harshly.
Deonte Lee Murray, 36, was charged with two counts of attempted murder and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said in a statement.
Murray, who was already in custody following his Sept. 15 arrest on unrelated carjacking charges, was expected to make an initial court appearance on the attempted murder charges later on Wednesday. 
It was not immediately clear if he had retained an attorney. Prosecutors asked that he be held on $6.15 million bail.
The graphic video footage, shot by a surveillance camera at the Martin Luther King Jr. Transit Center in the Los Angeles suburb of Compton, shows a man walk up to the black-and-white squad car and fire a handgun through the passenger window. He is then seen fleeing on foot.
The deputies, identified only as a 31-year-old woman and a 24-year-old man, both suffered gunshot wounds. Despite her injuries the female deputy was able to help her partner to safety and apply a tourniquet to his wounded arm.
Both victims survived and have since been released from a Los Angeles area hospital.
Following the shooting President Donald Trump said on Twitter that if the deputies died the suspect should face the death penalty for the ""cold-blooded shooting.""

Democrat Joe Biden, Trump's rival for the presidency in the Nov. 3 election, tweeted that ""acts of lawlessness and violence directed against police officers are unacceptable.""

Ukrainian police said a passerby found the woman unconscious with a head injury, wearing running gear and headphones in the area of western Kyiv. She was taken to hospital, where she died. 
Police added they were seeking a dark-haired man aged between 30-40, who wore dark shorts and a T-shirt, and may have been involved in beating the American woman.
In a statement, the U.S. embassy, which employs about 181 Americans and more than 560 locals, said it was working with Ukrainian authorities to determine what happened.

LISBON (Reuters) - Three Portuguese immigration officers have been charged with murder over the fatal beating of a Ukrainian man detained at Lisbon airport for trying to enter the country without a valid visa, prosecutors said on Wednesday.
In a statement, they said the incident in March this year occurred in a room run by the immigration and border service at the airport where the 40-year-old man was taken after he refused to board a flight out of the country. 
The Ukrainian man became ""agitated"" with the situation and to restrain him the immigration officers tied up his legs and arms. Soon afterwards three other officers entered the room, handcuffed the man's hands behind his back and beat him up, punching and kicking him repeatedly, the statement said. 
The suspects also used an expandable baton to beat the victim, it said. Hours later, emergency services were called in and the victim was pronounced dead at the scene. 
""The aggression perpetrated by the defendants caused several traumatic injuries that were the direct cause of his death,"" the statement said. 
The three officers were arrested and suspended after the incident and have now been charged with murder, it said. They are being kept under house arrest rather than in jail due to the coronavirus pandemic, pending trial. 
The immigration service could not be immediately reached for comment. It said earlier it was cooperating with the investigation and had taken ""the needed disciplinary measures"".

""Hate and violence progresses nothing. It's only when we can come together in mutual respect and love that we can communicate in an effective way and we can make real change,"" Major Aubrey Gregory told a briefing on Wednesday. 
Gregory and Officer Robinson Desroches were shot last Wednesday amid protests that erupted following news that a grand jury would not bring murder charges against three police officers involved in the March 13 killing of Taylor during a botched raid at her home.
Larynzo Johnson, 26, is the only suspect in the shootings of the two police officers last week. He was charged with two counts of assault and multiple counts of wanton endangerment. He pleaded not guilty. 
Gregory's calls for calm come as pressure builds on Kentucky's attorney general, Daniel Cameron, over his handling of the case. Cameron, who presented evidence to the grand jury, said in a Louisville television interview that he did not recommend any charges against the two police officers who shot Taylor, saying the jurors needed to make that decision on their own. 
A recording of the grand jury proceedings was scheduled to be made public on Wednesday, but Cameron asked a Jefferson County Circuit Court judge for another week to redact private information, according to a court filing released on Wednesday.
Gregory, who said he had been playing a leading role working with protest organizers to keep demonstrations peaceful, added he was concerned about violence.
""The willingness to profess openly in public the desire to harm, kill, hurt the police and their families has really ratcheted up,"" he said.
""We support the demonstrations we do not support violence in any shape, form or fashion,"" said Raoul Cunningham, president of the Louisville chapter of the NAACP on Wednesday.

""We hope that the situation here will come to a peaceful conclusion. And we also hope that justice will come regarding the murder of Breonna Taylor.""

ROME (Reuters) - The Vatican said on Wednesday it had denied a request from Mike Pompeo for an audience with Pope Francis, and accused the Secretary of State of trying to drag the Catholic Church into the U.S. presidential election by denouncing its relations with China.
The extraordinary remarks from the two top diplomatic officials at the Vatican came after Pompeo accused the Church in an article and a series of tweets this month of putting its ""moral authority"" at risk by renewing an agreement with China over the appointment of bishops.
Pompeo, who was in Rome on Wednesday and due to meet Vatican officials on Thursday, repeated his denunciations of China's record on religious freedom at an event hosted by the U.S. embassy to the Holy See.
The Vatican's two top diplomats, Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Foreign Minister Archbishop Paul Gallagher, said Francis had declined a request from Pompeo for an audience, as the pope avoids meeting politicians ahead of elections.
""Yes, he asked. But the pope had already said clearly that political figures are not received in election periods. That is the reason,"" Parolin said.
The Vatican's two-year-old agreement with Beijing gives the pope some say over the appointment of Chinese bishops. It was due to expire next month, but is expected to be renewed.
Officials in the Holy See say the agreement is not perfect but call it a step forward, after decades during which Chinese Catholics who recognise the pope were driven underground.
Parolin and Gallagher both described Pompeo's public criticism as a ""surprise"", coming just before his planned visit.
""Normally when you're preparing these visits between high-level officials, you negotiate the agenda for what you are going to talk about privately, confidentially. It's one of the rules of diplomacy,"" Gallagher said.
""THAT'S JUST CRAZY""
Asked if he believed that Pompeo's criticisms of the Vatican deal were intended for political use in the United States, Parolin said: ""Some have interpreted it this way ... that the comments were above all for domestic political use. I don't have proof of this but certainly this is one way of looking at it.""
The Vatican-China deal ""is a matter that has nothing to do with American politics. This is a matter between Churches and should not be used for this type of ends,"" Parolin said.
For his part, when asked at a briefing if he was ""picking a fight"" with the Vatican over China and what impact that could have on Catholic and other Christian voters, Pompeo replied: ""That's just crazy.""
President Donald Trump has campaigned on his hard line towards China ahead of the Nov. 3 election. He is also strongly associated with conservative Protestant and Catholic movements, many of which have been critical of Pope Francis.
In his speech on Thursday, Pompeo did not directly address the Vatican agreement with Beijing, but he described China as the world's worst abuser of religious rights.

""Nowhere is religious freedom under assault more than in China,"" Pompeo said. The Chinese Communist Party was looking to ""to snuff out the lamp of freedom ... on a horrifying scale"".

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Afghanistan's top peace official, Abdullah Abdullah, said on Wednesday he did not expect the result of the upcoming U.S. presidential election to dramatically change the Afghan peace process or troop withdrawal plans.
President Donald Trump's administration this year brokered peace talks between the Afghan government and the insurgent Taliban to end 19 years of war, and the United States is pulling out its troops under a deal with the militant group signed in February.
The withdrawal is expected to be complete in May, subject to certain security guarantees.
Trump is currently lagging behind Democrat challenger Joe Biden in polls ahead of the Nov. 3 election.
""Nobody can say with certainty what would be the impact of the outcome of the elections in the United States but based on my experiences and interactions, the policy will not change that much,"" said Abdullah, who is the senior official overseeing peace talks by the Afghan negotiating team in Doha.
""Neither Democrats nor Republicans would want to see all the gains or all the sacrifices they have made in Afghanistan in vain…(or) be hurt once again from Afghanistan or because of Afghanistan,"" he told Reuters in an interview at the end of a three-day visit to Pakistan.
Abdullah also said that an upcoming conference in Geneva in November, at which governments will pledge financial support to bolster the peace process, would also be ""one of the things in our mind"" as they try to build momentum at the negotiating table.
United States special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Tuesday flew to Doha to meet negotiators, who two diplomatic sources said have been deadlocked over setting a process for negotiations in part due to the Taliban insistence that the U.S.-Taliban agreement be used as a basis.
During his visit to Islamabad, Abdullah had met with Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as the president and foreign minister. 
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have long been rocky. Afghanistan officials – including Abdullah - and its international allies have for years accused Pakistan of backing the Taliban insurgents as a way to limit the influence of old rival India in Afghanistan.
But Abdullah said that he believed there had a been a change in recent years in Pakistan's approach, adding that they still had influence over the Taliban leadership, though the degree was at times exaggerated. 
""It was communicated to the Taliban that it was important for them, it's important to their relations with Pakistan that they sit around the negotiating table,"" he said, saying that had helped to break decades of the Taliban refusing to sit down for talks.

""Today that has changed,"" he said. ""I do consider this as an important development.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday blacklisted what it called ""key enablers"" of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, reinforcing efforts to push Damascus back to United Nations-led negotiations to end Syria's nearly decade-long civil war.
The United States imposed sanctions on 13 entities and six individuals, including the governor of the Central Bank of Syria, in a fresh round of sanctions aimed at cutting off revenue for Assad’s government.
""The United States will continue to employ all of its tools and authorities to target the finances of anyone who profits from or facilitates the Assad regime's abuse of the Syrian people,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo separately warned that the targeting of officials, commanders and ""corrupt business leaders will not cease until the Assad regime and its enablers take irreversible steps to end their campaign of violence against the Syrian people and genuinely implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254.""
A crackdown by Assad on protesters in 2011 led to the civil war, with Iran and Russia backing the government and the United States supporting the opposition.
Millions of people have fled Syria and millions more have been internally displaced.
Washington also blacklisted on Wednesday the head of the Syrian General Intelligence Directorate, the Syrian Ministry of Tourism and a Syrian businessman, Khodr Taher Bin Ali, who the Treasury said was connected to the Assad government, as well as his network of businesses.
The Treasury authorized until Dec. 30 transactions and activities necessary for the winding down of business with Emma Tel LLC, which was founded by the businessman.
Wednesday's action freezes any U.S. assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them. 
The State Department, as part of Wednesday's move, imposed sanctions on the commander of the 5th Corps of the Syrian Arab Army, accusing Milad  Jedid of being involved in preventing a ceasefire in the country, and also designated two other Syrians.

Syria has been under U.S. and European Union sanctions that have frozen the assets of the state and hundreds of companies and individuals. Washington already bans exports to Syria and investment there by Americans, as well as transactions involving oil and hydrocarbon products.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro reacted angrily on Wednesday to U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's call for a world effort to offer Brazil $20 billion to end Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) deforestation or face unspecified ""economic consequences.""
Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) he interpreted Biden's comment in a U.S. presidential debate on Tuesday night as a threat of economic sanctions if Brazil did not take the offer. 
Bolsonaro wrote in Portuguese and English that he does not accept ""bribes"" or ""coward threats."" 
The president said Brazil was taking action on deforestation and reasserted that he views foreign interest in the Amazon as financially motivated and an attempt to undermine Brazilian sovereignty.
""The greed of some countries towards the Amazon is a well-known fact,"" Bolsonaro said. 
""However, the explicit demonstration of this greed by someone who is running for the presidency of his country is a clear sign of contempt for cordial and fruitful coexistence between two sovereign nations.""
In November's U.S. election, Biden is challenging Republican President Donald Trump. Bolsonaro openly admires Trump and has sought to ally Brazil with the Trump administration, with the two leaders seeking to deepen trade ties.
In Tuesday's heated debate, Biden said Brazil provided an example of how Trump ""has no relationship with foreign policy.""
""The rainforests of Brazil are being torn down,"" Biden said.
""I would be gathering up and making sure we had the countries of the world coming up with $20 billion, and say, 'Here's $20 billion. Stop tearing down the forest. And if you don't then you're gonna have significant economic consequences.'""
Official data show that an area roughly the size of Lebanon was deforested in Brazil's Amazon for 2019, an 11-year high, with preliminary government data for 2020 showing forest clearances up 34.5%.
Bolsonaro's right-wing government maintains that Brazil is a model of conservation because of the size of forest land still standing. 
Brazil has repeatedly said the world should pay up if it wants more forest to be preserved. Brazilian Environment Minister Ricardo Salles reacted on Twitter to Biden's offer of funding, writing: ""Just one question: Biden's $20 billion in aid, is that yearly?"".
Bolsonaro ended his statement in English by calling Joe Biden by the wrong first name.

DOHUK, Iraq (Reuters) - Carefully tucking his Farvahar pendant under his shirt, Aram Mehdi reminds himself of the core Zoroastrian principles it represents: good words, good thoughts and good deeds.
Born and raised in a conservative Muslim family, the 31-year-old Iraqi Kurd from the city of Dohuk, in the north of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region, is afraid to wear the Zoroastrian symbol openly.
His friends used to call him 'Mullah', Mehdi recalls, as he scrolls through old pictures showing him praying at a local mosque.
But his social network started falling apart when he decided to distance himself from Islam and follow the teachings of Zoroaster, who founded Zoroastrianism some 3,500 years ago in ancient Iran.
Spreading as far as India, it was the official religion of three Persian dynasties until the 7th Century CE. It rapidly declined with the rise of Islam and all but disappeared in Iraq.
But in the country's Kurdish region, Zoroastrianism witnessed an unexpected revival after the extremist Islamic State group occupied vast swathes of northern Iraq, imposing a brutal doctrine of Islam and persecuting religious minorities.
""I began to ask myself, is theirs the true Islam, or the Islam that my parents taught me?"" Mehdi said.
According to Awat Taieb, co-founder of the Yasna association that since 2014 has promoted Zoroastrianism in Kurdistan and also representative of the faith at the Kurdistan government, about 15,000 people registered with the organisation so far.
Most of them were Kurds converting from Islam, but Arabs and Christians joined the movement as well, she said.
Although the regional Kurdish government officially recognised Zoroastrianism in 2015, converts from Islam remain registered as Muslims at the central Iraqi government, something Taieb does not expect to change any time soon.
Driving towards the newly established Yasna branch in Dohuk, Mehdi said he hoped to find a new community of like-minded converts.
The head of the branch, Helan Chia, asked him whether he would abide by the core principles of respecting nature, its four elements of air, water, fire and earth and mankind before registering him officially as a member.
The focus on the environment and on peaceful coexistence are key elements attracting young people from conservative backgrounds to the ancient faith.
But Dohuk's Zoroastrians still have some way to go to gain universal acceptance - some local sheikhs have labelled Zoroastrians as infidels on social media.
Touring the local four-pillared Charsteen cave, Mehdi said he dreamt of one day undergoing his conversion ritual there.
The director of the Dohuk antiquities department, Hassan Qasim, said it had been a place of Zoroastrian worship in the past, but added that the cave, a classified archeological site, can no longer be used as such.

With nowhere to practise their rites, Dohuk's Zoroastrians hope to grow in numbers and open a temple elsewhere.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Nearly half of Argentina's population was dragged into poverty in the second quarter of this year by the brutal effects of the the coronavirus pandemic on the country's longstanding economic crisis, researchers estimated on Wednesday.
Ahead of official government figures due later in the day, the Catholic University of Argentina (UCA) estimated the poverty rate spiked to between 46% and 47% by the end of June following months strict lockdowns to battle the coronavirus.
""There is greater general poverty. We are all a little poorer - we already were last year - and now with greater inequality,"" said UCA researcher Agustín Salvia.
He blamed the loss during the pandemic of 3.5 million jobs, mostly informal, for the rise, which was up from the 40.8% poverty rate recorded by UCA at the end of last year. The poverty line is drawn at 14,718 pesos ($193) per month.
According to the government's official statistics agency Indec, 35.5% of Argentines were living in poverty in the second half of 2019. Indec will publish the official figure for the first half of 2020 later on Wednesday.
The numbers reflect an everyday reality for Argentines like Guillermo Garay, who works as a street vendor during sporting events and saw his livelihood virtually disappear under the pandemic shutdowns.
""I survived because of family that supported me, because I had no possibility of doing anything,"" Garay said while selling Argentine flags at a protest in the capital, Buenos Aires. 
UNEMPLOYMENT
Argentina's economy contracted a record 19.1% in the second quarter versus a year earlier as the coronavirus crippled production and demand, and is on track for a 12% economic plunge in 2020, analysts say.
Small companies that produce for the domestic market were hit particularly hard as activity came to halt and businesses closed across the county for months beginning in March, driving unemployment up to 13.1% in the second quarter. 
Argentina recently struck a deal with its creditors to restructure about $65 billion in foreign debt and has a bumpy fiscal road ahead, sapping the spending power for social programs that could have helped alleviate the effect of the pandemic on the poor.
""To get out of this poverty crisis requires a lot of imagination on the part of those in charge. The traditional programs of a few public works and a slight improvement in wages will not be enough,"" said local economist Andrés Asiain. 
Salvia said it seemed unlikely that poverty levels would improve in the immediate future, and predicted about 45% of Argentines would still be in poverty at the end of the year.

Food and Agriculture Organization said on Wednesday.
The floods have added to hardship in Sudan, already struggling with an economic crisis and one of the world's highest rates of inflation when the coronavirus pandemic hit.
About 2.2 million hectares of cropland has been flooded and 108,000 head of livestock lost, according to an FAO assessment. Some 1.1 million tonnes of grain was destroyed in planted areas, most of it sorghum, a staple in Sudan, said Dominique Burgeon, a senior FAO official.
Women from some of nearly 600,000 affected agricultural households told the FAO they were cutting down to one small meal per day after their sorghum was washed away just before harvest, he said.
Commercial crops including bananas and mangos have also been badly hit.
The floods have also destroyed or damaged tens of thousands of homes and left more than 100 people dead. They have affected about 150,000 refugees and displaced people, the U.N. refugee agency has said. 
""It's a severe situation that needs mobilisation and support from the international community,"" Burgeon said. 
The United Nations estimates that 9.6 million people face acute food insecurity in Sudan, the highest number on record.
Locust swarms that have devastated crops in the Horn of Africa this year also still threaten the country, the FAO says.

VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrants hoping to reach the European Union are sheltering in forests and ruined former factory buildings near Bosnia's border with Croatia, with the cold setting in and conditions becoming more miserable.
On a cold Wednesday morning, migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan, Morocco and Algiers shivered in their makeshift tent camp high in the woods above the town of Velika Kladusa, built of cardboard and tree branches and covered with nylon sheets.
Some set up fires to warm up and cook modest meals. Others washed themselves and their clothes in a freezing forest stream, and brushed their teeth with ashes.
As the EU attempts to overhaul its defunct migration policies, thousands of people fleeing Asia, the Middle East and Africa are stranded on the fringe of the wealthy bloc, trying and often failing to enter and continue their journey.
Migrants and refugees mostly bypassed impoverished Bosnia during their mass movements across the Balkans in 2015-2016, but in recent years the country has become a key transit route after EU countries closed their borders to new arrivals.
""[There are] many problems here,"" said Mahmood Abal from Bangladesh. ""No rooms, no water, no medical facilities, no sanitation.""
He is one of about 500 men who were turned away from the Bosnian towns of Bihac and Velika Kladusa. Authorities are refusing to host large groups of migrants any longer and are preparing to close down some reception centres.
Sympathetic at first to the plight of the migrants, similar to their own during the war in the 1990s when they were forced to flee, Bosnians in the Krajina border region have become anxious, demanding that other regions share the burden.
But in ethnically-divided Bosnia, the Serb and Croat-dominated regions refuse to accept migrants, and so they concentrate in the Bosniak-dominated Sarajevo and Krajina.
Most migrants are smuggled to Bosnia in rubber boats over the Drina River, the natural border with Serbia, said Azur Sljivic, a Bosnian border police officer.
""Many of them drown because the Drina River is unpredictable, full of whirlpools,"" Sljivic told Reuters while patrolling along the border in the eastern town of Zvornik.
Yet they do not give up.
On Tuesday night, about 50 migrants left their Bosnian forest tents to try cross the Croatian border.

""Italy, see you soon!"", one of them shouted cheerfully.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling nationalists appeared to have taken a turn further to the right on Wednesday with the appointment of an ultra-conservative education chief in a new cabinet lineup, raising the prospect of new friction with the European Union.
Following weeks of internal rows over jobs and policies such as women's and LGBT rights, which threatened to break up the three-party Law and Justice (PiS) coalition, PiS chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 71, also joined the government as deputy premier.
PiS says a reshuffle was needed to streamline decision-making at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has pushed economies around the world into recession.
But critics call it the byproduct of an internal squabble between the ultra-conservative Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro and the more pragmatic Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, both of whom are vying to succeed the ageing Kaczynski.
""I am covinced the government with the new people ... will be even better equipped than before to deal with all challenges that await us, both in the internal arena as well as on the global and European arena,"" Morawiecki told a news conference. 
The education ministry, at the heart of PiS' efforts to instill more conservative values in public life, will go to Przemyslaw Czarnek, 43, a lecturer at a Catholic university who has said gay people are ""not equal to normal people"".
Speaking on Tuesday, Czarnek said schools should protect children from a moral and sexual revolution driven by ""LGBT ideology"".
""We will not allow for children to be exposed to an ideology ...that's contrary to values that have been the foundation of the Polish society for centuries,"" Czarnek told public TVP broadcaster.
Morawiecki said an additional post without a portfolio would be allocated to the United Poland party, Ziobro's small coalition grouping, but he did not name a minister to the role.
Media reports earlier said the minister without a portfolio to be responsible for citizens' affairs and ""European identity"" would be Michal Wos, 29, Poland's current environment minister.
Sources have said Morawiecki prefers a more tempered approach to issues such as the rights of gay, lesbian and transgender (LGBT) people, a view seen as reflecting a desire to patch up tense relations with Brussels. 
A leftist oposition lawmaker, Barbara Nowacka, said however that Czarnek's appointment was tantamount with a ""new culture war"".
""We expect changes in the core curriculum, changes in the autonomy of universities,"" Nowacka told Reuters. ""He is a man who would really like that the Catholic region is dominant."" 
Nowacka said the entry into government by Kaczynski, who is known to prefer to pull the levers of power backstage, suggests the government was on board with that.
It was not immediately clear whether the changes meant the government would move quickly to finish its contested court reforms, which the European Union says politicise courts and contradict democratic norms.
PiS has long said it would take further steps to overhaul the judiciary, which it says is too ineffective and seeped in communist-era mentality, soon after a July presidential election.

The party's candidate, the incumbent Andrzej Duda, won a new five-year mandate in that vote.

ROME (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered a warning to Italy over its economic relations with China on Wednesday, and described Chinese mobile telecoms technology as a threat to Italy's national security and the privacy of its citizens.
""The foreign minister and I had a long conversation about the United States' concerns at the Chinese Communist Party trying to leverage its economic presence in Italy to serve its own strategic purposes,"" Pompeo told a joint news conference with Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio.
""The United States also urges the Italian government to consider carefully the risks to its national security and the privacy of its citizens presented by technology companies with ties to the Chinese Community Party.""
Di Maio said the Italians were aware of U.S. concerns over Chinese 5G technology, and ""fully realise the responsibility faced by every country when dealing with security"".
U.S. attention has focused particularly on Huawei Technologies, the world's biggest telecoms equipment maker. Washington has told its European allies the Chinese firm poses a security threat, noting that Chinese companies and citizens must by law aid the state in intelligence gathering.
Huawei has denied it poses a risk. The head of its Italian unit said on Wednesday it was ready for any scrutiny to show that its technology was safe.
""We will open our insides, we are available to be vivisected to respond to all of this political pressure,"" Luigi De Vecchis told a conference in Rome.
While some U.S. allies, such as Britain, have announced bans on Huawei equipment in future telecoms infrastructure, Italy has so far declined to do so. However, the company was recently excluded from one major tender and a senior government official has told Reuters the state was ready to impose tougher rules in deals involving the Chinese firm.
Italy raised hackles in Washington last year when it became the first major Western economy to join China's international infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative. However, the tie-up has yielded little economic gain thus far.
Di Maio said Italy was looking for the European Union to adopt a common position on 5G development.
U.S. President Donald Trump has campaigned on a hard line towards China in the runup to a Nov. 3 election.

Pompeo's trip to Rome will also include meetings at the Vatican. He has criticised the Holy See for pursuing closer ties with Beijing, telling a symposium on Wednesday that China was looking to ""snuff out"" freedoms ""on a horrifying scale"".

FREETOWN (Reuters) - Sierra Leone's anti-corruption body has summoned former president Ernest Bai Koroma for questioning under oath over allegations of graft while in office, it said on Wednesday. 
The summons by the anti-graft commission is the latest move in a campaign by Koroma's successor, President Julius Maada Bio, to call to account the previous administration that Maada Bio says took the country to the brink of economic collapse.
It concerns alleged wrongdoing in connection with mining, construction and procurement contracts, and follows an order on Tuesday to bar Koroma and 111 officials from leaving the country after a judge-led inquiry alleged that they illicitly enriched themselves during his 2007-2018 tenure.
""The former president’s chief security officer received the notice on his behalf this morning at his residence in Makeni,"" anti-corruption commissioner Francis Ben Kaifala told Reuters.
Koroma had been ordered to answer questions from the commission - which has prosecuting powers - in person on Oct. 5, he said. 
Koroma was not available for comment, but has denied any wrongdoing in the past and said corruption allegations are part of a long-running smear campaign.
The former ruling All People's Congress party, which Koroma still leads, has rejected the inquiry's findings as ""politically motivated, legally flawed and procedurally defective"". It plans to challenge it at the Court of Appeal.
Koroma's Makeni property is among assets worth $200 million the government has ordered Koroma and the officials forfeit or repay after the inquiry released its report last Friday. 
An earlier report commissioned by Maada Bio accused the previous administration of exploiting an Ebola outbreak in the West African country for personal gain.

Sierra Leone, recovering from a decade of civil war that ended in 2002, saw its economy contract more than 20% in 2015 due to a slump in global commodity prices and the Ebola epidemic that had peaked a year earlier.

LONDON (Reuters) - Four of Britain's distinctive red postboxes have been painted black and gold and adorned with images by or of illustrious Black Britons, in a novel way of celebrating Black History Month.
One of Britain's most recognisable symbols, red pillar boxes appear on countless postcards and souvenir items, while tourists can often be seen posing for photographs next to the postboxes.
The  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) said it had selected one postbox in each of the four constituent parts of the United Kingdom - England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - and had them painted black with a gold trim at the top. They will remain that way for the whole of October, which is Black History Month.
In England, the chosen postbox is located close to the Black Cultural Archives heritage centre in Brixton, an area of south London that has long been a hub for the Caribbean community and other Black minority groups.
The Brixton postbox features an image of the painting ""Queuing at the RA"" by British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare, which appeared on a limited edition stamp issued by the Royal Mail in 2018 to celebrate the Royal Academy art gallery.
Shonibare is known for works that grapple with cultural identity and the legacies of colonialism, such as ""Nelson's Ship in a Bottle"", a replica of the ship HMS Victory enclosed in a giant bottle and with 37 sails made from an African fabric.
According to the UK Art Fund which acquired the artwork for display in London, it ""considers the legacy of British colonialism and its expansion in trade and Empire, made possible through the freedom of the seas and new trade routes that Nelson's victory provided."" 
The Scottish black postbox, located in Glasgow, features an image of Walter Tull, who was the first Black player signed by the city's Rangers soccer team before being killed in action during the First World War.
In the Welsh capital Cardiff, the black postbox features an image of Jamaican-born nurse Mary Seacole, who cared for wounded soldiers during the 1853-1856 Crimean War. 
In the Northern Ireland capital Belfast, the selected postbox features a picture of comedian Lenny Henry, who the Royal Mail said was ""instrumental in helping a multi-cultural society to embrace multi-cultural comedy"".
The Royal Mail is the latest institution to have engaged with Britain's Black heritage in recent months, jolted by the Black Lives Matter movement and by the toppling of the statue of a slave trader by protesters in the city of Bristol in June.
Among other changes, another slave trader statue was removed by officials in London, a concert hall in Bristol renamed itself and a charity that runs hundreds of grand country estates published an in-depth report about how the properties benefitted from slavery and colonialism.

The trend has been met with a backlash, with parts of the media and some politicians dismissing it as ""wokery"". The government has warned a number of major cultural institutions including the British Museum that their public funding could be called into question should they remove statues or other contentious objects.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - As Turkey and Greece prepare for talks to calm a bitter maritime dispute, Ankara released a video this week glorifying a 16th century naval victory which led to the Ottoman Empire taking control of the Mediterranean.
The video, shared on Twitter by the presidential communications department and viewed nearly half a million times, intersperses tales of ancient sea battles with footage of modern Turkish warships, driving home a message that Turkey must defend its interests in offshore waters.
This doctrine, called ""Blue Homeland"" in the video and accompanying song, has been championed by President Tayyip Erdogan's government as it challenges Greek and Cypriot maritime claims that confine Turkey to narrow strips of Aegean and Mediterranean coastal waters.
The policy, mirroring Turkey's assertive military interventions on land in Syria and Libya, has come to prominence in the last year - more than a decade after it first emerged - and is feeding into the east Mediterranean dispute.
Retired rear admiral Cihat Yayci, who had a major role in developing the doctrine, said Turkey's maritime policies were sharpened by the ""aggressive stances"" of Greece and Cyprus, which signed a series of accords marking out an exclusive economic zone in the east Mediterranean since 2003.
""They didn't want to share the seas with Turkey, they wanted to seize Turkey's seas. Turkey realized this,"" Yayci told Reuters.
The row burst into the open again last November when Turkey signed a maritime boundaries accord with Libya, which had been mooted by Yayci a decade earlier but which Athens said cut across its own claims.
In the wake of the Libya deal, tensions with Greece escalated in August when Ankara sent the survey vessel Oruc Reis to the eastern Mediterranean to explore for hydrocarbons.
They eased after Ankara brought Oruc Reis back to port, but Cyprus has demanded EU sanctions against Turkey.
European Union leaders are set to discuss the dispute at their summit starting on Thursday.
'NOT A THREAT'
For all the patriotic fervour, Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said this week he believed there would be ""good progress very soon"" in the talks with Greece, which are set to resume after a four-year hiatus.
Asked about Greek concerns regarding Blue Homeland, Kalin said it was not a threat to any other country.
""It's the idea of turning this sea land, the vast sea land in the Mediterranean, into an opportunity rather than a source of tension and friction among the Mediterranean countries,"" he told Reuters.
""Of course, we are open to dialogue and negotiation to agree on a model that is inclusive, that is fair, that is based on sharing whatever resources we have,"" he added.
The Greek foreign ministry declined to comment directly on Blue Homeland.
But it rejects Turkey's claims in the Aegean and east Mediterranean, saying Ankara has not signed the UN Convention for the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which gives islands sovereign rights to a continental shelf of up to 200 miles.
""I hope Turkey will adopt this logic consistently and in the long term, abandoning its illegal actions and provocations and making dialogue its priority,"" Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias said last week.
APPROACHING STORM
A hint of the approaching storm came a year ago when Erdogan posed at a military ceremony in front of a map showing the Blue Homeland, covering an area of some 462,000 square km - more than half the size of Turkey - across the Aegean, east Mediterranean and Black Sea.
The image was splashed across Greek newspapers and Dendias said Turkey was establishing itself as a ""troublemaker"".
While the two sides have agreed to resume talks broken off in 2016, the vast difference between that map and Greek maritime claims illustrates the gulf which the two sides must bridge if they are to find a compromise.
For a graphic on Overlapping claims in disputed east Med exploration area Overlapping claims in disputed east Med exploration area:
https://graphics.reuters.com/TURKEY-GREECE/qmyvmbgynpr/GREECE-TURKEY.jpg
In an interview, Yayci traced the roots of the Blue Homeland back to a 16th century Ottoman admiral celebrated in the government video.
""The real founder of the Blue Homeland concept is Barbarossa Hayrettin Pasha, who said 'whoever controls the seas controls the world',"" Yayci said at Istanbul's Bahcesehir University, where he runs a maritime research centre.
The video shows Ottoman sailors battling Crusaders, interspersed with images of Turkey's modern warships and sailors. A song evoking the Blue Homeland and a nationalistic poem read by Erdogan accompanies it.

The historic parallels extend to Turkey's gas exploration. A seismic survey vessel operating off Cyprus is named after Barbarossa, while two drill ships are named after powerful Ottoman sultans.

The ruling by the Sendai High Court, which upholds a lower court decision, means the government and TEPCO must pay 1.01 billion yen ($9.6 million) to 3,550 plaintiffs forced to flee their homes after a magnitude 9 earthquake triggered a tsunami that devastated the country's northeast and crippled the Fukushima nuclear plant, public broadcaster NHK reported.
The ruling could open up the government to further damage claims because thousands of other residents evacuated as reactors at the coastal power station overheated and released a radioactive cloud. While some people have returned home, areas close to the plant are still off limits.
The court said that the government could have taken measures to protect the site, based on expert assessments available in 2002 that indicated the possibility of a tsunami of more than 15 metres, said NHK, which aired footage of the plaintiffs celebrating outside the court after the ruling.
The government has yet to say whether it will appeal against the decision in Japan's Supreme Court.

NICE, France (Reuters) - Students arriving for the new university term in the French city of Nice said they found themselves crammed into lecture theatres with some people even sitting on the steps, despite a heightened alert in the city for the spread of COVID-19.
""The lecture hall was full. We were all stuck together,"" Joanna Gomes, a 22-year-old psychology student, said, describing a gathering organised by university staff on the first day of term. 
She said she had health problems which put her in a COVID-19 risk group. ""I'm scared,"" she said. ""It could be dangerous for me.""
The full lecture theatres show the challenges of returning to normal life after the summer break at a time of global pandemic. In France, as in many parts of Europe, COVID-19 rates have surged again in September.
Schools and universities are the second biggest source of virus clusters, after workplaces, according to French public health authorities.
At Nice's Universite de Cote d'Azur, 30 students and 10 staff have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of term on Sept. 7, according to university president Jeanick Brisswalter.
He said the university followed the government's COVID safety guidelines, including requiring students to wear masks. Once it became clear lecture theatres were full to capacity, the university responded by asking students to come in on alternate weeks, he said.
Brisswalter said students could catch COVID-19 outside university premises too, and that one cluster had been traced to a student party.
Four students at the university who spoke to Reuters described sitting elbow-to-elbow in lecture theatres at the start of term, with no vacant seats to ensure social distancing. Two of them said some students were sitting on the stairs.
The issue is not confined to Nice. Students posted on Twitter video and photos from universities around the country of packed lecture halls with people standing in the aisles, and tightly-packed crowds queuing on staircases and in corridors.

The boom rattled windows, scattered startled birds, briefly interrupted tennis at the French Open and prompted a flood of calls to emergency services.
In a city already tense after a knife attack outside the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on Friday, the blast sent people on to their balconies to see what had caused it and prompted intense messaging on social media.

BEROUN, Czech Republic (Reuters) - Thousands of Czechs quarantining at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic were allowed to vote at drive-in polling stations on Wednesday in a regional and upper house election which comes amid a surge in infections in the country.
The Czech Republic's spike in virus cases is the second largest in Europe this month when adjusted for population, with more than 40,000 cases in September bringing the total tally to 67,843 in the country of 10.7 million.
This weekend's regional election could be an early gauge of support for Prime Minister Andrej Babis's handling of the second wave of the virus. Support for his party in opinion polls has ticked lower amid criticism over his perceived reluctance to bring back tough measures and other policy inconsistencies hurting public trust. 
The state set aside one day for those in quarantine to vote from their cars at one of 78 special drive-in polling stations, which were built and manned by more than 1,600 soldiers.
Voters were not allowed out of cars.
""It is better than not voting,"" said Petr, who gave only his first name while voting in Beroun, 32 km west of Prague. 
The country passed through the first wave with far fewer cases than western neighbours but it came at an economic cost with the shutdown of schools, restaurants and businesses.
While the election for regional governments and a third of seats in parliament's upper house Senate is likely to draw only weak turnout, it could begin to signal some new alliances forming before a parliamentary election next year. 
Regular voting begins on Friday and ends on Saturday at 2:00 p.m. (1200 GMT).
In a September poll from STEM agency, support for Babis's ANO party fell to 28.4%, from 33.7% in May. The opposition Pirates, in second position, were steady at 12.8% and the opposition centre-right Civic Democrats (ODS) had 10.6%.

""Cyprus looks to the EU and its partners for solidarity in action,"" Cypriot Foreign Minister Nikos Christodoulides said after a meeting with his Spanish counterpart, Arancha Gonzalez Laya.
""Concretely upholding our common values and interests, and implementing our own decisions is of the essence.""
Cyprus is withholding its consent to European sanctions on Belarus because it wants tougher measures from the bloc on Turkey, which it says is violating its maritime rights. Greece supports Cyprus's position.
Senior EU diplomats have said the bloc is unlikely to accede to Cyprus' demands, after Ankara agreed to talks with Greece in a separate, but related issue. 
Turkey dispatched two survey vessels to separate areas in the eastern Mediterranean this year, drawing strong protests from both Cyprus and Greece, which say Ankara is operating on their respective continental shelves. Turkey says its within its rights.
While the vessel close to Greece has been recalled by Turkey to allow for exploratory talks between the two NATO allies, the ship close to Cyprus, the Barbaros Hayrredin Pasa, is still operating south-east of the island.
""Unfortunately.. signals of de-escalation have not been extended to Cyprus,"" Christodoulides said.
Laya said dialogue was needed to resolve the issue, not unilateral action. ""(That) is what Spain has been advocating between Greece and Turkey and which Spain advocates between Cyprus and Turkey,"" she said.

Eastern Mediterranean tensions are to be discussed at the summit of EU leaders meeting Oct. 1-2.

1307,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","UK considered sending asylum seekers to south Atlantic, FT reports","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain considered a plan to send asylum seekers 4,000 miles away to holding centres on its remote overseas territories in the south Atlantic but the idea, described as ""ludicrous"" by opponents, was later dropped, the Financial Times reported.
According to the paper, the Home Office (interior ministry) considered building migrant processing centres on the volcanic islands of Ascension and St Helena, having looked into how other countries dealt with issues of illegal migration.
However, Home Secretary Priti Patel dropped the plan after officials were consulted on the practicality of shipping the asylum seekers to the locations, the FT said. 
""This ludicrous idea is inhumane, completely impractical and wildly expensive,"" Nick Thomas-Symonds, the opposition Labour Party's home affairs spokesman, said on Twitter.
A Home Office source said Britain had a proud history of offering refuge to those who needed protection.
""Tens of thousands of people have rebuilt their lives in the UK and we will continue to provide safe and legal routes in the future,"" the source said. 
""As ministers have said we are developing plans to reform policies and laws around illegal migration and asylum to ensure we are able to provide protection to those who need it, while preventing abuse of the system and the criminality associated with it,"" the source said.
There has been a surge in the number of migrants arriving in Britain this year, with media reports suggesting that about 1,500 people travelled across the English Channel in small boats and dinghies in August alone.
In total, there were more than 32,000 asylum applications in the United Kingdom in the year ending June 2020.
The FT said the idea was evidence of the influence of former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott, who was appointed as a UK trade adviser earlier this month. Australia has used offshore detention centres on the Pacific islands of Nauru, and on Manus in Papua New Guinea.

Australia's policies and management of the detention centres have repeatedly been criticised by the United Nations and human rights groups. Asylum seekers intercepted at sea and sent to the camps can never settle in Australia, even if they are found to be genuine refugees.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand's ruling party leader Jacinda Ardern said she tried cannabis ""a long time ago"" when asked during a heated live debate on Wednesday ahead of the Oct 17 general election. 
Ardern, 40, is widely seen winning a second term in office on the back of her success in containing COVID-19 but her rival, conservative National Party leader Judith Collins, has been clawing back support.
New Zealanders are also voting on two other issues - on legalising recreational cannabis and euthanasia - topics that have split opinions in the country.
In the second election debate on Wednesday, when asked by the moderator if she has ever used cannabis, Ardern said: ""Yes I did, a long time ago.""
But she said she will only reveal which way she voted on the cannabis referendum after the election.
""I made a clear decision that I want the public of New Zealand to decide this and I want this not to be about politics,"" she said.
Collins, however, said she has never used cannabis and would vote against it.
In the wide-ranging debate, both leaders were also asked if U.S. President Donald Trump was a dangerous influence on the world.
Collins said Trump had done well recently on the peace deal between Israel and some Gulf nations.
""Actually that's better than war. He hasn't been ready to rush into war,"" said Collins. 
Ardern shot back saying: ""It is a worry when the best thing you can say is we haven't had war?""
Ardern last month slammed Trump's comments that New Zealand was experiencing a surge in COVID-19 as ""patently wrong"".
""The idea that we would be compared to the outbreak in the U.S. by President Trump, I totally reject that and I stand by my response,"" said Ardern, whose brand of liberal, inclusive and compassionate leadership has led to some people labelling her ""the anti-Trump"".
New Zealand has had 25 coronavirus related deaths, among the lowest in the world, while fatalities in the United States have crossed 200,000. 

The comments came just hours after Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden battled fiercely in a chaotic and bad-tempered first debate marked by personal insults and Trump's repeated interruptions.

1310,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","U.S., Taiwan to team up on infrastructure in pushback against China","TAIPEI (Reuters) - The United States and Taiwan will work together on infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific region and Latin America, officials said on Wednesday, in an implicit pushback for China's own massive regional investment plans.
Washington is deeply suspicious of Beijing's Belt and Road Initiative to build roads, railways and other facilities to link China to Europe, Asia and beyond, viewing it as a plan to entrap countries into China's orbit with debt diplomacy. 
China denies this.
The de facto U.S. embassy in Taipei said the new plan would support ""quality infrastructure in emerging markets"", while Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said it dovetailed the U.S. Indo-Pacific strategy with Taiwan's own New Southbound Policy.
The latter effort aims to boost economic ties with southeast and south Asia, to cut the island's reliance on China.
""The Taiwan-U.S. cooperative partnership relationship has gone up another level,"" Wu added.
There were no immediate details of the volume of funding or investment projects, however.
The plan sets up a working group led by the U.S. Treasury Department and Taiwan's Finance Ministry to identify and promote public and private sector collaboration in infrastructure investment.
Brent Christensen, the top U.S. official in Taiwan, said the pact, known as the Framework to Strengthen Infrastructure Finance and Market Building Cooperation, would offer a platform to promote more resilient supply chains in the Indo-Pacific.
The working group is due to hold its first meeting this autumn, he added.
Like most countries, the United States has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, which China claims as its own. But the United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and main source of arms, to Beijing's anger.
This month the United States and Taiwan said they were seeking ""like-minded"" democracies to join a shift in global supply chains during the coronavirus pandemic, as Washington looks to ease its economic reliance on China.

Taiwan has also been keen to wean its economy off China, especially as Beijing steps up efforts at military intimidation against the island.

BEIRUT, (Reuters) - Piles of rubble and broken glass lie in the corridors and courtyard of Beirut's College Notre Dame de Nazareth.
The principal's office has been damaged and the doors and windows of the chapel blown off. The statue of the Virgin Mary in the yard has remained intact, however, watching over workmen toiling to fix buildings.
These are the scenes as students wait to start a new academic year.
The huge explosion in Beirut's port on Aug. 4 did not spare the Lebanese capital's schools as it laid waste to swathes of the city. 
Rebuilding poses yet another challenge to an education system already reeling from an economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.
""I can't adapt to it as I adapted to other problems. We don't have classrooms, offices or halls. There is nothing standing, I have nowhere to bring in students,"" said Notre Dame principal Sister Magida Fheili.
Many of the school's buildings were left with no windows, no doors and broken walls.
More than 200 education institutions - public and private schools and technical colleges - were damaged by the explosion, said Maya Semaha, the Education Ministry's head of engineering.
Of those, 25 were severely damaged and some might need more time to fix than what is left until the academic year kicks off, she said.
NO MONEY FOR FEES
While some private schools have started with online classes, Lebanon's official back-to-school date - originally set for Sept. 28 - has been postponed until Oct. 12 after a surge in coronavirus cases in the Mediterranean country.
Curriculums were reduced to almost half so schools could complete them in a hybrid way, Education Ministry media advisor Albert Chamoun told Reuters. Lessons are expected to be a mix of online courses and in-person teaching, he explained.    But some establishments, like Nazareth and the Sagesse Beirut school, do not yet have the option of going back to the classrooms.     ""We are a big school with a lot of classes, we surely can welcome (students) during coronavirus by separating classes,"" said Father Charbel Massaad, president of Sagesse school. ""But our problem is not coronavirus now, it is the rebuilding.""
As he spoke, workers were rebuilding a disintegrated wall.
Massaad underlined the urgency of the restoration process and distribution of aid to schools before winter, so students can find stability to pursue their learning.
According to Semaha, money to repair public schools has now been secured through various international donors, while aid is still being gathered to help private schools.
But parents are also facing financial difficulties due to the collapse of Lebanon's economy. Rising book prices and poverty levels have left some families unable to pay, pushing students from private to public institutions or even leaving children out of schools.     Books will be available online to download for free, Chamoun said, though he acknowledged that many citizens cannot afford to buy laptops or tablets. He said the ministry was working on collecting donations and aid to provide electronic devices for students in public and private schools as the state does not have the means to secure them.     Sister Magida, whose school did not close during Lebanon’s 1975-90 civil war, expected that half the parents of her students would not be able to pay the fees this year.     ""Nothing works. We are working in very difficult circumstances trying to survive. The existence of schools is surely in danger, as is their education level,"" she said.

""In my opinion, all Lebanon is in danger.""

GAZA (Reuters) - Routine blackouts and shaky internet service have made remote learning in the Gaza Strip a challenge for students during the coronavirus pandemic.
With schools closed across the Palestinian enclave since a lockdown in August, hundreds of thousands of students have been stuck at home and learning has moved online.
In Gaza, where poverty is rampant and infrastructure lacking, siblings are often left to argue over precious screen time during the hours when the power is on.
On average Gazans in the Hamas Islamist-run territory get eight hours of electricity a day from its lone generating plant and Israeli power lines. Most families are dependent on foreign aid and struggle to pay for internet or buy extra computers or phones.
""We have to wait until electricity is back so we can recharge the phones,"" said 10th grader Raseel Hussein. ""Work is sent over the internet and we have to download it, and that depends on how weak or strong the signal is.""
Her mother, Yasmine, said that ""many families are poor and ... can't afford smart phones or internet to connect with teachers"".
Hamas declared a lockdown on Aug 24 after the first cases of coronavirus were reported outside of quarantine facilities for people entering Gaza. Since then there have been 2,800 cases and 20 people died.
Gaza is home to two million Palestinians in cities, towns and refugee camps squeezed within an area of 360 square km (139 square miles), with its borders sealed off by neighbouring Israel and Egypt.
The lockdown has been partially eased but schools, mosques, and other public facilities remain closed. A nightly curfew is in effect.

Moatasem Al-Minawai, an official with Gaza's education ministry, said challenges will continue even after schools reopen. With limitations on classroom attendance, students will be in school only part-time.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - Protests erupted in several parts of India on Wednesday following the late night cremation of a gang rape victim, that was carried out against the wishes of her family. 
The 19-year-old victim from the Dalit community - the lowest rung of India's ancient caste system - was attacked and raped on Sept. 14 in a field near her home in Hathras district, 100 km (62-miles) from the capital, New Delhi, authorities said.
She died in hospital on Tuesday from injuries sustained during the attack. Police have arrested four men in connection with the rape.
The victim's brother told Reuters neither police nor government officials sought the permission of the family to perform the last rites of the victim in her native village in Uttar Pradesh state at about 2 a.m. (0730 GMT) on Wednesday.
""We begged the authorities and police that we wanted to perform the last rites in the morning but they did not listen to us and the last rites were performed by them,"" he said. 
""We were put behind the barricades they formed using the police force. We could not even see the face of our dead sister."" 
The victim and her brother are not being identified due to laws against naming victims of sexual violence. 
Police and government officials in the woman's home district did not respond to requests for comment. 
The crime has caused outrage in India, where violence against women and those of lower castes is endemic. The victim's brother said the accused men were all members of an upper caste in the village. 
Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country.
Protesters in Hathras were met by police who charged them with batons, a witness said.
Angry protesters, many wearing masks to ward off the novel coronavirus, scuffled with police in New Delhi while in Kolkota, protesters burned a big picture of Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh who is also a hardline Hindu priest.

Adityanath has ordered a high-level police enquiry into the incident.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 06:10AM ET</span>",Flight of Hong Kong protesters piles pressure on Taiwan,"By Reuters staff
TAIPEI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - For some Hong Kong protesters, stripped of their passports and facing criminal charges, a perilous 600 km sea journey to Taiwan is their only hope of escape. For Taiwan, which has promised assistance to the people of Hong Kong but is wary of antagonising China, this brings a dilemma.
People began fleeing to Taiwan from the early months of the Hong Kong protests last year, mostly legally by air, sometimes by fishing boat, said activists in Taipei who have helped Hong Kong citizens obtain visas. Numbering a few hundred, they included people who took part in the pro-democracy protests, as well as clergy, social workers and others who offered care and support to protesters.
This year, coronavirus-related travel restrictions and Hong Kong's new security law, which was imposed on June 30 and handed the police and Chinese security agents sweeping powers, have narrowed the protesters' options to leave and sharply reduced the numbers fleeing to Taiwan to a few dozen. The most desperate are taking their chances by sea.
In the past month, China stopped a boat carrying 12 people, and Taiwan intercepted a craft carrying five near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea. Several sources with knowledge of the smuggling operation said at least a dozen more pro-democracy activists have reached Taiwan by boat. 
These crossings have brought some ""comfort"" to the mostly young, pro-democracy activists who fled to Taiwan before the Hong Kong security law took effect, said one. ""We have always felt guilty about running away.""
Those left behind in Hong Kong had two options - to face trial or to flee. ""It's a choice between hope and hopelessness. Of course some have chosen to risk their lives at sea.""
This person and other activists, speaking on condition of anonymity, described a small-scale operation, organized by individuals in Hong Kong and Taiwan, to ferry protesters across the typhoon-prone South China Sea. The few risking the journey have been charged with crimes such as arson and rioting by Hong Kong authorities and had their passports confiscated. Hong Kong has so far charged over 600 people with rioting, which carries up to a 10-year jail term.
The crossing, that can take more than a day, is fraught with risk. Driving a speedboat under cover of night brings the danger of collision with submerged rocks and buoys. There is also the danger of detection. In Hong Kong waters, police marine patrols are frequently seen among the fishing trawlers, container ships, pleasure craft and speedboats. Stepped up Chinese military patrols and training exercises in the South China Sea around Hong Kong have increased the risk of interception.
At least a dozen other protesters who possess travel documents, have come by air in recent months, despite the suspension of most Taiwan visa applications because of the coronavirus. Taiwan said in June it would allow Hong Kong citizens to apply for entry for ""special humanitarian considerations.""
The Taiwan government declined to say how many people from Hong Kong have been granted residency or entry. It has repeatedly said anyone who enters the country must do so legally.
""I bought a return ticket and carried lots of luggage, trying everything I could to act like a normal traveller,"" said one person who flew to Taiwan on a commercial flight, describing a trip hastily arranged before the Hong Kong security law came into force. ""It was such a relief the moment I boarded the Taiwanese aircraft. I knew I was safe at last.""
SOLVING AN EQUATION
The Taiwan government faces a difficult balancing act. It wants to help Hong Kong citizens who flee to the island, legally or illegally, but it is increasingly wary of doing so in an overt way in case this prompts a forceful backlash from China - including possible military action, said three sources with direct knowledge of government thinking.
Reuters questions to Taiwan's government were referred to the Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees China and Hong Kong policy. The Council declined to comment on what it called ""rumours."" It said in a statement that the government has established a mechanism of ""humanitarian assistance"" to give necessary help to those who are qualified, but it didn't elaborate.
""This is like solving a simultaneous equation,"" said ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party parliamentarian Hung Sun-han, speaking on his own account. ""We need to give considerations to human rights, but we also need to handle the tense relations between China and Taiwan."" 
Tensions across the Taiwan Strait have spiked since President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected by a landslide in January on a promise to stand up to Beijing, which has never renounced using force to bring self-ruled Taiwan under its control.
Tsai pledged assistance to people arriving from Hong Kong, including setting up an office to help with employment, living allowances and counselling. But that was several weeks before the introduction of Hong Kong's security law, and little was known of its contents and implications. The law makes anything Beijing regards as subversion, secession, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces punishable by up to life in prison.
More recently, Taiwan has been coy about the extent of the aid it has given.
The Taiwan government has several concerns, according to the three sources. It doesn't want to be accused of helping people Beijing says are violent criminals. Taiwan also fears Chinese military threats against the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands, two of the three sources said.
One scenario Taiwan authorities fear is that China could seize Taiwan's Pratas Islands -  the Taiwan-controlled but lightly defended territory closest to Hong Kong - in a drastic escalation of tensions that could lead to a war, two senior officials familiar with the situation said.
Taiwan has repeatedly complained of Chinese military activities in the area, including rare large-scale air and naval drills held near the Pratas Islands on September 9 and 10 which Taiwan called a serious provocation and Beijing described as a necessity to protect its sovereignty.
In mid-September, during U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach's visit to Taipei, China sent multiple jets to cross the sensitive midline of the Taiwan Strait and also into Taiwan's air defence identification zone near the Pratas. Taiwan says Chinese aircraft have continued to fly near the Pratas since then.
A mainland Chinese official who spoke with Reuters said delicate diplomacy between Taiwan and China was needed, as a policy misstep could lead to military conflict. ""We never talk about war but we must be aware of this danger,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
At home in Taiwan, meanwhile, there is growing popular pressure for Tsai's government to do more to help Hong Kong citizens, for instance by introducing a law that would guarantee refuge to Hong Kong citizens and by promising not to detain people arriving illegally by boat.
The three people familiar with government thinking described a strategy of offering support discreetly, what some call ""do more, say less."" They said Taiwan is offering concrete help - entry visas for instance - without drawing accusations from China of collusion with Hong Kong ""separatists.""
Nevertheless, reports of smuggling are ""very tricky to handle and it has brought us a lot of trouble,"" said one of the sources, speaking of growing pressure from China, without elaborating. ""But Taiwan will stick to the principle of not sending people back.""
This source said Taiwan is ""blurring out"" details of what the government called ""humanitarian assistance"" to Hong Kong citizens so that it becomes impossible for the public and media to confirm reports of illegal entry. ""To rescue people, we need to stay as quiet as possible...Keeping it low profile is the only way to protect people.""
FUGITIVES AND CRIMINALS
Pressure on Taiwan from Chinese politicians and state media is mounting.
On Sept. 14, former Hong Kong leader Leung Chun-ying questioned in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post why Taiwan withheld information on the whereabouts of the five people picked up by Taiwan's coast guard near the Pratas Islands. Leung, now the vice chairman of a high-level Chinese consultative committee, the CPPCC, told Reuters it was important to know the identities of the five to determine ""if they are fugitives or have absconded from court proceedings."" Hong Kong also expected to be told under what charges they were detained, whether they would now be released, prosecuted or deported and what access they have to legal assistance, he said.
Also on Sept. 14, the Hong Kong Security Bureau, responsible for security and law enforcement, called on Taiwan not to ""harbour criminals.""
Separately, four officials at Taiwan's de facto consulate in Hong Kong have been told by the Hong Kong government that their visas will not be renewed on the grounds that they refused to acknowledge Beijing's claim that Taiwan is part of ""one China,"" Reuters reported in July. All four have left the city.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office didn't directly address a question from Reuters about the visa issue. It said it supported the city government's ""handling of Taiwan related matters in Hong Kong."" It accused authorities in Taipei of ""colluding"" with independence and anti-China forces. ""Any actions that bring chaos to Hong Kong or seek independence will be severely punished by the law,"" it said.
One of the three people with knowledge of the Taiwan government's thinking explained, ""We don’t want the Communist Party to find an excuse to take revenge on Taiwanese people in Hong Kong or China. We want to offer real help"" to Hong Kong citizens ""without making ourselves vulnerable to China on the national security level.""
LOST AT SEA
Those leaving Hong Kong by boat monitor weather conditions before they depart. White capped waves and prevailing winds can hinder the passage, making it difficult to attain higher speeds and pushing up fuel consumption.
The sources familiar with the smuggling operation described a dangerous route in which at least one boat that set off from Hong Kong had lost communications with their contacts. ""People kept searching and searching through all channels...But the fact was that they were lost,"" said one of the people.
There were no records of such trips and Reuters couldn't independently verify the claim.
Protesters, some of whom have made it to Taiwan, say they are grateful for Tsai's pledges of help.

""Taiwan isn't just a place where they can take some respite. It's where they could gain strength to fight against China's totalitarian rule,"" said one of the people familiar with the smuggling operation.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's executive criticised judiciary overhauls by the nationalist governments in Poland and Hungary as a ""major source of controversy"" and ""serious concern"" in its first report on Wednesday about failings in the rule of law in the bloc.
Seen by Reuters ahead of official release on Wednesday, the report also focused on challenges to media independence and fighting corruption, saying the coronavirus pandemic served as a ""stress test"" of democratic resilience of the 27 EU states.
The report comes as the bloc is looking to link access to EU money, including a new 750 billion euro coronavirus recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law.
""Poland's justice reforms since 2015 have been a major source of controversy,"" the report said, adding that Hungary was also among member states where ""the direction of change has given rise to serious concern about the impact of reforms on judicial independence.""
Warsaw and Budapest are locked in long-running battles with the EU over undercutting democratic checks and balances through putting courts, media, NGOs and academics under more state control. 
""The European Union was created also as an antidote to ... authoritarian tendencies,"" said the EU's top democracy official, Commissioner for Values and Transparency, Vera Jourova, who co-wrote the report.
""The rule of law is not about being right-wing or left-wing; it is about being right or wrong.""
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban this week called for Jourova to be dismissed after she said his vision of ""illiberal democracy"" was in fact spearheading the creation of an ""ailing democracy"" in Hungary.
The Commission rejected Orban's request.
Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovakia were also criticised in the report for shortcomings in ensuring judiciary independence. The Commission noted corruption scandals in Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Malta. 

The report also said some governments' emergency measures to tackle coronavirus went too far in restraining the media and civil society's scrutiny of public decisions.

KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's new emir was sworn in at parliament on Wednesday as the country prepared to lay to rest late ruler Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who helped steer the U.S.-allied Gulf state through some of the Middle East's most turbulent decades.
The cabinet swiftly named designated successor Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah as ruler on Tuesday following the death of Sheikh Sabah, 91, whose body is due to arrive in Kuwait on Wednesday from the United States were he had been hospitalised since July.
Nawaf, 83, pledged to work for the OPEC member country's prosperity, stability and security after taking the oath of office, raising both hands to his head as lawmakers applauded.
""Our dear nation today faces difficult situations and dangerous challenges that can only be overcome ... by unifying ranks and working hard together,"" he told the National Assembly.
The funeral has been restricted to ruling family members due to concerns about coronavirus, which along with low oil prices has strained the wealthy petroleum producer's finances.
When the previous emir, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, died in 2006, thousands of Kuwaitis attended the funeral and many, along with expatriates, lined the streets.
""We honestly feel like we're gong to be lost without his guidance,"" said Fajer, a Kuwaiti woman.
Dignitaries from around the world paid respects to the seasoned diplomat and savvy politician, widely respected as a humanitarian who strove to heal rifts in the Middle East, mending ties with former occupier Iraq and trying until his death to resolve a bitter Gulf dispute.
Analysts saw his death following that earlier this year of Oman's Sultan Qaboos, who also played a moderating and balancing role in the region, as the end of an era in the Gulf where an aggressive younger generation has risen to power, particularly in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates which have taken hawkish stands against rival Iran.
""Though the incoming power brokers in neighbouring Gulf countries did not always heed his advice, the Emir was a reminder of an order hard-fought to achieve that was the basis for the goodwill international partners bear the region,"" wrote Kirsten Fontenrose, director of the Atlantic Council's Scowcroft Middle East. 
Sheikh Nawaf takes the reins of the small nation, which holds the world's seventh-largest oil reserves, at a time when the government is trying to boost the finances of a country whose citizens enjoy a cradle-to-grave welfare system.
Kuwait's oil, investment and foreign policy are not expected to change. 

Nawaf lacks his brother's experience as a conciliator and is likely to focus on domestic matters such as choosing a crown prince who can build consensus in the ruling family and work with a parliament that has often clashed with the government and hindered economic reform efforts, diplomats and analysts say.

The court decision comes as Wong and other activists face prosecution on suspicion of several offences related to last pro-democracy protests last year, which prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law in the Asian financial hub on June 30.
Wong, 23, who was arrested on Sept. 24, was defiant.
""We just want to send a clear message to the world, even if they arrest us, prosecute us and even lock us up in prison, there's no reason for us to give up,"" he said outside the court.
His case was adjourned until Dec. 18.
Just 17 years old when he became the face of student-led Umbrella Movement democracy protests in 2014, Wong was not a leading figure of the often violent unrest that shook the semi-autonomous former British colony last year.
He had been a frequent visitor to Washington where he appealed to the U.S. Congress to support Hong Kong's democracy movement and counter Beijing's tightening grip. 
His U.S. visits angered Beijing, which says he is a ""black hand"" of foreign forces.
The new security law punishes anything China considers subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.
Authorities introduced a law against masks last year in a bid to help police identify protesters they suspected of committing crimes. 
The Hong Kong government has since then made masks mandatory in most circumstances because of the novel coronavirus.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The relatives of 12 Hong Kong people arrested by China at sea last month called for access to their detained family members in a petition to the mainland's representative office in the semi-autonomous city on Wednesday.
The 12, of whom 10 were facing charges related to anti-government protests last year, were arrested on Aug. 23 for suspected illegal entry into mainland Chinese waters as they attempted to flee by boat to self-ruled Taiwan.
They are being held in Shenzen, where their families say they have been denied access to independent lawyers.
Five family members, who requested their full names not to be revealed, gathered outside China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, shouting ""return our children,"" ""meet us immediately,"" and ""reject government appointed lawyers.""
The arrest of the 12, whom China's foreign ministry has called ""separatists"", has compounded the fears of many in Hong Kong about what they see as China's determination to end any push for greater democracy in the financial hub.
The father of detainee Cheng Tsz-ho broke into tears: ""I just want to see if my son is ok.""
Hong Kong authorities have said the 12 will be represented by mainland lawyers chosen by the detainees from a list provided by Chinese authorities, and that they have offered ""needed and feasible"" assistance to the families and will continue to do so.
In a statement on Tuesday, the liaison office said the facts related to their crimes were clear and that people with ""ulterior motives"" were ""spreading rumours"" about the 12 to instigate illegal demonstrations. 
""Our family members are disappeared. We couldn’t see them or give them medicine. We want our own lawyers, not government-appointed lawyers,” said the mother of detainee Li Tsz-yin.
In a jointly-issued statement, read by activist Owen Chow, the relatives said the lawyers they had chosen were denied access and pressured by Chinese authorities to drop the case. The families said the Hong Kong government had not provided any ""concrete assistance"" and requested meetings with senior officials.
The family members left mooncakes, a traditional gift for the approaching mid-Autumn festival, near the tall barricades surrounding the Liaison Office. 
""I hope we can reunite for next year's festival,"" the wife of Wong Wai-yin, another detainee, said.

""I just want to see my husband. We are not here to make a mess. Why has Hong Kong become like this?""

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - An Indian court on Wednesday acquitted Hindu nationalist leaders, including former deputy prime minister Lal Krishna Advani, in a case over the demolition of a mosque at a disputed site 28 years ago, citing a lack of evidence.
The demolition sparked nationwide riots that killed more than 3,000 people in a decades-long dispute that has fuelled Hindu-Muslim tension, as the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's campaign for Hindu renaissance helped bring it to power.
Handing down its verdict after a lengthy legal battle, the court said there was not enough evidence to directly tie any of the accused to the violence, defence lawyer Manish Kumar Tripathi said. 
""The court did not accept the evidence, it was not strong enough,"" Tripathi told reporters at the courthouse. 
Advani, who was then BJP chief, was among 32 people accused of criminal conspiracy and inciting a mob to tear down the 16th-century Babri mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya in 1992.
The mosque stood on a site revered by devout Hindus as the birthplace of the god-king Ram.
The court pinned the blame on miscreants mingled among the crowd instead, adding that leaders such as Advani and Murli Manohar Joshi, another former cabinet minister, had tried to keep the mob from turning violent.
Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for a Hindu temple to be built at the site, after the Supreme Court paved the way last year, in a decision that also ordered land to be allotted further away for a mosque. 
The court had ignored all the evidence in Wednesday's case, said Zafaryab Jilani, a lawyer for the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, adding that it planned to appeal to the high court against the decision. 
""We will seek remedy,"" he added.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Belgium is finally getting a new government on Wednesday, 16 months on from a parliamentary election, with the Belgian king expected to name caretaker finance minister Alexander De Croo as the new prime minister.
Following weeks of talks, seven parties spanning the French-Dutch language divide have agreed to form a governing coalition to replace the caretaker administration of Sophie Wilmes, who led Belgium through six months of the COVID-19 crisis.
Belgium has one of the world's highest COVID-19 fatalities per capita. The death toll passed 10,000 on Wednesday. 
De Croo was set to lead the new government, Belgian newspapers including daily Le Soir reported, citing anonymous sources. 
Paul Magnette, leader of the French-speaking Socialists, said on Twitter that he was heading to the palace to form a government with other parties.

Belgium had been under a caretaker administration since the start of the COVID-19 crisis in March and without a fully fledged government since December 2018, when a four-party coalition collapsed.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's military has asked Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga's new government for its ninth straight annual budget increase, including funds to begin development of an advanced stealth fighter to counter new aircraft being deployed by China.
The Ministry of Defence budget proposal released on Wednesday seeks a 3.3% climb in spending to a record 5.49 trillion yen ($52 billion) for the year starting April 1. Finance ministry officials will review and possibly amend the request before passing it on to Suga's cabinet.
If approved, the plan would continue a build-up pursued by Suga's predecessor Shinzo Abe, that has seen Japan buy planes, missiles and aircraft carriers to give its Self Defence Forces greater range and potency as neighboring China expands its navy and air forces in East Asia. 
The latest defence budget request also comes as Japanese policymakers debate whether to arm and train its military to strike distant land targets in China, North Korea and other parts of Asia. 
Japan's new proposed jet fighter, the first in three decades, is expected to cost around $40 billion and be ready sometime in the 2030s. The latest budget request asks for $731 million for development and research.
Japan's leading defence company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is expected to be named as lead contractor next month.
Several overseas companies are also vying to join the project as suppliers and partners, including  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co and  Northrop Grumman  Corp (NYSE:NOC) from the United States and BAE Systems (OTC:BAESF) Plc and Rolls Royce (LON:RR) Holdings Plc from Britain. 
Other proposed purchases include 66.6 billion yen for six Lockheed F-35 stealth fighters, two of which are short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) B variants that will operate off a converted helicopter carrier. 
The military also wants 99 billion yen to build two new compact warships that can operate with fewer sailors than conventional destroyers and ease pressure on a navy struggling to find recruits in an ageing Japan.

It also wants to upgrade early warning radars and ballistic missile defences, and is asking for funds to be put aside for an as-yet undecided replacement for two planned Aegis Ashore radar stations that were cancelled in June due to costs and concerns about the impact on local residents.

SEOUL (Reuters) - When she first met a mysterious South Korean man who introduced himself as Dr Seong, the woman thought she had found a father figure to help her start a new life after fleeing from her home in North Korea.
It seemed a positive relationship, with Seong paying her for information and reconnecting her with her brother still in North Korea.
But things went bad when Seong and a colleague, identified by his surname Kim, began to sexually abuse her, according to the woman and military prosecutors who indicted Seong, a Defence Intelligence Command (DIC) lieutenant colonel, and Kim, a master sergeant, this month on charges of sexually assaulting and raping the woman.
More than 72% of the 33,700 North Koreans resettled in the South are women and at least a quarter of them encountered sexual violence in the South but less than 10% sought help, the gender equality ministry found in a 2017 survey.
Defectors have complained recently that the government of President Moon Jae-in, who has made improving ties with North Korea a priority, is failing to provide refuge by ignoring rights, stifling political activity and deporting some escapees.
In an interview with Reuters, the woman, who agreed to be identified only by her surname Lee, said the agents abused their power and turned her dream of a new life into a nightmare.
""I was mad at myself, for being unable to resist when they did that to me,"" she said. 
""After all, they were the first people I trusted, respected and relied on here.""
A lawyer for Seong and Kim did not respond to requests for comment. Defendants in South Korean criminal cases are customarily not identified by their full names. 
The defence ministry, which handles public relations for the DIC, declined to comment. 
The military's chief prosecutor, Colonel Lee Soo-dong, told Reuters Seong and Kim said they had consensual sexual intercourse with the woman but denied rape. 
'ABSOLUTE POWER'
The woman was 26 when she defected in 2014, disillusioned with her job at a military institute and harbouring dreams of South Korea gleaned from television dramas.
It was her link to the institute, as well as the fact her brother still worked there, that apparently made her an attractive asset for South Korean agents.
Seong told her he worked for the government and they developed what she described as a ""father-daughter"" relationship.
When she pleaded for help after her brother was arrested in North Korea in 2018, while trying to get information that Seong had requested, he and Kim began raping her, she said. The woman later learned North Korean secret police detained her brother. He has not been heard from since.
Lee said the abuse lasted nearly a year and a half and she was pressed to get two abortions and suffered severe distress.
Her lawyer, Jeon Su-mi, described her decision to file a complaint as her #MeToo moment. But the woman said military prosecutors victimised her during the long investigation, suggesting the sex was consensual and pressing her to drop the complaint.
She said at one point, she had to listen to an audio clip recorded by Seong during one alleged rape, which left her suicidal. She said she sought therapy.
Prosecutor Lee said his colleagues never intended to undermine her rights, though he acknowledged they should have been more sensitive.
Jeon blamed the system for enabling agents to take advantage of vulnerable defectors.
""The women can't say 'no' because to them, these people have absolute power, like God.""
The president's office declined to comment on the woman's case but Moon has called on the security agencies change the way they conduct investigations.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 30, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>","Kuwait mourns Emir Sheikh Sabah, veteran defender of Arab unity","By Ahmed Hagagy
KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah died on Tuesday aged 91, plunging his country into mourning for a leader regarded by many Gulf Arabs as a savvy diplomatic operator and a humanitarian champion.
The cabinet announced his brother and designated successor Crown Prince Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah as the new ruler in a statement read on state television. The parliamentary speaker tweeted that Sheikh Nawaf, 83, would be sworn in on Wednesday.
Sheikh Sabah had ruled the wealthy oil producer and U.S. ally since 2006, and steered its foreign policy for more than 50 years.
""With hearts filled with pain and sadness for the Kuwaiti people, the Islamic and Arab world and nations of the world, and with faith in the will of God, the cabinet mourns ... Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah who died in the United States on Tuesday,"" the statement said.
The emir's body will arrive on Wednesday in Kuwait from the United States, where he had been in hospital since July following surgery in Kuwait that month, state media reported on Tuesday, citing the Amiri Diwan.
The minister of the Amiri Diwan said on Tuesday that in compliance with safety and public health requirements, the burial ceremony for the deceased emir will be limited to relatives only, state media reported.
Flags were flying at half-staff in Kuwait, which announced 40 days of mourning. ""Goodbye, Emir of Humanity,"" read a large banner on a street near the Kuwait Stock Exchange. Kuwait Towers, a seaside landmark normally lit at night, went dark. 
Condolences poured in from Arab leaders and several countries in the region announced mourning periods.
Sheikh Sabah sought to balance relations with Kuwait's bigger neighbours - forging close ties with Saudi Arabia, rebuilding links with former occupier Iraq and keeping open dialogue with Iran. 
He tried to mediate in a Gulf dispute in which Riyadh and its allies imposed a boycott on Qatar, and made fundraising for humanitarian aid in Syria one of Kuwait's priorities.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in an Arabic-language tweet, lauded Sheikh Sabah for fostering ""moderation and balance"" in Kuwait and the region.
""Today we lost a big brother and a wise and loving leader ... who spared no effort for Arab unity,"" said Jordan's King Abdullah, also on Twitter.
​Sheikh Sabah kept strong ties with the United States, which led a coalition that ended Iraq's 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait and used the Gulf state as a launch pad for the 2003 Iraq invasion.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in a statement he was saddened by the death of a dear friend and called Sheikh Sabah an ""unwavering friend and partner to the United States"".
Trump earlier this month awarded the U.S. Legion of Merit, Degree Chief Commander, to Sheikh Sabah in what the White House said was the first time the honour has been given since 1991. The emir's eldest son, Sheikh Nasser, accepted the award.
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised the emir as ""an extraordinary symbol of wisdom and generosity, a messenger of peace, a bridge builder.""
SMOOTH SUCCESSION
The Kuwaiti dinar fell against the dollar in the forward market on Tuesday and Kuwaiti stocks plunged, ahead of the official announcement of the emir's death.
Under Kuwait's constitution, the crown prince automatically becomes emir but assumes power only after taking an oath in parliament, for which elections are due this year.
""I don't see a major change in foreign policy under the new emir, largely because Kuwaiti foreign policy is pretty popular domestically and regionally and is seen as effective,"" Courtney Freer, research fellow at LSE Middle East Centre, told Reuters. 
The succession is not expected to affect oil policy or foreign investment strategy through the Kuwait Investment Authority, one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds. 
The new emir's choice of crown prince and premier - who would be tasked with managing the government's often difficult relationship with parliament - will be watched closely.
""The new Emir will accede to the throne facing several tough challenges, including the coronavirus crisis, low oil prices, and delicate foreign politics,"" London-based Capital Economics said in a research note. 
An immediate priority would be a long-awaited debt law allowing Kuwait to tap global markets to finance a budget deficit, it said. Parliament, which analysts say has posed an obstacle to reform efforts, has repeatedly rejected the law. 

Although most political power in Kuwait is in the hands of the emir, its parliament is one of the most influential elected bodies among Gulf monarchies.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - When recently returned New Zealander Lara Barclay talked to fellow Kiwi expatriates in Australia, it was her country's success in tackling coronavirus that came up again and again and the crisis role of prime minister Jacinda Ardern.
Support from New Zealand's million-strong diaspora -- equal to a fifth of the country's resident population -- could prove a surprise boost for Ardern as the Labour Party leader seeks re-election at an Oct. 17 poll.
""They thought New Zealand's response was fantastic,"" said Barclay, a victim support worker. ""Every New Zealander I knew in Australia bar one ... were super impressed by New Zealand's response and by Jacinda.""
Labour is widely expected to retain power next month and hopes to rule without the support of a coalition partner, although the opposition National Party has been clawing back support in recent polls.
Overseas polling began on Wednesday, but a big unknown is how many expatriates will actually vote.
Just 10% of eligible overseas voters cast their vote in the last election in 2017, but analysts say Ardern's global profile from her promotion of issues such as social justice and equality, may draw more support.
""Ardern's got on to the front pages of world media and has been covered in way that no other New Zealand prime minister has been before,"" said Geoffrey Miller, analyst at the political website Democracy Project. 
""It wouldn't be a surprise if more New Zealanders living overseas decide to vote for Ardern, or may be just decide to vote in general,"" he said.
Tough restrictions to contain coronavirus limited New Zealand's total cases to less than 1,500 and just 25 deaths, far fewer than other developed nations, and the virus is largely contained.
The quick crisis response follows plaudits for 40-year-old Ardern's compassionate and inclusive response to an attack by a white supremacist at two mosques as well as a fatal volcanic eruption.
She is even tipped as a front runner to win the Nobel Peace prize, according to a UK betting agency. 
DOMESTIC DIFFICULTIES
Ardern won't have it all her own way. Analysts say Labour has largely failed on its big ticket policy promises like providing affordable housing, reforming tax and building key infrastructure. 
She faces National Party leader Judith Collins, known as ""Crusher Collins' for her tough-talking personality, who took over as leader in July.
Collins, 61, is a seasoned politician well known to the electorate, who is mostly associated with issues such as law and order, and infrastructure.
She has made efforts to connect more strongly with the farming community, but her appeal remains local while Ardern is known for how she portrays New Zealand to the world, said Richard Shaw, of Massey University.
""Ardern has turned that feeling right up to maximum volume, while Collins does not get any play in that space,"" Shaw said.
About 67,000 New Zealand voters have so far enrolled overseas, election officials said. This compares with about 61,000 who voted in the 2017 election, out of about 2.6 million votes in total. 
Voters still have until mid-October to register and referendums on legalising cannabis and euthanasia could encourage more to take part. The majority of those enrolled are in Australia, at nearly 60%, followed by the UK at 17% and more than 6% in the United States.
With the latest polls showing support for Labour at 47%, Ardern has urged New Zealanders in Australia to vote.
""Every single vote counts, including those Kiwis in Australia,"" she told broadcaster Channel Nine. ""They're almost the equivalent to a seat.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese journalist whose home was raided as part of an Australian anti-interference investigation in June said the action was unfounded and ""baseless"", in a detailed account released by Chinese media late on Tuesday.
China announced earlier this month that four journalists were subject to raids by Australian intelligence and police as part of a broader investigation into an alleged plot to influence an Australian state politician.
The Chinese journalist, Yang Jingzhong, who was the Sydney bureau chief of state news agency Xinhua, said Australian authorities raided his home at 6:30 a.m. on June 26 and conducted a seven-hour search, confiscating a number of electronic devices and documents. 
""I was shocked, but I quickly calmed down because I knew I had not violated any laws. However, my daughter had never experienced such a scene and was very frightened,"" said Yang, describing the scene. 
The raids were carried out on the same day as a raid on the office of Shaoquett Moselmane, the Australian politician allegedly targeted by foreign interference efforts.
Australian Federal Police declined to comment, and the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) did not respond to a request for comment. 
The Chinese journalist's account borrows heavily from an earlier response to the raids released by China's foreign ministry, which said that Australia had not given a reasonable explanation for the investigation.
Beijing earlier confirmed that all four journalists have returned to China.
The account comes amid a broader debate in some western countries over the overseas activities of Chinese state media, which put an emphasis on promoting China's image abroad, and amid deepening diplomatic tensions between Beijing and Canberra.
In the past year, the United States has required U.S.-based staff of China's top state media outlets, including Xinhua, CGTN and the People's Daily, to register as ""foreign agents"".
""I have always put the promotion of friendship and cooperation between China and Australia as the focus of my work,"" said the Xinhua's Yang, adding that most of his work involved reporting on ""cultural and economic exchanges between China and Australia"".
News of the raids targeting Chinese journalists was released by Beijing shortly after two Australian journalists were evacuated from China earlier this month, in a tense diplomatic standoff between Beijing and Australian embassy officials.
The Australian journalists were questioned by Chinese police prior to their departure in relation to the case of Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist with Beijing's state-run CGTN news channel detained in China in August.
The questioning of the Australian journalists has been widely interpreted as a tit-for-tat response to the raid on Chinese journalists in Canberra, though the China's foreign ministry has denied they are linked.

KABUL (Reuters) - Eighteen-year old Fatima Sultani gazes at the peak of a mountain near Afghanistan's capital Kabul after completing a morning climbing session, considering her next challenge. 
She and her team of nine young Afghan mountaineers, including three women, are hoping to climb Afghanistan's Mir Samir mountain and after that travel to Nepal to summit the world's highest peak, Mount Everest.
""My main goal is to show the world that Afghan women are strong and can do the most challenging work that men do,"" she told Reuters. ""When I became aware that women from foreign countries come here to conquer high peaks I thought ... why can't we Afghan women conquer these peaks?""
Sultani has continued climbing throughout the coronavirus pandemic, in August making it to the summit of the 7,492 metre (24,580 feet) Noshakh Peak in the Hindu Kush mountain range in northern Afghanistan, becoming the youngest woman in the world to do so.
But as the Islamist Taliban hold peace talks with the Afghan government in Doha, many women in Afghanistan worry the militant group may exert its influence through formal political channels.
When the Taliban ruled the country between 1996 and 2001, they banned education for females and barred women from leaving the house without a male relative.
The group says it has changed but many women remain sceptical.
""When I got into sports, I knew that I would face some problems in the future, for example, one of the issues was that maybe the Taliban would hinder sport for women, but still I'm ready to face the challenge,"" Fatima said.
When she's not training in the mountains, Fatima lives in Kabul with her parents, younger sister and cat. Her father said he will continue to celebrate Fatima's achievements but has lingering concerns about her safety.

""I am worried about this, (the Taliban) oppose women's sports,"" Abdul Wahed Sultani said. ""(But) I told Fatima that you are free to do whatever sport you want to, even mountaineering, and I will support her as much as I can.""

The Darien Gap, a stretch of jungle bridging Colombia and Panama next to the Caribbean Sea, has become one of the most important routes for illegally trafficking migrants - mainly Africans, Cubans and Haitians - who try to reach the United States by passing through Central America.
""The Haitian migrants were transported illegally in a motor vessel bound for Panama. However, during the journey the boat's engines presented technical failures, leaving 61 adults and 33 minors adrift, abandoned at sea,"" the navy said in a statement.
The vessel was assisted by a fishing boat that towed it to a port near the municipality of Acandi in Colombia's Choco province. The navy later coordinated the migrants' transfer to the city of Turbo, in Antioquia province, where they were left in the hands of the Andean country's migration agency. 
So far in 2020, Colombia has deported more than 3,800 undocumented immigrants, including over 3,000 Haitians, according to migration authorities. 
As well as Haitians, Colombian authorities regularly detain Cuban, African and Asian undocumented migrants who hope to reach the United States with the support of dedicated human-trafficking networks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Japan, Mongolia and South Korea next week, the State Department announced on Tuesday, a crucial visit to solidify ties with the regional allies at a time when Washington's relationship with China remains fraught.
The visit is scheduled to take place Oct. 4 to 8 and will be Pompeo's first time in East Asia since his trip to Thailand in July 2019. After flying to Japan, he will visit Mongolia on Oct. 6 and South Korea on Oct. 7 and 8, the State Department said.
As part of the trip on Oct. 6, Pompeo will participate in the second meeting of ""Quad,"" a gathering of foreign ministers from India, Australia and Japan. The Quad engagement was revived in 2017 to deepen security cooperation and coordinate alternatives for regional infrastructure financing offered by China.
Ties between China and the United States are at the lowest point in decades, with the world's top two economies at loggerheads over issues ranging from China's handling of the coronavirus to trade rivalries, new national security legislation in Hong Kong and tensions in the South China Sea.
Pompeo's trip comes in the run-up to the November election, with President Donald Trump making a tough approach to China an important foreign policy platform as he seeks a second term in office.

A forceful and outspoken critic of China, Pompeo met Beijing's top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, at a U.S. military base in Hawaii in June, but little progress was made and the ties continued to deteriorate.

(Reuters) - New York City on Tuesday said it would fine anyone caught in public without a mask, and the Walt  Disney  Co announced plans to lay off some 28,000 employees as its resorts struggle with plunging numbers of visitors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
More than 205,000 people have died in the United States and nearly 7.2 million people have been infected since the pandemic began, according to a Reuters tally.
At Disney (N:DIS), about two-thirds of the employees facing layoffs are part-time workers, the company said in a statement. 
""We have made the very difficult decision to begin the process of reducing our workforce at our Parks, Experiences and Products segment at all levels,"" Josh D'Amaro, chairman of Disney's parks unit, said in a statement.
In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will fine people up to $1,000 for refusing to wear a mask in public, as the rate of positive tests for the novel coronavirus climbed above 3% for the first time in months.
""We don't want to fine people, but if we have to, we will,"" de Blasio said. City police and health department officials, among others, will enforce the fines, he said.
City officials will first offer free masks to those caught not wearing one in public. If the person refuses, they will face an unspecified fine, de Blasio told reporters. 
A similar policy was imposed earlier this month by the state-controlled Metropolitan Transportation Authority under which commuters who refuse to wear a mask on public transit face a $50 fine. 
The mayor blamed the recent rise in part on nine ZIP codes out of 146 that city health officials say have seen a worrying uptick in cases, including several tight-knit Hasidic Jewish communities, and warned that some areas could be ordered to close businesses or schools if the numbers do not improve. 
NYC SCHOOLS COULD CLOSE AGAIN
De Blasio's announcement came as many elementary school students returned to public schools for the first time on Tuesday, an effort to provide a mix of in-person and virtual learning that had twice been delayed amid opposition by teachers unions.
The city has said it will shut schools again if the seven-day average reaches 3% or more.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday raised the possibility of stopping indoor dining again or reimposing other economic restrictions. 
""I don't believe we're at the point of rolling back anything,"" he said at a news conference. ""If the local governments do not do the compliance and attack the clusters, you will be there in the short-term future.""
Cuomo, who has feuded with de Blasio over who has authority to impose or loosen containment measures, said he would meet this week with leaders of Orthodox Jewish communities in Brooklyn as well as Nassau, Orange and Rockland counties, where infections have also ticked up. 
Beyond New York state, 28 other states were seeing upticks in new coronavirus infections over the past two weeks, and COVID-19 hospitalizations were on the rise in several Midwestern states.
Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wisconsin have all reported record numbers of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in the past seven days. On Monday, North Dakota reported 105 hospitalizations and Wisconsin 640.

The Tennessee Titans and Minnesota Vikings professional football teams suspended activities after some members of the Titans tested positive for COVID-19 following a game on Sunday, according to statements from the National Football League and the teams.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has discovered unspecified ""faults"" in its anti-epidemic measures, state media said on Wednesday, amid controversy over the death of a South Korean man whom Pyongyang said was killed to prevent the coronavirus. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un convened a meeting of the ruling Worker's Party's powerful politburo on Tuesday to review its anti-COVID-19 measures and discuss ways to improve them, the official KCNA news agency said. 
The gathering came after a South Korean fisheries official was shot dead by North Korean soldiers at sea last week, a major incident that shocked many South Koreans.
Seoul has accused the soldiers of setting the man's body on fire after killing him, while Pyongyang said they only burned a flotation device he was using, in order to stave off any risk of coronavirus infections. 
At the politburo meeting, participants said ""some faults"" have been found during the implementation of virus prevention measures, KCNA said, without elaborating.
""The meeting stressed the need to strictly guard against self-complacency, carelessness, irresponsibility and slackness in the anti-epidemic field,"" KCNA said. 
""It also called for successfully maintaining a steel-strong anti-epidemic system and order."" 
KCNA said the meeting also discussed unspecified organisational issues and preparations for the party's 75th founding anniversary on Oct. 10, a major holiday that North Korea usually celebrates with a massive military parade.

Speaking in a video to the United Nations General Assembly, pre-recorded due to the coronavirus pandemic, Netanyahu warned the depot in the Jnah neighbourhood was ""where the next explosion could take place"".
Lebanon has been pushed to breaking point by a financial meltdown and a massive August blast at Beirut port that killed nearly 200 people. Authorities have said highly explosive ammonium nitrate detonated after being kept in poor storage for years. Hezbollah has denied any involvement.
""I say to the people of Jnah ... You've got to protest this. Because if this thing explodes, it's another tragedy,"" Netanyahu said. ""Iran and Hezbollah have deliberately put you and your families in grave danger... You should tell them, tear these depots down."" 
A photo displayed by Netanyahu during his speech, purporting to show the entrance to a missile factory, was taken on the ground in Beirut, suggesting an Israeli intelligence asset provided it.
Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah denied the existence of missile sites on Tuesday, accusing Netanyahu of trying to provoke Lebanese against the Shi'ite movement.
Shortly after Netanyahu's speech, Hezbollah's media centre took a large group of journalists on a tour of what it said was the site, on a crowded residential street in Jnah. In the building, described by Hezbollah as a factory, there were machines used to cut metal and some gas cylinders. 
""There's not a speck of what Netanyahu said in this factory. This is a private factory that makes metal pieces, with laser cutting machines and such, that's all,"" said Mohammad Rammal, who said he runs the factory. ""These are lies, what more can I say?"" 
Heavily armed Hezbollah and Israel last fought a month-long war in 2006.
Speaking later on Tuesday to the General Assembly, Iranian diplomat Mohammad Reza Sahraei denied what he called Netanyahu's ""baseless and unfounded allegations.""

The Israeli military said in a statement it had reported the site, and others ""numerous times, both to the U.N. and additional diplomatic networks, as well as via various media channels."" It urged the Lebanese government to intervene.

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Venezuelan father waiting in Mexico to plead his U.S. asylum case who has yet to meet his newborn daughter. An Iraqi refugee stuck in Jordan despite his past helping U.S. soldiers. A mother sent back to Honduras after being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border from her two young children. A Malian package courier deported after three decades in the United States. And an Iranian couple kept apart for years under a U.S. travel ban.
They have all experienced first-hand the effects of Republican President Donald Trump's signature domestic policy goal in his nearly four years in office - the overhaul of the U.S. immigration system. A multitude of new bureaucratic hurdles to entering or staying in the United States have upended the lives of hundreds of thousands of people around the world.
Trump says the changes were necessary to fix an immigration system he has characterized as broken and riddled with loopholes. As he campaigns for a second term, immigration is once again a key plank of his platform.
While immigrants have faced hurdles settling in the United States for generations and illegal immigration has bedeviled both Republican and Democratic administrations, critics contend no recent administration has moved faster and more aggressively to carry out a restrictive immigration agenda. 
Now, many immigrants are in a new phase of uncertainty, waiting to see who will win the November presidential election - Trump, or his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. Trump plans to expand and solidify his changes to the immigration system in a second term, while Biden has vowed to undo many of them if he wins.
But the sheer number of new policies mean that many people waiting in limbo are affected by not only one new Trump measure but several layered on top of each other. Many families have been waiting years to resolve their immigration cases, and regardless of what happens in the election those waits are likely to drag out further. 
""A lot of people have it in their mind that a Biden administration would come in and reverse everything,"" said Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington-based think tank, but ""a lot of the policy changes were layered with the intent of making them difficult to walk back.""
""It would be impossible for a new administration to undo everything because there is so much to do,"" Pierce said. ""People's lives have already been altered.""
Here are the stories of some of them.
DREAMS FADE AFTER TRAVEL BAN
Masoud Abdi hasn't seen his wife Shima Montakhabi since Feb. 1, 2017.
Days earlier, in one of his first acts as president, Donald Trump barred most people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from coming to the United States, citing the need to protect the country from ""terrorist activities by foreign nationals.""
The couple, who met and married in Iran, were living in Tehran and waiting for Montakhabi's visa to be approved when the ban was announced. Abdi, who is a U.S. permanent resident, had a permit that allowed him to spend up to two years outside the United States without losing that status.
But when he saw the news about the ban he panicked. While permanent residents were eventually declared unaffected, in the fog of those first few days Abdi was taking no chances.
He returned to the United States and has not left since, fearing further restrictions that could put his green card and pending U.S. naturalization application at risk. Montakhabi, a pharmaceutical researcher, remained in Iran, her visa application pending.
A physician in Iran, Abdi first came to the United States in 2010 after winning a green card through the diversity lottery. That program - which Trump has criticized - aims to accept immigrants from countries that are not normally awarded many visas. 
When he and Montakhabi applied for her visa in late 2015, they had hoped to be starting a family in Champaign, Illinois within a couple of years at most. Now, they are both in their forties and that dream is beginning to fade. 
The couple try to speak every few hours, Abdi said. But sometimes the internet doesn't work in Iran and they can't communicate for several days. When this happens, Abdi said, his depression worsens. ""Talking to her is all that gives me motivation for living,"" he said.
The U.S. Supreme Court allowed a revised version of the travel ban to take effect in December 2017. It has since been expanded to additional countries. 
Through August 2020, more than 41,000 people seeking immigrant and non-immigrant visas have been affected by the ban, according to the State Department. The issuance of immigrant visas to Iranians dropped almost 80% from fiscal year 2016 to 2019, State Department data shows. 
Biden has said he would lift the travel ban if he is elected. But Abdi and Montakhabi are affected by other policy changes, too. 
As he waits in Illinois, Abdi says he cannot afford to reduce his hours as a clinical researcher. A more stringent wealth requirement for people sponsoring their relatives to join them in the United States and a separate proclamation requiring new immigrants to have sufficient funds to cover healthcare costs worry Abdi, who fears Montakhabi may be barred if his earnings were to drop. Those measures are being challenged in court, but in the meantime, Abdi has less time to pursue his U.S. medical license.
Another new ban also affects the couple. The administration stopped issuing almost all new family-based green cards in April 2020 until the end of the year, saying the move would protect American jobs amid the pandemic. Spouses of U.S. citizens are exempt, but Abdi is still waiting for naturalization. Under Trump, naturalization processing times have nearly doubled, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).
""This is not the America of my childhood, the land of opportunity,"" he said. ""It's not a land of opportunity for me. I'm stuck here and my wife is stuck in Iran.""
The State Department said it could not comment on individual visa cases.
SEPARATED, NEVER REUNITED
Maynor tries to keep everyone's spirits up. He is good at it - a skill he has honed as a street vendor hustling to sell oranges in California to make enough money to feed himself and his two young sisters. But it's hard when his mother, Maria, who lives in Honduras, calls to talk to her children and just cries.
""I tell her she has to try to motivate them,"" Maynor, 32, said of his sisters. ""But they start crying when they hear her cry.""
The last time the sisters saw their mother was almost three years ago, when Michelle was 8 years old and Nicole just 3 and still breastfeeding. The family is not being identified with their last name because the girls are minors and their attorney is concerned about hurting their ongoing U.S. immigration case.
Maria and her daughters were caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border near San Luis, Arizona, in December 2017, at a time when the Trump administration was rolling out what would become one of its most controversial policies - a crackdown on illegal crossings that led to thousands of migrant family separations.
After a few days in detention, a border agent came to take the girls away, Maria said. The 3-year-old grabbed on tight to her mother and they all sobbed, she recalled. Maria was bussed to an adult detention center and didn't know where her daughters were for nearly two weeks.
""That whole time period is just a blank,"" Maria said. ""I didn't want to bathe, or do anything. I wanted to die.""
She was eventually told by U.S. officials that her daughters had been sent to a shelter in California near where their brother Maynor lived.
Maria had been deported previously after trying to cross into the United States years earlier. During her three months in detention, Maria says she was told by an attorney her only option was deportation: either with her children or alone. 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) confirmed the dates of her deportation in 2009 and the separation from her children and subsequent deportation in 2018. The Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement, which houses migrant children, said it could not comment on the cases of her daughters due to privacy concerns.
Maria said she fled Honduras after gang members threatened Michelle, and the idea of her daughters returning to one of the most violent countries in Central America made her panic. 
""They gave me no real choice,"" she said in a telephone interview from Honduras. ""I went back totally destroyed."" 
More than 2,700 families were separated between when Trump officially announced a 'zero tolerance' policy to prosecute all illegal border crossers in May 2018 and its abrupt reversal months later in the face of an international outcry.
But the Department of Health and Human Services inspector general said thousands of children were separated both before and after that period. Some parents were separated from their children because they were being criminally charged for illegally crossing the border, others over questions about their identities or previous records, according to court filings.
The girls went to stay with Maynor, who was living with his girlfriend and his newborn at the time. But his girlfriend told him she didn't want the extra burden of caring for his sisters, so kicked Maynor and the girls out, he said.
""There was a time when Nicole would close herself in her room, she wouldn't eat or come out. The babysitter would call me and I would have to leave work to console her. That would happen almost every day,"" said Maynor. 
Now the girls may try to apply for asylum or a form of relief known as Special Immigrant Juvenile status, or SIJ. But a series of changes put in place by the Trump administration has made that process more difficult. Trump's attorneys general have issued rulings to narrow who is eligible for asylum based on claims of gang violence, for example, and increased their scrutiny of SIJ cases. 
Maria works cleaning houses and still sees the gang members who she said threatened her daughter. She breaks down every time she talks about being apart from her children.
""Even if they told me I could see them once a year, on a particular date, I would go and leave again,"" Maria said. ""I would do anything, just to see them again.""
A FATHER TRAPPED, YET TO MEET HIS BABY
In May, Landys Aguirre's 2-month-old daughter was admitted to an intensive care unit in Chicago with a high fever. He could see, in photos and grainy videos his wife Karla Anez sent him, that the baby's face, arms and legs were swollen.
Aguirre, alone 1,500 miles (2,400 km) away in a hotel room in Mexico under a signature Trump administration program meant to deter migration, began to sob, wishing he could be there to comfort Anez and their daughter, whom he had yet to meet.
The couple fled Venezuela in 2019 to seek political asylum as supporters of an opposition party. Aguirre said he had been kidnapped and tortured by pro-government groups. The pair presented themselves at a U.S. port of entry with copies of a forensic exam and photographic evidence of Aguirre's torture. Reuters reviewed the documents but could not independently confirm Aguirre's claims of persecution.
Aguirre said he never got a chance to present the documents to an asylum officer.
Instead, he was ordered to wait in Mexico for a U.S. court hearing under the Trump administration program known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) put in place in January 2019, which has sent tens of thousands of asylum seekers to wait in Mexican border towns. The administration said the program discourages ""false asylum claims.""
U.S. border officials make case-by-case determinations of who is placed in the program. Anez, five months pregnant at the time, was allowed in to fight her asylum case. She headed to Chicago to join her mother, who had arrived two years earlier.
She sent Aguirre pictures as she grew more heavily pregnant and when she gave birth in March. In May, when his daughter fell ill and he feared she might die, he considered swimming across the Rio Grande - the river that marks the border between the United States and Mexico - but decided against it.
He felt his asylum case was strong and he did not want to jeopardize it. After more than a week in hospital, the baby recovered.
""It's maddening, cruel, harsh and painful to be here in Mexico alone, with no help, in danger and missing my wife and my daughter, who I haven't met,"" Aguirre said.
""I presented myself voluntarily at a port of entry to ask for asylum, not so they could send me to Mexico like a criminal when I am a professional with two degrees fleeing political persecution.""
U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it could not comment on individual cases due to privacy concerns. 
Biden has pledged to end the program if he wins in November. But it is not clear what the fate of those now stuck in the program would be. Many are living in tent camps, shelters and rented rooms in dangerous neighborhoods in Mexico, risking kidnappings and extortion.
Anez and Aguirre's chances for U.S. protection also hinge on the fate of another Trump rule, one that barred asylum for almost anyone who transited through a third country and did not seek refuge elsewhere first. It was struck down in federal court and is now on hold, but that ruling could still be overturned by the Supreme Court.
And Anez, applying for asylum, could face new barriers to the issuance of a work permit and other limits proposed in new rules.
Aguirre remains in a hotel in Reynosa - one of the most violent cities in Mexico - as he waits for his asylum hearing date. Originally set for April 6, it has been delayed four times due to the pandemic.
It is now scheduled for November.
DEPORTED AFTER THREE DECADES 
Ibrahima Keita was walking to his car ahead of his morning school run in the suburbs of Cincinnati on May 22, 2018, when two immigration agents pulled up and arrested him for being in the country illegally.
Keita asked if he could take his sons to school first, since his wife, Neissa Kone, did not have a driver's license. The agents told him that was not possible. They did, however, knock on the door to tell his wife and sons what was happening.
His sons, Abdul, then 5 years old, and Solomon, then 7, burst into tears. Kone fell to her knees, pleading with the ICE agents not to take her husband, she said. 
Keita, 61, originally from Mali, had been in the United States since 1990. 
Fleeing a dictatorship, he crossed illegally into the United States from Canada and applied for asylum. Seven years later, at a court date to plead his case, his lawyer never arrived, he said. Not knowing he was allowed to attend the hearing alone, he waited outside the courthouse for hours. The judge ordered him deported from the United States for not showing up, according to court documents seen by Reuters.
Mali would not issue Keita travel documents, so he stayed. In 2008, ICE put Keita, who has no criminal record, on an 'order of supervision,' which allowed him to work in the United States as long as he regularly checked in. ICE confirmed the dates of Keita's removal order and his subsequent supervision order. 
During his later years in office, former Democratic President Barack Obama focused on deporting immigrants with criminal records, but Trump shifted that focus in an executive order on Jan. 25, 2017 so that no immigration violators would be spared automatically from enforcement. 
ICE said in a statement that the implementation memo that accompanied the executive order made clear that the agency would no longer exempt ""classes or categories"" of immigrants from enforcement and anyone ""in violation of the immigration laws may be subject to immigration arrest, detention and, if found removable by final order, removal from the United States.""
The administration also said it would ramp up pressure on countries that had been uncooperative in accepting deportees.
In fiscal year 2016, the last of the Obama administration, around 14% of immigrants arrested by ICE had no criminal convictions. That percentage rose to more than 35% of all ICE arrests in 2019, according to government data. 
After a year in detention, ICE chartered a plane in May 2019 and sent Keita to Bamako, Mali's capital. ICE said Keita failed to cooperate with a removal via commercial aircraft in 2018. Keita said he was doing everything he could to try to fight his deportation.
For the family, following him was not an option because Solomon, the oldest boy, has sickle cell anemia, a rare blood disorder that requires specialized care, not easily available in Mali.
After their father's deportation, Solomon internalized his grief while his younger brother Abdul ""let it all out,"" Kone, 48, said. He cried in a way she had never heard him cry before ""as if someone had died."" He started cutting himself.
Keita calls them three to four times a day, Kone said, and tells them to stay hopeful. He lives in a small apartment near his parents, aged 88 and 92, in Bamako. Kone reads the news and worries: Mali's president was recently ousted in a military coup, potentially further destabilizing the West African nation.
Keita was the family's breadwinner when he worked as a package courier in Ohio. Kone, who is also from Mali and overstayed a tourist visa 20 years ago, does not have permission to work and after their savings ran out could no longer afford to pay rent. She and the boys moved to accommodation provided by a church, then to a hotel under a local effort to house homeless people in hotel rooms to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. 
She said she hopes that a Biden win will make ""everything normal"" again. But seeking the repatriation of someone who has already been deported would require an order from a judge to reopen the case, a complicated legal process, immigration attorneys said.
""We never asked for help. We had a good life, a nice house in the suburbs, he worked so hard,"" Kone said. ""Now everything is upside down.""
LEFT STRANDED AFTER HELPING U.S. SOLDIERS 
In Iraq, Amer Hamdani worked for U.S. military contractors, providing security support for American installations. Now, he often struggles to feed his family as he waits in Jordan to gain entry to the United States as a refugee.
The 44-year-old's former job made him a high priority for resettlement under a special program for Iraqis at risk because of their association with the U.S. government since the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.
He said he fled with his wife and three children in 2014 after friends told him that his name was on an assassination list of people who had worked with U.S. companies, compiled by followers of populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. 
While he awaits a decision on his application for refugee status in the United States, he does not have permission to work in Jordan. He has relied on money that his brother has sent from Texas.
""The situation is miserable,"" he said. He lives on the outskirts of the capital Amman. ""I didn't think the U.S. would abandon us like this,"" he said.
Due to the U.S. involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, demand for the special program Hamdani applied for dramatically expanded, leading to backlogs under previous administrations, refugee experts said.
Hamdani had already submitted his application when Trump won the presidency. But after Trump took office in January 2017 the administration began dramatically slashing the size of the refugee program.
In the 2020 fiscal year, the United States said just 18,000 refugees would be allowed in, the lowest level since the modern refugee resettlement program began in 1980. While 4,000 of those spots were carved out for Iraqis who supported U.S. interests, only 118 people in that category had been admitted as of mid-September. 
In addition, 11 countries, including Iraq, faced new, extra levels of vetting. Admissions for those countries slowed to a trickle.
Now U.S. officials are weighing whether to postpone or further cut refugee admissions in the coming year, throwing Hamdani's application, which had been cleared for travel in early 2020, further into doubt.
Resettlement organizations say that while refugee applications can take many years, the delays faced by refugees from the countries selected for extra vetting have grown significantly.
In fiscal year 2016, before Trump was elected, the United States admitted 9,880 refugees from Iraq. That dropped to 144 just two years later in 2018 and 465 in the 2019 fiscal year, according to government data.
The State Department said it could not comment on specific cases but that the ""steep decline"" and increased processing times for Iraqis who helped U.S. forces is ""due to ongoing security conditions in Iraq and travel limitations due to COVID-19."" 
As the number of refugees overall has dropped, the proportion of Muslim refugees compared to Christians has also declined, according to an analysis of government data shared with Reuters. In fiscal year 2017, 43% of the 53,716 admitted refugees were Muslim while 44% were Christian. In fiscal year 2020 through mid-August, 71% of the 8,310 refugees allowed were Christian and just 21% were Muslim, the data showed.
Biden's campaign has pledged to admit 125,000 refugees a year if he is elected. But the dramatic downsizing of the program could lead to longer-term backlogs even if the cap is quickly lifted.
With fewer people coming in each year under Trump, offices run by nonprofits and funded by the government that help arriving refugees have closed around the country.
Reopening them may not always be possible, resettlement organizations say, leaving new refugees with fewer services.
The Trump administration also signed an executive order mandating that local governments would have to consent to resettlement in their communities. 
The measure was challenged and blocked by a court but Texas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott was the first statewide elected official to say he did not want to welcome refugees before the judge's ruling.

Hamdani is waiting to join his brother near Dallas, Texas.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Syrian tycoon Rami Makhlouf, a cousin and long-time ally of President Bashar al-Assad, appealed on Tuesday to his relative to stop what he described as security forces dismantling charities that served the poor among loyalists in Syria's civil war. 
Rami Makhlouf, once widely considered part of the president’s inner circle and Syria's leading businessman, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that a lifeline was being cut that supported thousands of war veterans and families of pro-Assad militia members backing the army in the decade-long conflict.
Makhlouf accused the powerful security forces of abetting the stripping of assets from charities owned by his holding company, Ramak Development and Humanitarian Projects, and selling them to corrupt politically influential businessmen.
""They have turned to robbing these humanitarian bodies and its projects by selling their assets ..,"" Makhlouf said in his social media posting.
Syrian authorities were not immediately available for comment on Makhlouf's allegations.
Throughout the war that began in 2011, U.S.-sanctioned Makhlouf had helped Assad evade Western sanctions on fuel and other goods vital to his military campaign. He said this year he financed many of the militias that fought alongside the regular army.
""I sent a letter today to Assad to put in his hands this matter to help restore the rights to these poor who have only these charities and their projects to take care of them,"" Makhlouf said.
Since late April Makhlouf has taken to Facebook with messages and videos that have appeared to expose a rift https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2591C3 within the ruling Alawite elite over allegations by the Syrian government that Makhlouf has hidden money overseas.
The Syrian government has not commented on Makhlouf's allegations he was being politically targeted by the powerful security agencies. 
The businessman, who had helped bankroll the ruling family had companies that spanned telecoms, energy, real estate, banks and hotels, looms large over Syria’s economy.
The authorities stripped him of his ownership of Syriatel mobile operator. It has frozen his assets in leading firms and put a ban on his travel. 
The United States imposed sanctions on Makhlouf before the war for what Washington calls public corruption and exploiting his proximity to power to enrich himself “at the expense of ordinary Syrians.”

The American-born Meghan has urged people to promote positivity online and, with her husband Prince Harry, encouraged Americans to vote in the November presidential election. That prompted a backlash in some quarters because Britain's royal family do not traditionally venture into politics.
In response to a question at Fortune magazine's Most Powerful Women Summit, Meghan said she tried to be ""authentic"" in public comments and that her remarks often were misconstrued. 
""If you look back at anything that I've said, it's really interesting because what ends up being inflammatory, it seems, is people's interpretation of it,"" Meghan said. ""But if you listen to what I actually say, it's not controversial.""
On Tuesday, Meghan encouraged people to avoid clicking on misinformation online and to report comments that are untrue. 
""As we are just days away from this election period, we have got to all put our stock in something that is true,"" she said. ""And we all need to have reliable media news sources that are telling us the truth. Without that I don't know where it leaves us."" 
Harry and Meghan now live in Southern California after stepping down from their royal roles in March to forge new careers. They moved out of Britain after growing media hostility.

On Monday three children and two women were killed when two militia rockets hit a family home, the Iraqi military said. Police sources said Baghdad airport was the intended target.
The attack coincided with Iraqi officials and Western diplomats saying Washington has made preparations to withdraw diplomats https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26J1Z4 from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy. Any move by the United States to reduce its diplomatic presence in a country where it has thousands of troops would be seen in the region as an escalation of its confrontation with Iran, which Washington blames for missile and bomb attacks.
Iraqis fear their country could become a battleground in a proxy war.
""We have made the point before that the actions of lawless Iran-backed militias remains the single biggest deterrent to stability in Iraq,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
""We are outraged by yesterday’s rocket attack in Baghdad that killed civilians, including a mother and her children,"" she said.
Two Iraqi intelligence sources have suggested plans to withdraw American diplomats were not yet in motion, and would depend on whether Iraqi security forces were able to do a better job of halting attacks. They said they had received orders to prevent attacks on U.S. sites, and had been told that U.S. evacuations would begin only if that effort failed.

Rockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic compound, constructed to be the biggest U.S. embassy in the world in central Baghdad's so-called Green Zone during the U.S. occupation after invading in 2003.

TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's federal authorities and its two biggest provinces on Tuesday promised new measures to combat a second COVID-19 wave that is notching up as many cases as during the pandemic's peak in April.
Canada reported new 2,176 infections on Monday, taking the total to 155,301. The death toll rose by 10 to 9,278.
Government minister Dominic LeBlanc, who chairs the cabinet's coronavirus committee, called the surge ""very worrying"".
Ontario, the most populous of the 10 provinces, said it would limit visitors to long-term care homes for the elderly in areas with high community spread. Most deaths in Canada have taken place in homes for seniors.
In Quebec, the second most populous, premier Francois Legault said financial support for businesses hurt by new COVID-19 restrictions would be announced soon. The province is closing bars and dine-in services at restaurants in hot spots for 28 days.
""The situation is still critical,” Legault told reporters in Quebec City.
In Ottawa, health officials said they expected to authorize new antigen tests for COVID-19, which can provide rapid results outside of a lab. This should provide additional testing as the second wave overwhelms laboratories, they said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who last week said the government would provide C$440 million ($329 million) to a global program designed to ensure fair access to COVID-19 vaccines, on Tuesday said Canada was giving an additional C$400 million in humanitarian and development funding.
Separately on Tuesday, the federal government said it had signed an agreement up to buy 7.9 million Abbott (N:ABT) ID NOW rapid point of care tests, pending Health Canada approval.

The ID NOW is not an antigen test, but the instruments used to analyze it can be run outside of a major lab, giving rapid results at a clinic or hospital.

According to reports received by the Caracas-based Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict, over 100 protests have taken place since the weekend in 19 of Venezuela's 23 states to demand authorities provide water, power and fuel. 
The OPEC nation's collapsed oil industry is no longer able to supply Venezuelans with fuel for their cars, and years of mismanagement and corruption have left much of the infrastructure bringing power and water to homes in ruins.
A strict COVID-19 lockdown enforced by President Nicolas Maduro since March has further limited Venezuelans' movement and sources of income.
In the past, Caracas was the center of Venezuela's protest movements, but the government has prioritized fuel deliveries to gas stations in the capital, keeping its streets mostly calm. 
In the rest of the country, Venezuelans spend days queueing for gasoline that often never arrives.
""We're looking at a new wave of protests with the particularity that this time the protagonists are those living in Venezuela's villages and towns,"" Marco Ponce, the observatory's director, told an online press conference.
The Maduro administration has sent in security forces to repress the demonstrations, leading to at least 50 arrests, Ponce said.
Venezuela's police and military have been accused by the United Nations of carrying out widespread human rights abuses, including arbitrary arrests and extrajudicial killings.
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the observatory's report.
Starved of gasoline and crippled by U.S. sanctions, the Maduro government has turned to its ally Iran for help obtaining petroleum products. On Monday, the first of a group of three tankers arrived to deliver more Iranian fuel.
Ponce said this could temporarily quieten some demonstrations, but he expected they would continue as ""there are thousands of reasons for Venezuelans to keep protesting.""
An estimated five million Venezuelans have left the country in recent years - roughly a sixth of the population - as hyperinflation made food and medicine unaffordable, in the biggest migration in Latin America's modern history.

Rodrigo Tovar, better known by his alias Jorge 40, returned to Colombia on Monday from the United States and was immediately detained by authorities to face 1,486 investigative procedures. 
""He has been deported from the United States to comply with the judicial sentences, as well as the different arrest warrants and security measures that have been issued against him,"" the attorney general's office said in a statement late on Monday.
Tovar, 69, formed part of the far-right United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), the country's main paramilitary group. He is accused of involvement in murders, massacres, kidnappings, torture, forced disappearances and mass displacements committed as the group battled left-wing guerrillas.
There are 65 arrest warrants and 109 detention orders against Tovar, who was expelled from a special justice tribunal dealing with crimes committed during the conflict due to his reluctance to collaborate with authorities.
Tovar demobilized in 2006 alongside thousands of other paramilitaries. He faces a maximum of 60 years in jail, judicial sources said.
Colombia is also awaiting the deportation from the United States of Salvatore Mancuso, another former AUC leader who is accused of war crimes and violating human rights.

Police said they did not have details of any arrests. A government spokesman was not immediately available to comment.
The detentions and charges were reported by the All Burma Federation of Students Unions (ABFSU), which represents the interests of students across the country, as well as campaign group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) and New York-based Human Rights Watch.
The ABFSU and HRW identified some of the students who had been arrested and Reuters saw four of those they named appear in court on Monday.
The ABFSU was at the forefront of pro-democracy protests that paved the way for the first civilian government in half a century coming to power and the arrests of its members come weeks before a Nov. 8 election that it has urged Myanmar citizens to boycott.
As part of a campaign which began in early September, leaflets containing slogans such as ""dictatorship must fail"" and ""oppose murderous fascism"" were distributed by students in towns and cities across the country. They also urged authorities to restore internet in the western state of Rakhine, where access has been curbed as troops battle ethnic insurgents seeking greater autonomy. 
The ABFSU said the 14 students had been detained in raids on their homes or university campus since mid-September and later charged and that about a dozen others were in hiding.
""All we want is a country which values basic human rights and democratic standards,"" a 21-year-old student among those in hiding told Reuters by phone. 
An officer at a police station in Mandalay, where the four students appeared in court on Monday, referred questions to a superior, who was not available for comment. Police in Meiktila and Pyay townships, where campaigners said students were detained, told Reuters by phone they had no details.
The conflict in Rakhine has displaced tens of thousands of people and killed dozens since it flared in early 2019. The United Nations human rights chief has said civilians had been targeted or attacked indiscriminately in abuses that may amount to war crimes, accusations Myanmar denies.
The campaign groups said some of the students were charged under Sections 505(a) and (b) of the Penal Code on causing public alarm, which carry a maximum two-year prison sentence. Others were charged with unlawful protest, which carries a three month sentence.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese leaders have criticised U.S. ambassador George Glass after he said they must choose between the United States and China or risk the consequences. 
Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa told reporters on Monday: ""In Portugal it is the representatives chosen by the Portuguese and they alone who decide on their destiny, respecting the constitution and the rights it gives them.""
Glass told the newspaper Expresso at the weekend that Portugal had to pick between its American ""friends and allies"" and its ""economic partner"" China. He described the country as a ""battlefield"" between Washington and Beijing.
Portugal could expect consequences related to security and defence if it choose to work with China over the United States in developments related to 5G networks and others, he said.
In response, Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva told Lusa news agency: ""In Portugal the decision-makers are the Portuguese authorities, who decide which are Portugal' interests"". 
The three companies who dominate Portugal's mobile phone market have already said they would not use Huawei technology in their core 5G networks, but the Portuguese government has not banned the Chinese group from supplying the infrastructure.
China looped Portugal into its Belt and Road initiative in December 2018 and in recent years Chinese companies have invested about 10 billion euros in the country, making it one of the biggest recipients of Chinese investment in Europe.
Several Portuguese companies have opened doors to Chinese investment.

1346,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>",Britain and Canada impose sanctions on Belarus leader Lukashenko,"By Josh Smith and David Ljunggren
SEOUL/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Britain and Canada imposed travel bans and asset freezes on Tuesday on Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, his son and other senior officials, accusing their government of rigging an election and committing violence against protesters.
The sanctions were the first to be implemented by major Western powers over the crisis in Belarus, a close Russian ally. There was no immediate announcement from United States, which sources had said last week was planning to coordinate a joint announcement with its two big English-speaking allies.
More than 12,000 people have been arrested in mass demonstrations since Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, was named the landslide winner of an Aug. 9 presidential election his opponents say was stolen.
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud. All major opposition figures are either in jail or in exile.
On Tuesday, the authorities announced they were revoking the registration of Belarus's biggest news organisation outside state control, website TUT.BY. Its staff said they would try to keep operating. 
""Today, the government has documented that it is depriving Belarusians of the right to the truth,"" said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhounskaya.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Reuters that Lukashenko should pay a cost for ""the kind of human rights abuses that we've seen and the fraudulent approach to that election"". Raab also mentioned Lukashenko's ally, Russian President Vladimir Putin, although none of the measures Britain announced on Tuesday targets Russia or any Russians.
""We can't just have a situation where the likes of Alexander Lukashenko and frankly Vladimir Putin think that the human rights abuses and the rigging of that election can just pass without them being held to account.""
Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne told Reuters by phone: ""The resolve we have to stand with the Belarus people won't stop here. This a first step. We will continue to engage with our international partners to see what more can be done, which may include additional sanctions in light of the evolving situation.""
TREADING CAREFULLY
The West has so far been careful not to provoke Moscow while showing sympathy for the pro-democracy movement in Belarus. 
On Tuesday French President Emmanuel Macron became the first leader of a big Western power to meet Tsikhounskaya.
""... We need to be pragmatic and to support the Belarusian people and we will do our best, believe me,"" Macron said after their 45-minute talk at a hotel in Lithuania.
The European Union, which Britain quit in January, has said it will impose sanctions on some Belarusian officials, but has yet to finalise a list.
Sources told Reuters last week the United States was discussing plans with Britain and Canada for a joint announcement, although sources have also said Washington wanted to act in conjunction with the EU.
One of the sources told Reuters on Tuesday a U.S. sanctions package was essentially ready, but the timing of any announcement was uncertain. A Western diplomat told Reuters on condition of anonymity that Washington's decision not to act alongside Britain and Canada was ""unexpected"".
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia, small EU members near Belarus, have announced sanctions lists of their own. Belarus announced tit-for-tat sanctions against 300 of their officials on Tuesday.
Britain's measures impose travel bans and asset freezes on Lukashenko and seven others, including his son Viktor. Canada's list includes Lukashenko and 10 others.

""There is a vanishing window to influence what is playing out in Belarus and we believe the time to take action is now,"" Raab said. ""We will hold those responsible for the thuggery deployed against the Belarusian people to account and we will stand up for our values of democracy and human rights.""

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 12:25PM ET</span>","Kuwait's new ruler to seek stability among fractious, powerful neighbours","DUBAI (Reuters) - Kuwait's new ruler in waiting may find it harder than his predecessor to uphold his country's mediating role between rival Gulf powers, if only because he lacks his late brother's decades of experience as a conciliator in a polarised region.
Sheikh Nawaf al-Ahmad al-Sabah, named crown prince of the oil producing country in 2006, is in line to succeed his brother Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad, whose death was announced on Tuesday. 
Under Nawaf, 83, Kuwait is likely to continue to work for stability by staying on good terms with its often quarrelling, powerful neighbours, instead of seeking a leadership role in the region, diplomats say. 
But he lacks the negotiating skills of the late emir, who spent four decades as Kuwait's top diplomat, earning the respect of his neighbours for rebuilding ties in the Middle East after Iraq's 1990 invasion of his small but hugely wealthy country. 
Swathes of the region remain mired in conflict and strife.
Saudi Arabia and Iran are locked in proxy wars across the region. U.S.-Iranian animosity reached historic heights in January when the United States killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad. 
Sheikh Sabah tried until his death to end a Gulf row that has seen Riyadh and its allies boycott Qatar since mid-2017.
While foreign policy is unlikely to change under Nawaf, OPEC member Kuwait may lose gravitas internationally, two sources close to the ruling family and one of the diplomats said.   
""He doesn't have the experience, the willingness for foreign policy,"" one of two sources said. ""Inside, Kuwait will stay strong, but outside it will be weaker.""
Sheikh Nawaf largely kept a low profile as crown prince and also during previous roles as defence minister, at the time of the 1990 invasion, and interior minister. He is known as a founder of the country's national guard and has attempted to build security cooperation with Arab states. 
He had been widely perceived as a surprise choice by the emir in the succession line in 2006, and a reluctant ruler, who was encouraged to accept the role by senior members of the 250-year-old Al Sabah dynasty, said the diplomat.
ROYAL JOSTLING
Diplomats and analysts expect he will delegate a larger portion of state affairs to his crown prince because of his low-key style and his age. This means that the person nominated by family consensus as his heir, a post which normally also holds the post of prime minister, will be closely watched.
Dozens of senior Al Sabah family members have been jostling for position in anticipation of the choice of crown prince, a role that traditionally manages the government's often difficult relationship with parliament. 
A handful of unofficial potential candidates include the late emir's 72-year-old eldest son, Sheikh Nasser Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, according to the sources close to the ruling family and diplomats.Business-minded Nasser entered the senior ranks of the cabinet in 2017 as defence minister but lost the job last year after the government quit in a row with the country's influential elected parliament and amid royal infighting.
Another candidate is former prime minister Sheikh Nasser al-Mohammad al-Sabah, a nephew of the emir who stepped down in 2011 after lawmakers threatened to question him on corruption allegations, but had remained close to the emir.
Sheikh Meshal al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, deputy chief of the National Guard, could also be in the running.None of the men - the crown prince and his potential successors - have the diplomatic experience of the emir.
MAINTAINING BALANCE
Any potential successor will have to act swiftly to tackle domestic issues after their ascension, such as the government's often fractious ties with parliament and jostling within the ranks of the Al Sabah, leaving less time for foreign policy.
Kuwait's government is seeking to shore up its finances amid low oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic, while depleting its General Reserve Fund to plug a budget deficit.
Waiting in the wings is a new generation of royals: senior royal court official Sheikh Mohammad al-Mubarak al-Sabah and international sports figure Sheikh Ahmad al-Fahad al-Sabah, who had been sidelined over allegations of political meddling in the royal system and corruption, which he denies. 
Kuwait has the most open political system in the Gulf, with parliament wielding power to pass laws and question ministers, although most senior posts are occupied by Al Sabah members. 
Friction between the cabinet and the assembly has led to frequent reshuffles or dissolution of parliament, holding up crucial investment and economic reforms.

Sheikh Nawaf's discreet manner and openness to different points of view will be essential for maintaining balance, diplomats say, adding he could give more space for lawmakers to question senior ministers and allow some top cabinet posts to be held by people outside the Sabah family.

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, has lost the latest skirmish in her privacy lawsuit against a tabloid newspaper, after London's High Court ruled on Tuesday the paper could amend its case to include details from a recently published biography.
Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers over articles the Mail on Sunday last year that included parts of a handwritten letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle, in 2018.
Ahead of a trial due to start next year, the Mail had applied for permission to amend its case, arguing that the couple had cooperated with a biography about them, ""Finding Freedom"", which was published in August.
The paper's lawyers said it showed that Meghan had intended some private details to become public, including the contents of the letter, as part of a media campaign to portray her in a positive light.
Antony White, the paper's lawyer, told the court last week some personal information in the biography of Harry, 36, and Meghan, 39, could only have come from the couple themselves or close friends authorised to disclose it.
The book ""gives every appearance of having been written with their extensive cooperation"", he said.
Meghan's lawyer Justin Rushbrooke said there was no evidence for the Mail's claims and the court should not permit speculative amendments.
One of the book’s authors, Omid Scobie, gave a witness statement saying the couple had not authorised the book nor been interviewed for it.
However the judge, Francesca Kaye, ruled that while she made no view on the strength of the Mail’s case, the amendments could not be said to be “unarguable or utterly fanciful”.
She said neither Rushbrooke’s arguments nor Scobie’s statement provided a “knockout blow"" and they would be issues for the trial judge to determine.
The trial is scheduled to start on Jan. 11 and to last between 7 and 10 days.
Tuesday’s decision is the second setback for the Duchess after the court in May rejected part of her claim that the paper had acted dishonestly and stoked the rift with her father.
However her legal team has so far successfully resisted the paper's attempts to publish the names of five friends who gave anonymous interviews to the U.S. magazine People, with the court agreeing they can stay secret for time being.
    The Mail's lawyers argue that publication of the letter was justified as a response to those interviews, while Meghan's team says it was untrue she had authorised or arranged for her friends to speak on her behalf.
Harry and Meghan now live in California with their son Archie, having stepped down from royal roles in March.

A YouGov poll on Tuesday found 48% of Britons thought Harry and Meghan should lose their royal titles.

She said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that the proposal, made this week by Germany as current president of the EU, would mean a unilateral modification of the bloc's founding treaties. It would thereby violate the rule of law itself, and amounted to ""blackmail"".
Hungary has often been at loggerheads with the EU over a perceived backslide from democratic standards, prompting the deputy head of the EU executive to describe Hungarian Premier Viktor Orban's system as an ""ailing democracy"".
Germany has floated a scheme that conditions access to EU money, including the 750-billion-euro ($879.68 billion) coronavirus recovery fund, to respect for the rule of law, a document seen by Reuters showed on Monday.
""In July, the heads of state and government agreed on a mechanism to protect the budget of the EU and not on another rule of law mechanism,"" Varga wrote.
""Assistance must be provided as soon as possible for member states that are in need. The proposal puts at risk quick and effective action by reopening questions already settled,"" she said. ""This is exactly what the frugals want as they have never really supported European recovery.""
By ""frugals"" she was referring to some EU governments that had pressed for the recovery fund to made up of mainly repayable loans rather than grants to avoid what they see as the risk of mutualising member states' debt. The deal struck at a July EU summit envisages a somewhat greater amount of grants than loans.
Orban on Monday called on European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to dismiss Vera Jourova, the top rule of law official in the EU executive, but a Commission spokeswoman brushed aside the demand on Tuesday.

BARCELONA/MADRID (Reuters) - Dressed in white lab coats, medical scrubs and face masks, hundreds of junior Spanish doctors took to the streets of Barcelona on Tuesday to demand better working conditions as they struggle against a second wave of coronavirus infections.
""We're working up to 80 hours a week and clocking shifts of 24 hours,"" protester Clara Boter, a 28-year-old medical resident intern, told Reuters. ""Our contract is for 40 hours a week and we're on a basic salary."" 
Doctors in her position earn around 960 euros a month, she said. 
Between chants, the young doctors lay down blankets around Barcelona's busy Plaza de Espana roundabout to stage a sleep-in, highlighting the long hours they have to work. 
One protester lay next to a sign that read: ""I haven't slept in 24 hours. Can I take care of you?""
Since exiting a strict lockdown in mid-June, coronavirus cases in Spain have soared, with thousands of infections diagnosed every day. Hospitalizations, though lower than the March-April peak, are also on the rise.
Spain has recorded almost 750,000 coronavirus cases since the epidemic began, with a death toll exceeding 31,000.
Junior doctors are not the only ones feeling the strain. In Madrid, the epicentre of the outbreak, primary care staff are also struggling to contain the surging caseload.
Regional authorities have locked down 45 mostly poor districts but have clashed with the national government, which favours a city-wide confinement.
In the working-class neighbourhood of Vallecas - one of the first to be shut down - local nurse Flora Espejo complained the political squabbling was doing nothing to help the situation. 
""These politicians need to calm down, do their job and start to improve this situation, which is completely overwhelming.""
At the Buenos Aires health centre where she works, people were queuing up outside to take a COVID-19 test.
The city has begun a mass-testing campaign in an effort to track the virus and isolate those who test positive, but Espejo is sceptical of its value.

""Recommendations without control are useless, I make recommendations continuously. There are people who carry them out and people who do not.""

Belarus has seen mass demonstrations since Lukashenko, in power for 26 years, was named the landslide winner of an Aug 9 presidential election his opponents say was rigged. 
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud. All major opposition figures are now in jail or have fled.
Raab told parliament last week that Britain was preparing sanctions on Minsk in coordination with the United States and Canada.
The European Union, which Britain left in January, has also announced plans for sanctions on Belarusian officials, although it has yet to finalise them.
Western countries have so far been cautious in responding the events in Belarus, balancing sympathy for the pro-democracy movement with concern about provoking Russia, which has made clear it still supports Lukashenko, its close ally.
Raab said he had spoken with Britain's international partners, and Britain had decided to move forward.
""We expect others will follow but I think time is of the essence because of that narrow window of opportunity to influence what is playing out,"" he said.

""We can’t just have a situation where the likes of Alexander Lukashenko and frankly Vladimir Putin think that the human rights abuses and the rigging of that election can just pass without them being held to account.""

While driving through a checkpoint with his family in northern Syria, a stray bullet pierced his left leg, shattering his bones and forcing doctors to amputate it above the knee.
""I hated myself, hated my life, I was very depressed,"" said Ibrahim, now 24.
But the Syrian man, who lives in the city of al-Bab near Aleppo, said his outlook on life changed after he was fitted with a prosthetic leg.
This inspired him to get certified as a physiotherapist specialised in prosthetics. 
Ibrahim now works at the al-Bab Centre for prosthetics, funded by a UK-registered charity, Hand in Hand for Aid and Development, that provides medical aid across Syria. 
He designs and develops the prosthetics, drawing on his own experience of wearing them, and provides physiotherapy, and pep talks, to other amputees who visit the centre.
""I've been working in this field for seven years ... Many people were responsive to me, seeing as I've already been through the challenges that they are going through,"" he said.  
Abdelrahim Khlouf, head of the al-Bab centre, said there were tens of thousands of people who have lost limbs in the country's north in Syria's nine-year multi-sided war.
According to a report published by the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund in 2018, more than 1.5 million Syrians are now living with permanent impairments caused by the conflict, including 86,000 who have lost limbs. 
The report adds that many suffer from a lack of access to proper medical or psychological care, and often face exclusion from their societies. 

Ibrahim, who recently got married, said his dream now is to continue his education abroad to gain more knowledge to help others who have lost limbs.

PARIS (Reuters) - A Pakistani man accused of wounding two people with a meat cleaver in front of the former offices of Charlie Hebdo last Friday did not know the satirical magazine had moved and wanted to set its offices on fire, the Paris prosecutor said.
Prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard told a news conference that the suspect carried three bottles of white spirit, a flammable paint thinner. He also said the man had operated under a false identity and that a photo of his passport on his phone showed that he was 25 years old, not 18 as he first said. 
""His initial plan was to enter into the office of the magazine, possibly with the help of a hammer, and then to set it on fire with the bottles of white spirit,"" Ricard said.
In 2015, twelve people were killed by gunmen who attacked Charlie Hebdo's office in revenge for the publication of cartoons that mocked the Prophet Mohammad.
After the attack, the weekly moved its headquarters to an undisclosed location. It republished some of the cartoons this month to mark the beginning of the trial of 14 people with alleged links to the killers.
Ricard said that as the suspect arrived in the street where the magazine was previously based, he saw the two victims and attacked them, thinking that they worked for the magazine.
Ricard said the man had reconnoitred the area on three separate days shortly before his attack, and had bought the meat cleaver on the day of the attack.

""In his telephone, we found a three-minute video in Urdu, in which he announces his plan, saying that 'here in France they make caricatures about our pure and great Prophet Mohammad'. Today...I will revolt against this',"" Ricard said.

PAISLEY, Ore. (Reuters) - In the flames, they are finding redemption.
The 10 Oregon prisoners carry chainsaws, axes, shovels and hoes into the biggest wildfires the state has seen in a century. 
Banding together, they form lines in the forest and trudge up the steep ashen slopes of the Cascade Mountains, hunting embers that could reignite flames.
The men are part of a seven-decade-old state-run program that aims to do two basic things: Rehabilitate prisoners by teaching them a trade, and provide extra boots on the ground for intense wildfire seasons.
A dozen such crews have worked fires in Oregon this month, which has seen over 1 million acres burn and nine people die during this year's wildfire season. 
The men in a crew working the forested mountains near Paisley, Oregon, last week were mostly young and fit. They had to be to scale the punishing terrain. Ankle-deep ash slicked hills and meant the men slipped two steps back for each stride forward.
Many were violent offenders - armed robberies and assaults were common convictions - but none were in prison for homicide or sexual crimes. Most say they have personalities that feed off adrenaline. The highs that crime brought landed them in jail. All say they say they are blessed to have found a legal, alternative rush.
""This gives us a different opportunity, rather than going back to something that we already know, which is guns, gangs, violence and drugs,"" said Eddie Correia, 36, who is about halfway through his six-year sentence for an assault conviction. 
Correia's crew had 10 prisoners who spent their days fighting fires and another 10 who slept and worked in an Oregon Department of Forestry support camp, picking up trash, serving food and providing other services. They earn $6 a day for their labor.
The men wake at 6:30 a.m. each day in Oregon's cold early fall dawn. They dress in sweatshirts emblazoned with the word INMATE and make their way to a makeshift breakfast area, where they sip coffee, stamp their feet to ward off the chill and chat about the chore that awaits them. 
Around them, the flat green pastures of the Fremont National Forest run right up to the fire-devastated mountains, where billows of white smoke float upward from the flames.
The men prep their equipment before heading out, using files to sharpen axes and triple checking their bright yellow backpacks to make sure all their gear is there.
Armando Gomez-Zacarias, 24, who has just over three years left on a 7-1/2 year sentence for robbery, said the work gave him ""a nice adrenaline rush.""
The physical toll, he emphasized, was brutal. 
""It's like running 100 laps on the track without stopping and carrying 50 pounds of weight,"" he said.
Correia, who has fought fires in the program since 2018 and wants to continue after he is released from jail, said the strenuous work and danger fostered a camaraderie impossible to replicate inside prison walls.
Those connections and sense of purpose, he said, ""have helped me deal with a lot of my own demons.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Europe is ""screwed"" if the European Parliament ceases sitting in the French city of Strasbourg once a month and convenes only in Brussels, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday. 
""At the moment I'm fighting tooth and nail for the idea that the European Parliament should convene in Strasbourg,"" Macron told university students in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius.
""If we accept that the European Parliament only gathers in Brussels, we're screwed, because in 10 years time everything will take place in Brussels and people will only speak amongst themselves in Brussels,"" he added.
Macron complained in a letter to the president of the European Parliament last week about the assembly's decision to hold sessions in Brussels only for the time being as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
In normal times, the parliament's lawmakers convene in Strasbourg for one week every month and in the Belgian city of Brussels for the remainder. The monthly upheaval costs the bloc 114 million euros ($124 million) a year, EU auditors say.
Critics have long called for the arrangement to be scrapped, but it has stayed in place largely because France would veto any attempt to make the required amendments to the EU treaty.

France says Strasbourg, which abuts the border with Germany, is a symbol of European post-war reconciliation and that European institutions should not all be centralised in one city.

The government announced on Monday a tightening of restrictions on socialising in northeast England from Wednesday, in response to high and increasing COVID-19 infection rates in the region - the latest in a series of local measures.
In the affected areas, which include large urban centres such as Newcastle, Gateshead, Sunderland and Durham, people will face fines if they are caught meeting people from other households indoors, including in homes, pubs and restaurants.
After a junior minister said on morning radio that she did not know what the new rules were, Johnson was asked hours later whether people from different households would be able to meet outdoors in pub gardens in the northeast.
""Outside the areas such as the northeast where extra measures have been brought in, it's six inside, six outside,"" he responded, referring to the government's ""rule of six"" which applies in areas not subject to specific local restrictions.
""In the northeast and other areas where extra tight measures have been brought in, you should follow the guidance of local authorities, but it's six in a home or six in hospitality, but as I understand it not six outside,"" he said.
Critics said the response was unclear and appeared to contradict the information released by the health ministry on Monday.
""For the prime minister to not understand his own rules is grossly incompetent,"" said Angela Rayner, deputy leader of the main opposition Labour Party. ""These new restrictions are due to come into force across huge parts of the country tonight. The government needs to get a grip.""
Johnson corrected himself soon afterwards on Twitter.
""Apologies, I misspoke today,"" he said. ""In the North East, new rules mean you cannot meet people from different households in social settings indoors, including in pubs, restaurants and your home. You should also avoid socialising with other households outside.""
With infection numbers rising again in different parts of the country, the government has said it wants to avoid a second national lockdown and instead is taking targeted local measures to try to slow the spread of the virus.
But the proliferation of different rules in different places has led to widespread complaints that citizens can no longer be sure what they can and cannot do, even as they face possible fines for breaching the guidance.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Governments in the Middle East and Central Asia need to increase spending in areas such as social protection, education and public health, where vulnerabilities have been exposed by the coronavirus pandemic, the International Monetary Fund said. 
The region, spanning around 30 countries from Mauritania to Kazakhstan, still lags global peers in terms of social spending and ""socioeconomic outcomes,"" the Washington-based multilateral lender said in a study published on Tuesday.
""The pandemic has further magnified these challenges and brought into sharp focus the urgent need for higher social spending, particularly on health and social protection, to save lives and protect the most vulnerable,"" it said.
The IMF has estimated that real gross domestic product across the region will shrink by 4.7% this year as the pandemic hits sectors such as tourism and trade. Low oil prices and crude production cuts are meanwhile straining the finances of regional oil exporters and reducing remittances.
For many countries, the health crisis has exposed long-standing vulnerabilities in health infrastructure and social safety nets, but their ability to address those problems is now facing financial limitations.
""Public finances have been significantly stretched to deal with existing needs as well as the human cost of the pandemic and to contain its economic fallout,"" said the IMF. ""In many countries, financing constraints limit the availability of budgetary resources."" 
Social spending in the region is generally lower than in other parts of the world, with governments spending about 10.4% of GDP on average, compared to a 14.2% average in emerging markets. Countries in the oil-rich Gulf spend less than advanced economies, said the Fund.
Social protection spending averaged 4.9% of GDP in the region, against 6.6% in emerging markets.
While most countries have increased social spending in response to the pandemic, this may not be sustainable without creating new revenues or using resources more efficiently.
""Even without increasing outlays, boosting the efficiency of spending would help significantly improve socioeconomic outcomes,"" the IMF said.
""For example, life expectancy at birth could increase by three years in Kuwait if the existing resource envelope was spent at the efficiency level of advanced economies.""

The boss of the British broadcaster, which is mainly funded by a licence fee paid by all TV-watching households, said he would set out new guidelines on the use of platforms such as Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in the coming weeks.
Shortly after he became director general at the start of September, Davie had told staff they should not air their own political views on social media because they risked damaging the BBC's reputation for impartiality.
He said on Tuesday the guidelines would apply to all presenters and not just journalists.

ATHENS (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged NATO allies Greece and Turkey on Tuesday to press ahead with talks to resolve their dispute over maritime boundaries as soon as possible.
Greece and Turkey, at loggerheads on a range of issues, have agreed to resume exploratory talks over contested maritime claims in the eastern Mediterranean ""in the future"" after weeks of tensions, but have not announced a date. 
""We hope that these talks can continue in a serious way,"" Pompeo said after meeting Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on the island of Crete. ""(We) encourage them to resume discussion of these issues as soon as possible.""
Pompeo was on a two-day trip to Greece following an increase in regional strains over energy resources. 
Tensions flared last month after Ankara sent its Oruc Reis seismic survey ship into disputed waters, escorted by gunboats, to map out sea territory for possible oil and gas drilling.
Since then, Turkey has recalled the vessel, saying this would allow for diplomacy before a European Union summit on Oct. 1-2 that will address the issue and possible sanctions against Ankara - demanded by Cyprus, Greece and France. 
Cyprus, an EU member state, has refused to sign off on sanctions sought by other members on Belarus over contested elections there unless tougher action is taken on Turkey. 
Countries in the eastern Mediterranean have been rushing to claim jurisdiction over maritime zones in the hope of finding oil or gas and this has exposed decades-old, and sometimes forgotten, conflicts in the process.
Greece and Egypt have signed a pact defining maritime boundaries between them, angering Turkey, which says the deal encroaches on its territory. Similarly a zoning agreement between Turkey and the internationally recognised Libyan government has riled Greece.
Pompeo, who also visited the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki on Monday, said the eastern Mediterranean region should provide a foundation for energy security. 

He said the United States supports Greece's efforts to diversify energy routes and supplies and believes in Greek-U.S. security cooperation, adding that Russia was a destabilising influence in the region.

The robot is the centerpiece of the Gundam Factory Yokohama, a tourist attraction that was due to open in October, but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The park operator said on Tuesday it will open on Dec. 19.
The videos, shot by a telephoto lens from Twitter user @yoshi115t, show what appear to be motion tests of the white robot that dwarfs boats speeding by in the background. The 25-tonne Gundam makes a walking motion as it exits a storage area, before kneeling and then raising its right arm to point toward the sky.
The park's Gundam-Lab will feature an exhibition area and cafe, while the Gundam-Dock Tower will allow visitors to view the robot's face and body.
""Mobile Suit Gundam"" debuted in Japan in the late 1970s as a cartoon about enormous battle robots piloted by humans. The series spawned multiple spinoffs and toys while gaining a worldwide following.
The Gundam franchise is operated by Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. Engineering company Yaskawa Electric Corp and industrial robot maker Nabtesco Corp are among companies making parts of the giant Gundam in Yokohama, according to the attraction's website.

The transition will take several years and existing animal shows will receive government support to switch to a new model, Environment Minister Barbara Pompili told a news conference. 
""Today, I announce the progressive end of the presence of wild animals in travelling circuses, a ban on the presence of orcas and dolphins in dolphinariums not adapted to the needs of marine mammals, and the end of mink farming for fur,"" she said. 
She said the measures would affect about 80 circuses, which have some 230 animals, including big cats, elephants, hippos, wolves and others. 
France, which has three dolphinariums, will not allow the opening of new ones and wants the closure of existing ones within seven to 10 years. She also wants the closure of four mink farms within five years.
The state will provide an aid package of more than 8 million euros ($9.36 million) to help animal shows switch to a new business model.
Some 20 European countries have already banned or limited the presence of wild animals in circuses. In France, many cities already do not allow circuses with wild animal shows to pitch their tents. 
Head of the French animal shows association William Kerwich said the ban is ""a knife in the back"" of an industry already hurting from coronavirus crowd limits. 
""It will put people out of work. And who will take care of the animals, they are born in captivity, they cannot be set free in the wild,"" he said on BFM television.

YORK, Pa. (Reuters) - Natalie Cruz, 12, missed math and language arts instruction one recent morning because the school's virtual interface would not load. Carlos, her 8-year-old brother, sat beside her at the kitchen table, studying with last year's workbooks because the district had yet to supply him with a PC, weeks after instruction started online.
Across town, Zachary and Zeno Lentz, 5 and 9, were at their high-performing elementary schools, where they attend in-person on Tuesdays and Fridays. They learn remotely the other three days, assisted by their college-educated mother, a social worker who can do her job from home. 
The Cruz and Lentz children are separated by just a few miles in York, Pennsylvania. But they are a world apart in educational opportunities, a gap education experts say has widened amid the disruption of the coronavirus pandemic.      
Belen Cruz, a single mother and nurse, is most worried about Natalie, who has learning difficulties and would benefit from in-person support. The mother can't afford a tutor and on weekdays usually leaves both children with her parents, who don't speak English well, while she works at a nursing home.     
""I think she will be behind,"" Cruz said, sitting in her two-bedroom row home in a working-class neighborhood.
Her children's schools are in the York City district, whose student population, about half Latino and one-third Black, scores well below average on the state's standardized proficiency exams. The Lentz family lives in the predominantly white York Suburban district, which boasts above-average scores on the tests.    
Across the United States, the disparities between poor and affluent districts are growing as school boards face increased costs from the pandemic - including technology for remote learning and safety measures such as cleaning - at a time of declining tax revenues. Students in urban school districts, including York, are also more likely to see in-person learning halted because of higher levels of coronavirus spread in more densely populated areas.
In Clearwater, Florida volunteers are delivering food to children who rely on school cafeteria meals. In Salt Lake City, Utah a laptop shortage meant one out of every seven students didn't log on for the first week of class. In Salinas, California a picture of two young children using the free Wifi outside a Taco Bell went viral, bringing attention to the 17 million students nationwide who lack internet access at home.
The financially struggling York City School District has cut or furloughed more than 100 people, including dozens of teachers, and ended its performing arts program. The cuts reflected a confluence of factors, including statewide cuts in funding and spending constraints placed on the district as it works through a state-supervised financial recovery program. 
York Suburban, which has fewer students with high needs and a stronger balance sheet, has made no such cuts.        
""That's some of the fundamental unfairness that exists in the way schools are funded, and urban districts in our state are poorly funded,"" said Brian Ellis, principal of York Suburban High School. ""We are very fortunate.""
At a September 23 school board meeting, York City Superintendent Andrea Berry said an additional 2,000 iPads would be distributed by Oct. 2, ensuring that each student will have a device, rather than just one per household.       
Berry said in an interview that schedules have been arranged with a mix of live and recorded material so that siblings sharing one PC can access lessons. The unequal schooling of city and suburban students, she said, was not unique to York.
""Any time you go to an urban city district, you are going to see disparity, inequity, poverty, lack of funding,"" she said. ""That's the story of urban districts.""
      
HISTORY OF SEGREGATION        
Established in the 1950's, the York Suburban School District wraps around a large swathe of York City, with its lines drawn in a contorted shape that captures wealthy patches surrounding the urban core. Split-level homes on cul-de-sacs and well-maintained churches dot the landscape, and students attend school in upgraded facilities.   
The city has preserved some of its early-American charm, with century-old row homes like the Cruz's, but decades of economic hardship and underinvestment have left pockets of blight. Racial tensions, which engulfed the city in riots in the late 1960s, resurfaced during the national uprising sparked by George Floyd's death in late May at the hands of Minneapolis police. Hundreds of protesters gathered in downtown York demanding racial and social justice.    
Lauri Lebo, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania State Education Association, said the inequities in York can be traced to the ""white flight"" from cities to the suburbs, starting in the 1950s and 1960s, in the wake of national laws to end racial segregation.    
""A lot of it is systemic racism, and also the way we deal with poverty in the country,"" said Lebo, a former journalist who has written extensively about education and racial issues in York.
Amid a summer of uncertainty over the virus, York City decided to begin school in the fall with remote-only learning. Like many other U.S. cities, it had higher levels of community infection and students' families - many headed by essential workers - were more likely to be directly impacted by COVID-19 than suburban households.    
York Suburban employed a hybrid model of online and in-person learning, while the neighboring Central York district, also predominantly white, offers five days in school. Wealthier families and districts are also far better equipped to adapt to online learning, if parents choose it, with higher levels of technology in homes and schools and parents who more often can choose to work from home.
Penn State University researchers who studied reopening plans across the state found that a majority of white students had the option to choose in-person schooling while a majority of Black and Hispanic students lived in online-only districts.  
For Maleny Delgado, a York City parent who wanted her three children to go to school five days a week, the district's last- minute switch to all remote learning was a gut punch. Her 9-year old son has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and struggles to concentrate in an online environment, she said. 
""Because we live in the city, we get treated like we are in the ghettos,"" she said. ""We are always going to be less.""
    
UNEQUAL FUNDING
Pennsylvania has among the nation's biggest spending gaps among school systems, with the richest district outspending the poorest one by as much as three-to-one per student. That stems in large part from the state covering a smaller share of education costs than almost any other, leaving local districts, with widely varying tax bases, to shoulder the rest.    
York City fares better than some districts with disadvantaged populations - and actually spends slightly more, per student, than York Suburban. But that doesn't mean it's students are getting an equal education, because the city students' needs are so much higher. The district has a much higher proportion of students in poverty than its suburban counterpart, and also serves more special needs students. A quarter of students are learning English as a second language.
York City's median household income is $30,000, with a poverty rate of about 35 percent. York Suburban's median household income is $68,000, with a poverty rate below 8 percent.
In 2016, the state passed a law aimed at allocating education funds more equally among districts. But in a compromise, the formula was applied only to incremental increases in funding because of political resistance to reducing state funding to any district.
If the formula were applied to all state educational funding, York City would annually receive $54.8 million more, an increase of nearly 80 percent from the current level, estimates Dan Urevick-Ackelsberg, an attorney for the Public Interest Law Center, which is suing the state to address such funding gaps.
In June, the York City school board approved a $155.8 million budget incorporating more than $6 million in cuts, prompting the York Dispatch to warn that the district was ""trapped in a death spiral.""        
The picture looks much different in York Suburban. The district had distributed PCs widely in recent years, putting it in a good position to ensure all students had them when the pandemic hit, Superintendent Timothy Williams (NYSE:WMB) said.
""York City has so many other fires to put out. Academics is like a backburner,"" said Cristina Lentz, who was a social worker in York City schools for three years before resigning in 2019.
Lentz, who now works for a behavioral health organization, is happy with how York Suburban is handling the pandemic. On a recent afternoon, her son Zachary walked out of the gleaming Yorkshire Elementary School keen to talk about baseball and his favorite subject: recess.     
For his days at home, Zachary's teacher has prepared packets of work for each day, Lentz said, and his class is building up to using the Chromebooks that have been procured for each child.  

""I worried so much about him and how he would do, and he is just blowing me away with the things he's doing and remembering,"" she said as she picked up Zachary from school. ""I know he is definitely benefiting from coming in here.""

""I'm fit as a butcher's dog, thanks basically to losing weight,"" said Johnson, adding that before his weight loss he had weighed 17st 6lb (112 kg), which he said was too much for a man with a height of 5ft 10in (1.78 m).

Prosecutors last year announced that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute one former British soldier, dubbed ""Soldier F"", for two murders, but that there was insufficient evidence to charge 16 other soldiers. One of those 16 has since died. 
A number of the bereaved families and injured victims subsequently exercised their right to request a review of decisions. 
""I have concluded that the available evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction of any of the 15 soldiers,"" Marianne O'Kane, Senior Assistant Director of Northern Ireland's Public Prosecution Service, said in a statement. 
The prosecution of Soldier F is ongoing but has not yet reached trial. 
In one of the most notorious incidents of the Northern Ireland conflict, soldiers from the Parachute Regiment opened fire on Sunday, Jan. 30, 1972, during an unauthorised march in a nationalist area of Londonderry. 
They killed 13 people and wounded 14 others, one of whom died later, in the worst single shooting incident of ""The Troubles"", three decades of sectarian violence involving Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and pro-British forces. 
The 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought a close to a conflict in which about 3,500 people were killed. 
A judicial inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday said in 2010 the victims were innocent and had posed no threat to the military.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - A woman from the lowest rung of India's caste system died in hospital on Tuesday weeks after authorities said she was raped by a group of men, triggering protests and opposition criticism over what it said was a failure to protect women.
Her case was the latest in a string of gruesome crimes against women in India that have given it the dismal reputation of being one of the worst places in the world to be female.
One woman reported a rape every 15 minutes on an average in India in 2018, according to the latest government data released in January.
""There is next to no protection for women. Criminals are openly committing crimes,"" Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, a leader of the opposition Congress party, said on Twitter.
The 19-year-old victim, belonging to the Dalit community, was attacked and raped Sept. 14 at a field near her home in Hathras district, 100 km (62-mile) from Delhi, authorities said.
Police have arrested four men in connection with the crime.
On Monday, the woman was brought from a hospital in Uttar Pradesh state to New Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, where she died while undergoing treatment, authorities said.
About 300 protesters from the Bhim Army, a party championing the rights of Dalits, entered the hospital premises and shouted slogans near the mortuary where the woman's body was kept. 
""We will take the matter to fast-track court for the faster investigation and collection of evidence,"" district authorities in Hathras said in a statement.
The woman's home state of Uttar Pradesh, which is ruled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, ranks as the most unsafe state for women in the country.

Last December, a 23-year-old Dalit woman was set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to a court in Uttar Pradesh to press rape charges.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jodi Cook will drop off her son to his Brooklyn school on Tuesday for the first time in months, but even though her 6-year-old will get at least some time interacting face to face with teachers and staff, she fears it will not be enough.
Going back to the classroom was the only viable option for Roberto, Cook said. He has some learning challenges and did not do well with remote learning when schools shut last spring. But even with a return to the classroom, Cook fears he might end up not getting access to all the services he needs. 
""I'm going to kind of go into it thinking of this year as a wash,"" Cook, a 48-year-old who works in real estate, told Reuters. ""He needs additional support that he's not going to be able to get.""
Hundreds of thousands of students who have chosen in-person learning will head back to the classroom in New York City this week after a months-long hiatus spurred by COVID-19. 
Children in elementary schools are due to start in-person instruction on Tuesday as part of the city's blended learning plan, which calls for students to spend some of the week in schools and the remainder learning at home online.
Efforts to bring students back to the classroom in the country's largest public school district serving more than 1 million students did not go off without a hitch.
Mayor Bill de Blasio delayed in-person learning at public schools twice due to staffing shortages and other difficulties arising from the pandemic. Recently, positive test rates for the coronavirus have been rising in some neighborhoods. Should the city cross its 3% threshold, schools will have to close in-person learning.  
Most other major school districts in the United States have scrapped plans to resume in-person education for now. In Los Angeles, the second largest school district in the nation, and Chicago, students are staying home and using laptops to attend classes.
Despite the challenges posed by this most unusual school year, Cook said the teachers and staff at their Brooklyn school had been ""great"" in the run-up to the start of in-person education. 
They called for check-ins and followed up when the family had to delay the start of Roberto's virtual learning earlier this month, and they scrambled to make sure he gets access to the in-person special care he needs, although they could not guarantee it due to limited resources.
Classrooms in the city's schools look very different from what pupils are accustomed. Educators had to implement numerous changes in order to meet new health and safety guidelines, including revamping old ventilation systems.
Face coverings, fewer desks placed six feet apart, lunch in the classroom, outdoor classes for some, and nurses on the premises are some of the novelties awaiting students and staff this academic year. 
""We've been talking to them about how they have to wear their masks and we've been describing to them what the classroom is going to look like,"" said Anne Cole Norman, a Brooklyn mother of two. ""I think mostly they're just happy, excited to go back and see kids."" 

Last week, pre-kindergarten children and students with special learning needs resumed in-person learning. After elementary schools, it will be middle and high school students' turn to return to the classroom on Thursday.

""There is no big party. We are just going to open,"" Engelbert Luetke-Daldrup told a news conference.
""We German engineers were ashamed,"" he said, adding that the delays had made Berlin, and Germany, a ""laughing stock"", while the fact that costs had spiralled to 6 billion euros ($7 billion) from an original 2.7 billion was also not acceptable.
Construction began in 2006 on the BER airport, which had originally been due to open in 2011. But construction problems and technical issues saw the date pushed back repeatedly.
That left Berlin relying on two outdated and increasingly crowded Cold War-era airports: Tegel, which served the west of the city, and Schoenefeld, once Communist East Berlin's airport which will be integrated into the new airport.
Easyjet and Lufthansa will simultaneously make the first landings at the new airport on Oct. 31.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Luetke-Daldrup said Berlin's airports will need government support of around 260 million euros, with only around 10 million passengers expected in 2020, down from 36 million last year.
Luetke-Daldrup appealed for the new airport to be awarded more international landing slots, saying tourists from places like China wanted to fly directly to the capital, rather than via hubs like Frankfurt and Munich.
Berlin will hold a celebration to thank Tegel when it closes on Nov. 8, Luetke-Daldrup said, noting that it is seen as a symbol of freedom and appreciated for its architecture. 
French occupying forces built Tegel in 1948 during the Berlin airlift, when the western allies flew in supplies to West Berlin after Soviet forces cut off road and rail transport. It started commercial operations in 1960.

The Mein Shiff 6 cruise ship had departed from Heraklion in Crete on Sunday with all 922 passengers having tested negative before boarding.
But sample tests on 150 members out of the ship's total crew of 666, conducted at a land lab, detected 12 COVID-19 infections.
Sailing off the island of Milos, the cruise liner made its way back to Piraeus, the country's biggest port, with better access to health services and equipped to deal with any emergency. The affected crew on the ship was isolated.
""Twelve unclear positive COVID-19 tests on crew of Mein
Schiff 6 have now been identified as negative by two further tests - PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests performed by TUI Cruises and antigen rapid tests of the Greek authorities,"" TUI Cruises said on Tuesday.
A further PCR test carried out by Greek health authorities ""should confirm this again"", it said, calling the incident a possible false alarm.
The results of the PCR tests by Greek health authorities were expected later on Tuesday.
""None of the 12 crew members has any symptoms. The 12 crew members as well as 24 crew members of contact group 1 were immediately isolated on board on Monday,"" TUI said.
Those 24 crew members were also subjected to an antigen test by Greek authorities and all results were negative. Until the final results of the PCR tests are available, they will remain isolated, it added.
TUI said that given that no passengers were among the contact group, no tests on them were necessary and the vessel would resume its cruise once Greek authorities give the green light.
The cruise industry has taken a major hit from the pandemic, with some of the earliest large clusters of COVID-19 occurring aboard cruise ships. 
Voyages of large cruise ships only resumed in recent weeks in Greece after they were banned for months.

TUI Cruises is a cruise line based in Germany.

Democratic Taiwan has denounced China's manoeuvres, including flying fighter jets over the sensitive mid-line of the Taiwan Strait, as an attempt at intimidation.
""The Chinese communists have continued their acts of provocation against Taiwan, but there are currently no signs showing it is ready to launch a full-scale war,"" Defence Minister Yen De-fa told parliament.
One sign of an imminent attack would be if troops from inland parts of China began massing along its east, but there are no indications that is happening, he added.
Taiwan's own forces are maintaining peacetime combat preparedness and have not stepped up their alert status, Yen said. Nevertheless he vowed a fight to the last man to defend the island's sovereignty and democracy.
Last week, in an apparent warning to China, the defence ministry said Taiwan's armed forces have the right to self-defence and counterattack amid ""harassment and threats"".
Taiwan's military is well armed and well trained, but dwarfed by that of China's, which is busy adding advanced new equipment, such as stealth fighters.
Premier Su Tseng-chang, also speaking in parliament, said attackers would have to pay a heavy price as Taiwan's people would tenaciously defend themselves and their land.
""Taiwan would not fall,"" added Su, who has previously said he would wield a broom if necessary to fight off a China attack, if that was all that was left.
China has been angered by greater U.S. support for Taiwan, including two visits by top officials, Health Secretary Alex Azar in August and Keith Krach, the undersecretary of state for economic affairs this month.
The United States, which has no diplomatic ties with the island but is its strongest backer, also plans new arms sales to Taiwan.

BAKU/YEREVAN (Reuters) - Armenia and Azerbaijan accused each other on Tuesday of firing into each other's territory, far from the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone, as the worst spate of fighting since the 1990s raged for a third day and the civilian death toll mounted.
Dozens have been reported killed and hundreds wounded since the fierce clashes between Azerbaijan and its ethnic Armenian mountain enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh broke out on Sunday in a new eruption of a decades-old conflict.
Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said 10 civilians had been killed by Armenian shelling since Sunday. There was no official information about casualties among Azeri servicemen.
The Armenian defence ministry said an Armenian civilian bus in Vardenis -- a town in Armenia at the border with Azerbaijan and far from Nagorno-Karabakh -- caught fire after being hit by an Azeri drone, but no one appeared to be hurt. It said it was making further checks.
Nagorno-Karabakh is a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but is run by ethnic Armenians and is supported by Armenia. It broke away from Azerbaijan in a war in the 1990s, but is not recognised by any country as an independent republic.
Any move to all-out war could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, which provides vital support to the enclave and is its lifeline to the outside world, while Ankara backs its own ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called for an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation of the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in phone calls with the countries' leaders, government spokesman Steffen Seiber said on Tuesday.
COUNTER-ATTACKS
The Armenian defence ministry said in a statement that Azeri armed forces opened fire on a military unit in Vardenis, but that the situation was generally less tense on the border. 
""The Armenian border with Azerbaijan is relatively calm"", defence ministry official Artsrun Hovhannisyan said.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said that from Vardenis the Armenian army had shelled the Dashkesan region inside Azerbaijan. Armenia denied those reports.
Azerbaijan on Sunday reported the death of five members of a single family. Armenia said on Tuesday that a 9-year-old girl was killed in shelling, while her mother and a brother were wounded.
A mother and her child were killed in Martuni on Sunday, the defence ministry of Nagorno-Karabakh said.
The clashes have reignited concern over stability in the South Caucasus region, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.
Armenia is considering the possibility of concluding a military-political alliance with Nagorno-Karabakh, Lilit Makunts, an MP from the ruling My Step alliance, wrote on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said both sides had attempted to recover lost ground by launching counter-attacks in the directions of Fizuli, Jabrayil, Agdere and Terter - Armenian-occupied areas of Azerbaijan that border Nagorno-Karabakh.

Armenia reported fighting throughout the night, and said that Nagorno-Karabakh's army had repelled attacks in several directions along the line of contact.

CHILLING, India(Reuters) - Ligen Eliyas deftly turns the excavator's hydraulic arm to push a huge boulder into the Zanskar river below in a cloud of dust, clearing another bit of land for a strategic highway that India is hurriedly building near the Chinese border.
The construction site near the hamlet of Chilling in the Ladakh region is around 250 km (150 miles) west of the area where Indian and Chinese troops are locked in the most serious confrontation in decades.
But when ready, the road will provide the only year-round access to large parts of Ladakh, including the border zone. That will go some way to bringing India on par with China, which has a network of roads and helipads on its side of the border.
""It will become a lot easier for the army after this road is finished,"" Eliyas said, with parts of his face and khaki uniform caked in fine stone dust.
The protracted standoff in the remote western Himalayan region erupted into a bloody hand-to-hand clash in June in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed and China suffered an unspecified number of casualties. The Asian giants fought a brief but bloody border war in 1962.
The 283-km (175-mile)-long Nimmu-Padam-Darcha (NPD) highway, where Eliyas is working, is expected to be completed in three years, officials said. It highlights the efforts by India, which have been redoubled after the latest tensions, to develop key infrastructure - roads, tunnels, bridges and airfields - along the unsettled 3,500 km (2,170 mile) border with China.
The road will link up with an 8.8-km (5.5-mile) tunnel that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate in coming weeks, opening the snow deserts of Ladakh to the rest of the country all year round.
There are two main highways that connect Ladakh to the rest of India, but they are closed for at least four months every winter. The only way urgent supplies are sent to Ladakh during these months is by air.
With thousands of its troops amassed at the border and no sign of a drawdown, India is now pushing harder to blast and smash its way through the Himalayas.
""We will not back down from taking any big and tough step in the interest of our country,"" Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told parliament this month, adding the government had doubled the budget for infrastructure work on the China border.
The frenetic construction itself has become a thorny issue this summer with the Chinese complaining that the Indian activity in the mountains was destabilising, Indian officials said. But China built its infrastructure in the area years ago, and it needs to be matched, they said.
""China does not recognise the so-called 'Ladakh Union Territory' illegally set up by India and is opposed to infrastructure building at the border area for the purpose of military control,"" the office of China's foreign ministry spokesperson said. It added that according to a recent consensus by both sides, no side should be taking any action that complicates the situation at the border area.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
MATTER OF HOURS
China's network of roads and railways, logistics depots and helipads mean that it can move troops to forward areas in a matter of hours, said Rajeswari Pillai Rajagopalan, a distinguished fellow at New Delhi think-tank Observer Research Foundation.
For India, it would take days to match those deployments, she said.
""The infrastructure buildup by the Chinese is not only aiming at the quick deployment of forces but also to sustain them for a relatively longer period of time,"" Rajagopalan said.
Conceived in 1999, India's NPD project moved at a glacial pace till work picked just a couple of year ago, said N.K. Jain, a commander in the state-run Border Roads Organisation (BRO).
Since then, the BRO has built some 100 km of the NPD project, and constructed 11 of the 15 major bridges on the route. ""Our work is happening at double the speed in the last two years,"" Jain said.
New drilling machines that push dynamite sticks deeper and faster into hard rock to blow them apart have improved the speed of construction, said B. Kishen, a BRO executive engineer who is supervising the project near Chilling.
On a recent afternoon, dozens of workers cleared debris from a freshly blasted section of the road. A few kilometres away, another group crouched under an excavator as explosives went off to clear land for another section of the highway.
Work will continue through the bitter winter, when temperatures drop to below minus 40 Celsius (minus 40 Fahrenheit) and biting winds at altitudes above 11,000 feet (3,300 m) make road construction even more challenging, Kishen said.
The government has identified 73 strategically important roads along the Chinese border, of which 61 are with the BRO, running over 3,300 km (2,000 miles). A parliamentary committee report in March noted that 75% of the work under BRO had been completed.
The full network of roads will cut down travel time between key Indian military bases, allowing for quicker mobilisation of troops and ease patrolling in some forward areas, an Indian official said.
""It will also lead to lower expenditure for the forces,"" the official said, with all-weather roads replacing the need for expensive airlift operations during the winter months.

""We will have a better chance of catching up with the Chinese.""

The appointment of General Narongpan Jittkaewtae, in an annual military reshuffle, comes as Thailand's army and palace dominated establishment faces the challenge of more than two months of anti-government protests.
Narongpan made no specific mention of the protesters, some of whom have called for reforms to curb the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy.
""I pledge to all of you that I will continue the obligations, responsibility, policies and ideology of the army chief, General Apirat Kongsompong, to the fullest of my ability,"" Narongpan told a military ceremony.
Apirat, moving to a senior position in the royal household, was outspoken in criticising opposition figures, academics and politicians as potential threats to national security. 
""I will protect and develop the army so it stands as a key institution of security that sustains the nation and throne,"" said Narongpan, who will formally take up the new post on Oct. 1. He did not take questions from media.
Army appointments are closely scrutinised in Thailand, where soldiers have taken power 13 times since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha first seized power in a 2014 coup.

Narongpan, 57, belongs to Vajiralongkorn's own King's Guard faction of the army.

He gave it to George, 7, at the weekend, raising the hackles of some Maltese, who thought the tooth should be returned to them. Culture Minister Jose Herrera said on Monday he would ""set the ball rolling"" in retreiving the tooth, but the plan rapidly ran aground.
""It is not (our) intention to pursue this matter any further,"" a ministry spokesman said, without giving any explanation for the abrupt change of heart.
Herrera's move on Monday had raised some negative comments on social media, with critics pointing out that fossilised teeth of megalodon sharks can be bought for less than 50 euros.

Germany has fared better than many other European countries so far during the pandemic, but Merkel told leaders of her party on Monday that the infection rate could hit 19,200 per day if the current trend continues, a party source said.
Merkel told the party leaders ""drastic measures"" must be taken in heavily affected regions, broadcaster RTL reported.
Under a ""hot spot strategy"", the government wants to tighten restrictions to limit parties to 25 people in private and 50 in public places in areas where the infection rate hits 35 per 100,000 over a seven day rolling period, the draft showed.
Temporary bans on serving alcohol would also be enforced.
If the seven-day infection rate hits 50 per 100,000, celebrations in private spaces would be restricted to 10 people and those in public spaces to 25, the draft resolution showed.
Mass-selling newspaper Bild reported that the plans were running into resistance from some of the state premiers, who must still agree to them.
Infections have been rising in Germany for weeks. The case load has leapt by more than 2,000 on some recent days.

A person with knowledge of Merkel's meeting with party leaders on Monday said the chancellor had based the 19,200 number on projections and was referring to the period up to Christmas.

Thailand has kept coronavirus infections low with just 3,559 cases and 59 deaths, but its economy has taken a hit from a ban on foreign visitors since April and is expected to contract 8.5% this year.
Government spokeswoman Traisulee Traisoranakul expects 1,200 tourists in the first month, generating about 1 billion baht ($31.55 million) in revenue and 12.4 billion baht over one year, drawing in 14,400 tourists.
Nationalities permitted to enter will be from countries deemed low risk by the government, which will keep tabs on them. 
""We are not opening the country, we are limiting the number of entries and will manage with wrist bands, apps to follow them,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters. 
The government predicts just 6.7 million foreign visitors this year after a record 39.8 million in 2019, whose spending made up about 11.4% of GDP, or 1.93 trillion baht.
Thailand in January was the first country outside of China to detect the coronavirus, in a visitor from Wuhan.
""Tourists will be on a long stay visa, starting Oct. 8 and will stay in alternative state quarantine for 14 days,"" Yuthasak said.
Visitors need health insurance and a negative coronavirus test 72 hours before travelling and will be tested twice in quarantine.
""Thailand's protection system can prevent a second wave,"" government spokeswoman Traisulee said.
""We have prevented local transmission for 100 days before,"" she said, adding that had made Thailand attractive for visitors wanting to avoid infections.

A police source said the operation began shortly before sunrise. The makeshift camp was home to about 700 migrants, the source added.
Several thousand migrants have attempted the perilous crossing this year, often paying people traffickers to help them traverse one of the world's busiest shipping lanes in overloaded rubber dinghies.
Britain has repeatedly pressed President Emmanuel Macron's government to do more to prevent the migrants leaving France. The British government has called the high numbers who made the illegal crossing this summer unacceptable.
France says it has stepped up patrols. 

Many of the migrants are from Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Syria and countries in Africa, fleeing poverty, persecution or war.

1392,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 04:21AM ET</span>",Puzzled scientists seek reasons behind Africa's low fatality rates from pandemic,"By Alexander Winning
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Africa's overburdened public health systems, dearth of testing facilities and overcrowded slums had experts predicting a disaster when COVID-19 hit the continent in February.
The new coronavirus was already wreaking havoc in wealthy Asian and European nations, and a United Nations agency said in April that, even with social-distancing measures, the virus could kill 300,000 Africans this year.
In May the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that 190,000 people on the continent could die if containment measures failed. Yet as the world marks 1 million COVID-19 deaths, Africa is doing much better than expected, with a lower percentage of deaths than other continents.
The continent's case fatality count stands at 2.4%, with roughly 35,000 deaths among the more than 1.4 million people reported infected with COVID-19, according to Reuters data as at late Monday. In North America, it is 2.9% and in Europe 4.5% 
Hard-hit countries such as Italy and Britain have recorded fatality counts of 11.6% and 9.0% respectively, compared to 1.6% for Ethiopia, 1.9% for Nigeria and 2.4% for South Africa, the continent's worst affected country.
Hospitals in many African countries say COVID-19 admission rates are falling.
""Based on what we have seen so far it is unlikely that we are going to see anything at the scale that we are seeing in Europe - both in terms of infections and mortality,"" said Rashida Ferrand, a London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine professor working at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in the Zimbabwean capital Harare.
Experts say that some COVID-19 deaths in Africa probably are being missed. Testing rates in the continent of about 1.3 billion people are among the lowest in the world, and many deaths of all types go unrecorded.
South Africa saw some 17,000 extra deaths from natural causes between early May and mid-July, 59% more than would normally be expected, according to a July report from the South African Medical Research Council. That suggests the death toll from COVID-19 could be significantly higher than the official figure, currently over 16,000, researchers say. Even so, there is wide agreement that COVID-19 fatality rates have not so far been as bad as predicted.
Why? Scientists and public health experts cite a number of possible factors, including the continent's youthful population and lessons learned from previous disease outbreaks. African governments also had precious time to prepare due to the relative isolation of many of their citizens from airports and other places where they could come into contact with global travellers.
Some scientists also are exploring the possibility that a tuberculosis vaccine routinely given to children in many African countries might be helping reduce deaths from COVID-19.
Another theory being considered is whether prior exposure to other coronaviruses including those that cause the common cold has provided a degree of resistance in some of the very communities once thought to be most vulnerable.
""There is a lot of circumstantial evidence,"" Salim Abdool Karim, a South African infectious disease specialist who has advised the government on COVID-19, told Reuters, ""but there is no smoking gun.""
LESSONS LEARNED
The virus hit Africa later than other continents, giving medical personnel time to set up field hospitals, source oxygen and ventilators, and learn from improvements in treatment elsewhere. 
""We got the gift of time,"" said Thumbi Mwangi, senior research fellow at the University of Nairobi's Institute of Tropical and Infectious Diseases. ""We had an amount of preparation that others did not.""
One reason could be that international travel is limited in many African countries, and travelling domestically can be more difficult than on other continents, Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, told a news conference on Thursday.
The continent's governments have also battled deadly infectious diseases such as Ebola, which killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa in 2013-16. So officials took notice when the new coronavirus started spreading around the globe rapidly early this year.
Many African countries were quick to introduce screening at airports, suspend flights from heavily affected nations and enforce social distancing measures and mask wearing. 
Within a week of Kenya reporting its first case, schools were shut, incoming travellers had to undergo a mandatory quarantine and large gatherings were banned. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, imposed a ban on interstate travel and a curfew. Many of its land borders had already been closed since August 2019 to cut down on smuggling, which helped fight the pandemic too.
South Africa introduced one of the world's toughest lockdowns in late March, when the country had confirmed just 400 cases.
""Africa brought down the hammer earlier in terms of coronavirus lockdowns,"" said Tim Bromfield, regional director for East and Southern Africa at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, a U.K.-based think tank.
Experts also point to the continent's demographics. 
Research has found that the risk of developing severe COVID-19 increases with age. 
A 2019 United Nations report said 62% of sub-Saharan Africa's population was under 25 and just 3% 65 or over. In the U.N.'s Europe and North America region, 28% were under 25 while 18% were age 65 and up.
Chikwe Ihekweazu, director general of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, attributed his country's relatively low case mortality rate in part to the fact that the majority of patients were between the ages of 31 and 40.
CROSS-PROTECTION?
Scientists in several countries including South Africa are testing whether the century-old Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, widely used on the continent against tuberculosis, provides a degree of cross-protection.
BCG vaccines have been shown to protect against other viral respiratory illnesses, and a study published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in July found that countries with higher vaccination rates for tuberculosis had lower peak mortality rates from COVID-19.
Studies have also started in South Africa and Zimbabwe to assess the impact of past exposure to other coronaviruses.
More than half of Africa's urban population is concentrated in slums, where access to water for hand washing is scarce, and physical distancing is near-impossible.
Diseases spread rapidly under such conditions, but some scientists wonder whether that may have been an unexpected boon in this case. There is some evidence that T cells developed by the body's immune system after exposure to other common cold coronaviruses could help fight off COVID-19.
""I would say that is at least a plausible explanation as to why there are different levels of resistance to the virus in different populations,"" said Thomas Scriba, an immunologist and deputy director of the South African Tuberculosis Vaccine Initiative.
Others are more sceptical.
""All other regions have been exposed to coronaviruses, have poor people and slums and have received BCG vaccination,"" said Humphrey Karamagi, team leader for data and analytics at the WHO's Africa office. ""We are most probably looking at a mix of multiple factors working together - and not a single magic bullet.""
For Sam Agatre Okuonzi, from the Arua Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda, the doomsday predictions were informed by entrenched prejudices, including that the continent is prone to disease.

""COVID-19 has shattered a lot of biases about disease in general but also about Africa,"" he told Thursday's briefing. ""The severity of the pandemic has not played out in line with the outrageous predictions.""

Tsikhanouskaya said Macron promised her to help negotiate with the Belarus authorities and secure the release of the political prisoners.
""He promised us to do everything to help with negotiations, (during) this political crisis in our country ... and he will do everything to help to release all the political prisoners"", Tsikhanouskaya told reporters in English after the meeting in Vilnius.
On Monday, on his first day in Vilnius, where Tsikhanouskaya fled into exile, Macron urged Belarus authorities to stop unlawful arrests, release protesters detained arbitrarily and respect election results. 
He had urged Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko to go on Sunday, hardening his stance as tens of thousands marched in Belarus for a seventh straight weekend to demand Lukashenko quit.
Tsikhanouskaya fled Belarus after the Aug. 9 election that the opposition said was rigged.
Macron is expected later in the day to visit French soldiers serving as part of a NATO battlegroup in the Lithuanian town of Rukla.
The French leader is keen to reassure Baltic countries that his policy of ""strategic dialogue"" with Russia, initiated about a year ago, and his criticism of NATO, does not mean weaker French commitment to the security of eastern European countries.

EU countries that escaped Moscow's orbit after the Cold War have criticised Macron's stance towards Russia. They say little has changed to merit a thaw in relations on ice since Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014.

Orban, 57, has repeatedly clashed with other EU leaders over his moves to put the judiciary, media and academics under more state control.
Critics in the European Union say he defends the rights of nation states and ethnic majorities at the expense of the generally accepted rules of civic behaviour. Orban rejected those accusations in an interview with Reuters last week.
""According to the Vice President, in Hungary a 'sick democracy' is being built,"" Orban wrote in a letter to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen published on Tuesday.
Reuters could not immediately verify Jourova's comments cited by Orban.
Orban's call for the ouster of Jourova, in charge of the Commission's work on values and transparency and upholding the rule of law, comes as Hungary is headed for a slower-than-expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Orban has repeatedly used rousing speeches in the past to portray himself as a defender of Hungary's national pride and sovereignty against foreign encroachment, including attacks from ""Brussels bureaucrats"".
The Hungarian economy shrank by 13.6% in the second quarter, the worst downturn in central Europe, 2020 inflation is seen at an eight-year-high and the forint is central Europe's worst-performing currency.
Hungary's weakened prospects could represent the biggest threat to Orban's decade-long rule as he prepares to face parliamentary elections in the first half of 2022.
Germany, current president of the European Union, has proposed a scheme that links access to EU money, including the 750 billion euro recovery fund, to respecting the rule of law.
Hungary and Poland are under EU investigation for undermining the independence of the judiciary, media and non-governmental organisations.

1395,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 29, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Brother of South Korean slain by North rebuffs accusation he tried to defect,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - The brother of the South Korean fisheries official killed by North Korean soldiers at sea last week rejected the government's claim on Tuesday that the man had expressed his willingness to defect to the soldiers. 
The death of the official, who was only identified by his surname Lee, sparked a dispute over why and how he was found floating in North Korean waters nearly 36 hours after he went missing.
The Coast Guard said it has determined after an investigation based on CCTV footage, military intelligence and background records that Lee told the North Korean troops he wished to defect and they were aware of his detailed personal information. 
""We have confirmed that the North side had secured his personal information that he would only know, including his name, age, hometown and height, and that the missing person had conveyed his willingness to go to the North,"" said Yoon Sung-hyun, chief of investigation and intelligence at the Coast Guard. 
Yoon said the possibility was ""extremely low"" that Lee had lost his footing or attempted to take his own life because he was wearing a life vest and a flotation device when found some 38 km (23.6 miles) away from where he went missing. 
Yoon said the official had run up debt of some 330 million won ($282,000) mostly from gambling but it was still unclear whether he sought to flee because of that. 
But the man's brother, Lee Rae-jin, said it must have been an accident as he had been proud of his job, just got a new boat and left a government identification card that would have facilitated his defection. 
He questioned the government's evidence, suggesting the North could have manipulated audios as both militaries frequently eavesdrop on each other. 
""Most old men of our age are indebted and have family issues but who would go to the North because of that?"" he told a news conference. 
Lee accused the government and the military of letting slip ""golden opportunities"" to save his brother by refusing his requests for more ships and helicopters during an initial search while his brother was still floating in the waters. 
He said only several boats and one helicopter were mobilised on Sept. 21-22. His brother went missing on Sept. 21 and was shot dead the following day. 
""My brother had even rejected to join my business, saying he would retire as a public servant and was proud of that,"" he said. 
The Coast Guard and Navy expanded their search for the man's body this week involving dozens of ships after Pyongyang said the soldiers only burned a flotation device he was using, in an effort to head off the risk of a novel coronanvirus outbreak.
South Korea has accused the North of dousing his body in fuel and setting it on fire after killing the man, calling for a joint investigation. 

Pyongyang remains silent about the joint probe as of Tuesday but leader Kim Jong Un has offered an apology. State media said the North was conducting its own search for the man's body but warned the South against raising tension by intruding into its waters.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Human rights group Amnesty International stopped its work in India on Tuesday saying the government had frozen its bank accounts in the latest action against it for speaking out about rights violations.
The group said it had laid off staff after facing a crackdown over the past two years over allegations of financial wrongdoing that it said were baseless.
""This is latest in the incessant witch-hunt of human rights organizations by the government of India over unfounded and motivated allegations,"" Amnesty said in a statement.
Its bank accounts were frozen on Sept. 10, it said.
Amnesty had highlighted rights violations in recent months in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region as well as what it said was a lack of police accountability during riots in Delhi in February, and the government had sought to punish it, it said.
There was no immediate response from government spokesmen to requests for comment. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has faced accusations that it is clamping down on dissent, including in Muslim-majority Kashmir, where insurgents have battled government forces for more than 30 years.
Critics also say the government is pushing a Hindu-first agenda, undermining the secular foundations of India's democracy and raising fears among its 170 million Muslim minority.
The government denies any bias against any community. 
Opposition politician Shashi Tharoor said Amnesty's exit was a blow.
""India's stature as a liberal democracy with free institutions, including media & civil society organisations, accounted for much of its soft power in the world. Actions like this both undermine our reputation as a democracy & vitiate our soft power,"" he said on Twitter.
'FREEZING DISSENT'
Amnesty said the federal financial crimes investigation agency, the Enforcement Directorate, had targeted it.
""The constant harassment by government agencies including the Enforcement Directorate is a result of our unequivocal calls for transparency in the government, more recently for accountability of the Delhi police and the Government of India regarding the grave human rights violations in Delhi riots and Jammu & Kashmir,"" said Avinash Kumar, executive director of Amnesty International India. 
""For a movement that has done nothing but raise its voices against injustice, this latest attack is akin to freezing dissent,"" he said. 
Amnesty and other groups have accused police of complicity in the riots in Delhi in which at least 50 people were killed, most of them Muslims.
Police denied the allegation.
The government has been tightening oversight of foreign non-governmental groups (NGOs), they say.
Last week, the government enacted changes in the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Amendment Bill setting new conditions for organisations. 
Some NGOs said the measures seeking tighter control of funds were aimed at creating an air of distrust.

Kumar said more than four million Indians have supported Amnesty's work in the last eight years and about 100,000 Indians had donated money.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - In Thai classrooms, showing a rebellious or creative streak through what you wear is difficult. 
School uniform rules are strict, down to how pupils' hair should be cut and the type of socks and shoes they are allowed to wear. 
But as students around the country push back against what they call archaic rules and join a broader pro-democracy movement, a young clothing designer is throwing his support behind them in a colourful way. 
Tin Tunsopon has taken the typical uniform of pleated skirts and white sailor shirts for girls and neat shorts and white shirts for boys and blown them up into exaggerated versions with huge collars and sleeve ruffles made from shoe laces.
""By re-creating these uniforms and giving them various designs...people can see that we should no longer be attached to the (traditional) uniforms anymore,"" 23-year-old Tin told Reuters. 
The clothing line labeled the 'rule breakers' was launched in collaboration with the Wacoal lingerie brand in June with prices ranging from $100 to a top end of $475, for a long pleat skirt with a big bow. 
Tin said they are designed for ""modern day girls, who are not afraid to express themselves and move with confidence"".
""The uniforms break away from the traditional forms, although still resembles a uniform ... I want to support kids to be as creative as they can,"" said Tin
Tin has named his label 'Post-Thesis', a nod to his graduation project at Bangkok University, where he examined the purpose of uniforms and how they can be changed.

Police, many of them female officers, responded by spraying plumes of tear gas at the women, some of whom wielded hammers, and threw bottles and paint. 
At least one officer was briefly engulfed in flames after being hit by a Molotov cocktail, before colleagues doused the fire with an extinguisher, television images showed.
Abortion is illegal in Mexico outside the capital city and the southern state of Oaxaca, which legalized the medical procedure last year. In the rest of Mexico, abortion is banned except under certain circumstances, such as rape.

The ""preclearance"" agreement will allow passengers to then proceed directly to connecting flights or to exit the airport after they land in the United States.
Once the program is operational, Brussels will be the first location for U.S. preclearance operations in mainland Europe.
Most Americans are still barred from traveling to the European Union because of the high number of coronavirus cases, but there are some limited exceptions. The United States also bars most people who have recently been in the EU from traveling to the United States.
The agreement has been under discussion for more than five years.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers in Brussels will conduct the same immigration, customs, and agriculture inspections of international air travelers currently performed when passengers arrived in the United States.
""This bilateral agreement strengthens the U.S.-Belgian security partnership and will help our countries stop bad actors at the earliest possible point in the travel continuum,” said CBP Acting Commissioner Mark A. Morgan.
The agreement, which was signed in Brussels by U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Ronald J. Gidwitz and Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs and of Defence Philippe Goffin, must be ratified by the Belgian Parliament, and technical agreements must be completed with the Brussels Airport Company.

The United States currently has 16 preclearance locations in six countries: Ireland, Aruba, the Bahamas; Bermuda; United Arab Emirates and Canada. In 2019, CBP personnel stationed abroad precleared 22 million travelers, representing over 16% of all commercial air travelers arriving in the United States.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Prince George's County, Maryland, has reached a $20 million settlement with the family of an unarmed man killed this year while handcuffed inside a police vehicle, authorities said on Monday.
Corporal Michael Owen fatally shot William Green after arresting him in January 2020, officials have said. He was charged with second-degree murder and is awaiting trial.
The settlement is one of the largest publicized payments to the kin of a victim of police violence in U.S. history.
The family of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old whose 2014 killing by police in Ferguson, Missouri sparked a national uprising against police brutality, received a $1.5 million settlement in the wake of his death. 
This month, the city of Louisville, Kentucky agreed to pay $12 million to the family of Breonna Taylor, whose killing led to months of protests nationwide. Taylor was sleeping when police raided her apartment as part of an investigation into her boyfriend.
The Green case is the first time that Prince George's County, outside the District of Columbia, has charged a police officer with murder for killing someone in the line of duty, county executive Angela Alsobrooks said at a briefing.
""It is our belief that when we are at fault, we take responsibility,"" she said. ""And in this case we are accepting responsibility.""
Tom Mooney, an attorney for Owen, said in an emailed statement that Owen had been charged in a ""knee-jerk"" manner that was ""based on unsubstantiated or discounted facts,"" and that the facts of the case would be revealed in court.
In a statement released after the settlement announcement, Prince George's County State Attorney Aisha Braveboy said that despite the civil settlement, criminal charges were still pending against Owen. 
""It is important to remember that he is presumed innocent and is entitled to a fair trial,"" she said. 
Jury selection for the criminal trial is set to begin in mid-March.

H. Kenneth Schroeder Jr., a magistrate judge in Buffalo, New York, said that Pascale Cecile Veronique Ferrier, 53, a resident of Canada's Quebec province, was a flight risk and had showed an inclination to harm Trump and others if released.
Schroeder said he had considered the government's evidence that Ferrier had nearly 300 rounds of ammunition on her when she was arrested trying to enter the United States earlier this month, as well traces of ricin found at her home in Quebec. 
""I conclude that there is clear and convincing evidence that the defendant does constitute a continuing danger to the president of the United States as well as to members of the community,"" the judge said in the hearing.
The envelope addressed to Trump was intercepted on Sept. 18 at the White House mail sorting facility in Washington, where U.S. Postal Service personnel flagged it as suspicious and contacted the FBI, according to an FBI affidavit filed with the charging documents.
Ferrier was arrested on Sept. 20 on the Canada-U.S. border between Buffalo and Fort Erie, Ontario, and a grand jury in Washington returned an indictment last Thursday, according to court filings.
Schroeder said Ferrier should be placed in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service for the purpose of transferring her to Washington to face the charge that she threatened to kill and injure the president. 

""Unfortunately, this country has a history of witnessing assassinations and attempted assassinations of the president of the United States, going back to Abraham Lincoln and then William McKinley here in this very city of Buffalo, New York, the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan and now numerous threats that have been made allegedly by the defendant against Donald J.

The issue of how Britain should deal with the legacies of its past, especially its role in slavery and colonialism, has been the subject of passionate debate since the statue of a slave trader was toppled by protesters in Bristol in June.
Since then, officials have removed the statue of another slave trader in London, a concert hall in Bristol has renamed itself, and venerable institutions like Oxford University have grappled publicly with what to do about contested heritage.
In a letter sent to the British Museum, the National Gallery, the Tate Gallery and other prominent cultural institutions, culture minister Oliver Dowden said the government was against the removal of statues and similar objects.
""Some represent figures who have said or done things which we may find deeply offensive and would not defend today,"" Dowden said in the letter, which was sent on Sept. 22 but published on Monday. ""But though we may now disagree with those who created them or who they represent, they play an important role in teaching us about our past, with all its faults.""
Some of the institutions in question received funding from slave traders in the distant past, or hold in their collections items taken from distant lands during the colonial period, without consent from the people who owned or created them.
But Dowden said that as publicly funded bodies, they should not be taking actions motivated by activism or politics.
""It is imperative that you continue to act impartially, in line with your publicly funded status, and not in a way that brings this into question,"" he said, adding that this was especially important at a time when government spending was under pressure.
Opposition Labour lawmaker David Lammy was among those who criticised Dowden's stance. 

""History is littered with autocrats instructing museum curators on what to exhibit,"" Lammy wrote on Twitter, accusing the government of stoking a ""fake culture war"" instead of supporting the cultural sector, which has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic.

Cell members ""received military and field training, including on how to make explosives, inside Revolutionary Guards sites in Iran"" for several weeks in late 2017, he said.
The statement said weapons and explosives were confiscated at two locations, a house and a farm, in the Gulf Arab state, the world's largest oil exporter and a key U.S. ally.
Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi'ite Iran are locked in several proxy wars in the region, including in Yemen. Riyadh has blamed Iran for an unprecedented missile and drone attack on the kingdom's oil facilities last year, a charge Tehran denies.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Internal splits in Bolivia's interim government led to the departure of four cabinet members, including the minister of economy, on Monday, stoking uncertainty about the Andean country's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.
Óscar Ortiz stepped down from the economy portfolio, citing ""deep differences"" and pressure from people close to interim President Jeanine Añez, who recently withdrew as a candidate from Oct. 18 general elections after falling behind in the polls.
The election next month, a re-run of a fraught vote last year that plunged the poor, landlocked nation into political crisis, comes as the pandemic has sapped economic growth and eaten into government reserves.
""I will always put principles first over personal interest. No role, no matter how important, justifies going against the principles and ethics that have always guided my actions,"" Ortiz told reporters.
Bolivia's ministers of labor, development and mining have also quit, forcing Añez to appoint replacements.

""I want to finish my administration by leaving the road paved so that the government that comes, regardless of political color, can dedicate itself to creating jobs,"" Añez said.

1412,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Threat to evacuate U.S. diplomats from Iraq raises fear of war,"By John Davison
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Washington has made preparations to withdraw diplomats from Iraq after warning Baghdad it could shut its embassy, two Iraqi officials and two Western diplomats said, a step Iraqis fear could turn their country into a battle zone.
Any move by the United States to reduce its diplomatic presence in a country where it has up to 5,000 troops would be widely seen in the region as an escalation of its confrontation with Iran, which Washington blames for missile and bomb attacks.
That in turn would open the possibility of military action, with just weeks to go before an election in which President Donald Trump has campaigned on a hard line towards Tehran and its proxies.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened to close the embassy in a phone call a week ago to President Barham Salih, two Iraqi government sources said. The conversation was initially reported by an Iraqi news website.
By Sunday, Washington had begun preparations to withdraw diplomatic staff if such a decision is taken, those sources and the two Western diplomats said.
The concern among the Iraqis is that withdrawing diplomats would be followed quickly by military action against forces Washington blamed for attacks.
Populist Iraqi cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who commands a following of millions of Iraqis, last week pleaded for groups to avoid aggravation that would turn Iraq into a battleground.
One of the Western diplomats said the U.S. administration did not ""want to be limited in their options"" to weaken Iran or pro-Iranian militias in Iraq. Asked whether he expected Washington to respond with economic or military measures, the diplomat replied: ""Strikes.""
The U.S. State Department, asked about plans to withdraw from Iraq, said: ""We never comment on the Secretary's private diplomatic conversations with foreign leaders ... Iran-backed groups launching rockets at our Embassy are a danger not only to us but to the Government of Iraq.""
Earlier this month, the United States military said it would reduce its presence in Iraq to 3,000 troops from 5,200.
The Pentagon said on Monday it was committed to supporting Iraq's long-term ""security, stability, and prosperity"" and U.S. military operations against Islamic State continued. 
PERENNIAL RISK
In a region polarised between allies of Iran and the United States, Iraq is the rare exception: a country that has close ties with both. But that has left it open to a perennial risk of becoming a battleground in a proxy war.
That risk was hammered home in January this year, when Washington killed Iran's most important military commander, Qassem Soleimani, with a drone strike at Baghdad airport. Iran responded with missiles fired at U.S. bases in Iraq.
Since then, a new prime minister has taken power in Iraq, supported by the United States, while Tehran still maintains close links to powerful Shi'ite armed movements.
Rockets regularly fly across the Tigris towards the heavily fortified U.S. diplomatic compound, constructed to be the biggest U.S. embassy in the world in central Baghdad's so-called Green Zone during the U.S. occupation after a 2003 invasion.
In recent weeks rocket attacks near the embassy have increased and roadside bombs targeted convoys carrying equipment to the U.S.-led military coalition. One roadside attack hit a British convoy in Baghdad, the first of its kind against Western diplomats in Iraq for years.
On Monday three children and two women were killed when two militia rockets hit a family home, the Iraqi military said. Police sources said Baghdad airport was the intended target.
Two Iraqi intelligence sources suggested plans to withdraw American diplomats were not yet in motion, and would depend on whether Iraqi security forces were able to do a better job of halting attacks. They said they had received orders to prevent attacks on U.S. sites, and had been told that U.S. evacuations would begin only if that effort failed.
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
Iraqis are concerned about the impact of November's presidential election on the Trump administration's decision-making.
While Trump has boasted of his hard line against Iran, he has also long promised to withdraw U.S. troops from engagements in the Middle East. The United States is already drawing down its force sent to help defeat Islamic State fighters in Iraq from 2014-2017.
Some Iraqi officials dismissed Pompeo's threat to pull out diplomats as bluster, designed to scare armed groups into stopping attacks. But they said it could backfire by provoking the militias instead, if they sense an opportunity to push Washington to retreat.
""The American threat to close their embassy is merely a pressure tactic, but is a double-edged sword,"" said Gati Rikabi, a member of Iraq's parliamentary security committee. 
He and another committee member said U.S. moves were designed to scare Iraqi leaders into supporting Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, who has tried to check the power of Iran-aligned militia groups, with scant success.
HAWKS ON BOTH SIDES
The militias are under public pressure to rein in supporters who might provoke Washington. Since last year, public opinion in Iraq has turned sharply against political groups seen as fomenting violence on behalf of Iran.
Publicly, the powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite militia groups which control large factions in parliament have tried to distance themselves from attacks on Western targets.
U.S. officials say they think the Shi'ite militias or their Iranian backers have created splinter offshoots to carry out such attacks, allowing the main organisations to evade blame.
A senior figure in a Shi'ite Muslim political party said he thought Trump might want to pull out diplomats to keep them out of harm's way and avoid an embarrassing pre-election incident.
Militia attacks were not necessarily under Tehran's control, he said, noting that Iran's foreign ministry had publicly called for a halt to attacks on diplomatic missions in Iraq. 

""Iran wants to boot the Americans out, but not at any cost. It doesn't want instability on its Western border,"" the Shi'ite leader said. ""Just like there are hawks in the U.S., there are hawks in Iran who have contact with the groups carrying out attacks, who aren't necessarily following state policy.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - The United States and Greece called on Monday for a peaceful resolution of maritime disputes in the east Mediterranean as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo began a two-day trip to Greece amid increased regional tension over energy resources.
NATO allies Greece and Turkey, at loggerheads on a range of issues, have agreed to resume exploratory talks over contested maritime claims following weeks of tensions.
""The United States and Greece ... reaffirmed their belief that maritime delimitation issues should be resolved peacefully in accordance with international law,"" the United States and Greece, also NATO allies, said in a joint statement after Pompeo met his Greek counterpart Nikos Dendias.
The United States also welcomed Greece's readiness to seek maritime agreements with its neighbours in the region, they said after meeting in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki. 
Tensions escalated last month after Turkey dispatched the Oruc Reis seismic survey vessel, escorted by gunboats, into a disputed area thought to be rich in energy resources, following a maritime agreement signed between Greece and Egypt. 
Turkey has said the pact infringes on its own continental shelf. The agreement also overlaps with maritime zones Turkey agreed with Libya last year, decried as illegal by Greece.
Ankara recalled the Oruc Reis this month, saying it wished to give diplomacy a chance. 
Pompeo said on Monday he hoped the exploratory talks, which are expected to resume soon, will also bring results. 
""We hope the exploratory talks not only get kicked off right, but it's important that they're resolved in a way that delivers outcomes that each of the two nations find more than acceptable,"" Pompeo told the Athens News Agency. 
Pompeo has previously said the United States is ""deeply concerned"" about Turkish actions in the east Mediterranean.
ENERGY TIES
The United States also hopes to build up its energy ties with Greece, which seeks to become an energy hub in the Balkans and help Europe to diversify its energy resources. 
Athens already imports large quantities of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG). It is developing a floating LNG storage and regasification unit off the port of Alexandroupolis, which is expected to channel gas to Bulgaria via the Interconnector Greece - Bulgaria (IGB) pipeline and from there to central Europe by early 2023.
ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), France's Total and Greece's Hellenic Petroleum have set up a joint venture that will look for gas and oil off the Greek island of Crete.
The United States has also expressed interest in the privatisation of the ports of Alexandroupolis and Kavala in northern Greece.
Pompeo and Greek Development Minister Adonis Georgiadis also signed on Monday a science and technology agreement. The two countries want to collaborate on artificial intelligence, cyber security, 5G and privatization of strategic infrastructure, their joint statement said.

Pompeo arrived in Crete on Monday evening. He was due to stay at the Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' residence and visit the Souda military base on Crete on Tuesday.

The measures, which also include wider use of cloth masks for the public in Amsterdam and other big cities, came as daily new infection rates have passed their earlier peak in April. 
(Graphic: https://graphics.reuters.com/world-coronavirus-tracker-and-maps/countries-and-territories/netherlands/)
Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the steps were unavoidable due to the speed of the virus's spread. 
""Naturally these measures will have negative economic consequences,"" he said in a televised press conference. ""But allowing the virus to flare up would have even bigger consequences, including damage to the economy."" 
Businesses were instructed to have employees work from home except when strictly necessary. Bars and restaurants must shut by 10 p.m. 
People were told to avoid non-essential travel between hot spots Amsterdam, Rotterdam and The Hague. Retail stores in those cities will be allowed to refuse customers who do not wear masks. 
Sporting events will be closed to the public and gatherings limited to 40 people. Social gatherings at home must be limited to three guests.
Rutte had said on Friday he was considering regional measures to slow the outbreak, but by Monday the situation had worsened, prompting the nationwide measures.
The National Institute for Health (RIVM) on Monday reported 2,914 new cases, just shy of Sunday's all-time record of 2,995. 
Hospitalisations and deaths are below April's levels, but the head of the country's intensive care units warned that non-essential procedures will be delayed to make way for COVID-19 patients again starting this weekend.

Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said the number of infections was projected to increase to 5,000 per day from a current 3,000 before the measures kick in.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Africa is losing nearly $89 billion a year in illicit financial flows such as tax evasion and theft, amounting to more than it receives in development aid, a U.N. study showed on Monday. 
The estimate, in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development's (UNCTAD) 248-page report, is its most comprehensive to date for Africa. It shows an increasing trend over time and is higher than most previous estimates.
The report calls Africa a ""net creditor to the world,"" echoing economists' observations that the aid-reliant continent is actually a net exporter of capital because of these trends.
""Illicit financial flows rob Africa and its people of their prospects, undermining transparency and accountability and eroding trust in African institutions,"" said UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi. 
Junior Davis, head of policy and research at UNCTAD's Africa division, told Reuters the figure was likely an underestimate, citing data limitations.
Nearly half of the total annual figure of $88.6 billion is accounted for by the export of commodities such as gold, diamonds and platinum, the report said. For example, gold accounted for 77 percent of total underinvoiced exports worth $40 billion in 2015, it showed.
Understating a commodity's true value helps conceal trade profits abroad and deprives developing countries of foreign exchange and erodes their tax base, UNCTAD said.

Tackling illicit flows is a priority for the United Nations, whose General Assembly adopted a resolution on this in 2018, and the report urges African countries to draw on the report to present ""renewed arguments"" in international forums.

HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe's state security minister on Monday alleged a plot by ""rogue elements"" in the opposition working with Western governments to smuggle in guns and foment chaos, signalling another possible crackdown.
Without providing evidence, Owen Ncube told reporters the plot was part of a wider plan to oust President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his government illegally.
Similar accusations have been made against the opposition in the past since the time of former President Robert Mugabe, usually as a precursor to a crackdown.
The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change's (MDC) treasurer David Coltart said the allegations were false. 
""We are committed to non violence,"" he tweeted.
Accused of being no better than the authoritarian Mugabe, the Mnangagwa government has since July detained and charged several politicians, anti-government activists and a journalist, accusing them of inciting violence and planning protests. 
That has drawn criticism from Western embassies in Harare.
""Some rogue elements among us are conniving with some hostile Western governments to smuggle guns and set up so-called Democratic Resistance Committees, that are for all intents and purposes violent militia groups,"" Ncube said.
""These plans are key components of 'Operation Light House', the brainchild of one Western power that seeks to destroy the democratic foundations of Zimbabwe, make the country ungovernable and justify foreign intervention,"" he said, without naming the country accused.
In Zimbabwe, state security ministers rarely hold press conferences and Ncube declined to take questions. 
His comments came after the National Security Council in July denied that Mnangagwa faced a military coup.
He faces growing anger over the worst economic crisis in more than a decade, marked by inflation above 700% and shortages of foreign currency and medicines in public hospitals.

Ncube denied opposition charges that state security agents were abducting and torturing activists.

The interior ministry could not be reached for comment. 
The arrests come after security measures were tightened around the first anniversary of rare demonstrations in Cairo and other cities, triggered by appeals in September last year from an exiled former contractor and actor, Mohamed Ali.
Ali, who had posted videos online lambasting the authorities, called for more protests this month.
Videos posted on social media since Sept. 20 appeared to show several very small demonstrations involving up to several dozen people in different parts of the country. 
Reuters could not independently verify the videos, but security sources confirmed some small and scattered protests on Friday, which they said were mainly in villages and outside big cities. 
In one case, a witness said about 100 men had gathered in an area outside the city of Damietta and chanted ""Leave, Sisi"".
The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms said it had directly documented 249 detentions over the past nine days, while it said another 133 had been documented by other rights groups or lawyers. 
The public prosecutor's office said on Sunday it had ordered the release of 68 minors detained for their alleged participation in ""recent riots"". It did not mention other arrests.
Security forces can be seen deployed in public spaces especially on Fridays, and there have been increased security checks. 
The protests are partly fuelled by economic frustrations made worse by the coronavirus pandemic, and by a major government campaign to impose fines or demolitions on unlicensed housing, activists say. 
In an apparent reference to the protests, Sisi praised Egyptians for enduring tough economic conditions on Sunday and said some were trying to exploit Egypt's challenges to undermine the country but would not succeed.
""They choose the difficult conditions to offend and sow suspicion among Egyptians about what we are doing - that this is at their expense and against them,"" Sisi said during the inauguration of a petrochemical plant. 
""The people and the state are one entity. Nobody intervenes between us and nobody will be able to intervene between us.""
Since his election in 2014 Sisi has overseen a broad crackdown on political dissent, which was extended with a wave of arrests after the protests last September.
Sisi says the government is looking after human rights by working to provide basic needs such as jobs and housing.

At the inauguration, a video on human rights was played that said the ""safety and stability"" of Egypt was one of the most important rights of its people.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said it would lift sanctions, which have caused imports to the landlocked country to slump 30%, once a civilian prime minister was named, as was the case on Sunday, among other demands.
President Bah Ndaw, a retired colonel appointed president of the transition, named veteran diplomat Moctar Ouane as interim prime minister. 
But in a briefing with Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, the ECOWAS envoy to Mali, former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan, said there were still ""grey areas"" to discuss. 
""According to the Special Envoy, the military leaders are yet to satisfy ECOWAS demand of a full civilian as Vice President, and what his roles would be in government,"" a statement after the meeting said. 
Last week, retired colonel Bah Ndaw was sworn in as president, and Colonel Assimi Goita, who led the coup that ousted President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, was sworn in as vice president.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese are in despair at their sectarian leaders who have left the nation without government during the worst crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war that has already driven many into poverty.
Emmanuel Macron, president of Lebanon's former colonial power France who has led international efforts to offer support, also rebuked politicians after his initiative faltered when the prime minister-designate quit amid bickering for ministerial posts.
With politics deadlocked and the economy crushed by debt, Lebanon's pound took a further dive, adding to the pain of citizens, many of whom have struggled to make ends meet since the economic crisis erupted last year.
""The first thing we need is a government,"" said Taleb Tamer, a 31-year-old baker in Beirut, which was hammered by a devastating port blast last month that killed almost 200 people.
""I have rent, household expenses and the pound is finished. God willing, they will form a government to fix the situation. But it needs time,"" he said.
The ruling elite have yet to signal how they will solve the crisis in a nation where politics relies on power-sharing between Christian and Muslim sects. The challenge of finding an exit deepened on Saturday when Prime Minister-designate Mustapha Adib, a Sunni Muslim named on Aug. 31, stood down.
His efforts to form a cabinet of non-partisan ministers ran into the sand after Lebanon's two main Shi'ite groups, the Amal Movement and the heavily armed, Iran-backed Hezbollah, demanded that they name several ministers, including the finance post.
'SCOLDING' POLITICIANS
Lebanon, dubbed the Switzerland of the Middle East before its civil war, has been trying to rebuild since the conflict. But its plans stumbled as debts mounted amid fractious, sectarian politics that have provided fertile ground for regional rivalries to play out between Sunni Muslim Gulf Arabs, Shi'ite Iran and others.
""I am ashamed of Lebanon's political leaders,"" Macron said in Paris on Sunday, after politicians reneged on their promise to him on Sept. 1 to swiftly form a government that could start reforms and trigger vital foreign aid.
He criticised Hezbollah and a leading Sunni politician, former Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri, for their roles in the deadlock.
Macron told politicians this month they could face sanctions if corruption stood in the way of reforms. On Sunday, he said he would give them up to six weeks more to form a cabinet, saying he would only consider sanctions at a later stage.
A source from the Shi'ite political bloc said such words would not push politicians to give ground: ""Does Macron think that by scolding the main political forces, which have weighty parliamentary blocs, he can change their positions by force?""
Macron's new deadline falls after a U.S. election on Nov. 3, when the future of Washington's policy may become clearer. 
President Donald Trump, seeking re-election, has taken a hard line with new or tougher sanctions on Hezbollah, its backer Iran and some Lebanese allies of the group.
It has left many Lebanese feeling their fate would be decided by international politics.

""Iran, Saudi Arabia, France, America, if they agree on a solution between them, then we will have a solution,"" said Ahmed Nassereddin, 40, who was forced to close his shops selling imported clothing brands due to the crisis.

But Information Minister Shibli Faraz said that courts were free to make their own decisions.
Sharif is one of several opposition leaders facing corruption charges and arrested by the anti-graft body, often before a formal case is registered.
An anti-corruption court in Islamabad on Monday also indicted former President Asif Ali Zardari, husband of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, for suspected corruption, a prosecution official said. He was arrested in June last year in a separate case and released on bail.
Opposition parties and civil rights groups have long held that the anti-graft agency is used by the military for selected accountability, saying it does not touch powerful generals or Khan's ministers.
Nine major opposition parties last week denounced the military for meddling in politics and rigging the 2018 elections to bring Khan to power.
The military, which has ruled for half of Pakistan's history since its independence from Britain in 1947, denies interfering in politics or election wrongdoing. 
""If justice had prevailed, retired general Asim Bajwa would have been arrested,"" Maryam Nawaz, daughter of former prime minister Sharif, told a news conference after her uncle's arrest.
Bajwa, who oversees the $65 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and is also an adviser to PM Khan, was recently embroiled in controversy following a news report that alleged he had amassed assets worth millions of dollars beyond his means.

He has publicly denied the allegations.

The dozens of warrants for key ""authors"" of the crime, including military personnel and federal and municipal police, were announced on Saturday, the sixth anniversary of the kidnapping.
The still-unsolved disappearance exposed deep flaws in Mexico's criminal justice system and sparked one of the worst crises of the prior administration. 
Lopez Obrador urged those arrested to cooperate, and said the soldiers for whom arrest orders have been issued are no longer in active service.
""We are looking for those detained to be considered protected witnesses. ... We have to break the pact of silence,"" he told his daily news conference. ""If they collaborate, they will have considerations of legal character.""
It was not clear what type of protection would be offered, or if collaboration could be a factor in sentencing.

The students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College disappeared on Sept. 26, 2014, in the state of Guerrero. The remains of only two of the students have been positively identified so far, while evidence of a third student was never definitively confirmed.

The unnamed boy, who was visiting Britain with his family, was thrown from a 10th-floor viewing platform by teenager Jonty Bravery on August 4 last year, falling 100 feet (30 metres) onto another roof. 
His mother was heard by witnesses screaming: ""Where's my son? Where's my son?""
The boy, aged just six at the time of the attack, endured months of fear and rehabilitation. 
""He can at last stand on his legs without any help or support,"" his parents said. ""Still, and only a few moments, because he still has not regained his balance in walking, but we are so happy to see him like that!""
""Regarding food, he now eats almost alone (after everything has been cut out and prepared for him) and, in a suitable glass, he begins to drink slightly thickened liquids! It’s a very important progress.""
Bravery, who was 17 at the time of the incident, was jailed for at least 15 years in June after pleading guilty to attempted murder.
He told police he had planned to hurt someone at the museum to be on television. He had researched how to kill people on the internet the previous day, and before the incident he had asked a member of the public the location of a tall building.

Bravery, who has autistic spectrum disorder and a personality disorder, is now being held at the high security Broadmoor Hospital.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Al-Aqsa Mosque is as quiet today as it was turbulent 20 years ago when it gave its name to the Palestinian uprising that began beneath its walls and carved a bloody new chapter in the Middle East.
The Al-Aqsa Intifada – also known as The Second Intifada - began with rocks and tear gas before mushrooming into an armed conflict in which more than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were killed.
When it petered out five years later, suicide bomb attacks on Israeli cities, and Israeli air strikes and tank raids on Palestinian towns, had polarised opinion on both sides. The last peace talks flopped in 2014, and stalemate has simmered since. 
Gazing over the walled Old City from the Mount of Olives, Palestinian Jerusalemite Ziad Abu Zayyad sees many parallels between the situation two decades ago and now.
Now 33, and after two intifadas, the first in the late 1980s, the statehood that Abu Zayyad has sought all his life still seems as far off as it was then.
But his generation also harbours vivid childhood memories of violence during the years of the intifada, and despite recent political setbacks, many are reluctant to revisit that trauma. 
“I do believe the Palestinian people need to be smart and think wisely before they choose the path that they want to go into. It is not only the end of the road that matters, but also the journey itself that history will remember,” said Abu Zayyad.
“Intifada can be made in different shapes. It may be by using a pen and writing, by opening a blog and reaching out to the people, by having a diplomatic effort - even though it has proved to be useless these days.” 
WEST BANK
The uprising ignited on Sept. 28, 2000 after Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon - a right-wing former general detested by many Palestinians - held a walkabout on Jerusalem’s most hotly contested holy site.
Protests broke out around the hilltop plateau in the Old City compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Sanctuary) and Jews as the Temple Mount, and quickly escalated.
Israel blamed then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who two months earlier at Camp David had failed to clinch a peace agreement with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. 
The abortive summit proved a watershed for both sides – Palestinians unwilling to accept less than a viable state in what is now Israeli-occupied territory with its capital in East Jerusalem - which includes the Old City, and Barak publicly concluding that Israel had “no partner for peace”.
Thirteen km (eight miles) north of the Old City – a plaque near her home marks the exact distance – Palestinian engineer Leen Anabtawi can see Jerusalem from one side of her balcony, and an Israeli settlement from the other.
She remembers playing with empty bullets as a four-year-old in the West Bank town of Jenin during the intifada, her first encounter with Israelis, she said, being soldiers who took over the upper floors of her family’s building to fire into Jenin's refugee camp, considered a stronghold for Palestinian militants.
Growing up in Jenin, studying in Nablus and now working in Ramallah, the seat of the Palestinians' limited self-rule administration, Anabtawi has watched her generation evolve since the “scary” intifada years.
“My friends started focusing on different things,” she said. “It’s hard to take action when you have so much to care about... your children, your school, your future, your life, your loans.”
Her own focus is now personal - to compete with Israeli engineers as an equal.
“Existing as a Palestinian is resisting,” she said. “Growing up to be a strong, powerful intellectual person who has a (voice), who has an idea and an aim is resisting these days.”
HEBRON AND GAZA
While Israel looms large in discussions, many young Palestinians are also frustrated at their own leaders - plagued by years of infighting that has undermined young people's faith in political action.
Some accuse the leadership of suppressing political expression, arresting activists and journalists and - in their view - cooperating with Israel in policing the West Bank.
Some have established their own grassroots initiatives.
Basil al-Adra, 24, set up tourist routes around his village near Hebron to teach Palestinians what it is like to live in a rural area among fortified Israeli settlements.
“The best way of resistance for me is national peaceful resistance,” he said at a recent awards ceremony to recognise his family's project. “The most important thing in life to have my own legitimate rights like any other person in the world.”
But others still believe that force of arms is the only way to achieve their goals, including in Gaza, from which Israel withdrew its settlers and soldiers unilaterally in 2005. 
Two years later the enclave was taken over by the Islamist movement Hamas, which is sworn to Israel's destruction, and Gaza has been under a tight Israeli-led blockade ever since.
In the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, Mohammad Shahin, 24, often attended weekly protests that were held on the border with Israel in 2018, hurling stones and rolling burning tyres at Israeli soldiers.
“We want a new Intifada in order to break the blockade and drive the enemies out of our occupied land,"" said Shahin, 24.

""They have no place here, these are our lands and they came from Western countries. I support resistance whether by stones, rockets, arms, tires or petrol bombs.""

NITSANEI OZ, Israel (Reuters) - A huge Palestinian flag suddenly looms up above the grey concrete slabs of Israel’s West Bank barrier, a rare glimpse of ""the other"" before it disappears in your rear-view mirror.
Farther north around ancient Armageddon and the tourist lookout points of Mount Gilboa, a wrong turn leads to a warning sign, or a gap in the trees reveals a West Bank Palestinian village below in the distance.
The relative rarity of these fleeting glimpses shows how, 20 years after the Second Palestinian Intifada (uprising), many Israelis ceased seeing the Palestinians as prospective peace partners, and prefer not to see them at all.
Israel credits the barrier with having stemmed Palestinian suicide bombings and shooting attacks during the five-year intifada, in which more than 1,000 Israelis and 3,000 Palestinians were killed.
Palestinians say it was a land grab that cuts miles into the West Bank and was designed to annex parts of the territory that Israel captured and occupied in the 1967 Middle East war, and which Palestinians seek for a future state.
The International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled in an advisory opinion in 2004 that the barrier was illegal under international law. Israel rejected this, accusing the court of being “politically motivated”.
But there is little argument that the barrier has shifted the geographical terms of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – radically changing the dynamic between two intertwined peoples.
While West Bank Palestinians could before 2000 easily walk or drive into Israel, a generation later, some Israelis are now most likely to encounter them while serving as soldiers at a checkpoint – unless they are among the 450,000 Israelis now living in West Bank settlements.
And from border communities such as Nitsanei Oz just inside Israel, miles of fencing, walls and watchtowers between them and the West Bank have become an immutable reality. 
“By building the fence we did create a fact on the ground - a one-side fact,"" said Shachar Goldrat, 36, in Tel Aviv.
“It did create a situation of some measure of security, so yes, it was a way to give up and say, 'We are not going to have a peace treaty any time soon.'”
SEPARATION PROCESS
The uprising erupted on Sept. 28, 2000 after Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon paid a high-profile visit to Jerusalem’s most fiercely disputed holy site, the walled Old City compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble (OTC:NEBLQ) Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
Palestinians regarded Sharon's walkabout as a calculated provocation, but Israel accused then-Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of inciting violence - two months after a failed peace summit in the United States.
Palestinians signalled they would accept nothing less than a viable state in what is now Israeli-occupied territory with its capital in East Jerusalem, while many Israelis concluded that they had no ""partner for peace”.
Just 60 km (40 miles) south of Israel's coastal metropolis Tel Aviv lies Gaza, where two million Palestinians live under the control of the Islamist movement Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States.
Since Israel unilaterally withdrew troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005 and Hamas took over the narrow enclave, there has been even less direct contact – besides the frequent threat of rockets fired by Palestinian militants into Israel, and of Israeli air strikes into densely populated Gaza.
The West Bank barrier and Gaza pull-out were both spearheaded by Sharon, who was by then prime minister.
""What we intended was a process of separation from the Palestinians,"" a former Sharon former adviser, Eival Giladi, told Reuters. “It was a vision of putting down the Intifada so that then we could make progress, not under the pressure of terrorism, but by being proactive and strong.”
Giladi regrets what he calls a ""lost decade"", when, he believes, Israel “did not make wise use of the positive conditions we had to hand” to bring about “a more successful result with the Palestinians”.
The last round of peace talks collapsed six years ago.
But Israeli historian Benny Morris said that after living with the daily fear of explosions in buses and restaurants, the main impact of the intifada was the “hardening of Israelis' positions” toward Palestinians.
The barrier was one expression of that, Morris said.
""Israelis have gone off Palestinians. They want as little as possible to do with them, want as few of them around as possible and the fence helps that situation emerge,"" he told Reuters.
“Over 1,000 Israelis were killed by bombers, snipers, in restaurants and so on and this made Israelis extremely angry. I'm sure the Israeli reaction to that made the Palestinians angry. But it made the Israelis understand that the Palestinians are really not interested in making peace but only in destroying Israel. I think that was the major effect on Israelis.”
Some Israelis, however, want a rethink - not least after months in which the coronavirus pandemic – respecting neither religion nor politics - has forced lockdowns everywhere.
“I think that we cannot look to the past, we have to look to the future,"" said Dror Gal, a 65-year-old lawyer in Tel Aviv.

""And mainly during these days of the virus...we should have to cooperate, we should live together - to survive together.""

A video shared on social media showed dozens of villagers visiting the grave of Ion Aliman, a Social Democrat, to light candles after voting had ended in Sunday's local elections.
""It is your victory,"" one man can be heard saying. ""Know that you will be proud of us. Rest in peace.""
Aliman won his third term as mayor of Deveselu, a village of around 3,000 people in southern Romania, with 64% of the vote, electoral bureau data showed on Monday.
""He was a real mayor to us,"" one unnamed woman who wore a surgical mask told private television station ProTV in Deveselu. ""He took the side of the village, respected all the laws. I don't think we will see a mayor like him again."" 
Aliman, a former navy officer who would have turned 57 on Monday, died on Sept. 17 in a hospital in Bucharest. His name was already on the printed voting ballots and could not be removed, officials said. A new election will be held.
In 2008, a village in eastern Romania also knowingly re-elected their mayor who had died just after voting began.
Despite Aliman's victory, his Social Democrat Party lost key cities and county councils across Romania on Sunday to the centrist minority Liberal government and USR-Plus, an alliance of two centre-right groupings. 

Romania has reported 123,944 COVID-19 infections since late February, with 4,748 deaths, the highest fatality rate in the European Union's eastern wing.

1436,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 09:56AM ET</span>","Britain, Canada, EU throw weight behind 2030 biodiversity protection goal","By Kate Abnett and Simon Jessop
BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and Canada on Monday joined the European Union in pledging to protect 30% of their land and seas by 2030 to stem ""catastrophic"" biodiversity loss and help galvanise support for broader agreement on the target ahead of a U.N. summit. 
With the twin crises of climate change and wildlife loss accelerating, leaders are trying to build momentum ahead of the meeting in Kunming, China, in May, where nearly 200 countries will negotiate a new agreement on protecting nature.
""We must act now – right now. We cannot afford dither and delay because biodiversity loss is happening today and it is happening at a frightening rate. Left unchecked, the consequences will be catastrophic for us all,"" British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said. 
""Extinction is forever – so our action must be immediate.""
Without action, 30% to 50% of all species could be lost by 2050, threatening economic and social prosperity, a report by The Nature Conservancy charity this month said. For example, losing bees, butterflies and other pollinators could cause a drop in annual agricultural output worth $217 billion.
Scientists have said a minimum of 30% of the planet must be safeguarded, through protected areas and conservation. A draft of the Kunming agreement includes this pledge. 
While Monday's pledges did not detail specific actions nor funding plans, protected areas are usually managed to ensure the long-term conservation of nature. This can mean curbing or banning commercial or extraction activities, ensuring unspoiled natural areas remain unspoiled, or restoring and maintaining ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.
""We have both the responsibility and the opportunity. We have the second largest land mass, a fifth of the world’s freshwater, and the longest coastline in the world, that together are critical for biodiversity and for securing carbon in nature in the fight against climate change,"" Canada's Environment Minister Jonathan Wilkinson said.
ACTION PLEDGE
In England, where 26% of land is already protected, the government said an extra 4,000 sq km would be safeguarded to meet the 30% goal.
However, E.J. Milner-Gulland, professor of biodiversity at the University of Oxford said: ""It's great to get another 4%, but that, in itself, is not going to be a transformative thing in this country - and particularly if there's no funding."" 
The EU's executive Commission has already proposed a target for the 27-country bloc to legally protect 30% of its land and sea by 2030. That would safeguard 4% more land and 19% more seas than today.
A growing body of evidence suggests that it pays to protect nature. Expanding areas under conservation could yield a return of at least $5 for every $1 spent, according to a paper by more than 100 researchers, published in July.
But so far, funding has fallen far short. The Nature Conservancy report said the world needed to spend an extra $598 billion to $824 billion each year over the next decade to reverse the extinction crisis.
Separately on Monday, more than 60 countries - also including EU states, Britain and Canada - committed to 10 actions to reverse the loss of biodiversity by 2030, including integrating nature protection into COVID-19 recovery plans, increasing financing to protect the natural world, and clamping down on marine pollution and deforestation.

The pledge was signed by countries including Mexico, Bangladesh, Germany and Norway. Notable absences were Brazil and Indonesia - two hotspots of deforestation - and China and the United States, the world's top two emitters of greenhouse gases.

SUBOTICA, Serbia (Reuters) - Dozens of migrants from the Middle East and Africa have set up tents outside Subotica, a town in northern Serbia, with a view to sneaking over the nearby border with Hungary and on to Western Europe.
According to the Asylum Protection Centre, there are around 1,000 migrants in the northern province of Vojvodina waiting to try to cross into neighbouring countries including Romania and Hungary en route to wealthier parts of the continent.
A further 1,000 or so were in Belgrade, many of them living in the open air in parks or on river banks before they also moved north towards the border.
""We have 150 migrants entering the country from the south every day,"" said Rados Djurovic, executive director of the centre.
Samir, from Morocco, said he had tried to cross the border with Croatia to travel on to Germany, but was stopped by police and military patrols. Now he is outside the camp in Subotica waiting to cross to Hungary.
""We are staying here, we have nothing, we are waiting, and I pray all the time that I will make it to (Western) Europe some time,"" he told Reuters.
He and others had pitched tents in the grounds of a government-run refugee camp, where men sat in groups eating walnuts, talking or looking at their smartphones.
Migrants queued up for bread being distributed by volunteers, but few, if any, wore masks despite the coronavirus pandemic.
Svetlana Palic, spokeswoman for the government's commissionaire for refugees, said overall migrant numbers in Serbia were some 30% higher than the same time last year.
She did not say why, but strict policies in Hungary to control the number of migrants entering its territory as well as patrols in Croatia mean some are stuck in Serbia's north.
Their plight is back in the headlines after a fire on the Greek island of Lesbos razed a refugee camp housing more than 12,000 people to the ground, stranding most of them.
Last week the European Union launched a contentious plan to overhaul migration rules that have long divided the bloc, including an element that would de facto oblige each state to host some refugees.
Eastern nations Poland and Hungary are strongly opposed to such measures.
Serbia was a focal point for migrants in 2015, when more than a million people fleeing wars and poverty in the Middle East and Asia made it to the EU's shores, overwhelming security and welfare networks, and fomenting far-right sentiment.
Samir's friend Adil Faris said: ""I know the border is closed and that it is not easy, but we will find a way.""

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court nominee Barrett would have final say on recusal calls,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats are urging U.S. Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett to recuse herself from any election-related cases because of President Donald Trump's comments that he expects the justices to potentially decide the outcome, but there is no way to force her to do so.
Although U.S. law requires justices to step aside when there is a conflict of interest or genuine question of bias, it leaves the individual justice to decide whether such a conflict exists. Aside from direct financial and personal conflicts, they rarely do so.
Trump on Saturday nominated Barrett to the vacancy created by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Sept. 18. If confirmed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate, Barrett would give the court a 6-3 conservative majority.
On Wednesday Trump said he wanted the full complement of nine justices on the court as soon as possible in part because he believes the court will determine the outcome of the Nov. 3 presidential election.
""I think this will end up in the Supreme Court, and I think it's very important that we have nine justices,"" he told reporters at a White House event.
The Supreme Court has determined the outcome of a U.S. presidential election only once, in 2000, leading President George W. Bush to the White House.
Trump indicated that the Supreme Court would rule in his favor with nine justices on board. He alleged they would respond to an unspecified ""scam that the Democrats are pulling"" in relation to increased use of mail-in ballots as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump has repeatedly and without evidence attacked mail-in balloting, a longstanding feature of U.S. elections.
'ETHICAL COMPLICATION'
Senate Democrats say they will probe Barrett on the subject during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the hope she will pledge to step aside in election-related cases.
Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who serves on the committee, said on Sunday he would ask Barrett about recusal when he meets her.
""If she does not recuse herself, I fear that the court will be further de-legitimized,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
There are no indications Republican senators share those concerns, with Republican Senator Mike Lee, speaking on ABC's ""This Week,"" saying that recusal decisions would be up to Barrett.
During previous Senate hearings, Supreme Court nominees have routinely declined to commit on how they would approach cases that could come before them.
Federal law requires a justice to step aside from cases ""in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned."" In a 2011 report, conservative Chief Justice John Roberts said he had ""complete confidence in the capability of my colleagues to determine when recusal is warranted.""
Legal experts told Reuters that under the way the law has been interpreted up until now, the new justice need not recuse herself from any election issue.
But New York University School of Law legal ethics expert Stephen Gillers noted that should a decisive election issue come before the justice, Democratic candidate Joe Biden could be justified in filing a motion asking her to recuse.
""I believe that would be a persuasive argument in this unique circumstance,"" he said.
He noted that in 2000, when the Supreme Court decided the election in favor of Republican Bush, none of the justices were appointed by either candidate, although Democratic candidate Al Gore was vice president to President Bill Clinton, who appointed both Ginsburg and Justice Stephen Breyer.
This time, there would be three justices on the bench appointed by Trump himself.
Both liberal and conservative justices have been pressed by critics in the past to recuse themselves in cases with perceived conflicts. Litigants can file motions seeking recusal but rarely do.
In 2004, the Sierra Club environmental group asked conservative Justice Antonin Scalia to step aside in a case concerning then-Vice President Dick Cheney, a friend of the justice. Scalia refused, saying his impartiality could not reasonably be questioned.
During the 2016 presidential race, liberal Ginsburg criticized then-candidate Trump as a ""faker,"" prompting cries by conservative critics of bias. Ginsburg later expressed regret for her remarks but did not step aside from any case involving Trump.
Despite calls from some conservatives for her to recuse herself, liberal Justice Elena Kagan participated in a 2012 ruling upholding President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act, the healthcare law dubbed Obamacare. Kagan had served as Obama's top Supreme Court advocate when the law was enacted in 2010 but said she played no role in its conception.
Kagan, appointed to the court by Obama in 2010, recused herself from other cases on which she had worked in Obama's administration.

Justices routinely step aside when they have financial conflicts, such as owning stock in companies with cases before the court.

Greece was on the front line of a huge surge of refugees and migrants to Europe in 2015 and 2016, many through its outlying islands close to Turkey including Lesbos. The flow has since ebbed.
Police said 35 people linked to non-governmental organisations were under investigation for providing support to traffickers ferrying migrants to the island. The workers gave information over encrypted messaging apps on assembly points on the Turkish shore and geographical coordinates of landing areas, according to the police.
""Α preliminary investigation from the prosecutor is under way. We have identified the persons involved,"" a police official told Reuters without giving further details. 
The names of the aid groups the individuals work for have not been disclosed. The police official said Greek intelligence services were also involved because the workers were thought to have passed on details of Greek coastguard movements.
In a statement, Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said authorities were cooperating with many NGOs but would not tolerate NGOs ""with illegal activity"".

There are about 15,000 asylum seekers on Lesbos. Earlier this month the primary processing camp, Moria, was destroyed in a fire, forcing thousands to flee. Some 9,000 have now been relocated to a temporary tent camp.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian police fired warning shots on Monday during a protest in Papua by several hundred university students opposing plans to extend a special autonomy status that critics say has not done enough to help people in one the country's poorest areas.
The 2001 Special Autonomy Law which is set to expire next year was supposed to give the area a larger share of revenue from its rich resources and more political autonomy.
""Despite the funds, health care isn't guaranteed and education remains minimal,"" student Ayus Heluka said by telephone after attending Monday's rally at Cendrawasih University in the Papuan capital of Jayapura. 
Papuan police spokesman Ahmad Kamal confirmed by telephone that police had fired warning shots but denied a claim by a lawyer at the rally that two students had been hurt and three arrested.
Video and photo footage on social media showed people running in panic after shots were heard. 
There has been a flare-up in tensions in Papua between security forces and separatists groups in recent weeks, with the deaths of at least two civilians and two soldiers, including the shooting of a popular Christian pastor. 
Papua has been plagued by separatist tensions since the former Dutch colony was incorporated into Indonesia after a U.N.-backed 1969 referendum called the Act of Free Choice, which has been widely criticised by human rights groups. 
Extensive protests erupted in 2019 in several cities in Papua in response to claims of racist abuse and physical mistreatment of Papuan students in the city of Surabaya.
Some Papuan pro-independence groups warn demonstrations against the renewal of the special autonomy law could persist.
The government has previously said it working to develop the region. An official at the home ministry's regional autonomy office, which oversees the issue, declined to comment on Monday, when asked about Monday's rally and extending the law.
Adriana Elisabeth, who researches Papuan communities, said that were benefits from special autonomy, such as scholarships and infrastructure, but said the benefits ""do not reach those in the grassroots.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan police seized four tonnes of sodium nitrate, used in the making of car bombs and improvised explosive devices, officials said, in one of the largest such seizures in the country's 19-year insurgency.
The chemical was seized from a truck in Kabul on Sunday. The driver had been arrested and investigations were under way, interior ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said.
The government has not said which militant group was responsible. Sodium nitrate is also used in fertilisers and preservatives but it has been banned in Afghanistan for years. 
The Taliban, Islamic State and other militant groups operate in Afghanistan and have carried out major attacks in and around the capital. 
The National Directorate of Security (NDS) said on Sunday it had detained seven Islamic State members in the eastern city of Jalalabad, including a man believed to be in charge of planning urban area bombings.
An NDS statement said the group planned to target a gathering of Afghan security forces or tribal elders in the eastern province of Nangarhar, where Islamic State has carried out a number of attacks this year. 
Suicide bomber vests, weapons and explosives were also seized.
Afghan and Taliban negotiators have been meeting in Doha since Sept. 12 hoping to agree on a ceasefire and a power-sharing deal. But they have been bogged down on procedures even before discussing their agenda. 
Violence has risen despite the talks and the Taliban have rejected calls for a ceasefire.
Taliban fighters on Saturday launched attacks in the central province of Bamiyan in the bloodiest clash in the area, considered one of the safest in the country, since the start of the 19-year war.
Clashes continued for two days, with nine police killed and the Taliban suffering heavy casualties, Latif Azimi, spokesman for the Bamiyan provincial governor, said.
A Taliban statement said their fighters clashed with a convoy of security forces and that 30 Afghan commandos were killed.

After meeting Polish Foreign Minister Zbigniew Rau in Budapest, Peter Szijjarto said an EU report on the rule of law, which will soon be discussed in Brussels, was expected to be a political statement, rather than any well-founded assessment.
""The aim of this institute of comparative law would be that we should not be taken for fools,"" Szijjarto said, adding that he had ""had enough of some western European politicians using us as a punchbag"".
The institute would examine how the rule of law was upheld across the EU, to avoid ""double standards"" being applied to Hungary and Poland, he said.
The Law and Justice party (PiS) government in Poland - as well as its nationalist ally, the Hungarian government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban - have long been at loggerheads with the EU over accusations that they undercut democratic standards.
While both post-communist states benefit from generous EU handouts, their rulers have come under pressure for putting courts and judges, media and academics, non-government organisations and rights groups under direct government control.
In an interview with Reuters on Friday, Orban denied undermining democracy.
An EU summit in July agreed that the bloc's next joint budget for 2021-27, worth a trillion euros, and access to a linked economic recovery fund worth a further 750 billion euros to help repair damage done by the coronavirus pandemic, should both include conditions that member states adhere to the rule of law.
However, the exact details have not yet been set down, with the European Parliament pushing for tougher conditions than those agreed at the summit, and Warsaw and Budapest threatening to veto anything that would threaten their benefits.
Rau said the new institute would promote debate and transparency within the EU.

""A legal debate cannot be replaced by a political debate,"" he said.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - At least 21 people were killed on Monday in a second day of heavy clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh that reportedly involved air power, missiles and heavy armour.
The confrontation between the two former Soviet republics has rekindled concern over stability in the South Caucasus, a corridor for pipelines carrying oil and gas to world markets.
Any move to all-out conflict could drag in major regional powers Russia and Turkey. Moscow has a defence alliance with Armenia, while Ankara backs its ethnic Turkic kin in Azerbaijan.
Majority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan have come to blows periodically in their decades-long conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway region that is inside Azerbaijan but run by ethnic Armenians. 
Armenia's parliament condemned what it said was a ""full-scale military attack"" by Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh that was receiving Turkey's help, adding that Ankara's involvement could risk destabilising the region. Azerbaijan denied its ally Turkey was taking part in the fighting.
Azerbaijan declared a partial military mobilisation, and its foreign minister said six Azeri civilians had been killed and 19 wounded. An Armenian defence ministry representative said 200 Armenians were wounded, Interfax reported. 
Nagorno-Karabakh reported 15 more of its soldiers had been killed, after saying on Sunday that 16 of its servicemen had been killed and over 100 wounded when Azerbaijan attacked.
Nagorno-Karabakh also said it had recovered some territory that it had lost control of on Sunday, and said Azerbaijan had been using heavy artillery to shell areas.
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Azeri town of Terter north of Nagorno-Karabakh.
Interfax news agency quoted the press secretary of Azerbaijan's defence ministry, Anar Evyazov, as saying the Azeri military occupied several strategically important heights near the village of Talish in Karabakh.
""Missile, artillery and air strikes are being applied to the enemy's positions, which forces the enemy to surrender the held positions,"" he said, adding that several important strategic heights around Talish village had been taken. 
FLURRY OF DIPLOMACY
Evyazov also said Lernik Babayan, commander of the Armenian military's airborne assault battalion, had been killed near Talish. It was not immediately possible to verify the report.
The clashes have spurred a flurry of diplomacy. 
China urged both sides to show restraint. Russia called for an immediate ceasefire and Turkey said it would support Azerbaijan. 
Under international law, Nagorno-Karabakh is recognised as part of Azerbaijan. But the ethnic Armenians who make up the vast majority of the population reject Azeri rule. 
They have run their own affairs, with support from Armenia, since Nagorno-Karabakh broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that erupted as the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.
Although a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.

At least 200 people were killed in a flare-up of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in April 2016. At least 16 people were killed in clashes in July.

Yahaya Aminu Sharif was sentenced last month by a sharia court in Kano, the commercial hub of Nigeria's mostly Muslim north, after he was accused of sharing the song on WhatsApp.
""Music is not a crime,"" read a joint statement from the group of U.N. rapporteurs.
""Application of the death penalty for artistic expression or for sharing a song on the internet is a flagrant violation of international human rights law, as well as of Nigeria's constitution,"" said Karima Bennoune, special rapporteur on cultural rights.
The rights experts said Nigeria should overturn the death sentence and guarantee the singer's safety while he launched an appeal. Protesters enraged by the song burned down Sharif's family home on March 4.
There was no immediate reaction from the judicial authorities in Kano, which runs sharia alongside civil courts.
The state's justice system has been in the spotlight since a sharia court also sentenced a 13-year-old boy to 10 years in prison last month after he was accused of making blasphemous statements during an argument.
The head of Poland's Auschwitz Memorial has written to Nigeria's president asking him to pardon the boy, Omar Farouq, and offering to serve part of the jail term himself.
Kano's sharia courts are active, but death sentences for blasphemy are unusual and the most recent, handed down in 2015 to nine followers of the Tijani Muslim sect, have yet to be carried out.

The case stems from Torra's refusal to follow the orders of Spain's electoral committee to remove symbols supporting jailed and self-exiled independence leaders from his government palace during a national election campaign in 2019. He defended his actions on the grounds of freedom of expression. 
The ruling can be appealed but it takes effect once it is fully notified, meaning that deputy Catalan leader Pere Aragones is set to soon become acting head of the regional government.

The ban may prompt a snap election in the northeastern Spanish region to find a replacement if, as expected, the regional parliament does not vote a candidate for the post in the coming days.

The suspect, who is from Pakistan, wounded two people who had stepped outside for a cigarette in front of the old offices of the Charlie Hebdo magazine. His clothes were spattered in blood when he was arrested shortly after the attack. 
The video was found on the suspect's mobile phone, French media reported. Reuters could not independently authenticate the video recording. A police source confirmed a video was being examined.
In the video, the suspect identifies himself as Zeheer Hassan Mehmood and says he came from Mandi Bahauddin in Punjab province. Starting to sob, he then recites poetry praising the Prophet Mohammad.
""If I'm sounding emotional, let me explain: here, in France, the caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad were made,"" he says in Urdu. ""I am going to do (an act of) resistance today, Sept. 25.""
The cartoons were first published by Charlie Hebdo in 2006 and spurred Islamist militants to target the magazine's office in 2015 in an attack that left 12 people dead and was claimed by al Qaeda. 
The weekly, which moved to a secret location after the attack, republished the cartoons earlier this month to mark the beginning of the trial of 14 people with alleged links to the Charlie Hebdo killers. 
For Muslims, any depiction of the Prophet is blasphemous. 
Wearing a long tunic, the suspect said he was spiritually guided by Ilyas Qadri. Qadri is a Sunni cleric and the founder of Dawat-e-Islami, a non-violent organisation spread across the globe. 

Qadri says a person who commits blasphemy should be handed in to police, but if another individual were driven by their emotions to kill the blasphemer, the law should not apply.

ZURICH (Reuters) - The Swiss government is sailing into rough waters as it seeks to tackle a new treaty on relations with the European Union, even though it won a weekend referendum against domestic eurosceptics seeking to strengthen curbs on immigration from the bloc.
Voters rejected by 62%-38% on Sunday the right-wing Swiss People's Party's (SVP) push to scrap a pact allowing free movement of people from the EU to a nation where foreigners make up a quarter of the population of 8.6 million.
But the resounding referendum triumph does not translate into easy acceptance of the wide-ranging treaty with the EU that has lain dormant for two years. 
Arguments over state aid, EU citizens' access to Swiss welfare benefits and unilateral Swiss rules designed to protect high wages from competition by cross-border workers on temporary assignments have proved too tough a nut for the Swiss side to crack in domestic talks to forge a consensus.
Critics say the deal infringes so much on Swiss sovereignty that it would never win a majority in parliament or a binding referendum practically sure to arise under the Swiss system of direct democracy
Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter said after Sunday's vote that the government would take weeks to establish its position and resume talks with Brussels on the draft treaty, which would have Bern routinely adopt single market rules and create a new dispute settlement platform.
'LOVE-HATE STORY'
That is unlikely to go down well in Brussels, already so irked by Swiss foot-dragging that it launched a battle over cross-border stock trading last year.
""Switzerland and the EU is a love-hate story,"" newspaper Le Temps wrote. Despite the weekend vote, ""never has the conclusion of a framework agreement ... seemed further away.""
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen welcomed the vote as positive for Swiss-EU ties, adding she would speak soon to Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga to congratulate her.
""Of course, I look forward to the Swiss (cabinet) now moving swiftly on the signature and ratification of the International Framework Agreement that we negotiated in 2018,"" she added.
Swiss politicians across the political spectrum and labour leaders have said they could not endorse the treaty as it stands and called for maintaining the status quo of 120 custom-made bilateral pacts governing ties, at least for now.
That could be a hard sell for the EU, which is loath to give Switzerland any concessions that British negotiators could seize on in separate EU negotiations over Brexit. 
Tages-Anzeiger newspaper columnist Fabian Fellmann said the Swiss government would have to play for time while it sought domestic support and Brexit was finalised. 
""That may seem timid, but it is better than heading for an open break with the EU,"" he wrote.
European Council President Charles Michel had kind words for the Swiss at the weekend. But he tweeted on Friday he would not accept cherry-picking from either London or Bern.

""Access to the EU's large market will no longer be sold off. From now on, we will better enforce the level playing field, in a market open to those who respect its standards. Whether they leave our Union or want to move closer to it,"" he wrote.

In the southern part of the Yellow Sea, drills including live-fire exercises will be held from Monday to Wednesday, it said in another notice.
All ships are prohibited from entering the area, it said.
In a bid to train a combat-ready military force, China holds military drills periodically, but rarely do multiple exercises happen at the same time.

PALAISEAU, France (Reuters) - A schoolteacher whose body, face and tongue are covered in tattoos and who has had the whites of his eyes surgically turned black said he was prevented from teaching at a French kindergarten after a parent complained he scared their child.
But the teacher, Sylvain Helaine, 35, still teaches children from the age of six up, and said that, after an initial shock when they see him for the first time, his pupils see past his appearance.
""All of my students and their parents were always cool with me because basically they knew me,"" said Helaine, who estimated he has spent around 460 hours under the tattooists' needle.
""It's only when people see me from far away that they can assume the worst.""
He said last year he was teaching kindergarten at the Docteur Morere Elementary School in Palaiseau, a suburb of Paris, when the parents of a three-year-old child complained to educational authorities. They said their son, who was not taught by Helaine, had nightmares after seeing him.
A couple of months later the school authorities informed him he would no longer teach kindergarten children, he said. ""I think the decision they took was quite sad,"" said Helaine.
A spokesman for the local education authority said an agreement was reached with Helaine to move him away from teaching kindergarten. Pupils under six ""could be frightened by his appearance"", the spokesman said.
Despite the setbacks, Helaine said he would stick with his chosen career. ""I'm a primary school teacher ... I love my job."" 
He said he started getting tattoos at the age of 27 when, while teaching at a private school in London, he had an ""existential crisis"". Since then, he said, ""Getting tattoos is my passion."" 

He said he hoped to show his pupils that they should accept people who are different from the norm. ""Maybe when they are adults they will be less racist and less homophobic and more open-minded,"" he said.

The roll-on roll-off ferry, carrying 803 passengers and 186 crew, sank on a stormy Baltic Sea shortly after midnight on Sept. 28, 1994. The official investigation in 1997 concluded that the bow shield had failed, damaging the bow ramp and flooding the car deck. 
However, Sweden said that a Discovery (NASDAQ:DISCA) Network documentary about the disaster included new underwater video images from the wreck site showing damage on the starboard side of the wreck.
""Estonia, Finland and Sweden have agreed that verification of the new information presented in the documentary will be made,"" the foreign ministers of the three countries said in a joint statement on Monday.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Senior Afghan peace official Abdullah Abdullah arrived in Pakistan on Monday for meetings in a country seen as vital to the success of Afghan talks aimed at ending decades of war.
During his three-day visit to Islamabad, Abdullah, a former foreign minister and chairman of Afghanistan's High Council for National Reconciliation, will meet Prime Minister Imran Khan as well as Pakistan's foreign minister.
Relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan have long been rocky. Afghanistan and its international allies have for years accused Pakistan of backing Taliban insurgents as a way to limit the influence of old rival India in Afghanistan.
Pakistan denies that and in turn accuses Afghanistan of letting anti-Pakistan militants plot attacks from Afghan soil, which Afghanistan denies.
""Pakistan fully supports all efforts for peace,"" its foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement.
""The visit of Dr Abdullah Abdullah will contribute to further strengthening amity, brotherhood and close cooperation.""
The United States has acknowledged Pakistan's help in fostering Afghan peace efforts including in encouraging the Taliban to negotiate.
The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, said last week the United States and its allies were looking at an agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan so that neither side's territory would be used to attack the other.
Khalilzad was the architect of a February pact between the United States and the Taliban allowing U.S. troops to withdraw from Afghanistan in exchange for Taliban guarantees on international terrorism.
But Prime Minister Khan, in an opinion piece in the Washington Post on Saturday, expressed concern that Afghanistan could again be used as a haven for international militant groups and warned that a ""hasty international withdrawal from Afghanistan would be unwise"".
There have also been concerns that the Afghan peace process could increase militancy in Pakistan as fighters now in Afghanistan seek refuge on the Pakistani side of the border.
Afghan and Taliban negotiators have been meeting in Doha since Sept. 12 hoping to agree on a ceasefire and a power-sharing deal. 

But they have been bogged down on principles and procedures for talks even before discussing their agenda.

MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Russian rebels during fighting in eastern Ukraine. All 298 people aboard were killed. 
After an international investigation lasting nearly six years, four defendants went on trial in absentia in March, of whom only Oleg Pulatov has instructed a lawyer to defend him.
""He did not contribute and he was not involved. What's more, he did not and does not have any knowledge of how and why MH17 was downed,"" his lawyer Sabine ten Doesschate said at the Hague District Court.

Since mid-September, Omid Tootian has been living in a small tent in Cyprus's buffer zone, a United Nations-controlled slice of territory carved out after a war split Cyprus in 1974. 
A musician critical of Teheran, Tootian left Iran for Turkey four years ago. Fearful for his safety in Turkey where he claimed other Iranian dissidents had disappeared, he traveled to northern Cyprus, a statelet recognized only by Ankara. From there, he planned to travel to its internationally recognized Greek Cypriot south.
That is where his plans stalled.
""The police didn't let me in,"" Tootian, 45, told Reuters, saying officers on the Greek Cypriot side cited restrictions because of COVID-19. ""So I got stuck here in between.""
'Here' is a slice of territory about 500 meters wide separating opposing sides in central Nicosia, Cyprus's ethnically split capital. The buffer zone, as it is known, fans out east to west, 116 miles (180 kms)long. 
Tootian has pitched his tent in the overgrown garden of a home abandoned during the war. Shutters with peeling paint hang off hinges on windows still stacked with sandbags. A building next door housing peace groups has the only visible sign of activity in the area.
The area is named after the Ledra Palace, a hotel on the other side of the road where a British contingent of United Nations peacekeepers stays. 
After 29 years of being sealed shut, it was the first crossing point opened to the two communities in 2003. In February, the coronavirus outbreak effectively sealed it again.
Now only a few people, and overwhelmingly locals, use the corridor. The Greek Cypriot side does not allow non-Cypriots through because of coronavirus restrictions. 
But despite having tested negative for COVID-19, Tootian says, he was still turned back four to five times. He says he will not return to the Turkish Cypriot side because he fears he will be deported to Turkey, and from there, back to Iran.
""I have no choice. I will either stay here or they will take me in, there is no other option,"" Tootian said.
The Cypriot interior ministry, responsible for asylum matters, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 

A spokesperson for the UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, said they had communicated with Cypriot authorities on the need to allow Tootian access to services to apply for international protection, enshrined in national and EU law.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin won out in negotiations on the candidate to lead a key state on Monday, after winning a weekend election that was seen as a litmus test of his leadership amid a fresh challenge for his post.
Muhyiddin's ruling coalition narrowly won Saturday's electoral contest in Sabah state, in what was widely seen as a referendum on his seven-month-old administration and just days after opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim declared he had a ""formidable"" majority in parliament to oust the premier.
But questions linger over Muhyiddin's grip on power, especially amid signs of an increasingly tenuous alliance with former ruling party UMNO threatening his already razor-thin parliamentary majority.
Muhyiddin's Saturday win was almost immediately tested by UMNO, which wanted their candidate named as chief minister. Both sides eventually agreed to name Hajiji Noor, from Muhyiddin's Bersatu party, after two days of marathon meetings.
At the federal level, UMNO had said last week that some of its lawmakers now wanted to support Anwar as premier.
Anwar, in turn, has to convince King Sultan Abdullah that he has the numbers to form a government. The palace is expected to issue a statement on Monday, but officials did not say what it would be about.
""While Muhyiddin is PM and leader of the ruling coalition, it is UMNO which commands the most seats,"" said Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, senior associate at political consultancy Vriens & Partners.
""The Sabah result, if anything has failed to provide any clarity or closure over Malaysia's political impasse as the tug-of-war involving lawmakers' support of both the ruling government as well as the opposition continue.""
Muhyiddin rose to power in March after forming an alliance with opposition parties, including UMNO. Allies have pressured him to seek early polls to secure a strong mandate.

But cracks in his federal coalition began showing in July, when UMNO declared it was pulling some of its support for Muhyiddin after its former leader and premier Najib Razak was sentenced to jail over the 1MDB scandal.

A closely watched 1News-Colmar Brunton poll showed support for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's party, which is seeking a second term, is at 47%, down 1 percentage points since the last poll on Sept. 22.
This means Labour, which is campaigning on its record of bringing the novel coronavirus under control, would have 59 seats in Parliament, two short of the 61 seats needed to form a government. 
But support for its possible coalition partner the Green Party rose to 7%, which would give it eight seats.
The Labour Party is still widely expected to form the next government. Another poll released on Sunday showed Ardern's party was poised to retain power.
Support for the opposition National Party was at 33% in the latest poll on Monday, up two percentage points, after its tough-talking conservative leader Judith Collins was praised for her performance in a leaders' debate last week. 
Ardern's popularity as preferred prime minister was steady at 54%, while Collins rose to 23%, up 5 percentage points from the last poll.
Smaller parties also continued to gain more support.
All recent polls have pointed to a victory for Ardern's Labour Party, governing in a coalition with the Greens and New Zealand First.

Ardern, 40, has won support at home and global admiration for her response to last year's attack by a white supremacist on two mosques, a fatal volcanic eruption and her success in tackling the coronavirus.

The reports did not say whether the six suspects were among those already being tried in absentia in an Istanbul court for Khashoggi's killing.
State-owned Anadolu news agency said that two of the suspects were facing charges carrying aggravated life jail sentences, while the charges against the other four carried sentences of up to five years in jail.
The Istanbul prosecutor's office declined to provide immediate comment on the media reports.
A Saudi court this month jailed eight people for between seven and 20 years for the murder, four months after Khashoggi's family forgave his killers and enabled earlier death sentences to be set aside.

Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was last seen at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. His body was reportedly dismembered and removed from the building and his remains have not been found.

Pell left Rome in July 2017 to face charges for sexually assaulting two choirboys in the late 1990s. He was convicted in December 2018 and served just over a year in jail before Australia's High Court overturned the conviction in April.
The 79-year-old cardinal has been living in Sydney since his release.
""He always intended to return to Rome,"" said Katrina Lee, Pell's close friend who is an executive adviser to the Archdiocese of Sydney. 
She confirmed a report in the Herald Sun newspaper which said Pell was flying to Rome on Tuesday, but said she did not know how long he was going for or the aim of the trip.
When he left Rome in 2017, Pell was head of the Vatican's Secretariat of the Economy which was working on cleaning up the church's vast finances and eliminating abuse. 
His trip to Rome comes just days after a powerful Vatican cardinal, Giovanni Becciu, was fired after Pope Francis accused him of embezzlement and nepotism.
Pell and Becciu were at odds over reform of the Vatican's accounts.
In a statement sent to the Catholic News Agency on Sept 26, Pell said: ""The Holy Father was elected to clean up Vatican finances. He plays a long game and is to be thanked and congratulated on recent developments."" 
""I hope the cleaning of the stables continues in both the Vatican and Victoria,"" Pell said. He was charged with child sex abuse in the Australian state of Victoria.

News of the meeting is likely to annoy Moscow, which rejects the finding of German, French and Swedish experts that Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent in Russia last month. Russia has repeatedly criticised Berlin for what Moscow says is a failure to share information on the case.
Confirming a report by German news magazine Der Spiegel, Navalny wrote on Twitter that it was ""a private meeting and conversation with the family"".
He added: ""I am very grateful to Chancellor Merkel for visiting me in hospital.""
A spokesman for Merkel earlier declined to comment on the Der Spiegel report.
The Navalny case has further worsened relations between Moscow and a number of western countries. Merkel has faced calls to halt the nearly-completed Nord Stream 2 pipeline bringing Russian gas to Germany.
Navalny was flown from Russia to Berlin last month after falling ill on a domestic flight. He received treatment in the Charite hospital for 32 days before being discharged last week.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigerian labour unions agreed with the government on Monday to suspend a planned strike over fuel and power price rises hours before businesses were due to grind to a halt, the labour minister and trade unions said. 
The Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), which represents millions of workers across most sectors of Africa's biggest economy, including parts of the oil industry, last week announced its plans to embark on a general strike. 
Nigeria cut costly subsidies in September to allow the petrol price to be determined by the market and increased the power tariff. President Muhammadu Buhari had said Nigeria could no longer afford the subsidies but the unions said a reversal of price hikes was needed to avert the strike.
The strike was due to begin on Monday but Labour and Employment Minister Festus Keyamo said in a statement, posted on Twitter, that an agreement was reached between the government and unions at 2:53 a.m. (0153 GMT). ""Strike suspended,"" he wrote. 
He said the deregulation of petrol pump prices would remain in place and the government would roll out a financial support package for workers, and a joint committee comprising of government officials and labour union members would over a two-week period examine the justification for the electricity tariff policy. 
A communique issued by the NLC and the Trade Union Congress (TUC) stated that the strike had been suspended and outlined the details outlined by Keyamo. 
Africa's top oil exporter has been under pressure from international lenders such as the World Bank to carry out reforms to qualify for budget support loans after the coronavirus pandemic triggered an oil price crash that slashed the government's income.
Cheap fuel prices have long been seen by many in Nigeria as a benefit of living in an oil-producing country. Previous attempts to eliminate subsidies were scuppered due to social unrest.

China has ramped up efforts to get international groups and companies to refer on their websites and in official documents to democratic, Chinese-claimed Taiwan as being part of China, to the ire of Taiwan's government and many of its people. 
Over the weekend, Taiwan officials expressed anger after the Brussels-based Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy began listing on its website its six Taiwan member cites as belonging to China.
The mayors of the cities then wrote an open letter calling for the decision to be reversed.
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said after the protest, the group had reverted to its original designation of the cities as being part of Chinese Taipei, a name Taiwan uses in some international bodies like the Olympics to avoid Beijing's objections to their participation.
The European Union ""helped us in this effort"", Wu told parliament, without giving details.
""We are very happy that with everyone's hard work the name has reverted,"" he said.
""Though some people may not be happy with this name, at least the way we participate is not placed under another country.""
The EU's de facto embassy in Taipei did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and neither did the Global Covenant. 
No EU member states have diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the EU itself tends to keep a low profile when it comes to Taiwan, wary of upsetting China, its second largest trading partner.
In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Taiwan was an inalienable part of Chinese territory.
""Cities in the Taiwan region certainly should be listed as Chinese,"" he told reporters.

The Global Covenant says its mission is to ""galvanise climate and energy action across cities worldwide"". The only Chinese city it lists as a member is Hong Kong.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey sees a European Union summit this week as an opportunity to reset relations between them, but the bloc must produce specific proposals and a timetable to work on a roadmap together, President Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman said.
Tensions flared between Turkey and EU member Greece after Ankara sent a seismic vessel to explore for hydrocarbons in disputed waters in the eastern Mediterranean last month and the Oct. 1-2 summit aims to calm the bitter dispute. 
A Turkish and a Greek warship collided during the standoff and Turkey has since recalled the Oruc Reis vessel to allow for diplomacy. Ankara and Athens have agreed to resume talks over their contested maritime claims.
However, the row has also brought to a head strains between EU candidate Turkey and the bloc over issues such as migration, Turkey's involvement in Syria and Libya and what the EU says is growing authoritarianism under Erdogan.
""I believe the EU summit has a chance to have a reset in Turkey-EU relations. It is an important opportunity. We can have a reset there. And I see this willingness on the part of many EU member countries,"" presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told Reuters.
""They also have to understand that they cannot expect Turkey to do everything,"" Kalin said in an interview. ""It must be a mutual process. If Turkey is expected to do X, Y, Z, EU countries must fulfil their responsibilities as well.""
Senior EU diplomats and officials have said the bloc is unlikely to follow through on a threat to impose sanctions on Turkey after Ankara's agreement last week to resume exploratory talks with Greece, which were halted in 2016.
Work was continuing on deciding a date for the resumption of talks, Kalin said, adding the talks would continue where they left off and focus not just on issues of continental shelves and maritime limits, but on islands and air space.
He said he believed the talks would have a positive impact and would also focus on political consultation and military-to-military talks. ""In all of these three tracks we believe we will make some good progress very soon,"" he said.
Turkey got involved in a war of words with France during the east Mediterranean dispute and Erdogan last week held his first talks with French President Emmanuel Macron in months in a bid to ease the tensions. 
Kalin said there was a positive atmosphere in those talks with the two leaders agreeing to try and find ways to minimise their differences.

""I believe all these things will produce a more positive agenda and a more positive atmosphere between Turkey and France,"" he said.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China expects a significant rebound in domestic travel over the upcoming Golden Week holiday after the sector was pummelled by the novel coronavirus for months, with some flights selling out and travel platforms reporting a surge in hotel bookings.
The pent-up demand is fuelling optimism the Chinese travel industry has reached a turning point, with hopes the eight-day holiday from Oct. 1 will supercharge a tentative pickup seen in recent months, even as some trepidation over the virus lingers.
While the world's second-largest economy is now largely back to normal, though there are still pockets of lingering weakness such as tourism, Capital Economics said in a recent note.
China's resurgent travel industry offers a striking contrast to business in some other parts of Asia as well as in the United States and Europe, where the novel coronavirus is still circulating and gatherings are restricted.
The holiday to mark modern China's founding is traditionally one of its busiest times for travel, and not just at home. Last year, 782 million trips were made, with more than 7 million people travelling abroad, according to government data.
""The demand on tourism that was suppressed for nine months will probably be released in these eight days,"" said online travel platform Trip.com (O:TCOM) in a statement, estimating that 600 million trips could be made.
China has largely stamped out its coronavirus epidemic, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan late last year, and many restrictions on domestic travel have been lifted. 
Few people, however, are expected to venture abroad due to various quarantine requirements around the world and a dearth of overseas flights. On Monday, the Foreign Ministry announced that people should avoid international trips unless ""truly necessary"" due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
But more domestic air bookings were made between Oct. 1 and Sept. 14 than in the year-earlier period, with a surge in August, and economy seats on popular routes, like Beijing to the southwestern city of Lijiang, have sold out, according to travel service provider Qunar.com.
Hotel and airline bookings made during the week of Sept. 8-15 exceeded those made during the same period last year, Alibaba-backed online travel platform Fliggy said, with hotel bookings for Golden Week up by more than 50%.
LONGING TO FLY
Spending on hotels during the holiday is expected to recover to last year's level, or even see slight growth, according to the research department of China's  Meituan Dianping  (HK:3690), whose on-demand service apps span groceries to hotels.
""People want to fly somewhere, there is this pent-up demand as they're sick of staying at home,"" said Mei Xin, retail analyst at Huatai Securities.
But still, some coronavirus caution remains.
People often have to show health-tracking QR codes, which have played a key part in containing the virus, and some hotels are asking guests to get coronavirus tests before arriving.
And some families are being asked to stay at home.
In cities like Beijing and Shanghai, schools have asked parents and students not to go away for the holidays unless strictly necessary. 
Beijing-based television producer Pan Lei, 45, said he felt he had to cancel a family trip to the Yellow Mountain tourist area after getting a notice from his children's schools. 
""I lost the money I paid in advance,"" he said. 
But he said it was understandable there were fears of a second coronavirus wave this winter. 

""Schools want to cut risks to the minimum.""

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's city of Melbourne, its hotspot in the second wave of coronavirus infections, is on track to return to near normal by Christmas, strengthening hopes for major summer sporting events to go ahead amid a general economic revival. 
Southeastern Victoria state recorded a single digit rise in new cases for the first time in three months on Monday, with the lifting of some of the toughest curbs its capital of Melbourne, such as a night-time curfew, Premier Daniel Andrews said.
""That is a very, very significant set of numbers. We are well ahead of schedule,"" Andrews told a daily news conference, anticipating a move to ""COVID normal"", with most curbs eased.
However, he urged people to stick to strict social distancing rules, despite the rigours of an eight-week-old lockdown to limit the second wave.
""If people don't do the right thing in the final few weeks of the lockdown, or if they lie about where they've been, there's no COVID-normal Christmas,"" he said.
Stringent rules in Australia's second most populous state have proved divisive, with some provoking criticism from businesses, protest groups and even federal authorities.
Victoria announced changes to its ""triggers"" to determine further easing after announcing an immediate end to nightly curfews and possible advancement of the next round of such easing by a week, to Oct. 19.
The latest relaxation allowed 127,000 people to return to work on Monday, at manufacturing and food processing industries among others, offering a boost to the hard-hit economy.
But Melbourne retained strict curbs on where people can go and ordered a fine of nearly A$5,000 ($3,527) for those flouting limits on gatherings to two households in an outside space.
Victoria reported just five new virus cases and three deaths in the past 24 hours, down from a daily tally that topped 700 in early August. 
The most populous state of New South Wales reported on Monday its second consecutive day without a virus case in more than three months, as did the northeastern state of Queensland.
Andrews said the downward trend in new infections bodes well for summer sporting events, such as the annual Boxing Day cricket test match and the Australian Open tennis tournament. 
""What I can say, though, is, if we all stay the course and we continue to see these numbers down, that it becomes more possible to have a crowd of some size,"" Andrews said.
Australia's tally of infections stands at just over 27,000 with 875 deaths, with Victoria contributing about 75% of cases and nearly 90% of all deaths. 
The numbers are still well below those in many other developed nations battling new waves of infection.
New Zealand recorded no new cases overnight as a recent outbreak eased. That has fuelled talk of travel between the Pacific neighbours resuming by year-end.
It was ""possible"" that New Zealanders would be able to travel to some Australian regions before Christmas, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told state broadcaster TVNZ on Monday.
Plans for a travel 'bubble' between the neighbours lost pace following the Melbourne resurgence of the virus and Auckland's second wave of infections.

1473,By Bloomberg,"<span>Sep 28, 2020 01:36AM ET</span>",Brexit Talks Enter Key Week With Time and Trust Running Out,"(Bloomberg) -- The U.K. and European Union are starting a key week of Brexit talks, with the bloc stiffening its demands over how any trade deal will be enforced after losing trust in Boris Johnson because of his attempt to rewrite last year’s divorce agreement.
The final round of scheduled discussions between the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, and his British counterpart, David Frost, begins in Brussels on Tuesday with officials on both sides expressing cautious optimism a deal can be reached.
If the two sides make enough progress by Friday, they could embark on a two-week period of intense discussions -- the so-called Brussels “tunnel” -- to hammer out an accord in time for a summit of EU leaders on Oct. 15, Johnson’s self-imposed deadline for striking a deal.
If they don’t, Britain would be almost certain to crash out of the EU’s single market at the end of the year without a trade accord, potentially poisoning relations with the bloc for a generation. Businesses and consumers would be left grappling with additional costs and disruption as quotas and tariffs return for the first time in a generation.
The two main obstacles to an agreement remain deciding which of the EU’s state aid rules the U.K. will have to follow after leaving, and what access fishing boats from the bloc will have to British waters. But doubts about Johnson’s willingness to abide by pledges he has previously made have only added another layer of difficulty to striking a deal, two EU officials close to the talks said.
The prime minister’s Internal Market Bill would break some of the agreements the U.K. made when it left the EU to prevent customs controls between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, a move that the government in London concedes breaks international law.
EU officials say the disagreement can be ironed out -- or made moot if the two sides reach a zero-tariff, zero-quota trade agreement. But the bloc has threatened Johnson with legal action unless the government amends or withdraws the legislation by the middle of this week. The row has cast a shadow over the negotiations over the U.K. and EU’s future trade and security relationship, the officials said.
The two sides will attempt to smooth things over on Monday afternoon when Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic hold separate talks on the implementation of the Irish border agreement.
Technically, the U.K. and EU are trying to keep that issue at arms length from Barnier and Frost’s negotiations over their future relationship -- but officials privately acknowledge a row at Gove and Sefcovic’s joint committee on Northern Ireland could set the rest of the week’s discussions back further.
The controversy over the Internal Market Bill has convinced the EU, as well as many European countries, that there needs to be a stronger “governance” mechanism in the deal, the two officials said. The EU doesn’t want to take the U.K’s commitments on trust; it wants to make them legally binding and accompany them with clear sanctions to stop Johnson from unilaterally breaking them in future.
That still leaves the two major sources of disagreement to resolve -- the so-called level playing field, or rules to ensure fair competition between British companies and their EU rivals, as well as fisheries.
The former is still proving hard to resolve principally because of the British government’s reluctance to set out what its future policy on state aid will be. On the latter, the U.K. is seeking a completely different way of calculating fishing quotas that would allow British boats to catch far more than they do at present. The EU is still strongly opposed to this, with countries like France warning that it could destroy their own fishing industries.
In a statement on Friday, the U.K. government noted that the “differences on fisheries and the level playing field remain significant” and that a lot of work still needs to be done. “If the gaps in these areas are to be bridged, the EU’s more constructive attitude will need to be translated into more realistic policy positions in the days to come.”
More than three out of four businesses surveyed by the Confederation of British Industry, the U.K.’s biggest business lobby group, want a deal to be signed, with almost half saying the coronavirus pandemic has hindered their preparations for Brexit.
It’s possible the negotiations will drag on beyond Johnson’s Oct. 15 deadline, but not by far. The EU views the end of October as the very last moment to sign a deal. It will need to translate a treaty of hundreds of pages into all its official languages to give to each of its 27 governments and then be ratified by the European Parliament -- all by Dec. 31.

The Beijing city government said it would offer rewards to health workers who disclose vital information about any imminent health emergency, and will also ensure their safety and legal rights are protected. 
Workers could in urgent situations skip the chain of command and report health risks directly to the local government, it said, and as long as their intent was not ""malicious"", they would not face punishment if information turned out to be false.
Beijing also said it would strengthen its monitoring network, set up specialist infectious disease hospitals and establish ""sentries"" at the community level to keep watch for symptoms like fever. 
The central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the COVID-19 outbreak first began, has been criticised for its heavy-handed treatment of medical staff who first tried to reveal details of a new and unknown pneumonia-like disease at the end of 2019.
Li Wenliang, one of the doctors warned by local police, later became one of the most high-profile victims of the coronavirus, causing nationwide outrage.
Chinese officials have acknowledged that the COVID-19 outbreak exposed ""shortcomings"" in their ability to handle epidemics, and they have promised to take action to improve early warning systems and free up the flow of information.
The government said in May that it would empower local disease control centres to take early action in the event of any new outbreak, though experts said the measures did not go far enough to address ""systemic"" flaws.
They say China's top-down political system does not give local governments the authority or the funding to take the timely action required to tackle outbreaks.

Last month, the city government of Shenzhen also unveiled new guidelines allowing medical workers to disclose information about infectious diseases. They also gave local authorities powers to take emergency action more quickly.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bradley Parscale, the former campaign manager for President Donald Trump's re-election campaign, was hospitalized Sunday after his wife told police he was threatening to harm himself, ABC News reported.
The Fort Lauderdale, Florida, police department confirmed in a statement that a man identified as Parscale was detained after they received a report from his wife.
""Officers made contact with the male, developed a rapport, and safely negotiated for him to exit the home,"" the department said in a statement. They did not directly identify him as Trump's former campaign manager, but a property deed identifies the co-owner of the property as Candice Parscale, the same name as the wife of the former campaign manager.
On the scene, police spoke with Parscale's wife, who advised them her husband ""was armed, had access to multiple firearms inside the residence and was threatening to harm himself,"" the statement said.
Parscale was demoted from leading Trump's re-election bid in July, after the president was lagging behind former Vice President Joe Biden in the polls. He drew blame internally for a botched Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally in June that drew an underwhelming crowd, and led to a subsequent coronavirus outbreak.

""Brad Parscale is a member of our family and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible,"" said Tim Murtagh, a Trump campaign spokesman, in a statement, without specifically confirming the incident.

ST. HELENA, Calif. (Reuters) - A wind-driven wildfire erupted on Sunday in the heart of northern California's Napa Valley wine country and spread across more than 1,000 acres (404 hectares), forcing the evacuation of several hundreds homes and a hospital, authorities said.
Fire crews were out in force, scrambling to fend off flames threatening neighborhoods and vineyards in the northwest corner of the famed wine-growing valley, about 75 miles (120 km) north of San Francisco. 
The blaze, dubbed the Glass Fire, broke out before dawn near Calistoga and raced toward the adjacent towns of Deer Park and St. Helena, with flames advancing to within a mile of the Adventist Health St. Helena hospital.
All 55 patients who were at the hospital at the time were safely evacuated by ambulance and helicopter over the course of five hours, beginning around 7 a.m. in the morning, hospital spokeswoman Linda Williams (NYSE:WMB) told Reuters.
""We had ambulances lined up from all over the Bay area,"" she said, adding that while the facility was surrounded by smoke, the skies over the hospital itself remained clear enough for helicopters to land and take off with patients who needed to be evacuated by air.
It was the second wildfire-related evacuation of the 151-bed hospital since August, coming on the heels of a massive cluster of lightning-sparked blazes that swept several counties north of the San Francisco Bay region. 
Some 600 homes were placed under evacuation orders, with residents of another 1,400 dwellings warned to be ready to flee at a moment's notice, according to California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire) spokesman Tyree Zander. About 5,000 people in all were affected by evacuation notices, he said.
By 1:30 p.m., flames stoked by winds gusting up to 50 miles per hour (80 kph) had scorched some 1,200 acres (485 hectares) of grassy rolling hillsides and oak woodlands, with zero percent containment, Zander said. 
FIRE AT HARVEST TIME 
The fire's cause was under investigation. There were no immediate reports of injuries, but a Reuters photographer in St. Helena saw a number of structures that had been burned.
The blaze erupted midway through the traditional grape-harvesting period in the Napa Valley, world renowned as one of California's premiere wine-producing regions. The area's 475 wineries account for just 4% of the state's total annual grape harvest but half of the retail value of all California wines sold, according to the Napa Valley Vintners trade group.
Napa and other wine-growing regions have been plagued by a series of wildfires in and around the Bay area over the past several years. Susan Krausz, co-owner of Arkenstone Estate Vineyards in Angwin, said it would take days or weeks to assess the impact of the latest blaze on valley vintners.
""Most people have harvested,"" she said, adding, ""Any time's a bad time for a fire.""
Tom Kaljian, 78, a realtor who owns a house about halfway between Calistoga and St. Helena, defied evacuation orders to spend the day with his wife hosing down their home and dry brush along a fence line separating their property from the Silverado Trail, one of the area's main north-south roadways.
""We were told to get out of here, but I was trying to protect our little abode, so we stayed,"" he told Reuters by phone, adding that firefighters stopped by later to tell him his house was no longer in danger.
""I stopped watering at that point, and came in and took a nap,"" he said. 
The Glass Fire came as the Pacific Gas and Electric Company announced it was temporarily shutting off power to transmission lines in portions of 16 counties across northern and central California as a precaution against heightened wildfire risks posed by hot, windy, dry conditions.
The public safety power shutoffs were expected to affect some 65,000 homes and businesses in the region, said PG&E, the state's largest electric utility.
A red flag warning for extreme wildfire risks was to remain posted for Napa Valley through Monday morning, Zander said. 

CalFire said a fire weather watch was due to go into effect on Monday across much of Southern California due to a forecast return of hot, gusty Santa Ana winds and low humidity from San Diego to Los Angeles and Ventura counties.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump paid just $750 in federal income taxes in both 2016 and 2017, after years of reporting heavy losses from his business enterprises to offset hundreds of millions of dollars in income, the New York Times reported on Sunday, citing tax-return data.
In a report that Trump dismissed as ""fake news,"" the Times said the Republican president also paid no federal income taxes in 10 of the previous 15 years through 2017, despite receiving $427.4 million through 2018 from his reality television program and other endorsement and licensing deals.
The disclosure of previously private tax information came little more than a month before the Nov. 3 election between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Democrats were quick to seize on the report to paint Trump as a tax dodger and raise questions about his carefully groomed image as a savvy businessman. 
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer took to Twitter to ask Americans to raise their hands if they paid more in federal income tax than Trump.
Calling the report ""total fake news"" at a White House news conference, Trump again cited an ongoing audit as his reason for not releasing his returns. In a statement to the Times, Alan Garten, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, said Trump had paid millions of dollars in personal taxes over the last decade, without weighing in on the specific finding of minimal income taxes.
Trump's consistent refusal to release his taxes has been a departure from standard practice for presidential candidates. He is currently in a legal battle with New York City prosecutors and congressional Democrats who are seeking to obtain his returns.
He also previously indicated he preferred to minimize his tax bill, saying in a 2016 presidential debate it made him ""smart.""
The Times reported that Trump was able to minimize his tax bill by reporting heavy losses across his business empire. It said he claimed $47.4 million in losses in 2018, despite saying he had income of at least $434.9 million in a financial disclosure that year.
The Times emphasized the documents reveal only what Trump told the government about his businesses, and did not disclose his true wealth. 
The Times said it had obtained tax-return data covering over two decades for Trump and companies within his business organization. It did not have information about his personal returns from 2018 or 2019.

The Times also reported that Trump was currently embroiled in a decade-long Internal Revenue Service audit over a $72.9 million tax refund he claimed after declaring large losses. If the IRS rules against him in that audit, he could have to pay over $100 million, according to the newspaper.

Under the new lockdown measures being considered, all pubs, restaurants and bars would be ordered to shut for two weeks initially, the report said. 
Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said any new national lockdown would threaten jobs, livelihoods and human contact.
The report added that households would also be banned indefinitely from meeting each other in any indoor location where they were not already under the order. 
Britain had last week imposed new measures that required people to work from home where possible and had ordered restaurants and bars to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19, with new restrictions lasting probably six months.

Schools and shops be allowed to remain open, along with factories and offices at which staff could not work from home, the Times added, citing a senior government source.

Plans for a travel 'bubble' between Australia and New Zealand has been in discussions for months as both nations slowed the spread of the coronavirus, but they were disrupted after a resurgence of COVID-19 in Melbourne, Australia, followed by a second wave of infections in Auckland. 
With the virus largely contained in New Zealand, and as cases continue to decline in Australian regions, talks of a travel bubble with some states have been revived. 
When asked by state broadcaster TVNZ whether New Zealanders would be able to travel to at least some Australian regions before Christmas, Ardern said: ""It is possible."" 
""What we would need to be assured of is that when Australia is saying 'okay we've got a hotspot over here' that the border around that hotspot means that people aren't able to travel into the states where we are engaging with in trans-Tasman travel,"" she said.
Ardern said Australia was pretty satisfied with both how New Zealand was tracking now and how they are tracking generally. 
New Zealand has only 59 active cases and 1,477 confirmed cases of COVID-19 so far, one of the lowest tally in the world. 
Some media reports on Monday also said the travel may initially be just one way with New Zealanders heading to Australia, and may be restricted to just travellers from New Zealand's South Island, which has had no coronavirus cases for months. 
Victoria, Australia’s second most populous state and the epicentre of the country’s COVID-19 outbreak, said on Sunday that it would ease social distancing restrictions as infections slow to fewer than 20 cases a day.

Australia has reported just over 27,000 cases, and 872 deaths, well below the numbers seen in many other developed nations.

(Reuters) - A Kentucky legislator who was arrested during demonstrations over the Breonna Taylor case accused Louisville police of detaining her and about 20 allies on false pretenses on Sunday and called for charges to be dropped.
State Representative Attica Scott, the only Black woman in the Kentucky legislature, was arrested along with her 19-year-old daughter, prominent activist Shameka Parrish-Wright and others on Thursday during protests against a grand jury decision on Wednesday to clear police of homicide charges in the shooting death of Taylor.
Louisville has become the latest flashpoint in U.S. protests against racism and police brutality.
Scott is the main sponsor of the proposed ""Breonna's Law,"" which would require police body cameras and ban ""no-knock"" search warrants like the one secured before breaking through Taylor's door.
""It felt like retaliation,"" Scott said of her arrest, speaking by telephone after a news conference. ""They knew exactly who I was when I got to the jail.""
Police denied Scott was arrested in retaliation for her efforts to expand police oversight and said the case was in the hands of County Attorney Mike O'Connell.
""We can say that no charges were made in retaliation for anything,"" police spokesman Jessie Halladay said in an email.
O'Connell's office did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment on Sunday.
Scott, whose account is supported by video she posted on social media, said she and other intended to obey a 9 p.m. curfew and reach a designated sanctuary when they were met by a line of police.
She was held overnight on charges of felony first-degree rioting, which carries a sentence of one to five years, and the misdemeanor offenses of failure to disperse and unlawful assembly.
She said police accused her of vandalizing the public library, which she called ""absurd"" considering her public position on libraries and a statement by the library workers union defending her as a ""vocal supporter for libraries.""
""How dare LMPD say that I was trying to burn down our library,"" Scott said. ""Come up with some better lies.""
Protests intensified in Louisville and other U.S. cities following Wednesday's announcement that a grand jury would not bring homicide charges against police officers involved in the fatal March 13 shooting of Taylor in her home during a botched execution of a search warrant.

Instead, one officer was charged with wanton endangerment for stray bullets that struck a neighboring apartment.

The attorney general's office of the central Mexican state of Guanajuato said the bodies of seven men and four women were found in the bar in the early hours of Sunday morning in the city of Jaral del Progreso. Another woman was found with gunshot injuries, authorities said in a news release.
Guanajuato, a major carmaking hub, has become a recurring scene of criminal violence in Mexico, ravaged by a turf war between the local Santa Rosa de Lima gang and the powerful Jalisco New Generation Cartel.
In July, gunmen killed 24 people at a drug rehabilitation center in Guanajuato, marking one of the worst mass slayings since President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador took office pledging to reduce record levels of violence.

Partial results also showed France's green party making gains, with leaders of the Europe Ecology - The Greens saying they expected to be able to form a group, handing the party a little more clout in the upper house.
""This election, in the current social, economic, and public health context, brings comfort to the centre-right majority,"" Gerard Larcher, the leader of Les Republicains said in a statement.
Half of the Senate's 348-seates were being contested.
Under France's Fifth Republic, the Senate has less influence over legislating than the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. In case of disagreement over legislation, it is the Assembly which has the last word.
Macron's La Republique en Marche (LaRem) controls the lower house with the support of a junior alliance partner.
The Senate is indirectly elected by France's mayors and as well as regional, departmental and municipal councillors.
Macron has struggled to anchor his party, which he created to propel him to the presidency in 2017, at the grassroots level and took a drubbing in local elections in a vote early this year that saw a green surge. 

It is the fifth biggest group in the Senate behind Les Republicains and Le Parti Socialiste.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's ruling centrist Liberals emerged as the leading party in a municipal ballot on Sunday, including in the capital, exit polls showed, bolstering their chances of forming the next government after a Dec. 6 parliamentary election.
The ballot is a popularity test ahead of the national vote for the minority cabinet of Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, which has been fighting the spread of the new coronavirus since its first day in office, and imposed a strict lockdown.
""This is a historical victory for our party, the most spectacular result in our 30 post-communist years. I thank Romanians for defending democracy by showing up to cast their ballots during pandemics,"" Orban said in a victory speech.
The opposition Social Democrats (PSD), lost power last year and have seen their popular support halve since a 2016 ballot and protests over attempts to politicise the judiciary.
""It's the first time we defeat the Social Democrats, and it's so decisively,"" Orban said. ""This creates premises for a Liberal-led government for the next four years.""
Citing incomplete data, Orban said his party won about 1,500 mayors across the country or about 50% of all localities.
Exit polls showed that mathematician Nicusor Dan, backed by the Liberals and an alliance of opposition parties USR-Plus, won Bucharest city hall with 47% followed by incumbent PSD mayor Gabriela Firea with 39%.
Until Sunday's vote the PSD had 55% of Romania's mayors while Orban's Liberals controlled about 33% of localities. 
Political pundits have said the ballot has mobilised younger voters fed up with graft in Romania, a nation of 20 million people that joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 2004 and the European Union in 2007.
Local elections matter in Romania, one of EU's poorest members, as municipal officials control a large chunk of budget revenues, and have access to EU development funds.

Spending that cash helps bolster public support for the party associated with mayors who manage it, analysts say.

The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) said on Friday it would lift sanctions, which have caused imports to the landlocked country to slump 30%, once a civilian premier was named.
It had softened initial demands that a purely civilian leadership be installed, and the appointment of Ouane comes two days after retired colonel Bah Ndaw was sworn in as president, and coup-leader Colonel Assimi Goita as vice president.
International powers feared the coup could further destabilise the country and undermine a joint fight against Islamist insurgents there and in the wider Sahel region.
A veteran diplomat, Ouane, 64, served as Mali's ambassador to the United Nations in 1995-2002, and as foreign minister in 2004-2011. 
The men will be tasked with overseeing an 18-month transition back to civilian rule after the Aug. 18 overthrow of President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita.
Ndaw, a retired colonel and former defence minister, signed a decree authorising Ouane's selection, which the M5-RFP coalition of opposition groups welcomed, even though he was not their first choice.

""The M5-RFP must be willing to focus on the struggle, the reforms, the transparent elections, the crisis in the north and the centre... to support men capable of bringing the country out of this crisis,"" said Nouhoum Togo, the group's spokesman.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's King Abdullah dissolved parliament on Sunday, officials said, paving the way for an election in November at a time of rising popular discontent over worsening economic conditions and curbs on public freedoms under emergency laws. 
Under constitutional rules, the government must resign within a week. 
In July, Jordan's electoral commission set Nov. 10 as the date for a parliamentary election after the monarch called for countrywide polls to be held at the end of the parliament's four-year term.
The king issued a royal edict ordering the dissolution of parliament, effective Sunday. The assembly comprises 130 lawmakers, mainly pro-government tribal officials, businessmen and ex-security officials.
The move is likely to be followed by a wider government shake-up to ward off popular disenchantment over economic hardship worsened by the economic blow dealt by COVID-19 and over allegations of official corruption.
Jordan's economy is expected to shrink by 6% this year as it grapples with its worst economic crisis in many years, with unemployment and poverty aggravated by the pandemic.""Citizens have lost confidence in this government,"" said Munzir al Huwarat, a political analyst.
Liberal and independent politicians say the government has used emergency laws enacted last March at the start of the coronavirus lockdown to limit civil and political rights. 
The authorities have arrested hundreds of teacher activists after dissolving their opposition-led elected union last July and detained scores of dissidents for criticism on social media.
King Abdullah appointed Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz in the summer of 2018 to defuse the biggest protests in years over tax increases pushed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce Jordan's large public debt.
The elections will be held under an existing system that limits the representation of those of Palestinian origin in favour of native Jordanians who are the backbone of the country's political establishment.
Jordan's main political opposition comes from the Muslim Brotherhood movement but it faces legal curbs on its activities, leaving mostly pro-monarchy parties and some independent Islamists and politicians to compete in these elections, political analysts say.

Constitutionally, most powers rest with the king, who appoints governments and approves legislation.

MINSK (Reuters) - Masked police dragged people into vans and fired stun grenades and tear gas to disperse crowds as tens of thousands marched for a seventh straight weekend to demand veteran Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko quit. 
Protesters chanted ""impostor"" and ""Sveta is our president"" as they marched through Minsk and other cities decked out in red-and-white opposition colours. At least 200 people were detained, the interior ministry said. 
Some dubbed the protest a ""people's inauguration"" of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, Lukashenko's main opponent who fled into exile after the Aug. 9 election that Lukashenko's opponents say was blatantly rigged to hand Lukashenko a sixth term.
Lukashenko denies electoral fraud and was inaugurated on Wednesday in a ceremony held without any prior announcement, sparking more protests and condemnation from the European Union, the United States and Britain. 
French President Emmanuel Macron said in comments in the French press Lukashenko must step aside. 
""We are witnessing a power crisis in Belarus with an authoritarian administration that is not able to accept the logic of democracy,"" Macron told le Journal du Dimanche in comments published on Sunday.
""It is clear that Lukashenko must go.""
Lukashenko retorted that, under Macron's logic, the French leader should have resigned two years ago when the ""yellow vest"" protest for economic justice began and that mass demonstrations had become commonplace in France.
He offered to help negotiate a peaceful transfer of power between Macron and those protesting against the French authorities. 
""As an experienced politician - to an immature one - I want to advise Mr. Macron to look around less, and instead finally deal with the internal affairs of France,"" Lukashenko was quoted by the official Belta news agency as saying. 
Russia said the EU's decision not to recognise Lukashenko as the legitimate president contradicted international law and amounted to indirect meddling in the country.
Buoyed by the support from traditional ally Russia, the 66-year-old Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm manager who has been in power for over a quarter of a century, shows no inclination to resign. 
POLICE ACTION PROMPTS HACKER RETALIATION
Riot police pulled people out of crowds and hauled them away into vans, a Reuters witness said. Several metro stations were shut and the mobile internet disrupted. Some protesters wore fake crowns to mock Lukashenko's inauguration.
""We came to celebrate the people's inauguration of the people's president,"" said Alexander, a 30-year-old logistics worker, while protesting in Minsk. ""First he falsified the elections, and then he falsified the inauguration."" 
Police said they used tear gas and stun grenades to disperse ""disobedient"" protesters in the eastern city of Gomel, the Russian agency TASS reported. 
Local media footage showed masked security forces spraying a substance from a can into the faces of people in Gomel, while the protesters retreated shouting ""fascists"". One detainee managed to escape from a prison van as people cheered. 
In Minsk, helmeted security forces went inside a pizzeria to detain someone as customers looked on.
A group of anonymous hackers has started leaking the personal data of police officers in retaliation for the crackdown on protests since the election. 
On Sunday, it released another batch of data from more than 1,000 police stationed in Gomel in revenge for the treatment of the protesters there. 
The Belarusian government typically releases the data for the total number of people arrested on the day after a protest. 
Police detained 150 people during protests on Saturday, the interior ministry said.

Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei on Saturday accused western countries preparing to impose new sanctions on Minsk of attempting to sow ""chaos and anarchy"".

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron admonished Lebanon's leaders on Sunday for serving their own interests ahead of their country and vowed to push ahead with efforts to prevent chaos, but appeared to have no back up plan should his initiative fail. 
Lebanon's prime minister-designate, Mustapha Adib, quit on Saturday after failing to line up a non-partisan cabinet, dealing a blow to a French plan aimed at rallying sectarian leaders to tackle the country's crisis. [nL8N2GN016]
""I am ashamed of Lebanon's political leaders,"" Macron told a news conference in Paris. ""The leaders did not want, clearly and resolutely, to respect the commitments made to France and the international community. They decided to betray this commitment.""
For the first time, Macron also specifically questioned the role of the heavily armed Hezbollah and the influence of Iran, saying that the group needed to lift its ambiguity on the political arena. 
Adib was picked on Aug. 31 to form a cabinet after Macron's intervention secured a consensus on naming him in a country where power is shared out between Muslims and Christians.
Under the French roadmap, the new government would take steps to tackle corruption and implement reforms needed to trigger billions of dollars of international aid to fix an economy crushed by a huge debt. 
But there was deadlock over a demand by Lebanon's two main Shi'ite groups, Amal and Hezbollah, that they name several ministers, including for finance, who will have a big role in drawing up economic rescue plans.
Macron, who also took a swipe at leading Sunni Muslim politician Saad al-Hariri, criticised both parties for blocking efforts to form a government by a mid-September deadline.
""Hezbollah can't be at the same time an army at war with Israel, an unrestrained militia against civilians in Syria and a respectable party in Lebanon,"" Macron said, adding that he saw no evidence Tehran was interfering in his initiative. 
""Is it really a political party or does it proceed just in a logic dictated by Iran, and its terrorist forces? I want us to see if in the next few weeks something is possible. I'm not naive.""
Macron said he would convene international partners within 20 days to assess where his efforts stood and hold an aid conference by the end of October.
Describing the events of the last few days as a betrayal, he said political leaders had chosen ""to deliver Lebanon to the game of foreign powers"", destabilising the region further.
He warned them that they had 4-6 weeks to play ball. When asked whether sanctions were on the table, he said he would only consider them at a later stage in conjunction with other powers because he could not see their use for now.

""This is a system of terror. This system is no longer advancing and a few dozen people are bringing down a country and its people,"" Macron said. ""The French initiative will persist. My commitment ... will not falter.""

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan on Sunday resumed its land border traffic with Syria, following a more than month-long closure, after applying new rules to prevent truck drivers spreading the novel coronavirus into the kingdom, officials and businessmen said.
They said authorities imposed back-to-back handling of goods to ensure Syrian, Lebanese truck drivers and others entering the kingdom maintain a social distance from Jordanian customs officials.
Officials said in mid-August they had to close the crossing, the main gateway for goods from Lebanon and Syria to the Gulf, after dozens of infections among border officials linked to a spike in cases in neighbouring Syria.
Before the decade-old conflict in Syria, the Nasib-Jaber crossing was also a transit route for hundreds of trucks a day transporting goods between Europe and Turkey and the Gulf in a multi-billion dollar annual trade.
The closure hit trade that had already shrunk because of the impact of COVID-19 and the Caesar Act - the toughest U.S. sanctions yet that came into force in June and prohibited foreign companies trading with Damascus.
""We have had millions of dollars of losses as a result of the closure,"" said Mohammad al Daoud, the president of the Jordanian Truck Owners' Association that represents over 17,000 trucks. 
The country's other land crossings with Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian territories have been only open for commercial goods since a lockdown in March to stem the pandemic. 
Syrian authorities said 70 trailers carrying, mostly fresh produce, entered Jordan on Sunday, including transit cargo heading to Gulf markets and Iraq. 
While the crossing was closed, Syria's only normally operating frontier crossing had been with Lebanon, which itself has no other functioning land borders.
Lebanon was also hit hard by the closure. It relies on the crossing for overland connections to all other countries because its only other frontier is with Israel, with which it has no ties.
""This crossing is an economic lifeline for all our land exports,"" said Ibrahim al Tarshishi, the head of the Lebanese farmers' association.

ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss voters overwhelmingly rejected on Sunday a right-wing party's attempt to scrap a pact allowing the free movement of people from the European Union, opting for stability amid the economic uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Swiss People's Party (SVP) had forced a referendum on the EU agreement in a bid to curb immigration to the country where foreigners make up a quarter of the population. 
The measure lost, as expected, by a 62%-38% margin.
""The bilateral path is the right one for Switzerland and for the EU. The Swiss people have confirmed this path again today,"" Justice Minister Karin Keller-Sutter told reporters in Bern. 
""Today is a great day for the relations between the European Union and Switzerland,"" European Council President Charles Michel tweeted. ""The Swiss people have spoken & sent a clear message: together we have a great future ahead of us.""
The SVP - the biggest party in parliament - has long pushed to take back control of immigration, echoing some arguments pro-Brexit politicians used in the run-up to Britain's exit from the EU. It won a referendum on the issue in 2014, only to see parliament water down its implementation.
Opponents said the plan would have robbed business of skilled workers and torpedoed accords that enhance non-EU member Switzerland's access to the crucial EU single market. 
Around two-thirds of the 2.1 million foreigners living in Switzerland in 2019 were citizens of the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein, which with Switzerland are members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). 
More than 450,000 Swiss live in the EU.
The domestic political battle immediately turned to Switzerland's biggest foreign policy headache: a stalled treaty meant to cement ties with the EU but which critics say infringes too much on Swiss sovereignty and would never win a referendum.
With questions open over state aid, rules to protect high Swiss wages, and access to welfare benefits, the Swiss have dragged their feet while trying to forge a domestic consensus, triggering a row over cross-border stock trading.
""The government will determine Switzerland's position in the coming weeks and take up discussions with the EU over the issues that remain open,"" Keller-Sutter said. 
Voters also blocked an attempt to make it easier to shoot wolves deemed a threat to livestock.

They narrowly approved the government's plans to buy new fighter jets for up to 6 billion Swiss francs ($6.46 billion).

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Full-time students at Chicago's Columbia College spend $14,000 a year for professional, hands-on training in dance, film and music that the school normally offers in studios and classrooms scattered across the city's South Loop and Near South Side. 
When the coronavirus pandemic led the school to move some coursework online this summer without reducing tuition, many students, including Isaiah Moore, cried foul. 
A television and cultural studies major, Moore now leads a group of students holding campus demonstrations, circulating a petition and meeting with school officials in the hopes of a tuition cut and more transparency in the college's finances. 
""We want our tuition to reflect the way our education is being experienced now,"" said the 21-year-old from New Jersey. ""This is the time we need more unprecedented solutions to unprecedented problems."" 
Moore is one of a growing number of U.S. college students pushing for their schools to cut tuition and fees because of reduced in-person classroom time and less access to on-campus resources. 
The sky-rocketing cost of post-secondary education is a perennial issue in the United States. It intensified this spring when U.S. colleges and universities, in response to the COVID-19 outbreak, canceled classes and shut down campuses. Dozens of students filed lawsuits asking courts to force schools to issue refunds. 
With two-thirds of American colleges moving at least some of their fall classes online, students have become more vocal in their objections, saying they are not getting the education they purchased.
Many colleges and universities, including Columbia College, have refused to reduce tuition, saying salary and maintenance costs have held steady, regardless of whether the institution is offering in-person or online classes or a hybrid model. 
""For all three instructional methods, the college will be delivering all expected learning outcomes for courses and credit towards graduation,"" Columbia College, which is not affiliated with New York's Columbia University, said in a statement. It said it was providing a ""well-rounded and rigorous fall semester."" 
To be sure, some institutions have lowered tuition and fees, including Georgetown, Princeton and Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) University where fall tuition was slashed by 10%.
Even so, Northwestern's cut has failed to satisfy 175 students who have signed a letter threatening a tuition strike beginning Oct. 1. In the letter, to be sent to the school's president, the students demand officials reverse a 3.5% tuition hike implemented in June before the 10% cut was made, as well as further reduce tuition by at least 30%. 
""Withholding tuition en masse is quite a large move, but we believe it is warranted given the level of crisis,"" said one of the organizers of the protest, Alex Harrison, a 19-year-old sophomore who is studying journalism and political science. 
The protesting students at the private university of 21,000 students in Evanston, Illinois, north of Chicago, are also demanding officials address issues involving housing contracts, financial aid, work-study and support staff while calling on them to use some of the school's $10.8 billion endowment to help students through the pandemic. 
Other college students have taken to online petitions to voice their frustration. Change.org says 1,500 petitions calling for college tuition reductions during the pandemic have been created on its site. The petitions have received closed to one million signatures since March, the platform said. 
One of the petitions was started by Ava Yelton, a senior at the University of New Mexico, which is offering both in-person and online courses this school year. 
Her petition, garnering 5,400 signatures, calls for a tuition and fees cut to match a ""significantly"" decreased amount of instruction, hands-on learning and opportunities to engage in extracurricular activities. 
She said the Albuquerque school, which charges more than $8,000 a year for an in-state student, raised tuition 2.6% this year. 
""It's an unethical choice to not only maintain tuition, but to increase (it) during such uncertain times,"" said the 20-year-old public health and psychology major. 
David Vu, a 20-year-old student at the University of San Francisco, has led a movement on campus calling for a 4% cut to the annual $50,000 tuition and elimination of fees for unaccessible services after the school moved online for the fall semester. 
The management major said some of his fellow students have created social media accounts to call for a tuition payment boycott while others have taken the semester off or have transferred to less expensive schools. 

""It's like the school and students are trying to call each other's bluff right now,"" he said.

1493,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Lebanese patriarch warns of 'multiple dangers' without a government,"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's top Christian cleric said on Sunday the nation faced ""multiple dangers"" that would be hard to weather without a government, speaking after the prime minister-designate quit and dealt a blow to France's bid to lift the country out of crisis.
Muslim religious figures also said Lebanese needed to unite following Mustapha Adib's decision to step down on Saturday after his efforts to form a cabinet hit a roadblock over ministerial appointments in the sectarian system.
It leaves Lebanon, with its arrangement of sharing power between Muslims and Christians, rudderless as it faces its deepest crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war. 
French President Emmanuel Macron, who had pressed Lebanon's fractious politicians to reach a consensus over naming Adib on Aug. 31, will speak about the crisis later on Sunday.
Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, leader of the Maronite church, Lebanon's biggest Christian community, said Adib's resignation had ""disappointed citizens, especially the youth, who were betting on the start of change in the political class"".
Many top politicians, both Christian and Muslim, have held sway for years or even decades. Some are former warlords.
Rai said Lebanon now had to navigate ""multiple dangers"" without a government at the helm.
Rai's comments were echoed on the streets of Beirut, where mass protests erupted in 2019 as years of mismanagement, corruption and mounting debts finally led to economic collapse.
""We need new people. We need new blood,"" said Hassan Amer, 24, serving coffee at a roadside cafe in the capital, which was hammered by a huge port blast on Aug. 4 that killed almost 200 people. 
Frustration at Adib's failure to form a government was voiced by many across religious communities.
A senior Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Sheikh Ahmed Qabalan, said it was a ""disaster"" that Adib had resigned and called for national unity, state news agency reported.
""We don't want sectarian or confessional talk,"" Lebanon's top Sunni Muslim religious leader, Grand Mufti Sheikh Abdul Latif Derian, was quoted by broadcasters as saying.
He said Lebanon's communities needed to show ""understanding and balance"" to face the major challenges ahead. 
The cabinet formation effort stumbled after Lebanon's two main Shi'ite groups, Amal and the heavily armed Iran-backed Hezbollah, demanded they name several ministers, including finance, a key role as the nation draws up a rescue plan.
Saad al-Hariri, a former prime minister and leading Sunni politician, said he would not be involved in naming any new premier and that the French plan was ""the last and only opportunity to halt Lebanon's collapse"".

A French roadmap lays out a reform programme for a new government to help trigger billions of dollars of international aid.

China has come under scrutiny over its treatment of Uighur Muslims and claims of alleged forced-labour abuses in Xinjiang, where the United Nations cites credible reports as saying one million Muslims held in camps have been put to work.
China has repeatedly denied mistreating Uighurs and says the camps are vocational training centres that are needed to tackle extremism, accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.
""The sense of gain, happiness, and security among the people of all ethnic groups (in Xinjiang) has continued to increase,"" Xi told a ruling Communist Party conference on Xinjiang held on Friday and Saturday, Xinhua said.
Xi said it was necessary to educate Xinjiang's population on an understanding of the Chinese nation and guide ""all ethnic groups on establishing a correct perspective on the country, history and nationality"".
""Practice has shown that the party's strategy for governing Xinjiang in the new era is completely correct” and it should be a long-term approach, he added. 
In July, Washington imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over alleged human rights abuses against Uighurs under the Global Magnitsky Act, which allows the U.S. government to target human rights violators by freezing any U.S. assets, banning U.S. travel and prohibiting Americans from doing business with them.

Greek media have reported that the blue and white Greek flag painted on a rocky hillside on Saturday appeared stained with red paint. Kastellorizo is very close to the Turkish coast.
It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the incident. 
""We blatantly condemn yesterday's insult of the Greek flag on Kastellorizo,"" the Greek foreign ministry said in a statement.
""We expect Turkish authorities to immediately condemn and investigate the incident, so that the culprits are brought before justice,"" it said. ""Such unacceptable actions only seek to torpedo prospects for easing tensions between the two countries"".
There was no immediate comment from Turkey.
Greek police were investigating, an official said. Greek media also reported that a drone equipped with a loudspeaker flew over Kastellorizo on Saturday, playing the Turkish national anthem.
Greece and Turkey disagree over a range of issues, including where their continental shelves extend. Tensions flared up last month after Turkey sent a seismic survey ship into disputed waters, escorted by gunboats, to map out sea territory for possible oil and gas drilling in an area thought to be rich in energy resources.
A Turkish and a Greek warship collided during the standoff. Since then, Turkey has recalled the Oruc Reis and the two countries have agreed to restart exploratory talks.

1498,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 07:48AM ET</span>",From Kennedy-Nixon to Trump-Biden: 60 years of U.S. presidential debates,"(Reuters) - Republican President Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden face off on Tuesday in a televised presidential debate, part of a 60-year-old tradition marked by some of the most memorable moments of modern U.S. political history:
- 1960: The first televised debate pitted Democratic nominee John F. Kennedy against Republican Vice President Richard Nixon, who was recovering from a hospital visit and had a 5 o'clock shadow, having refused makeup. The 70 million viewers focused on what they saw, not what they heard. Kennedy won the election.
- 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican President Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: ""There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration."" Carter won the election.
- 1980: Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for the elderly. Reagan, who already had complained that Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: ""There you go again"" and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Reagan won the election.
- 1984: Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: ""I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."" Reagan was re-elected.
- 1988: A debate against Republican Vice President George H.W. Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favor the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed ""the iceman"" by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Bush won the election.
The vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Bush's running mate, compared himself politically to John F. Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: ""Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.""
- 1992: Three candidates - Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Clinton won the election. 
- 1996: In a debate with Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether at 73 he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Clinton retorted: ""I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question."" Clinton was re-elected.
- 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W. Bush, Democratic Vice President Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Bush spoke. ""We all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,"" Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing ""syllable."" Bush won the election.
- 2004: The last debate between Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Bush sticking to simple arguments while Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Bush was re-elected.
- 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain's running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: ""Aw, say it ain't so, Joe,"" adding a ""doggone it"" for good measure. Biden and Palin both vowed to make U.S. economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Biden said McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election.
- 2012: Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had ""binders full of women"" as candidates for Cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Romney. Obama won again.

- 2016: The first debate between Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton drew 84 million U.S. television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Clinton jabbing at Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate's husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage and she wondered if she should have told him to “back up, you creep.” Instead she said, “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” In the third debate Trump called Clinton “such a nasty woman” and declined to say he would accept the election results.

1499,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 27, 2020 06:56AM ET</span>",Yemen's warring parties agree largest prisoner swap,"By Stephanie Nebehay
GLION, Switzerland (Reuters) - Yemen's warring parties have agreed to exchange around 1,000 prisoners, including 15 Saudis, as part of trust-building steps aimed at reviving a stalled peace process, the United Nations and sources said on Sunday.
The Yemeni government, backed by a Saudi-led military coalition, and the Houthi movement they have been battling for over five years, in late 2018 signed a deal to swap some 15,000 detainees split between both sides but the pact has been slowly and only partially implemented.
The two sides will now free 1,081 detainees and prisoners, U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths said in a joint news briefing with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) after a nearly 10-day meeting of the prisoners' exchange committee held in the Swiss village of Glion above Lake Geneva. 
Heads of the two sides of the committee hugged at the end of their meeting, with Griffiths telling them: ""Well done, well done.""
Sources familiar with the talks and Houthi-run Masirah TV said the movement would release 400 people, including 15 Saudis and four Sudanese, while the coalition would free 681 Houthi fighters in the largest swap since peace talks in Stockholm in December 2018.
""I urge the parties to move forward immediately with the release and to spare no effort in building upon this momentum to swiftly agree to releasing more detainees,"" Griffiths said.
ICRC Middle East director Fabrizio Carboni, sitting next to Griffiths, called on the two warring parties to provide ""security and logistical guarantees"" for swift releases. The ICRC team will interview those released and give them medical checks.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the internationally recognised government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014, prompting the Western-backed coalition to intervene in March 2015. 
Griffiths is trying to restart political negotiations to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and caused what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis with millions on the brink of famine.
""What matters to us is implementing the prisoners (exchange) and not just signing it,"" senior Houthi political official Mohammed Ali al-Houthi tweeted earlier on Sunday.
In unilateral moves, the Houthis last year freed 290 prisoners and Saudi Arabia released 128, while a locally mediated swap in Taiz governorate saw dozens freed. In January 2020, the ICRC facilitated the release of six Saudis held by the Houthis.
The conflict, seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in military stalemate for years with the Houthis holding Sanaa and most big urban centres. 

Riyadh launched informal talks with the Houthis late last year for a ceasefire as it seeks to exit a costly war ahead of hosting a summit of the Group of 20 nations in November.

YEREVAN/BAKU (Reuters) - Armenia declared martial law and mobilised its male population on Sunday after clashes with Azerbaijan over the breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region in which sources on both sides reported fatalities.
Authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh, a mainly ethnic Armenian region inside Azerbaijan which declared independence in 1991, also announced martial law and mobilised the male population after clashes which the two sides blamed on each other.
Armenia said Azerbaijan had carried out an air and artillery attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, but Azerbaijan said it had responded to Armenian shelling.
Armenian human right activists said two civilians, a woman and a child, had been killed by Azeri shelling. Baku said an unspecified number of Azeri civilians had been killed and six wounded, and Nagorno-Karabakh said 10 of its military staff had been killed. The reports could not be independently confirmed.
Russia's foreign ministry, a mediator in decades of conflict between majority Christian Armenia and mainly Muslim Azerbaijan, urged both sides to cease fire immediately and hold talks. 
The two countries have long been at odds over Nagorno-Karabakh, which broke away from Azerbaijan in a conflict that broke out as the Soviet Union collapsed. 
Though a ceasefire was agreed in 1994, Azerbaijan and Armenia frequently accuse each other of attacks around Nagorno-Karabakh and along the separate Azeri-Armenian frontier.
The conflict has worried Western and regional countries in part because it could cause instability in the South Caucasus, which serves as a corridor for pipelines transporting oil and gas to world markets.
FREQUENT SKIRMISHES
Armenia's defence ministry said its troops had destroyed three tanks and shot down two helicopters and three unmanned aerial vehicles in response to an attack on civilian targets including Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert.
""Our response will be proportionate, and the military-political leadership of Azerbaijan bears full responsibility for the situation,"" the ministry said in a statement echoed by the foreign ministry.
Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan wrote on Twitter: ""We stay strong next to our army to protect our motherland from Azeri invasion."" 
Azerbaijan denied the Armenian defence ministry statement, saying it had ""complete advantage over the enemy on the front"", and accused Armenian forces of launching ""deliberate and targeted"" attacks along the front line.
""We defend our territory, our cause is right!"" Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, said in an address to the nation. 
Azerbaijan's defence ministry said some civilians had been killed but gave no death toll. 

At least 200 people were killed in a flare-of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan in April 2016. There are frequent skirmishes and at least 16 were reported killed in clashes in July.

PORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Police clashed with anti-racism protesters and pushed back members of the press in downtown Portland, Oregon into early Sunday morning, making more than 20 arrests.
The violence followed a relatively peaceful rally by the right-wing Proud Boys group and counter protests by anti-fascist and Black Lives Matter activists on Saturday.
Videos published online showed police pushing protesters and photographers to the ground and jabbing them with batons as officers drove them out of an area near Portland's federal courthouse. 
Protesters burned a U.S. flag and scuffled with police trying to arrest fellow demonstrators.
Police declared a riot after they said rocks and cans were thrown at officers, the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office reported.
Portland Police spokesman Kevin Allen said the bureau was committed to upholding civil rights and any use of force by officers would be reviewed.
The Northwest city has seen four months of protests against police violence and racism with escalating political violence between left and right-wing activists in the run-up to the Nov.3 presidential election. 
Dressed in trademark black and yellow polo shirts and body armor, hundreds of Proud Boys supporters rallied to end what they called ""domestic terrorism"" in Democratic-run Portland.
""They've allowed 120 days of rioting and looting and murder happening within our streets and we're locals so we're just tired of this, that's why we're out here today,"" said Haley Adams, wearing an anti-stab vest and a stars and stripes bandana.
The self-declared ""Western chauvinist"" Proud Boys had forecast a crowd of at least 10,000 but police said fewer than 1,000 were present. 
Police reported four arrests related to the rally. Online videos showed a person pushing a reporter to the ground and kicking him in the face. Police said they were investigating the assault of a person documenting the gathering. 
State Governor Kate Brown declared a weekend state of emergency for Oregon's biggest city, saying large numbers of ""white supremacist groups"" were traveling from out of state to attend the rally.
City and state leaders said in a letter to the community that Proud Boys supporters planned to cause chaos and violence but that had yet to materialize by early Sunday morning. 
Proud Boys leaders said their presence pushed Brown to declare an emergency and create the kind of state and local police task force needed to keep the peace in a city President Donald Trump has called an ""anarchist jurisdiction.""
""It's crazy that it takes us to come here to solve things,"" Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio said in video on the group's Parler page. 
Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden has said Trump's rhetoric is stoking violence.

As the Proud Boys rally broke up, Portland Police stopped vehicles for traffic violations, confiscated firearms, paintball guns, baseball bats and shields, and issued two citations for unlawful firearm possession.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Sunday it is searching for the body a South Korean official killed by its troops, but warned that South Korean naval operations in the area threatened to raise tensions by intruding across a disputed sea border.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un issued a rare apology on Friday for the fatal shooting of the South Korean fisheries official in North Korean waters, according to Seoul.
South Korea's military has accused the North's soldiers of killing the man, dousing his body in fuel and setting it on fire near the sea border.
After South Korean President Moon Jae-in convened a ministers' meeting to discuss North Korea on Sunday, the presidential Blue House reiterated calls for Pyongyang to allow a joint investigation into the killing. It urged the restoration of military communication hotlines that the North severed earlier this year as relations soured.
North Korean state news agency KCNA called the killing an ""awful case which should not have happened"" but accused South Korean naval operations near in the area of crossing into North Korean waters.
""We urge the south side to immediately halt the intrusion across the military demarcation line in the west sea that may lead to escalation of tensions,"" KCNA said.
A spokesman for South Korea's Ministry of National Defense had no immediate comment on the North's accusations.
The South has been searching only in waters south of the Northern Limit Line, a contested sea demarcation between the two Koreas that dates to the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea's Yonhap news agency said, quoting an unnamed coast guard official.
South Korea has mobilised 39 vessels, including 16 naval ships, and six aircraft for the search, which continued on Sunday despite the North Korean complaints, Yonhap said.
North Korea was beginning its own search operation to recover the body, KCNA said.

""We also took more necessary security measures in order to make sure that no more incident spoiling the relations of trust and respect between the north and the south would happen in any case,"" the report added, without elaborating.

Coronavirus outbreaks have forced some colleges to ask students -- many of whom are far from home and paying thousands of pounds for accommodation and teaching -- to self-isolate in their rooms and follow lectures online. 
""I very much want students to be able to go home at Christmas,"" Dowden told Sky News. 
""We're three months away from Christmas. We've announced a range of measures. We are constantly keeping this situation under review.""

The opposition Labour Party indicated it could support such a move.

China has ramped up pressure on international groups and companies, no matter how small or obscure, to refer to democratic Taiwan as being part of China, to the anger of Taiwan's government and many of its people. 
Beijing views the island as merely a wayward Chinese province.
This month a Taiwan bird conservation body said it had been expelled from a partnership with a British-based wildlife charity after they demanded the Taiwan group change their name and sign documents stating they did not support Taiwan's independence. 
Late on Saturday, the government of the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung said the website of the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy had begun listing Taiwan member cities like itself as part of China.
On Sunday, Taiwan's government reacted with anger.
""Taiwan is Taiwan. China is China. Taiwan is not a city of China's. If there is incorrect usage we think this is extremely improper,"" Premier Su Tseng-chang told reporters.
""China hopes to make Taiwan part of it in the world, a city of its. This is not in line with the facts.""
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said it had asked the group to make a correction, while Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chi-mai said his city was known globally as being in southern Taiwan, rather than as part of China.
The Global Covenant's secretariat said in a short email to Reuters that they ""may not be able to respond until business hours resume Monday"".
The Global Covenant says its mission is to ""galvanise climate and energy action across cities worldwide"", representing a population of over 800 million. The only Chinese city it lists as a member is Hong Kong. 

China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The European Union said on Thursday Lukashenko was not the president of Belarus. Russia, Belarus's closest ally, said the EU decision not to recognise Lukashenko amounted to indirect meddling in the country.

The opposition Democratic Alliance had accused Mapisa-Nqakula of misusing state resources by letting the group from the ruling African National Congress (ANC) travel with her to Harare in September.
The presidency said late on Saturday Mapisa-Nqakula had been on an official trip. But her decision to let the delegation - who were traveling to Zimbabwe on unrelated business - join her on the flight had been an ""error of judgment"". 
It said President Cyril Ramaphosa had told Mapisa-Nqakula in a letter that this was not in keeping with her responsibilities as a cabinet minister. 
The minister had been given a formal reprimand, a ""salary sacrifice"" had been imposed on her for three months from Nov. 1 and she would have to make sure the ANC reimbursed the state for the costs of the flight, the presidency added.
A defense ministry spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the minister. Mapisa-Nqakula herself did not immediately respond to a message sent on LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD). 
Ramaphosa has pledged to clean up the ANC's reputation after a decade of scandals under his predecessor Jacob Zuma.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is poised to retain power at next month's election, a widely watched poll showed on Sunday, although it said a recent COVID-19 outbreak has dented her support slightly.
A Newshub-Reid Research Poll released on Sunday showed support for Ardern's Labour Party at to 50.1%, though this is down from the record 60.9% recorded earlier this year when New Zealand was widely lauded as a world leader in battling COVID-19.
Support for the main opposition National Party was at 29.6%, up 4.5 percentage points.
Should the poll findings materialise, Ardern would govern without relying on any coalition partners.
New Zealand was COVID-free for 102 days until a second wave hit Auckland last month.
Ardern became the country’s youngest leader in more than 150 years in 2017 after the kingmaker nationalist New Zealand First Party agreed to form a government with her Labour Party, ending the National Party’s decade in power.

Ardern, 40, also holds huge global appeal due to her response to last year’s attack by a white supremacist on two mosques, a fatal volcanic eruption and her success with the COVID-19 outbreak.

Wang would hold talks with his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga during the trip, the source said.
The visit would come after Suga and Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed during a phone conversation on Friday to have more high-level contacts.
Suga and Wang would likely agree to strengthen economic ties between the nations, said the source who declined to be named as the information is not public. 
The visit was earlier reported by public broadcaster NHK.
Suga, who became prime minister earlier this month, must manage relations with Japan's bigger neighbour as ties between China and the United States worsen amid the coronavirus pandemic and lingering trade friction.
Tokyo is also in a dispute with Beijing over ownership of islands in the East China Sea and has expressed concern about an uptick in Chinese military activity the region. 
Separately, Suga plans to meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in early October, the government source said, as Pompeo will visit Tokyo for a meeting with his counterparts of Australia, India and Japan.

LISBON (Reuters) - Thousands of workers gathered in cities and towns across Portugal on Saturday demanding higher wages and more government action to protect jobs threatened by the coronavirus pandemic. 
During the peaceful protests, organised by Portugal's biggest umbrella union, the CGTP, workers wearing masks and keeping a safe distance urged the country's Socialist government to raise the national minimum wage to 850 euros from the current 635 euros, the lowest in western Europe.
""Workers' rights are increasingly being stolen,"" said Anabela Vogado, from trade union CESP, as she marched to Lisbon's main square. ""The fear of the pandemic cannot take our rights away."" 
Unemployment in Portugal rose above 400,000 in August, according to the latest data, and is up more than a third on the same period last year. 
In the southern Algarve region, which relies heavily on tourism, the number of people registered as unemployed soared 177% in August compared to a year ago.
""Why is there so much money to support (companies) with investments and moratoriums and then there is no political courage to stop the workers from being fired?,"" said worker Luis Batista, who was visibly angry.
The government, led by Prime Minister Antonio Costa, has introduced several measures to help businesses weather the coronavirus pandemic, including state-backed loans and delaying some tax payments. 
It has also introduced a furlough scheme, allowing firms to temporarily suspend jobs or reduce working hours instead of firing workers. But those at Saturday's protests believe the measures were not enough. 

""Our government mostly supports companies and forgets about the workers,"" said glassmaker Pedro Milheiro, who had joined the protest in Lisbon to express his frustration. ""More support is needed.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As the parent of seven children, Amy Coney Barrett knows about working with a large group: it is an experience she will have again if confirmed as the ninth justice on the U.S. Supreme Court - and its first mother with school-age children.
In a flag-bedecked White House Rose Garden, President Donald Trump on Saturday nominated the 48-year-old Barrett for the seat left open by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Husband Jesse Barrett and their seven children were on hand and visited with Trump in the Oval Office.
""The president has asked me to become the ninth justice, and as it happens I'm used to being in a group of nine, my family,"" Barrett said.
A conservative appeals court judge, Barrett is likely to face fierce opposition by Democrats determined to stymie her nomination as long as possible even though Republicans appear to have the votes to confirm her in the weeks ahead.
The country's first look at the Barrett, however, was as a parent with cooking challenges who, with her husband, has been ""co-principals of the Barrett e-learning academy"" at home during the coronavirus pandemic.
Trump made a point of mentioning that Barrett would be the first-ever mother of school-age kids on the high court, a point noted by Trump, who carefully pronounced the names of all seven children. 
Barrett caught Trump's attention in her 2017 confirmation fight to become an appeals court judge, when she was engaged in a back and forth with Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein about her Catholic religion.
""The dogma lives loudly within you, and that's a concern,"" Feinstein told her.
Barrett's strong defense left a ""favorable impression"" on Trump, who admired her toughness, a source familiar with Trump's thinking said.
Shortly thereafter, members of the White House counsel's office had coffee mugs made with the slogan, ""The Dogma Lives Loudly Within You.""
Feinstein on Saturday wrote on Twitter: ""Judge Barrett clearly passes the president's conservative litmus tests or he wouldn't have nominated her. She would push the Supreme Court further to the right, putting many rights and protections that the American people have fought for and deeply cherish at risk.""
Barrett cast herself as someone who respects Ginsburg for her advocacy of women worldwide but would act more in the mold of her conservative mentor, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, for whom she served as a Supreme Court clerk.
But she said she would try to act in a way to represent all Americans.

""If confirmed, I would not assume that role for the sake of those in my own circle and certainly not for my own sake. I would assume this role to serve you,"" she said.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and others in his party on Saturday blasted President Donald Trump's choice of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, focusing in particular on the threat they said she would pose to healthcare for millions of Americans. 
Biden noted that even as Trump's administration is seeking to strike down Obamacare in a case the Supreme Court is due to hear on Nov. 10, Barrett has a ""written track record"" criticizing a pivotal 2012 ruling authored by Chief Justice John Roberts preserving the law formally known as the Affordable Care Act. 
Biden, seeking to defeat the Republican president on Nov. 3, called on the Senate not to act on the court's vacancy caused by the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until after the Nov. 3 election, allowing the winner to make the appointment.
""The United States Constitution was designed to give the voters one chance to have their voice heard on who serves on the court. That moment is now and their voice should be heard,"" Biden said.
Senate Republicans refused to consider President Barack Obama's 2016 Supreme Court nominee, saying the winner of that year's election should make the pick.
Trump's choice means that he would replace Ginsburg, a champion of gender equality and other liberal causes who died on Sept. 18 at age 87, with a jurist who in many ways is her judicial opposite. 
If confirmed, Barrett would give the court a 6-3 conservative majority. The implications for contentious issues such as abortion, LGBT rights, gun-control measures and healthcare has prompted passionate reaction on both sides. 
Democrats said Barrett would vote to dismantle healthcare during a coronavirus pandemic that already has killed more than 200,000 Americans. 
""This nomination threatens the destruction of life-saving protections for 135 million Americans with pre-existing conditions together with every other benefit and protection of the Affordable Care Act,"" House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said. 
Obamacare has helped millions of Americans obtain medical insurance. 
Trump wants Barrett confirmed before the election. If so, she would be on the bench for the Obamacare oral arguments, with Republican-led states and Trump's administration trying to invalidate the law. A coalition of Democratic-led states is seeking to preserve the law in the litigation.
Republicans hold a 53-47 Senate majority and have committed to moving quickly on confirmation. They cheered Trump's choice.
""President Trump could not have made a better decision,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.
Senator Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), chairman of the Judiciary Committee that will conduct confirmation hearings, added, ""We move forward on this nomination knowing that the president has picked a highly qualified individual who will serve our nation well on the highest court in the land.""
Trump critics also have expressed concern that a hasty confirmation process so close to an election risks further eroding the court's reputation as independent. 
But Christian conservative and anti-abortion activists, who praised the choice, urged senators to move quickly and warned Democrats not to attack Barrett's religious faith.
""We have full confidence that the pro-life Senate majority will move swiftly to confirm her before the election,"" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group that is launching a digital advertising campaign supporting Barrett. 
Abortion rights groups said Barrett's addition to the court could jeopardize the landmark 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide.

""The Supreme Court has a vital role in protecting and upholding civil rights and liberties - including reproductive rights - for everyone in the United States. We cannot barrel forward with a nomination that will impact people's lives for generations,"" said Nancy Northup, president of the Center for Reproductive Rights.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Syria's foreign minister accused U.S. President Donald Trump's administration on Saturday of attempting to suffocate Syrians with sanctions ""just like George Floyd and others were cruelly suffocated in the United States.""
New U.S. sanctions that took effect in June under the so-called Caesar Act have further crippled the war-torn country's already crumbling economy by prohibiting foreign companies trading with Damascus.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly via a pre-recorded video on Saturday, Syria's Foreign Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Walid Al-Moualem likened the effect of the sanctions to the death of Floyd, a Black American who died in May after a white police officer knelt on his neck. 
""The real purpose of the Act is to put pressure on Syrians, their livelihoods, and their daily lives. It is an inhumane attempt to suffocate Syrians, just like George Floyd and others were cruelly suffocated in the United States,"" Al-Moualem said.
The U.S. mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In June, Russia also made a veiled reference to Floyd's death, which sparked protests across the United States and around the world, when it slammed U.S. policy toward Iran as like ""putting a knee"" to the country's neck.
Washington says the sanctions aim to cut revenue for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government and push him back into U.N.-led talks to end the more than eight-year-long conflict.
A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Moscow backing Assad and Washington supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions are internally displaced.

The list, which was due to be published in June, was postponed in order to add nominations for people playing key roles in the early months of the outbreak. It will be released on Oct. 10. 
Britain has recorded the worst death toll in Europe and one of the worst economic contractions of any leading nation since the pandemic took hold in March. 
Queen Elizabeth has made very few public appearances during that time but she has delivered a number of rallying messages to the nation and appeared in video conference calls with care workers and members of the military.
The honours have been awarded since Queen Victoria’s reign in the 19th century and aim to recognise not just well-known figures but those who have contributed to national life through often selfless and unsung contributions over many years.
In July the Queen knighted Captain Tom Moore, recognising the 100-year-old's efforts in lifting the nation's spirits during the pandemic by raising over $40 million for health workers by walking laps of his garden with the aid of a walking frame.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the pandemic was the greatest health challenge in our lifetime.

Johnson's government has sought this month to pass laws that could override parts of Britain's EU exit treaty that it signed in January, despite a warning from Brussels that doing so would wreck their future relationship. 
But the Centre for Brexit Policy said this did not go far enough because the Withdrawal Agreement allowed Brussels ongoing influence in Britain over such issues as the law and state aid.
To boost British leverage, the group says the government should also threaten to impose punitive terms on those euro zone companies wishing to raise capital for investment in London. 
John Longworth, director-general of the group, said he hoped its report would act as a wake-up call for ministers as negotiators hold talks on the future relationship in the final months before the Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31 and Britain fully leaves the bloc.
Its publication is likely to increase the pressure on Johnson's government to not back down in the tough approach it has taken to the talks. The group is backed by several key lawmakers across multiple political parties in Britain. 
""Deeply embedded in the Withdrawal Agreement are sweeping powers for the EU over much of our commercial and national life,"" Longworth said. 
""The prospect of the European Court of Justice and the European Commission continuing to issue orders to the UK and endless legal wrangling truly means we face a nightmare on Brexit street unless we break free from their clutches at the 11th hour.""

Omar Gomez, head of the special prosecutor's office for the case, told a new conference in Mexico City the warrants had been issued for the ""material and intellectual authors"" of the crime, including military members, and federal and municipal police.
The announcement came during a news conference at the National Palace in Mexico City on the sixth anniversary of the students' kidnapping. During the event, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Mexico's Undersecretary of Human Rights Alejandro Encinas held fabrics embroidered by relatives of the victims, many of whom attended the ceremony holding large pictures of the disappeared students.
Saturday marks the first time in the case Mexican authorities have announced arrest warrants for military personnel. Reuters reported earlier in the week that arrest warrants were imminent. 
The Mexican military did not respond to initial requests for comment.
The students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teachers' College disappeared on September 26, 2014, in the state of Guerrero. The remains of only two of the students have been positively identified so far.
The unsolved kidnapping of the young men who were training to be teachers convulsed the country, sparking massive protests in 2014 and garnering international condemnation as one of the darkest examples of the government’s longstanding difficulty preventing violence or convicting those responsible.
In June, authorities announced the apprehension of the leader of a Guerrero gang accused of involvement in the disappearance, and arrest warrants for Guerrero officials in connection with the case.
Family members of the victims have long accused Mexican authorities, including the military, of complicity in the students' disappearance.

""The military participated,"" Maria Martinez Zeferino, the mother of one of the disappeared students, said during Saturday's news conference.

RIYADH (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia plans to resume tourist visas by early 2021 after months of suspension amid strict government measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the kingdom's tourism minister told Reuters.
Tourism is a key pillar of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's ambitious reform strategy to reduce the economy's dependence on oil.
The kingdom, which opened its doors to foreign tourists in September 2019 by launching a new visa regime for 49 countries, wants the sector to contribute 10% of gross domestic product by 2030. 
""For tourist visa, until now we are talking about early next year. If things get better or if any positive developments happen with regards to the vaccine, we might accelerate and have it earlier,"" Ahmed al-Khateeb said in a virtual interview.
In late-February the kingdom closed its borders to foreign pilgrims and to tourists from at least 25 countries. In March, it barred all travel in and out of the country. 
Khateeb said the tourism sector has been hit hard and is expected to see a 35%-45% decline by year end. The focus on domestic tourism during the summer has cushioned the blow, however.
""This pandemic is a systematic risk that has hit everyone; 
however, we have seen a very strong summer after the January-May lockup period,"" Khateeb said.
""We have noticed a growth of 30% year on year in domestic tourism which is beyond our expectations."" 
The Saudi Summer campaign, which promoted 10 tourist destinations - from beaches and forests to mountain peaks and historic areas - for citizens and residents to visit in lieu of holidaying abroad, helped boost average occupancy ratio at hotels to 80 percent.
Saudi Arabia has reported 332,790 COVID-19 cases and 4655 deaths so far. Infection rates have seen a steady decline over the past few weeks.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Crowds protested outside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's home on Saturday demanding he quit over his handling of COVID-19 - many angered by what they said were government attempts to use lockdown measures to stifle demonstrations.
Long lines of cars drove along the main highway to Jerusalem in a protest convoy and groups gathered on bridges and junctions in other cities, also demonstrating about corruption charges against Netanyahu - charges he denies.
The protests came a day after the government tightened COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, though parliament failed to pass one measure to restrict citizens' protests to within 1 km (0.6 miles) of their homes.
That measure would have effectively halted the weekly demonstrations outside Netanyahu's residence which have built up over the summer. 
""I'm here to stop the destruction of Israel, to stop democracy dying,"" said Amit Tirosh, 42, a doctor from central Israel. 
""Luckily parliament managed to stop the demonstrations' halt at the last minute. Everyone should be here. We are at the edge of an abyss.""
Netanyahu has rejected allegations that the tougher lockdown rules were in part intended to quash the protests, which he has often called ""anarchist"" and ""ludicrous"". ""We need the lockdown in order to save lives,"" he said on Thursday. 
There was no official figure for the number of protesters on Saturday but Israel's N12 News said thousands took part. Police said most of them complied with social distancing and face mask rules.
Netanyahu's government decided this week to tighten a three-week lockdown imposed on Sept. 18, hoping to keep Israelis at home, shutting down many businesses and limiting group prayers during the ongoing Jewish high-holiday season.
On Saturday, Netanyahu urged Israelis in a video message on Twitter to pray in the open air rather than inside synagogues on Yom Kippur, the upcoming Jewish day of atonement and the holiest day in the Jewish calendar which begins on Sunday.
Only 27% of Israelis trust Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis, according to a survey published by the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday. 
Israel imposed its first lockdown in March and then relaxed it in May as new cases tapered off. But infections have since surged, reaching daily highs of more than 7,000 among the population of nine million. The country is in recession with unemployment above 11%.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - As China and the United States feuded at the United Nations this week over COVID-19 and climate, one of the world's smallest states pleaded for detente.
""Micronesia asks our American and Chinese friends to reinforce their cooperation and friendship with each other ... to achieve what is best for our global community,"" the Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo told the U.N. General Assembly in a video address.
Micronesia - with a population of about 113,000 - and its Pacific Island neighbors have long been stuck in a diplomatic tug-of-war between the world's biggest economic powers as China takes on U.S. influence in a region Washington has considered its backyard since World War Two. 
During his Friday address to the gathering of world leaders - pre-recorded due to the pandemic - Panuelo acknowledged that competition had been beneficial for some people in the Pacific. 
But he warned that the efforts ""also potentially threaten to fracture long-standing alliances within our Pacific community, and could become counterproductive to our collective desire for regional solidarity, security, and stability.""
The U.S.-Chinese showdown is now playing out at the 193-member United Nations, where Beijing has pushed for greater multilateral influence in a challenge to traditional U.S. leadership. Tensions between the two superpowers have hit boiling point at the world body over the deadly coronavirus pandemic.
Micronesia's plea stood out during the annual - yet virtual - gathering of world leaders at the United Nations this week because while most countries called for unity to combat COVID-19, other references to U.S. and Chinese frictions were generally oblique. 
International Crisis Group U.N. director Richard Gowan said most leaders want to avoid getting entangled in the tensions. 
""A lot of the U.N.'s members think the U.S. is destructive and China is power-hungry. They don't find either very appealing,"" he said. ""Ambitious Europeans like (French President Emmanuel) Macron see a chance to fill the leadership gap, so they are willing to challenge Beijing and Washington.""
RIVALRY

""The world as it is today cannot come down to simple rivalry between China and the United States, no matter the global weight of these two great powers, no matter the history that binds us together,"" Macron said. 
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also warned the world is heading in a dangerous direction and ""cannot afford a future where the two largest economies split the globe in a Great Fracture — each with its own trade and financial rules and internet and artificial intelligence capacities.""
In the Pacific, China has been forging stronger economic ties with small island nations, and drawing countries out of their long-term alliances with Taiwan, winning over Kiribati and the Solomon Islands in the past year. 
China considers Taiwan its own territory with no right to state-to-state ties. Four of Taiwan's remaining 15 diplomatic allies are in the Pacific - Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands. All four states spoke in support of Taiwan during their leaders' addresses to the United Nations. 
Though tiny in land mass, Pacific nations control vast swaths of highly strategic waters, forming a boundary between the Americas and Asia. As oceans warm and sea level rises, they are also on the frontlines of the global climate crisis. 

""It is my hope ... that the United States of America and the People's Republic of China jointly champion global causes for global solidarity and cooperation, from climate change to COVID-19,"" Panuelo said.

The newspaper said Johnson had asked Charles Moore, a former editor of the Daily Telegraph, to become the chairman of the BBC and wanted Paul Dacre, a former editor of the Daily Mail, to be chairman of media regulator Ofcom.
The BBC is entering a crucial period in its history, with some lawmakers attacking its universal funding model and online giants Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) posing a new threat. 
""This is part of a process of the prime minister putting allies in key positions,"" the newspaper quoted one source close to Johnson as saying. 
Applications for the roles are due to open shortly. Of the BBC position, a spokeswoman for the Department of Media said: ""It is an open recruitment process and all public appointments are subject to a robust and fair selection criteria."" 
The spokeswoman had no comment about the Ofcom role.
Moore and Dacre both led right-wing dailies and have accused the BBC of a left-wing bias and a willingness to go beyond its core remit of providing public service broadcasting. The BBC has denied the criticism.
The BBC is widely respected globally but it has clashed with members of Johnson's governing Conservative Party who accuse it of being out of touch with the country, particularly over Britain's departure from the European Union.
With critics circling, its new director general, Tim Davie, has told staff they should not air their own political views on social media and staff should not expect any further expansion. 
Johnson, a former journalist with the Telegraph, has questioned why the BBC should continue to be supported by an annual fee paid by all viewing households.
The BBC's television, radio and online content reaches 92% of the population, and its news and programmes, such as sci-fi drama ""Doctor Who"" and natural history documentaries pioneered by David Attenborough, have shaped Britain's culture.
It argues that the licence fee allows it to deliver hard-hitting news and entertainment while remaining independent from the state. The broadcaster has secured the income until 2027 when its charter expires.

Ofcom regulates the British media industry, including the BBC, to ensure they provide impartial news.

Four judges will have the rank of Federal Judge, and have the power to challenge the legality of BND's activities, Sueddeutsche said, citing the contents of a 111-page document.
In May, Germany's Constitutional Court said some of the intelligence agency's practices were unconstitutional.
The ruling had said that telephone and internet surveillance of foreigners abroad by the BND violated freedom of the press and right to privacy in telecommunications enshrined in the constitution, or Basic Law.
The complainants were mostly journalists reporting on human rights violations in conflict zones and in authoritarian states who were concerned about legal provisions allowing the BND to collect, store and analyse data via telecoms monitoring abroad.

Police said nine officers had been injured and 16 people arrested for offences including assaulting an officer and violent disorder, in the second weekend of trouble at a demonstration against pandemic restrictions. 
Chanting ""Freedom"" and carrying banners saying ""We Do Not Consent"" and ""COVID 1984"", thousands of people had crammed into Trafalgar Square to protest. Several told broadcasters they believed the pandemic was a hoax created by governments to control people. 
The police ordered the protest to disperse because demonstrators had failed to socially distance or wear masks, meaning it was no longer exempt from national rules that limit gatherings to six people. 
Video footage showed officers briefly using batons to drive the protesters back.
""I am very frustrated to see that nine officers were injured during clashes with a small minority of protesters,"" said Commander Ade Adelekan. 
""This is especially saddening in light of the injuries sustained by officers last weekend. We will be supporting those officers who were injured and I wish them a very speedy recovery."" 
Saturday's demonstration followed a similar event last weekend when 32 people were arrested. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson tightened COVID-19 restrictions this week, telling people to work from home if possible and ordering pubs and restaurants to close early after cases started to rise again.
The United Kingdom recorded 6,042 new cases of COVID-19, official figures showed on Saturday, and 34 new deaths among those who tested positive for the virus within 28 days.

Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Cundy told reporters he had recovered the gun, plus CCTV and body-warn video taken at the time of the shooting. ""Our specialist investigators are carefully reviewing all of that footage,"" he said.
The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which said the suspect had been arrested for possession of drugs and ammunition.

The handcuffs remained in place while officers prepared to search him using a metal detector, the IOPC said. At that point, shots were fired.
The killing of an officer is rare in Britain and the murder drew condolences from the prime minister and other senior politicians.

BANGUI (Reuters) - Central African Republic's president said on Saturday he would stand for a second term in the December election, pressing on with preparations for a vote that the opposition wants delayed due to concerns over voter registrations.
The main opposition coalition is questioning the credibility of the election, after instability in the region and the coronavirus pandemic disrupted voter rolls and required parliament to tweak the electoral calendar.
Touadera made his candidacy announcement to a crowd of 6,000 supporters in a sports hall in the capital Bangui that had been repainted for the occasion in the blue and white colours of his party.
""The Central African people will no longer go backwards. The old political recipes which have led the country into misfortune are no longer accepted,"" he said.
One challenger is deposed former president Francois Bozize, who was overthrown in a 2013 rebellion by a coalition of mainly Muslim rebels from the north, plunging the majority Christian nation into a violent civil war.
Touadera, who was prime minister under Bozize, has served as president since 2016. His first term has seen the precarious restoration of state institutions and the signing of a controversial agreement with armed groups in 2019, which has failed to bring lasting peace.
The violence has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, displacing over 600,000 people within the country while a further 600,000 live as refugees in neighbouring Cameroon, Chad, and elsewhere, according to U.N. figures.

Three members of the Lebanese security forces were also injured in the clash, which began after Lebanese forces raided a house in the Wadi Khaled area, where the group that was suspected of planning attacks was holed up, the sources said.
The group included Syrians and Lebanese, the sources said, adding that the scale of the clash, in which militants fired rocket propelled grenades, prompted the Lebanese army to cordon off the area.
The sources said the group included people linked to the militant Khaled al-Talawi, who was killed earlier this month in a shootout with security forces. Four Lebanese soldiers were killed in that clash.
Talawi was described as a former member of the Islamic State group and leader of a cell behind the killing in August of three people in north Lebanon.

Islamic State, to whom a breakaway faction of Nigerian militant group Boko Haram pledged allegiance in 2016, said on its Amaq news agency that 30 police officers and soldiers were killed in the attack on Friday on a road leading to the strategic fishing town of Baga in Borno state. 
In a statement on Saturday, Borno state police said eight police officers and three members of a government-approved militia were killed, and 13 people were wounded in the attack around noon (1100 GMT) on Friday. 
Two soldiers, a police officer and a member of the government-approved militia - all speaking anonymously because they were not authorised to speak to journalists - told Reuters at least four soldiers were also killed.
Two Nigerian military spokesmen did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Islamist militants have forced more than 2 million people to flee their homes since 2009 when Boko Haram began an insurgency aimed at creating a state adhering to a strict interpretation of sharia law. Some 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict. 
The convoy was taking people back to Baga at the start of an initiative by authorities in Borno to relocate displaced persons to their homes. Borno is the insurgency's birthplace and the state worst hit by the conflict.
Islamic State's West Africa Province (ISWAP) has become a dominant force in the region in recent years, targeting attacks on security forces. Boko Haram has carried out suicide bomb attacks and shooting raids on local residents.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's ruling coalition won a key state election on Saturday, in a vote that was widely seen as a referendum on his seven-month-old administration.
The victory in Sabah state in Borneo is likely to strengthen Muhyiddin's position as he faces a leadership challenge from opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, who said this week he had the parliamentary majority needed to oust the premier.
Muhyiddin's Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition and its allies won 38 of the 73 seats up for grabs in Saturday's election, narrowly taking control of the previously opposition-held state.
Muhyiddin said earlier that victory in Sabah could pave the way for early national elections aimed at ending uncertainty over the stability of his ruling alliance, which has a two-seat majority in parliament.
Muhyiddin came to power in March after forming an alliance with opposition parties following the shock resignation of his predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad. 
Muhyiddin's opponents have accused him of stealing power by shifting alliances instead of at the ballot box, and his allies have been pressuring him for months to call snap national polls to secure a strong mandate.
""He will use the victory to dismiss any challenge to federal leadership. Muhyiddin can now confidently lead a federal coalition in a general election,"" said Adib Zalkapli, a director with political risk consultancy BowerGroupAsia.
On Wednesday, Anwar declared that he had secured a ""formidable"" majority to claim the premiership - something Muhyiddin dismissed as a ""mere allegation"".
The power struggle comes as the Malaysian economy reels from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Muhyiddin has announced a stimulus package of 305 billion ringgit ($73.16 billion), including additional measures announced just three days ahead of the Sabah polls.

PARIS (Reuters) - The man believed to have attacked and wounded two people with a meat cleaver on Friday is cooperating with the police and said he had targeted weekly satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, a police source told Reuters.
The attack took place in front of a building where Islamist militants gunned down employees of Charlie Hebdo in 2015 because of the republication of cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammad.
It coincided with the start this month of the trial of 14 alleged accomplices in the Charlie Hebdo attack. The gunmen behind that attack killed 12 people. 
A judicial source said the suspect's custody had been extended on Saturday morning. According to French law, he faces a formal investigation at the end of the process.
A suspected accomplice of the attacker was released in the early hours of Saturday while another person close to the suspected attacker and who could had been his former roommate in a hotel north of Paris has been arrested. 
By midday Saturday, seven people remained in custody including the suspected attacker. 
Police quickly detained the man suspected of carrying out the attack next to the steps of an opera house about 500 metres away. 
The suspected attacker was from Pakistan and arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said.
A second suspect was detained moments after the attack and prosecutors were trying to establish his relation to the attacker. He was released free of charge, the source said.
Charlie Hebdo vacated its offices after the 2015 attack and is now in a secret location. The building is now used by a television production company.
Two of the production company's staff, a man and a woman, were in the street having a cigarette break when they were attacked, according to prosecutors and a colleague of the victims.
After the 2015 attack on Charlie Hebdo, investigators said the militants had wanted to avenge the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad in the magazine. Charlie Hebdo republished the cartoons on the eve of the trial.
Al-Qaeda, the militant Islamist group that claimed responsibility for the 2015 attack, threatened to attack Charlie Hebdo again after it republished the cartoons.
France has experienced a wave of attacks by Islamist militants in the past few years. Bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theatre and sites around Paris killed 130 people, and in July 2016 an Islamist militant drove a truck through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's prime minister-designate quit on Saturday after trying for almost a month to line up a non-partisan cabinet, dealing a blow to a French plan aimed at rallying sectarian leaders to tackle the worst crisis since the nation's 1975-1990 civil war.
Mustapha Adib, former ambassador to Berlin, was picked on Aug. 31 to form a cabinet after President Emmanuel Macron's intervention secured a consensus on naming him in a country where power is shared out between Muslims and Christians.
A source close to Macron said the situation that led to Adib's resignation amounted to ""collective betrayal"" by political parties but said France, the former colonial power, would not abandon Lebanon.
Under the French roadmap, the new government would take steps to tackle corruption and implement reforms needed to trigger billions of dollars of international aid to fix an economy that has been crushed by a mountain of debt.
Lebanon faced a further knock when a huge explosion at Beirut port on Aug. 4 ruined a swathe of the capital.
Adib - a Sunni Muslim, as the prime minister has to be under the sectarian power-sharing system - announced he was stepping down but said Lebanon must not abandon the French plan or squander Macron's goodwill.
""I stress that this initiative must continue,"" he said after meeting President Michel Aoun, a Christian. He wished his successor well in the ""hard task"" of forming a government.
Politicians, whose loyalties tend to follow confessional lines, had promised Paris they would have a government in place by mid-September.
But Adib's efforts stumbled in a dispute over appointments, particularly the post of finance minister, who will have a key role in drawing up economic rescue plans. 
""It's a setback, but we're not giving up,"" a French diplomatic source said.
DEADLOCK
Talks with the International Monetary Fund on a vital bailout package stalled this year, and one of the cabinet's first tasks would have been to restart the negotiations.
The street value of the Lebanese pound, which has plunged from an official peg of 1,500 to the dollar since the economic crisis erupted last year, weakened further. One trader said it was trading at 8,200, from 7,700 on Friday.
Lebanon's Al-Jadeed TV reported protests by small groups burning tyres and blocking roads in the northern city of Tripoli and Sidon in the south, particularly over the currency whose tumble has driven many into poverty.
The cabinet formation hit a deadlock over a demand by Lebanon's two main Shi'ite groups, Amal and the heavily armed Iran-backed Hezbollah, that they name several ministers, including finance, a position previously held by a Shi'ite.
Adib held several meetings with Shi'ite politicians but failed to reach agreement on how the minister would be chosen.
Shi'ite leaders feared being sidelined as Adib sought to shake up appointments to ministries, some of which have been controlled by the same faction for years, politicians said.
Mohanad Hage Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said Iranian-backed factions might have wanted to stall the cabinet formation to await the result of a U.S. election on Nov. 3.
U.S. President Donald Trump, seeking re-election, has taken a tough line on Iran and its allies, and his administration imposed sanctions on Lebanese politicians who back Hezbollah.

Amal leader and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri said his group still backed the French plan. The Free Patriotic Movement, founded by Lebanon's president and allied to Hezbollah, also said it backed the French initiative and a new cabinet had to secure broad support. Critics said Adib did not consult enough.

About 500 airmen, mostly Americans, were brought to the village of Pranjani during 1944 to be airlifted back to base in Bari, Italy, in the bold mission behind enemy lines - known as Operation Halyard.
U.S. diplomats and senior Serbian officials raised their countries' flags at the site in central Serbia during Saturday's inauguration ceremony.
For more than 50 years, during Communism, the operation was not officially acknowledged or taught in schools because it received local support from royalist troops led by convicted Nazi collaborator Draza Mihajlovic. 
Radoljub Jankovic, a local resident who was 14 at the time of the airlifts, recounted his memories of the operation in a speech at the ceremony. 
""I still hear the noise of the engines of the American planes in the air,"" he said, presenting a bottle of home-made traditional plum brandy to the U.S. ambassador to Serbia and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic.

Piotr Cywinski requested a pardon for Omar Farouq, who was accused of making blasphemous statements during an argument and sentenced by a sharia court in Nigeria's northern Kano state last month. 
If a pardon was not possible, Cywinski said he and 119 other volunteers would take on the boy's punishment and each spend a month in a Nigerian jail.
As the director of a memorial to a place ""where children were imprisoned and murdered, I cannot remain indifferent to this disgraceful sentence for humanity,"" he said in the letter to President Muhammadu Buhari, posted on the Memorial's Twitter account.
Two spokesmen for Nigeria's president declined to comment on the unusual intervention on Saturday. 
The presidency has not commented on the sentence that was condemned by rights groups. The U.N. children's agency UNICEF last month said the sentence was ""wrong"" and went against international accords that Nigeria had signed.
A special adviser to the governor of Kano said he had seen the letter on social media. 
""The position of Kano state government remains the decision of the sharia court,"" Salihu Tanko Yakasai told Reuters.
Baba Jibo Ibrahim, a spokesman for the Kano State Judiciary, said he had not seen the letter but added that the president had the power to pardon the boy.

Nigeria is roughly split evenly between the mostly Christian south and predominantly Muslim north. Twelve of Nigeria's 36 states apply sharia.

MINSK (Reuters) - Belarusian security forces detained dozens of protesters on Saturday as crowds rallied in central Minsk accusing President Alexander Lukashenko of rigging last month's election.
One group of women chanted ""Our president is Sveta!"" - referring to opposition politician Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya who they say won the vote - before riot police dragged many of them into vans. Other protesters were arrested nearby.
Belarus, a former Soviet republic closely allied with Russia, has been rocked by mass street protests since Lukashenko's claim of a landslide victory in an Aug. 9 vote.
He has denied rigging the election and dismissed opposition accusations of mass arrests and abuses as a Western smear campaign.
On Saturday, video on social media showed police detaining Nina Baginskaya, a 73-year-old who has become a central figure of the protest movement after scuffling with police last month. 
The footage showed a masked riot police officer ripping a red and white flag out of Baginskaya's hands before dragging her into a van. 
Protesters have used the flag that Belarus adopted after the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union, before Lukashenko restored the Soviet version four years later.

Lukashenko, a 66-year-old former collective farm manager, was sworn in for a sixth term on Wednesday in a ceremony held without warning, prompting thousands to take the streets of the capital.

""Yesterday, as a result of a terrible tragedy... Ukraine lost 26 of its worthy sons,"" Zelenskiy said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""I insist that the causes of this plane crash be promptly clarified and that the investigation be objective and impartial.""
He declared Saturday a day of mourning.
The Antonov An-26 aircraft crashed while trying to land during a training exercise, Ukraine's Defence Ministry said, adding that the black boxes with flight data had been found.
Ukrainian authorities said they were investigating four possible causes of the crash -- a technical malfunction involving the aircraft; improper performance by the crew; improper performance by flight control; and inadequate maintenance.
The State Security Service, a Ukrainian law enforcement agency, said the plane crashed five minutes after the crew commander asked to land after the left engine of the twin-engined plane failed. 
""According to the preliminary information, the cadets did not directly control the aircraft - all flights were performed by the crew commander,"" the State Security Service said in a statement on Saturday.
The crash happened around 2 km (1.2 miles) from a military airport.
The cadets were from the Kharkiv University of the Air Force, which is run by the defence ministry.

Modi said India was moving ahead with Phase 3 clinical trials - the large-scale trials considered the gold standard for determining safety and efficacy - and would help all countries enhance their cold chain and storage capacities for the delivery of vaccines.
Modi said in August that India was ready to mass produce COVID-19 vaccines when scientists gave the go-ahead.
U.N. chief Antonio Guterres has been pushing for a ""people's vaccine"" that is available and affordable everywhere and expressed concern on Tuesday that some countries were ""reportedly making side deals exclusively for their own populations.""
""Such 'vaccinationalism' is not only unfair, it is self-defeating. None of us is safe until all of us are safe. Everybody knows that,"" he told the General Assembly

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling nationalists signed a new coalition agreement on Saturday, ending weeks of in-fighting in the three-party alliance over how it will govern over the next three years. 
The leaders of the Law and Justice (PiS) party and the smaller conservative United Poland and Accord groups signed the deal at PiS headquarters in Warsaw on Saturday but gave no details on how the coalition will work in practice.
""I am absolutely sure that these years will be beneficial for Poland. This agreement guarantees that,"" Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the head of PiS and Poland's de facto leader, told a news conference that was also attended by the leaders of his two smaller allies and by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. 
Following short statements, the leaders signed the agreement and left. 
The three parties already form the government. But the coalition had been split by internal fights over LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) issues, animal rights and relations with the European Union. PiS leaders had threatened a minority government and early elections. 
The coalition led by PiS has won a series of elections since 2015, but the party has been under pressure because of economic difficulties exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. 
Saturday's agreement is likely to ensure the coalition maintains its majority in the lower house of parliament, allowing it to increase control over the media and to continue with reforms to the judiciary, seen by the opposition as undermining the independence of the courts. 
Earlier this week local media reported that the deal means that Kaczynski will become a deputy prime minister and oversee the Ministries of Justice, Internal Affairs and Defence. 
If confirmed, the appointment of Kaczynski would be seen as an effort to rein in Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who heads United Poland and wants Warsaw to take a more combative stance on issues such as women's and gay rights and judicial reform.

“With their illegal and inhuman sanctions, and terrorist actions, the Americans have inflicted 150 billion dollars of damage on the people of Iran,” Rouhani said in televised remarks, his voice shaking with anger. 
“We haven’t seen such an extent of savagery ... The address for Iranian people’s curses and hatred is the White House.”
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have soared since U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.
Iran, in turn, has gradually breached the central limits in that deal, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), including on the size of its stockpile of low-enriched uranium as well as the level of purity to which it was allowed to enrich uranium.
Washington imposed new sanctions on Monday on Iran’s defence ministry and others involved in its nuclear and weapons programme. 
On Thursday, Washington blacklisted several Iranian officials and entities over alleged gross violations of human rights, including imposing sanctions on a judge it said was involved in the case of an Iranian wrestler sentenced to death.

Rouhani gave no details on the breakdown of the economic damage he said had been incurred due to the sanctions.

Sources said this week that U.S. officials indicated in talks with a Sudanese delegation they wanted Khartoum to follow the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and open ties with Israel.
Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism dates back to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir, and makes it difficult for its new transitional government to access urgently needed debt relief and foreign financing.
Hamdok said Sudan had told U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a visit last month it was necessary to separate the removal from the U.S. list from the normalisation of relations with Israel.
""This topic (ties to Israel) needs a deep discussion of the society,"" he told a conference in Khartoum to discuss economic reforms.
Sudan's surging inflation and plummeting currency have been the biggest challenges to Hamdok's transitional administration, which rules with the military since Bashir's ouster.
Sudan was put on the U.S. list in 1993 because the United States believed Bashir's regime was supporting militant groups. But many in Sudan consider this is undeserved since Bashir was removed last year and Sudan has long cooperated with the United States on counter-terrorism.
The White House and State Department have declined to comment when asked about the status of negotiations.

Burhan and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a surprise meeting in Uganda earlier this year. Yet opening ties is sensitive, as Sudan was a staunch foe of Israel under Bashir.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea urged North Korea on Saturday to further investigate the fatal shooting of a South Korean fisheries official and suggested it could be an unprecedented joint probe by the two sides, as public and political outrage over the killing grew.
The move came as a rare apology from North Korean leader Kim Jong Un appears to have failed to soothe criticism over the Moon government's handling over the accident.
After a National Security Council meeting last evening, South Korea's presidential office said it would call for a joint probe into the case with the North if needed, saying there were discrepancies in accounts of the accident from the two sides. 
South Korea's military said on Thursday that the North's soldiers killed the man, doused his body in fuel and set it on fire near the sea border. 
But the North Korean government said in a message on Friday that its soldiers shot the ""illegal intruder"" and denied burning his body. 
The two Koreas have not conducted joint probes into previous accidents, including the death of the South Korean tourist who was shot at the North's mountain resort of Kumgang in 2008 and the North’s bombing of the Yeonpyeong Island which killed four South Koreans in 2010. The two Koreas have been technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce. 
""A chance of a joint probe is low. How on earth can we investigate the North Korean military?,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul. 
The North has tightened border controls due to the Covid-19 outbreak, which further complicates the prospect of the joint investigation, he said.
""Given Kim quickly offered a rare apology, there is a possibility of an exchange of written questions and answers between two Koreas,"" he said. 
'KOREAN LIVES MATTER'
In the message, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was quoted as offering an apology for disappointing his counterpart Moon Jae-in and the South Korean people.
The main opposition People Power Party said on Saturday Kim’s apology was not genuine, calling on the Moon government to send the case to the International Criminal Court and the U.S. Security Council. 
The Moon administration faces an intense political backlash over how it responded to the incident, which coincided with a renewed push by the president for engagement with Pyongyang.
Critics questioned why the military did not attempt to save him despite allegedly spotting him six hours before he was shot dead.
""Peace is important in inter-Korean relations, but the most important thing is the lives of our people. Our people were shot by North Korea and why there is no such movement as “Korean lives matter” in South Korea?,” said Thae Yong Ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to the South, and became a lawmaker. 
“I am depressed. Why are we weak in front of North Korea,"" he said at a meeting of a parliamentary task force to investigate the case.
The maritime ministry official was reported missing while on duty on a fisheries boat near the island of Yeonpyeong close to South Korea's sea border.

South Korea's military said the man was apparently attempting to defect to the North, but his brother refuted the claims, saying that he must have had an accident. The North's message did not mention whether he was attempting to defect or not, saying the man said he was from South Korea.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An armed militia killed at least 15 people in a pre-dawn attack on Friday in western Ethiopia, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said in a statement late on Friday, the latest security challenge for Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government.
The attack follows another similar incident earlier this month that took place in the same Metakal zone of Ethiopia's Benishangul-Gumuz region, which borders Sudan, where 30 people were killed.
""Civilians are being subjected to repeated attacks with unmitigated cruelty in Benishangul-Gumuz,"" said Daniel Bekele, the head of the EHRC. ""Federal and regional authorities should take the required steps to enforce the rule of law and bring perpetrators to account.""
The Commission did not say what was behind the attacks and Abera Bayeta, the region's peace and security head, did not immediately respond to calls seeking comment.
The Commission said that the Ethiopian National Defense forces engaged in a shootout with armed gunmen in the area and were able to restore calm by Friday afternoon. 
The killing is the latest incident of violence in the region. In June last year, men in camouflage uniforms killed more than 50 people and injured 23 in the same area. [USKCN1TR2FI]

1549,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 26, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>","Less razzmatazz, but Nobel Prizes go ahead amid pandemic","By Simon Johnson
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The winners of this year's Nobel Prizes will miss out on a swanky gala in Stockholm surrounded by royalty and Sweden's glitterati, but 2020 will at least not be added to the war years when no awards were given. 
Yet as the coronavirus pandemic rapidly enveloped much of the world earlier this year, that was far from certain.
""When we were thinking about this in March and April this year, we were worried that it wouldn't be possible to award any prizes at all,"" Lars Heikensten, head of the Nobel Foundation that administers the prizes founded by dynamite inventor Alfred Nobel, told Reuters.
While Sweden has not imposed a rigid lockdown like many European countries, Heikensten said the committees that decide the various prizes had to switch to working digitally to make the selection process work. 
But the foundation was determined that the awards - worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.1 million) this year - go ahead.
""We thought it was particularly important in a year like this, when the importance of science is so obvious,"" Heikensten said.
The awards were cancelled during parts of World War One and World War Two. Some prizes have not been given in individual years, with the most recent example being the postponement of the Literature prize in 2018 over a sex scandal.
The awards attract huge attention every year, shining a light, if only briefly, on scientists who work mostly in academic obscurity, while burnishing the reputations of often better-known authors who receive the Literature award. 
But the COVID-19 pandemic, which has claimed almost a million lives globally, has meant that the Nobels will have a lower profile this year with many of the traditional celebrations postponed or re-jigged as digital events.
The foundation has cancelled the banquet, highlight of the celebrations that takes place every December, and the traditional prize-giving ceremony in Stockholm's Concert Hall will be replaced by a televised event where winners receive their prizes in their home nations.
This year's first prize - for Physiology or Medicine - will be announced on Oct. 5. Heikensten said if restrictions allowed by the end of next year, the 2020 winners would be invited to celebrate alongside the 2021 laureates.
""The traditional celebrations are important and part of what we are, but they are not the most important thing, which is the prize winners and what they embody,"" he said.

Five Republican U.S. senators urged Netflix this week to reconsider plans to adapt the book into a TV series because they said the author has defended the Chinese government's clampdown on ethnic Uighurs and other Muslims in the Xinjiang region.
""The Three-Body Problem"" and two sequels were written by Liu Cixin. 
Netflix announced this month that it was turning the books into a live-action, English-language TV series led by D.B Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of HBO megahit ""Game of Thrones"".
Liu serves as a consulting producer on the project. 
""Mr. Liu is the author of the book not the creator of this show. We do not agree with his comments, which are entirely unrelated to his book or this Netflix show,"" said Netflix Global Public Policy Vice President Dean Garfield in a letter to the senators. 
""If anything, the government is helping their economy and trying to lift them out of poverty,"" Liu told the New Yorker magazine in 2019. 
""If you were to loosen up the country a bit, the consequences would be terrifying.""
The senators also asked Netflix to reconsider the implications of providing a platform to Liu in producing this project.
The Netflix streaming service is available in more than 190 countries but does not operate in China.
The United States and human rights groups have criticized China's treatment of the Uighurs. 
China's foreign ministry has repeatedly denied the existence of internment camps in Xinjiang, calling the facilities vocational and educational institutions and accusing what it calls anti-China forces of smearing its Xinjiang policy.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian wildlife officials began disposing of hundreds of dead pilot whales on Saturday after concluding there was no longer any hope of rescuing any more.
In Australia's biggest whale beaching, 470 whales were first spotted on a wide sandbank during an aerial reconnaissance of rugged Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania state on Monday.
After days of difficult and dangerous rescue attempts, Australia said they rescued 108 whales, with the rest now believed to have died.
Rob Buck, Incident Controller and Parks and Wildlife Service manager, said 15 whales have already been disposed of at sea, but the operations to dispose of the remaining near 350 mammals was expected to take several days at least.
""Collection and disposal is being undertaken with the assistance of aquaculture companies whose equipment and expertise on the harbour is essential for a timely and effective outcome,"" Buck said in an emailed statement.
The bodies of the dead whales were being separated into groups and enclosed with water booms to try keep them in one place and isolated from sharks and other predators.

Most of the released whales, a gregarious species that lives in deep waters, were expected to ""regroup"" and recover from the traumatic event, officials said.

Tsarukyan, leader of the Prosperous Armenia party, the second-biggest faction in parliament, denied any wrongdoing, saying the criminal prosecution against him was political.
Parliament stripped Tsarukyan of his immunity in June, allowing him to be arrested. The National Security Service raided his home and interrogated him. 
""This is politically motivated. They will answer for their decision,"" Tsarukyan said late on Friday as he was going to the National Security Service. ""In a short time everything will be put in its place.""
His arrest was ordered by the Yerevan Court of General Jurisdiction over allegations of misconduct surrounding the 2017 elections, which preceded a peaceful revolution.
Prosperous Armenia, the Armenian Revolutionary Federation and the new Homeland party led by former national security chief Artur Vanetsyan, said this week they plan a mass protest for Oct. 8.
“The hopes of many people haven’t been fulfilled and the promises weren’t kept for the last two years,"" Prosperous Armenia spokeswoman Iveta Tonoyan told reporters on Tuesday in parliament. ""There is great public discontent with the government, and to make it heard we will organise a protest.""
Tsarukyan has accused Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and his government of mishandling the economy and failing to fight the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.
Armenia, a country of 3 million, has registered 48,643 confirmed coronavirus cases and 947 COVID-19 deaths as of Friday, the worst-affected country in the South Caucasus region. 
The economy will contract 6.2% this year because of the pandemic, reversing last year's 7.6% growth, the central bank forecasts. 
Pashinyan and his party came to power in May 2018 after the revolution against corruption and cronyism. Tsarukyan aligned himself with that movement at one stage.

Tsarukyan's party won 26 of the 132 seats in snap parliamentary elections in December 2018 after the revolution. Some of its members joined Pashinyan's cabinet, but they were soon dismissed.

KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen visited a low-key but critical maintenance base for fighter jet engines on Saturday, offering encouragement as the Chinese-claimed island's armed forces strain in the face of repeated Chinese air force incursions.
This month alone, China's drills have included its jets crossing the mid-line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait and exercising near the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands in the South China Sea.
Beijing regards Taiwan as a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the democratic island under its control.
Taiwan's air force has repeatedly scrambled to intercept Chinese jets. Though they have not flown over mainland Taiwan itself, the flights have ramped up pressure, both financial and physical, on Taiwan's air force to ensure its aircraft are ready to go at any moment.
Visiting the Gangshan air base in southern Taiwan's Kaohsiung, Tsai received a detailed account of how the maintenance crew is making sure Taiwan's F-16 and other fighters are operating at peak performance.
She appeared slightly taken aback when told the cost of one small component for the F-CK-1 Ching-kuo Indigenous Defence Fighter was T$380,000 ($13,000).
Speaking later to sailors at the nearby Zuoying naval base, Tsai promised to be the strongest backer of the island's armed forces.
“If there was no backup or help from you all, the military’s steadfast combat strength would be greatly reduced,"" she said.
Taiwan's air force is dwarfed by China's, and the strain of the multiple sorties on Taiwan's armed forces have begun to show.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry this month said the ""dramatic increase"" in the threat level, along with the aircraft being ""middle-aged"" had led to a huge increase in maintenance costs not originally budgeted for.
Saldik Fafana, 21，a trainee air force engineer at the Gangshan base, said he had noticed an impact recently. ""There is more work,"" he told reporters.
'CONSTANTLY ON EDGE'
Taiwan is revamping its fighter line-up.
The United States last year approved an $8 billion sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan, a deal that would bringing the island's total to more than 200, the largest F-16 fleet in Asia.
Premier Su Tseng-chang expressed concern on Wednesday about the cost of the tensions with China.
""Each time the communist aircraft harass Taiwan, our air force takes to the skies, and it is extremely costly. This isn't only a burden for Taiwan, but quite a big one for China too,"" he said.
One Taiwan-based diplomat, citing conversations with security officials, said China appeared to be waging a campaign of attrition with its frequent fly-bys.
""China is trying to wear out Taiwan's pilots by keeping them constantly on edge,"" the diplomat said on condition of anonymity.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry, in a report to parliament last month, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, said China's flights over the narrow strait's mid-line were aimed at reducing Taiwan's response time.
This has put ""enormous pressure"" on Taiwan's frontline responders, it said.
Chinese flights to Taiwan's southwest, including at night, are ""an attempt to exhaust our air defences"", the ministry added, warning that if these become regular fixtures, they will ""increase our burden of response"".

The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) had released a report on Thursday which estimated that about 16,000 mosques in Xinjiang have been destroyed or damaged as a result of government policies, mostly since 2017. 
The estimates were made using satellite imagery and based on a sample of 900 religious sites prior to 2017, including mosques, shrines and sacred sites.
""The Chinese government has embarked on a systematic and intentional campaign to rewrite the cultural heritage of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region... in order to render those indigenous cultural traditions subservient to the 'Chinese nation',"" said the ASPI report. 
""Alongside other coercive efforts to re-engineer Uighur social and cultural life by transforming or eliminating Uighurs' language, music, homes and even diets, the Chinese Government's policies are actively erasing and altering key elements of their tangible cultural heritage.""
In response to the report, China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin called it ""nothing but slanderous rumors"" during a press conference on Friday, and said the ASPI had received foreign funds to ""support its concoction of lies against China."" 
""It we look at the numbers, there are more than 24,000 mosques in Xinjiang, which is over ten times more than in the U.S.,"" said Wang. ""It means there is a mosque for every 530 Muslims in Xinjiang, which is more mosques per capita than many Muslim countries.""
China has come under scrutiny over its treatment of Uighur Muslims and claims of alleged forced-labour abuses in Xinjiang, where the United Nations cites credible reports as saying one million Muslims held in camps have been put to work.

China has denied mistreating Uighurs, and say the camps are vocational training centres that are needed to tackle extremism.

(Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Friday chided President Donald Trump for not speaking out about repression of democratic protests in Belarus, a country he said is being run by a ""dictator.""
More than 12,000 people have been arrested, and hundreds remain in jail, since President Alexander Lukashenko was declared the landslide winner of an Aug. 9 presidential election that the opposition in the former Soviet state denounced as rigged. 
In a statement emailed to Reuters, Biden sided with demonstrators' ""peaceful expressions of freedom"" and demands for new elections.
Biden, a former vice president and Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman who has had testy clashes with Russia over eastern Europe, also insisted on the release of several named opposition leaders whom he called ""political prisoners.""
""Yet President Trump refuses to speak out against Lukashenka's actions or to offer his personal support for the pro-democracy movement,"" Biden said, using an alternate spelling of the Belarusian politician's name.
Lukashenko was abruptly inaugurated on Wednesday in what Biden called a ""sham ceremony,"" the same day that U.S. news was dominated by Trump's declining to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose his re-election bid against Biden on Nov. 3.
""A president hiding in fear from his own citizens, refusing to accept the will of the people is a sign of a weak, illegitimate autocrat, not a strong leader,"" Biden said in his statement.
Trump and Biden are set to meet for their first debate on Tuesday. The topics are to include ""race and violence in our cities,"" the organizers said.
The two have clashed over whether mass demonstrations in the United States over police violence against Black people are largely peaceful or whether they need to be met with militarized force, with Trump calling himself the ""law and order"" president.
A spokeswoman for Trump's presidential campaign referred a request for comment to the White House, which did not immediately respond.
The comments from Biden would seem to show little sign of respite for Lukashenko, 66, who is now reliant on his security forces and his ally Russia to maintain his 26-year grip on power. He has brushed off the condemnation.
The United States, Britain and Canada are expected to impose sanctions soon on Belarusian individuals over what those governments view as a rigged election and violence against peaceful protesters, sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters.

Biden promised to ""defend our democratic values and stand with those who share them"" in his statement but did not detail policy steps his administration would take against Belarus.

LEONA THERON, SOUTH AFRICA
Theron is one of 11 judges at South Africa's Constitutional Court.
She has become known for challenging laws that discriminate against women and girls from the bench of the highest court.
Aged 33, Theron became the first Black female judge, as well as the overall youngest judge, to be appointed at the KwaZulu-Natal division of the high court in 1999.
Since then, Theron has handed down numerous judgments promoting the rights of women in South Africa.
A prominent 2008 ruling argued that women married in customary marriages have equal rights and benefits to their spouses. This was upheld by the Constitutional Court, helping mainly Black women to benefit from their property rights.
Theron has also been a staunch defender of justice for rape survivors. In 2006, at the Supreme Court of Appeal, Theron dissented a majority judgment that had decreased the life sentence of a rapist to 16 years in jail.
Theron once wrote: ""Against the backdrop of the unprecedented spate of rapes in this country, courts must also be mindful of their duty to send out a clear message to potential rapists and to the community that they are determined to protect the equality, dignity and freedom of all women.""

Ndung'u was appointed to Kenya's Supreme Court in 2011, and is one of only two women currently serving the seven-member court.
Before becoming a Supreme Court justice, the advocate served as a member of parliament for four years where she was instrumental in bringing forward legislation to protect and empower Kenya's women and girls.
Ndung'u is the architect of Kenya's Sexual Offences Act 2006 - a landmark piece of legislation - aimed at giving victims of sexual violence access justice and punishing perpetrators.
Often known as the 'Njoki law', it introduces mandatory minimum sentences for a wide range of offences including child rape, trafficking for sexual exploitation, and the deliberate transmission of HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.
During her parliamentary term, Ndung'u was behind amendments to Kenya's Employment Act 2007 which provided for paid maternity and paternity leave, and the Political Parties Act 2007 on affirmative action measures for women in politics.
During a TED talk in 2017, Ndung'u advocated for more women in the policy-making positions in government.
""If you are absent at the table, so are your interests,"" she said.

Benito, born in Costa Rica, rose to prominence in the 1990's as a judge on the United Nation's International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that dealt with war crimes.
She played a key role in establishing case law arguing that wartime rape and other forms of sexual violence were used as weapons of war, as a means of terror, and were war crimes.
As president of the Inter-American Court, Benito has said: ""We must accept that we will only live in true democracies if women, in all their diversity, participate in making all the decisions that affect our lives.""
MEAZA ASHENAFI, ETHIOPIA
Ashenafi was appointed Ethiopia's first female Supreme Court Chief in November 2018.
As an adviser to a commission drafting Ethiopia's new constitution in the early 1990s', and later as a lawyer fighting for victims of domestic and sexual violence, inheritance disputes and custody battles, Ashenafi helped enshrine in law many protections for women and girls.
Her most famous case was turned into the 2014 award-winning Ethiopian film ""Difret"" - promoted by Hollywood actor Angelina Jolie as executive producer.
The film is based on a court case where Ashenafi defended a teenage girl for killing a man who had abducted and raped her.
Ashenafi's efforts got the charges against the teenager dropped - and resulted in the outlawing of the tradition of kidnapping girls to be forced into marriage in Ethiopia.
The advocate is also credited with creating a word in Amharic - one of Ethiopia's main languages - to describe sexual harassment.
""Naming it was very important,"" said Ashenafi in an interview with American broadcaster VOA last year. ""Unless you name it, it's difficult to advocate for legislative reform to articulate the issue and publicise and expose the practice.""

In a historic ruling, the court ruled abortion was allowed under limited circumstances - in cases of rape, incest, fetal malformation, or if the life of the mother or fetus is in danger.
Her case has served as an example and inspiration for other lawyers in Latin America seeking to decriminalize abortion.
""All the attempts to overturn the court's decision since then have been defeated and the law is still strong and binding,"" Roa once told the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation.

A Rhodes scholar who read law at Oxford University and at Harvard University, Guruswamy is an expert on constitutional law, and has advised Nepal on framing its constitution.
She is a leading voice in upholding constitutional rights and equality for women, religious minorities and sexual minorities, in particular.
Asked for her advice to young women lawyers, Guruswamy once said: ""The law is a wonderful profession, but I think in India as a woman, and as a woman lawyer, you have to listen to your heart and say that you will get there. Because everything around you says that you can't.""

Jaising, 80, is a senior advocate in India's Supreme Court and was the country's first woman additional solicitor general between 2009 and 2014.
In the early days of her career, she took up cases defending the rights of air hostesses seeking pay parity and promotions, as well as the rights of street hawkers and the homeless.
Jaising, born in pre-independent India in 1940, studied arts and law at Bangalore University and the University of Mumbai and was a rare woman in India's male-dominated courts when she started practicing.
She has taken on a powerful police officer and a high court judge in sexual harassment cases and played a pioneering role in the drafting of India's laws against sexual harassment at workplace and against domestic violence.
She has also fought for equal inheritance rights for women and for their equal rights in child custody cases.

Jaising once said she believes that law is like ""plasticine in our hands, and we must shape it to the benefit of the most vulnerable and marginalised"".

KYIV (Reuters) - A military transport plane carrying air force cadets crashed and burst into flames near a highway in northeastern Ukraine on Friday evening, killing at least 22 people on board, officials said.
The Antonov An-26 aircraft crashed while trying to land during a training exercise, the General Staff of the Armed Forces Ruslan Khomchak said in a statement, adding that at least two more people were critically injured. 
Video posted by Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed the plane in flames lying near a road and smoke billowing upwards in the night sky. 
Footage taken later showed rescue workers inspecting the smoking wreckage near the town of Chuhuiv.
An investigation has started on what caused the crash. 
One pilot reported failure in the left engine of the twin-engined plane, said Oleksiy Kucher, the governor of the Kharkiv region, according to Interfax Ukraine, adding this would not have been a critical situation for an experienced pilot.
Citing preliminary information, Kucher said that some of the people on board managed to jump out of the plane when it was at low altitude. 
An eyewitness who was driving along the road towards Chuhuiv told Reuters he saw a man in flames running from the plane after it crashed.
""Another car stopped behind us. We took a fire extinguisher and ran with another driver to help him,"" said Yaroslav, who gave only his first name.
""Another man came from the plane. He had a cut on his head. We pulled him to the opposite side (of the road). The one who was on fire, we put the fire out."" 
The crash happened around 2 km (1.2 miles) from a military airport, the State Emergency Service of Ukraine said in a statement. It said 27 people had been on board the plane.
The cadets were from the Kharkiv University of Air Force, which is run by the defence ministry.

""A state commission is being created to identify all the circumstances and causes of this disaster. Search and rescue work continues on the spot,"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office said. Zelenskiy will travel to the area on Saturday.

ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigeria's airports could shut down on Monday as four key unions said they would join an indefinite nationwide strike to protest an increase in power and petrol prices. 
A Thursday statement issued by four unions representing pilots, engineers and other aviation professionals said they are ""in full support"" of a strike called by the Nigerian Labour Congress, which represents millions of workers across most sectors of Africa's biggest economy.
""All workers in the aviation sector are hereby directed to withdraw their services at all aerodromes nationwide as from 00hrs of 28th September,"" the unions said in a statement seen by Reuters. 
The signatories included National Union of Air Transport Employees, the National Association of Aircraft Pilots and Engineers, the Air Transport Services (NASDAQ:ATSG) Senior Staff Association of Nigeria and the Association of Nigeria Aviation Professionals.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Aviation said negotiations are happening at a high level; union leaders met yesterday with the Labour, Petroleum and Power ministries at the presidential villa, but reached no consensus.
Nigeria's government removed pump-price controls on petrol earlier this month, and roughly doubled power tariffs in an aim to shore up a budget battered by a fall in oil prices and an economic contraction brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Petrol subsidies drained billions from government coffers, while experts said artificially low tariffs were holding back much-needed investment in the nation's dilapidated power sector. 
International lenders such as the World Bank have pressed Nigeria to make the reforms to qualify for budget support loans.
But the unions said the increases were poorly timed due to the economic hardship created by the pandemic, with high inflation and a recession looming after the economy contracted in the second quarter. 

Union leaders previously said a reversal of the price hikes would avert the strike.

1561,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 06:36PM ET</span>",Special Report: Will your mail ballot count in the U.S. presidential election? It may depend on who's counting and where,"By Julia Harte, Jason Lange and Simon Lewis
(Reuters) - Two elderly women in small towns in Wisconsin voted by mail during April’s presidential nominating contests. Both were sheltering in place as coronavirus surged across their state.
Each mailed her ballot to the local election office with a note explaining why no witness had signed the envelope, as Wisconsin’s strict voting laws require. The women didn’t want to risk virus exposure, they told Reuters in telephone interviews this month.
That’s where the similarity ends. The ballot of Peggy Houglum, a 72-year-old voter in the eastern Wisconsin hamlet of Cedar Grove, was rejected due to the missing witness information. That of Judith Olson, 88, a resident of the northern town of Elk, was accepted, according to “incident” logs viewed by Reuters in which Wisconsin election offices document irregular ballots. Houglum, who plans to vote for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in November, said she was never told her ballot didn’t count. Olson wouldn’t provide her party affiliation or say whom she supports for president.
Local election officials confirmed the fate of those ballots. Cedar Grove Village Clerk Julie Brey told Reuters she had sought guidance from the Wisconsin Elections Commission on what to do. Her Elk counterpart, Suzanne Brandt, said she couldn’t recall who advised her to accept an unwitnessed ballot.
The unequal treatment in the same crucial battleground state underscores a growing worry about the general election on Nov. 3 between Biden and incumbent Republican President Donald Trump. Whether or not a mail ballot is counted could depend to a large degree on how local election workers enforce mail-in voting rules, how they notify voters who submit deficient ballots, and whether they allow them to fix such errors. Each of the 50 U.S. states has a central election authority, but ballots are processed by dozens of separate county or municipal election offices within each state.
Reuters reviewed incident logs and other election records from Wisconsin’s April race. The news organization also examined data from election offices in North Carolina, Florida and Arizona containing the number of mail-in ballots rejected in recent elections in those presidential battlegrounds. Reuters also surveyed 36 election officials across the four states about how they processed mail-in ballots, notified voters who mailed deficient ballots, and enabled those voters to cast valid votes.
The records detailed more than 3 million mail ballots cast during the four states’ presidential nomination contests this year. The vast majority of those were accepted, but at least 25,000 mail-in ballots were rejected for violations of signature and witness requirements. Reuters could not follow up with all individuals whose ballots were rejected. Still, some trends emerged from the statewide data and interviews with dozens of voters and election officials.
Reuters found:
- Minorities, who tend to vote Democratic, are more likely than white voters to have their mail-in ballots rejected for signature and witness issues in North Carolina and Florida. Voter race data was unavailable in Arizona and Wisconsin.
- Procedures for handling deficient mail ballots differed, sometimes markedly, between election offices within each state; and election officials told Reuters of varying timetables and methods for notifying voters. Ballot designs also diverged, with signature boxes clearer on some than others.
- Geography and population size helped determine how easily election officials could contact voters about ballot deficiencies. Officials in small, compact jurisdictions tended to say they found it easier to notify voters than did their counterparts in larger communities, because they were more likely to know voters personally.

'VOTING WITHOUT A SAFETY NET'
U.S. mail-in voting surged in states that held presidential primaries after mid-March, when the COVID-19 pandemic exploded. Millions of Americans are projected to cast mail ballots for the first time this November, with coronavirus expected to drive record-high absentee turnout.
Slowed U.S. Postal Service deliveries this summer raised alarms about ballots arriving too late to be counted. But voters may not be aware of other potential pitfalls.
The uneven application of mail-in voting rules illegally disadvantages some voters, according to voting-rights advocates, who have sued to standardize the way local officials process absentee ballots, notify voters about errors and allow voters to fix them in the four states that Reuters examined. One lawsuit failed in September to eliminate Wisconsin’s witness requirement. Another successfully extended the period for Arizona voters to add signatures to unsigned ballots. Activists won settlements in two additional cases, one in Florida, the other in North Carolina, though they say those states have yet to comply fully.
For millions of U.S. voters, voting-rights advocates say, the odds of their mail-in ballot counting this November could come down to where they are registered to vote and how workers in their local election office implement their state’s voting rules.
""Mail-in voting is voting without a safety net,"" because voters are not present to resolve any issues that arise with their mail ballots, said David Becker, head of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. That underscores why statewide rules ""shouldn’t be applied differently county to county,"" he said.
Jason Snead, executive director at the conservative Honest Elections Project, said election officials should apply absentee ballot requirements as uniformly as possible. Still he said “absolute uniformity” goes against the U.S. tradition of running elections locally to provide “flexibility, responsiveness and direct accountability to voters.” He said voters need to know they must ""follow every rule that is written out on that ballot, make sure that they've crossed every t, dotted every i.”
The stakes are high.
Trump won the White House in 2016 by a whisker. He lost the popular vote, but fewer than 80,000 votes in three crucial states, including Wisconsin, handed him an Electoral College victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Recent polls slightly favor Biden in Wisconsin, but he and Trump are neck-and-neck in Florida, Arizona and North Carolina.
The number of rejected mail ballots is almost certain to be higher in November than it was in this year’s primaries because of higher expected turnout, election experts said.
In North Carolina, for example, about 1% of voters cast mail ballots in the March 3 primary, before coronavirus swept the nation. That figure could soar close to 25% in November, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll of likely voters conducted earlier this month. About a third of voters in Florida expect to vote by mail, as do about two in five voters in Wisconsin and more than half in Arizona, other Reuters/Ipsos polls showed this month.
If officials in North Carolina and Florida alone toss out ballots in November at the rates they did in March, more than 75,000 voters could be disenfranchised, Reuters calculates. That figure assumes turnout matches 2016 levels, and that voters end up casting mail ballots at the levels they said they would in the polls.

TALE OF TWO BALLOTS
In the four battleground states, Reuters found examples of 24 voters whose ballots were rejected without their knowledge, because local authorities used different mail-in ballot counting processes or notification procedures than other localities in the same state. Election officials in almost every case claimed they had attempted to notify voters who cast deficient ballots and informed them how to cast a valid vote.
Wisconsin and North Carolina are among 11 U.S. states that require absentee ballot envelopes to be signed by a witness.
More than half of the 23,000 absentee ballots rejected in Wisconsin’s April 7 primary were thrown out for lacking a voter signature, witness information or both, according to state data. On April 2, a federal district judge in Wisconsin relaxed the witness requirement due to the pandemic. That ruling was overturned by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals the next day.
Election officials statewide applied the witness requirement in myriad ways, according to a Reuters analysis of incident logs and other public records from municipalities comprising about 80% of Wisconsin’s electorate.
In the eastern Wisconsin village of Waldo, home to around 500 people, Clerk-Treasurer Michelle Brecht noticed a dozen voters had omitted witness information on their mail ballots; witnesses must provide a signature and an address. Because Brecht knew almost everyone in town, she told Reuters, she contacted all affected voters and was able to help them fix their ballots.
In the western Wisconsin town of Pepin, meanwhile, ballots lacking voter signatures and witness information were among 143 mail votes counted, according to County Board of Canvassers’ minutes from the April primary. The minutes did not say how many mail ballots were deficient, but the board recommended “more training for election workers in the area of absentee ballot processing.”
Nancy Wolfe, town clerk of Pepin, whose population is a little more than 800 residents, said her staff had received additional training. She did not respond when asked specifically about the board’s claim that deficient absentee ballots were accepted in the April primary.
Some inconsistencies likely arose from confusion over the last-minute court rulings, according to Jay Heck, state director for Common Cause Wisconsin, a government watchdog group. The appeals court reversed the district court’s lifting of the witness requirement just days before the election, he noted, leaving election officials disoriented. Heck also pointed to Wisconsin’s “unusually decentralized” election administration system, in which 1,850 separate municipalities handle voter registration and absentee ballots.
North Carolina’s witness requirement is even stricter: Absentee voters had to find two witnesses for the March 3 primary. That tripped up retiree William Hearn. He told Reuters he only got one witness to sign his ballot envelope. (For the November presidential contest, North Carolina is allowing voters to secure a single witness.)
Hearn, 72, was one of at least 121 voters in Durham County and nearly 1,800 statewide who had mail-in ballots rejected for missing signature or witness information, according to a Reuters analysis of state election data.
Derek Bowens, director of the elections board of Durham County, which contains North Carolina’s fourth-largest city, Durham, said his office mailed a replacement ballot with a letter of explanation to Hearn on February 27, one day after receiving his incomplete ballot.
Hearn said he never received it and had no idea his original ballot had been rejected until notified in September by Reuters. “I have a very big problem with that,” Hearn said. A Biden supporter, he now fears his mail ballot could be rejected in November without his knowledge.
An hour south in Harnett County, Republican David Krachun, 57, forgot to sign his ballot in the March primary. In contrast to Durham, Harnett County voters who cast deficient ballots were notified twice by mail and as many times as necessary by phone, according to county elections director Claire Jones.
Of the 25 voters who had mail ballots rejected in Harnett County, which is largely Republican, seven eventually cast a ballot that counted, according to Jones; they included Krachun, who mailed in a second absentee ballot that was accepted. Harnett County's 28% ""cure"" rate was close to three times that of Durham County, a Democratic stronghold.
RACIAL DISPARITIES
Krachun is white, while Hearn, whose ballot was rejected, is Black.
During the March election in North Carolina, about 5% of all voters who returned mail ballots had them rejected for signature or witness issues and ended up not casting a vote that counted, state election records show. Broken down by race, about 8% of Black voters didn’t wind up casting a valid vote after their mail ballots were tossed compared to about 5% of white voters. Election officials interviewed by Reuters had no explanation for the disparity.
Florida counties also reject mail-in ballots at widely varying rates, and they reject Black and Hispanic voters at higher rates than white voters, according to University of Florida professor Daniel Smith.
Smith examined mail-in ballots in March’s presidential primary that were recorded as being delivered by Election Day. Out of those voters, 1.1% of Hispanics and 0.8% of Blacks had their ballots rejected, Smith found, compared with just 0.4% of whites.
Officials in six Florida counties where minorities were rejected at significantly higher rates than white voters said their offices applied the rules consistently and that racial and ethnic disparities must be due to factors outside their control.
“It's definitely not something purposely being done,” said Kari Ewalt, community relations manager for the supervisor of elections in Osceola County. Smith found that Hispanic voters there were more than twice as likely as white voters to have their ballots rejected.
One possible explanation is that many minority voters have little experience with mail voting. But Smith found that even accounting for that, Black and Hispanic voters were more likely to have their ballots rejected. The variation across Florida counties suggested “it can’t just be the individual’s fault,” Smith said.
Disparities could arise from officials in some election offices being stricter when scrutinizing a voter’s signature, Smith said. The design of the ballot return envelope, and how quickly officials process ballots and flag problems to voters, are also potential factors, he said.
NO STANDARD PROCESS
Local election officials in all four states have considerable leeway in how they process mail-in ballots and respond to errors.
In Florida, officials must contact voters whose ballots lack signatures and offer them a chance to confirm their identities with an affidavit, which can be returned up to two days after the polls close. But there is no set prescription for how to do that. Some election offices first try to call the voter, others first put the affidavit in the mail. Others said they primarily use email.
In North Carolina, a Reuters survey of 20 counties revealed similar differences. In rural Lee County, Karen Marosites, deputy director of elections, said it sometimes took eight days to notify a voter of a deficient mail-in ballot.
In response to a lawsuit brought by groups including the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, a civil rights organization, a federal judge in North Carolina in August ordered the state elections board to publish statewide guidance that would bring the state’s 100 counties into alignment.
Coalition attorneys said the resulting guidance, released September 22, was an improvement but still lacked clarity on how counties would help voters cure deficient ballots. The North Carolina elections board did not respond to requests for comment.
In Wisconsin, a federal district judge in September upheld Wisconsin’s witness requirement after the Democratic National Committee sued to remove it due to the pandemic.
In Arizona, another lawsuit filed by the Democratic Party this year prompted the state’s 15 counties to standardize how mail-in voters could fix signature issues, giving them five business days after Election Day to cure unsigned ballots and mismatched signatures. But officials still have significant leeway in contacting voters.
Pima County, Arizona’s second-largest, mails replacement ballots only to voters whose unsigned ballots arrive more than a week before Election Day. Rural Apache (NASDAQ:APA) County, meanwhile, notifies such voters via phone, email and U.S. mail, and follows up at least twice with phone and email if needed -- in addition to sending back the unsigned ballot if there is enough time for voters to sign and return it. “We have had people call us mad that we are ‘spamming’ them,” said Apache County Chief Deputy Recorder Bowen Udall.
Alex Gulotta, the Arizona state director of All Voting is Local, a voting-rights group, said such differences can determine whether votes count - or not.

“There shouldn’t even be a possibility for that much variance to exist between the counties,” Gulotta said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's left-leaning opposition New Democratic Party (NDP) on Friday said it would back Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in a confidence vote to be held in coming weeks, averting the threat of a fall election.
In a so-called Throne Speech delivered on Wednesday, Trudeau sought the support of at least one opposition party on a sweeping agenda to battle COVID-19, help those hurt by it, and foster economic growth. 
Trudeau's Liberal party does not have a majority in parliament and needs the support of at least one of three opposition parties. The other two groups had already signaled they would not back the government.
After reaching a deal on a bill to expand the recipients of unemployment benefits and to provide paid sick leave for many who previously did not get it, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh said he would back the government.
""We will support that bill and then, yes, we will be able to support that Throne Speech,"" Singh said, provided Liberals indeed follow through on their promise when the bill's modifications are presented to parliament on Monday.
On Thursday, the Liberals increased the proposed weekly unemployment payout to match the amount millions of unemployed Canadians had received as emergency support during the pandemic to win the NDP backing. 
That emergency support expires this weekend and will be replaced by the revised unemployment package.

""We now have an agreement with the NDP on a bill that will deliver the help that Canadians need,"" Pablo Rodriguez, Liberal House of Commons leader, said on Twitter. ""It's by working together that we will get through this pandemic.""

Delivering a recorded speech to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA), Johnson will say the COVID-19 pandemic has increased barriers to trade.
He will also present a five-point plan to improve the international response to future pandemics.
""After nine months of fighting COVID, the very notion of the international community looks tattered,"" he will say, according to advance extracts distributed by his office.
""Unless we unite and turn our fire against our common foe, we know that everyone will lose. Now is the time therefore ... for humanity to reach across borders and repair these ugly rifts.""
His plan includes a global network of research hubs, more vaccine manufacturing capacity, and an agreement to reduce export tariffs imposed at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
He will commit an initial 71 million pounds to the global vaccine partnership known as COVAX to secure purchase rights on 27 million doses, and 500 million to a separate COVAX initiative to help poorer countries access a vaccine.
Johnson will also announce 340 million pounds ($433.23 million) in funding for the WHO spread across four years - a 30% increase on the previous four-year commitment - with around a third of the money dependent on reform to the organisation.
Britain, along with France and Germany, is expressing support for the WHO, albeit tied to reforms, when the body faces criticism over its pandemic response.

The United States gave a year's notice in July that it is leaving the U.N. agency - which was created to improve health globally - after Trump accused it of being too close to China and having mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a widely-circulated video Francisco Larranaga, the husband of victim Juliana Giraldo, cries while requesting assistance following her death in the Andean country's Cauca province on Thursday.
""The army just killed my wife,"" Larranaga sobs in the video, adding Giraldo was shot.
The killing was condemned by President Ivan Duque and Minister of Defense Carlos Holmes Trujillo.
""I condemn this reprehensible act,"" Duque said in a message on Twitter, adding he ordered the army and defense ministry to conduct a prompt investigation, while calling for the person responsible to be held accountable.
General Marco Mayorga, commander of the army's third division, gave an interview to local media Caracol Radio on Friday, describing the army's version of events. He said a soldier reported shooting at the vehicle's tires as it reversed near the checkpoint, thinking it was preparing to drive into it.
""The soldier said he shot at the tires to stop the vehicle,"" Mayorga said. ""It seems to me a bullet fell to the pavement and changed course...unfortunately hitting Juliana."" 
Colombia's transgender community often face discrimination and many accuse the police of perpetuating violence against trans people.
""Juliana Giraldo Diaz didn't die, she was killed. They murdered her in cold blood,"" Red Comunitaria Trans, a Colombian trans rights group, said on Twitter. 
With her death the number of trans people killed in Colombia this year rose to 28, the group added.
Last week, Colombia's human rights ombudsman said violence against members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community had increased during the first eight months of the year, when at least 63 people - including 17 transgender woman - were killed. 
Earlier this month, the president called for investigations into police after 13 civilians were killed in protests. Colombia's police, like the army, are controlled by the defense ministry.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peru's Navy on Friday was carefully watching a fleet of around 250 Chinese fishing vessels that had sailed just outside the Andean country's waters, angering the domestic fishing industry and sparking a Twitter war between Washington and Beijing.
The fleet, previously fishing for giant squid near the Galapagos (NASDAQ:GLPG) Islands off Ecuador, was detected this week by Peruvian naval forces some 230 miles (370.15 km) off the coast of the country, the local maritime authority reported.
""Our Navy is making overflights ensuring there are no such vessels within the scope of our jurisdiction, which is 200 miles,"" Defense Minister Jorge Chávez told reporters on Friday.
The commander of the Coast Guard operations, Rear Admiral Jorge Portocarrero, told Reuters the fleet was identified and located after a low-altitude flight of an exploration aircraft and a patrol vessel between Sunday and Wednesday.
""Not all are in a single place, they are scattered,"" he said, adding there were 250-270 ships. ""We have no evidence of them having entered our maritime space.""
The United States embassy in Lima said the Chinese vessels had a history of avoiding tracking and seemed to ""be dumping plastic"" pollutants.
""Over fishing can cause enormous ecological and economic damage. Peru cannot afford such a loss,"" the U.S. embassy said on Twitter this week.
The Chinese embassy responded that it attached great importance to protecting the environment and the ocean. ""We hope that the Peruvian public is not deceived by false information,"" it said on Twitter.
'FRIEND AND PARTNER'
Peru's Foreign Ministry sought to defuse the tension, saying it had expressed discomfort to U.S. officials about the ""inaccuracy"" of the U.S. embassy's tweets. Peru is the world's second largest producer of copper, much of which is bought by China.
Vice Minister Talavera said he had told U.S officials that Peru ""is a friend and partner"" of both the United States and China and called on them to resolve their differences through dialogue, understanding and cooperation.
Local fishing associations said indiscriminate fishing of giant squid hurt the domestic industry. Squid accounts for 43% of Peru's fishery exports.
""It's an open secret that every year vessels mainly from China... are installed just at the edge of 200 miles off Peru to extract this resource,"" Cayetana Aljovín, president of the National Society on Fishing, said on Friday.
""By extracting an unregulated resource in those waters, it could negatively impact the Peruvian ecosystem.""
Peru's government approved a law in August requiring local and foreign boats operating off its coast to use GPS and SISESAT equipment, a satellite tracking system for vessels.
Portoccarero stated the fleet of Chinese ships has been present in the Pacific Ocean for years, ranging from the north of Chile, Peru's coast and close to the Galapagos Islands, depending on the migration patterns of the squid.
He added that in 2004, three Chinese-flagged ships were captured within Peruvian maritime territory, after an operation with a navy submarine and helicopter, though added this sort of fleet was found in places around the world.
""We have a large one in front of Argentina, another in the north of Brazil, there are several surrounding Australia, New Zealand, East Africa, and in the Indian Ocean. It is a global issue,"" he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed told the United Nations on Friday that his country has ""no intention"" of harming Sudan and Egypt with a giant hydropower dam on the Blue Nile that has caused a bitter water dispute between the three countries.
Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan failed to strike a deal on the operation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam before Ethiopia began filling the reservoir behind the dam in July. But the three states have returned to African Union-led mediation.
""I want to make it abundantly clear that we have no intention to harm these countries,"" he told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly in a video statement, pre-recorded due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
""We are steadfast in our commitment to addressing the concerns of downstream countries and reaching a mutually beneficial outcome in the context of the ongoing AU-led process,"" Nobel Peace Laureate Abiy said. 
Negotiations have previously faltered over a demand from Egypt and Sudan that any deal should be legally binding, over the mechanism for resolving future disputes, and over how to manage the dam during periods of reduced rainfall or drought.
Egypt says it is dependent on the Nile for more than 90% of its scarce fresh water supplies, and fears the dam could have a devastating effect on its economy.
Abiy told the United Nations that the project contributes to the conservation of water resources, ""which would otherwise have been lost to evaporation in downstream countries.""
""What we are essentially doing is to meet our electricity demands from one of the cleanest sources of energy. We cannot afford to continue keeping more than 65 million of our people in the dark,"" he said. 
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi expressed his concern about the project when he addressed the United Nations on Tuesday. 
""The Nile River must not be monopolized by one state. For Egypt the Nile water is an existential matter. This, however, does not mean that we want to undermine the rights of our brothers and sisters, sharing with us the Nile basin,"" he said.

""Nevertheless, it is unacceptable for the negotiations to continue forever in an attempt to impose the realities on the ground,"" Sisi said.

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 04:53PM ET</span>",Lawyer for Breonna Taylor's family calls for release of Kentucky grand jury evidence,"By Carlos Barria and Bryan Woolston
LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - A civil rights lawyer representing Breonna Taylor's family on Friday demanded Kentucky's state attorney general release the evidence presented to a grand jury that decided against charging police officers with homicide in her death during a botched raid.
""Release the transcripts!"" Ben Crump said, leading Taylor's relatives and others in a chant outside the grand jury building and questioning whether Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron presented the grand jury with enough evidence against the white officers.
""There seems to be two justice systems in America. One for Black America and one for white America,"" Crump said.
Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has also called on Cameron to make evidence in the case public. 
In the U.S. justice system, prosecutors present findings in secret to a panel known as a grand jury that must decide if the evidence is sufficient to charge a suspect. Since there are no presentations by attorneys for the suspect, the system gives prosecutors wide leeway in guiding the grand jury's decisions.
Protests erupted in Louisville and other American cities following Wednesday's announcement that the grand jury would not bring homicide charges against police officers involved in the fatal March 13 shooting of Taylor, who was Black, in her home during the execution of a search warrant.
Instead, one officer was charged with wanton endangerment for stray bullets that struck a neighboring apartment.
At a news conference on Friday, Interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said he expected the crowds of protesters to grow over the weekend, and expressed concern about reports that several militia groups were planning to come to the city.
""Many of them say they are coming to help us. Let me be clear: That is not help we need, that is not help we want, and it does not help the situation,"" Schroeder said. 
Taylor's slaying initially drew little national attention. But it was thrust into prominence after George Floyd, a Black man arrested for a non-violent offense in Minneapolis, died under the knee of a white police officer on May 25, igniting a summer of protests against racial injustice and excessive police force.
Taylor, 26, an emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse, was struck by six bullets moments after she and her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, were roused from bed in the commotion of the raid.
Walker fired one shot, wounding a police officer, saying he did not hear police identify themselves. Three officers responded by firing 32 rounds.
'I AM ANGRY'
""I am angry. ... The system as a whole has failed her,"" Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said in a statement read aloud by her sister. 
""You robbed the world of a queen,"" the statement said.
Crump, who has represented several families in high-profile cases of police killings, helped Taylor's family win a $12 million settlement from the city of Louisville in a wrongful death lawsuit.
He questioned whether Cameron, a Black Republican who was praised by U.S. President Donald Trump for his handling of the case, was attempting to protect the police.
""Did he (Cameron) present any evidence on Breonna Taylor's behalf or did he ... try to justify the killing of Breonna Taylor by these police officers?"" Crump asked.
Cameron has declined to release the grand jury evidence, in part because a separate federal investigation was ongoing. 
Cameron's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday about Crump's remarks. But on Thursday, Cameron's spokeswoman, Elizabeth Kuhn, said: ""Releasing that information now would compromise the federal investigation and violate a prosecutor's ethical duties."" 
In the second night of Louisville protests following the decision, Thursday night and Friday morning were relatively calm after two police officers were shot and wounded on Wednesday. The officers were recovering.
Police said on Friday they had arrested 24 protesters including state Representative Attica Scott, the only Black woman in the Kentucky legislature. She is also a sponsor of the proposed ""Breonna's Law,"" which would end ""no-knock"" warrants and require police to wear body cameras while warrants are served. The bill is due to come up in the 2021 session.
Police also arrested Scott's daughter, Ashanti Scott, and Shameka Parrish-Wright, a prominent activist. The three were charged with felony first-degree rioting and the misdemeanors of failure to disperse and unlawful assembly.
They were released Friday morning after spending the night in jail, said Ted Shouse, an attorney for Parrish-Wright. They were arrested together when somebody nearby broke the window of a library and threw a flare into the building, but neither Parrish-Wright nor the Scotts were involved, Shouse said.
Attica Scott said the charges against her and her daughter were ""ridiculous"" and that she was detained before the curfew went into effect at 9 p.m.
Larynzo Johnson, 26, the suspect in the shooting of the two police officers on Wednesday night, pleaded not guilty on Friday to two counts of assault and multiple counts of wanton endangerment, according to Josh Abner, a spokesman for the Jefferson County attorney's office.

Bail was set at $1 million and he was assigned a public defender, according to a court filing.

""For the sake of those countries from which these people are escaping war today, they need to be as close to their borders as possible in order to have the greatest possible enthusiasm and motivation to come back and rebuild them,"" President Andrzej Duda told public broadcaster TVP Info. 
He criticized proposals for the EU to distribute migrants among member countries, saying that Poland opposed being forced to receive migrants and migrants having no choice in their destination. 
""No dictate of the European Union, I believe, should ever force us to do so. We should never agree with that,"" he said.
The plan would legally oblige all member states to host their share of refugees, in exchange for funding from the EU budget. It also aims to step up returns of illegal migrants and support foreign states in stemming migration before people reach Europe.

On Thursday, after a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said the plan was unacceptable to the Visegrad Four (V4) group, which also includes Slovakia.

(Reuters) - Oregon Governor Kate Brown on Friday declared a state of emergency in Portland over the weekend due to risks of violence as thousands of members of what she called ""white supremacist groups"" such as the Proud Boys hold a rally.
Leaders of the self-described ""Western chauvinist"" Proud Boys called Saturday's rally to ""end domestic terrorism"" after four months of near daily demonstrations against police violence and racism in Oregon's largest city that have often ended in violence. 
Many out-of-state demonstrators, some armed, were expected to attend the Proud Boys event in a park about six miles (9.7 km) north of downtown, state officials said, with organizers expecting a crowd of up to 20,000, according to local television station KGW8.
Police hope to keep right-wing groups apart from left-wing counter protesters set to gather in another park about 2 miles away.
""I am incredibly concerned about the increased risk of violence in Portland this weekend,"" Brown told reporters.
Under her emergency declaration, state troopers and the Multnomah County Sheriff's Office will lead a law enforcement taskforce authorized to use ""proportional force"" including tear gas to keep the peace, said Oregon State Police Superintendent Travis Hampton.
Proud Boys chairman Enrique Tarrio said his group did not intend to cause violence.
""We will be peaceful unless provoked. I encourage people to protest us,"" Tarrio wrote on Twitter on Thursday. ""What we won't condone or tolerate is violence towards attendees."" 
The men-only Proud Boys group describes itself as a fraternal organization that is ""anti-racism"" and ""anti-political correctness."" 
Civil rights group The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) classifies the Proud Boys as a hate group, citing its members' anti-Muslim and misogynist rhetoric.
""Saturday's rally is the latest in a long series of sustained provocations that the Proud Boys have held in Portland,"" SPLC research analyst Cassie Miller said in a statement on Friday. 
President Donald Trump, who has made law and order a principal theme of his bid for re-election on Nov. 3, has singled out Portland as one of several Democratic-led cities he calls ""anarchist jurisdictions."" 
His Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, says Trump's rhetoric is stoking the violence.

PARIS (Reuters) - A man armed with a meat cleaver attacked and wounded two people on Friday who had stepped out for a cigarette in front of the Paris office building where Islamist militants gunned down employees of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo five years ago.
Police soon after detained the man suspected of carrying out the attack, with bloodstains on his clothes, next to the steps of an opera house about 500 metres (yards) away.
The suspected attacker was from Pakistan, and had arrived in France three years ago as an unaccompanied minor, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. 
""We are still in a war against Islamist terrorism,"" Darmanin said in a Twitter post. 
He said he had ordered law enforcement agents to beef up protection at all sites where Islamist attacks had taken place in the past, and at synagogues, where the city's Jewish community this weekend mark the Yom Kippur holiday. 
Nathan Messas, a doctor who lives near the scene of Friday's attack, said it brought back memories of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. ""Once again, hatred, gratuitous hatred. I was here five years ago. Five years later, we're here again. I don't know when this is going to end,"" Messas said.
The victims of Friday's attack were taken to hospital but their lives were not in danger, officials said. 
The attack coincided with the start this month of the trial of 14 alleged accomplices in the 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack. The gunmen behind that attack killed 12 people.
Investigators said the militants at that time wanted to avenge the publication of cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad in the magazine. Charlie Hebdo republished the cartoons on the eve of the trial this month.
The main suspect in Friday's attack is 18 years old, a police source said. The interior minister said he was not on a security services watchlist. He was detained a month ago for carrying a weapon - a screwdriver - and was released with a warning, said the minister. 
A second suspect was detained moments after the attack and prosecutors were trying to establish his relation to the knife attacker. The second man is Algerian, according to the police source.
Later on Friday, a further five people were detained after police searched a property in a northeastern suburb of Paris linked to the main suspect, a judicial source told Reuters.
CIGARETTE BREAK
Charlie Hebdo vacated its offices after the 2015 attack and is now in a secret location. The building is now used by a television production company.
Two of the production company's staff, a man and a woman, were in the street having a cigarette break when they were attacked, according to prosecutors and a colleague of the victims.
A local resident, who gave his name as Albert, told Reuters he heard a long, deathly shout from ""a person who was screaming and screaming"".
In the immediate aftermath, a neighbour said she saw blood on the ground and people pulling a wounded woman away into the office building.
She said workers repairing the road told her ""a dark-skinned man randomly hit a lady with a big butcher's knife"" in front of a mural that serves as a memorial to victims of the 2015 attack.
Paul Moreira, a journalist from the Premieres Lignes media production company, told French broadcaster BFM TV it was his colleagues who were attacked.
""It's somebody who was in the road with a meat cleaver who attacked them in front of our offices. It was chilling.""
France has experienced a wave of attacks by Islamist militants in recent years and Friday's stabbing demonstrated the long shadow cast over the country by the Charlie Hebdo shootings.
Bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theatre and sites around Paris killed 130 people, and in July 2016 an Islamist militant drove a truck through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in Nice, killing 86.
Al-Qaeda, the militant Islamist group that claimed responsibility for the 2015 attack, threatened to attack Charlie Hebdo again after it republished the cartoons this month.
Police moved Charlie Hebdo's head of human resources from her home this week after threats against her life. 

The staff of the magazine issued a statement expressing their support for the victims of Friday's attack. ""Far from terrorising us, such events should make us even more assertive in the defence of our values,"" the statement said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it would provide more than $720 million in humanitarian assistance in response to the crisis in Syria, plus nearly $152 million for Africa's Sahel region and almost $108 million for South Sudan. 
Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun made the announcement on Syria at an event on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. He said the money would go ""both for Syrians inside the country and for those in desperate need across the region.""
At the same event, acting USAID Administrator John Barsa announced nearly $108 million for the humanitarian crisis in South Sudan. 
Barsa also said Washington would provide nearly $152 million in new humanitarian assistance for Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and Mauritania to help them cope with population displacements and food insecurity because of conflict in the Sahel region. 
Biegun said the additional funds for Syria would bring total U.S. support since the start of the crisis there to more than $12 billion.
A crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Iran and Russia backing the government and the United States supporting the opposition. Millions have fled Syria and millions more have been internally displaced.
In July, the United States imposed new sanctions aimed at cutting off funds to Assad.
Syrian authorities blame Western sanctions for civilian hardship in the country, where a collapse of the currency has led to soaring prices and people struggling to afford food and basic supplies.
Washington says its sanctions are not intended to harm the people and do not target humanitarian assistance.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said heavy rains, fighting between armed groups, food insecurity, a deteriorating economic situation and the COVID-19 pandemic had compounded an already dire humanitarian crisis in South Sudan.
He said the funds for South Sudan would go to help South Sudanese in the country and in neighboring states. 

In 2018, South Sudan formally ended five years of civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people, caused a famine and created a massive refugee crisis, but efforts to conclude a peace process have stalled.

(Reuters) - A British police officer was shot dead in the early hours of Friday by a man who was being held at a custody centre in south London.
Police said the incident occurred at about 2:15 a.m. while the man was being detained at the Croydon Custody Centre, where arrested suspects are processed. The unnamed officer was treated at the scene for injuries but died in hospital.
The 23-year-old suspect is thought to have then turned the gun on himself. He was taken to hospital with a gunshot wound and is in a critical condition. Officers did not open fire.
""A murder investigation is under way and officers are working at several crime scenes to secure evidence and to establish the facts of what happened,"" said London police chief Cressida Dick, who described the incident as ""truly shocking"".
""Early indications are that the suspect shot himself. This has not yet, of course, been established as a fact."" 
The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) which later said the suspect had been arrested for possession of drugs and ammunition.
""The man was handcuffed to the rear before being transported to Croydon Custody Suite in a police vehicle where he was escorted into the building,"" it added in a statement.
The handcuffs remained in place while officers prepared to search him using a metal detector, the IOPC said. At that point, shots were fired.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""My deepest condolences go to the family, friends and colleagues of the police officer who was killed in Croydon last night. We owe a huge debt to those who risk their own lives to keep us safe.""

The killing of an officer is a rare event in Britain where the vast majority of police remain routinely unarmed. The BBC said only 16 other London police officers had been killed by a firearm since World War Two.

Abbas urged Guterres to work with the Middle East Quartet of mediators - the United States, Russia, the European Union and the U.N. - and the U.N. Security Council on a conference ""with full authority and with the participation of all concerned parties, early next year, to engage in a genuine peace process.""
The Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip with east Jerusalem as its capital, all territory captured by Israel in 1967. Palestinian leaders rejected a peace proposal unveiled in January by U.S. President Donald Trump, in which Washington would recognize Jewish settlements in occupied territory as part of Israel.
""There will be no peace, no security, no stability and no coexistence in our region while this occupation continues and a just, comprehensive solution to the question of Palestine, the core of the conflict, remains denied,"" Abbas told the 193-member U.N. General Assembly in a video pre-recorded due to COVID-19.
He said the Palestinians remained committed to the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, drawn up by Saudi Arabia, in which Arab nations offered to normalize ties with Israel in return for a statehood deal with the Palestinians and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in 1967.
The United Arab Emirates and Bahrain signed agreements last week to establish ties with Israel, becoming the first Arab states in a quarter century to break a longstanding taboo. The Palestinians denounced the move. 
Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz, in his debut speech to the United Nations on Wednesday, said the Arab Peace Initiative is the basis for a ""comprehensive and just solution,"" but also said he supported U.S. peace efforts. He stopped short of endorsing the recent U.S.-brokered agreements. 
Saudi Arabia has quietly acquiesced to the deals but has signaled it is not ready to take similar action.
Abbas also said the Palestinians were ""preparing ourselves to hold parliamentary elections, followed by presidential elections"" and that all factions and parties would take part.

However he set no date, and there are numerous obstacles. Abbas's Fatah faction is dominant in the West Bank, but its Islamist rival Hamas controls Gaza, and East Jerusalem was captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed, in a move that has not won international recognition. Israel regards all of Jerusalem as its capital.

In the pouring rain, protest organiser Junya Limprasert from Act4Dem read out a letter to the king calling for more democracy and said the Thai people did not want a king who spends most of the year in Germany.
""We want the king to give up the throne, we want the king to stop harassing the Thai people,"" she said outside the villa in Tutzing on Lake Starnberg, a popular playground for millionaires an hour's drive southwest of Munich.
The Thai embassy in Berlin could not be reached for comment. The Royal Palace made no comment and has made no comment on the protests in Thailand.
Protesters challenging Thailand's palace and army-dominated establishment broke a long-standing taboo by demanding reform of the monarchy in August and the call was taken up last weekend by tens of thousands of people at a demonstration in Bangkok.
The hashtag #RepublicofThailand trended in Thailand on Friday after parliament delayed addressing protesters' demand for constitutional change.
According to the Thai constitution, the monarchy must be held ""in a position of revered worship"".
The symbolic plaque planted in a flower pot in front of the Tutzing villa resembled one protesters cemented near the Grand Palace in Bangkok last weekend and which proclaims Thailand belongs to the people and not the monarch. Thai police swiftly removed that plaque.
Vajiralongkorn, 68, has been Thailand's king since 2016, but spends much of his time in Bavaria, where his 15-year-old son is at school. The king's lifestyle has been fodder for German tabloids, which have published pictures of him wearing a crop top when he was Crown Prince.
Details of the king's life in Germany are not carried in mainstream media in Thailand, where lese majeste laws set a jail sentence of up to 15 years for anyone insulting the monarchy.
Thai protesters have complained about the cost of the king's stays in Europe as well as his absence from the kingdom. 

The protesters in Thailand seek to reduce the king's powers under the constitution and also to remove his direct control of a royal fortune valued in tens of billions of dollars and some units of the army.

NEW DELHI/SEOUL (Reuters) - India is unlikely to revoke a ban on PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) following PUBG Corp's decision to withdraw the mobile game's publishing rights in the country from China's Tencent (HK:0700), a senior government official said on Friday.
PUBG, a popular online multiplayer battle game, was among 118 Chinese-origin mobile applications banned by New Delhi earlier this month.
That led PUBG Corp, the unit of a South Korean firm behind the game, to announce it would no longer give Tencent Games the rights to publish the game in India. It also said it was exploring ways to provide gaming experiences to Indian users in future.
The new ownership structure is, however, unlikely to change things immediately, said the source, declining to be named as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
""The violent nature of the game has been the cause of many complaints from all quarters,"" the source said. ""That does not change with the change in ownership rights.""
A spokeswoman for PUBG Corp in South Korea said the company was closely reviewing India's concerns and that it was ready to work on anything that needed improvement.
The company has also been in talks with Jio Platforms, the digital unit of Indian conglomerate  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI), to bring the game back in its biggest market by users.
""We had initial talks with Jio Platforms to seek for cooperation opportunities, but nothing has been decided yet,"" the PUBG spokeswoman told Reuters.
Reliance did not respond to a request for comment.

While officially New Delhi says it has banned the apps because they collect user data and pose a threat to national security, the move is widely seen as a way to pressure Chinese tech companies following a months-long standoff between India and China along a disputed Himalayan border.

PARIS (Reuters) - The stabbing of two people in Paris's rue Nicolas-Appert on Friday brought violence back to the street where, five years ago, Islamist militants killed 12 people in the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.
Two journalists were wounded in Friday's attack in what Prime Minister Jean Castex said was a symbolic place, outside Charlie Hebdo's former offices. 
Bullet-holes in railings along the short street lined with apartments and offices bear the scars of the earlier attack, in which the assailants stormed Charlie Hebdo's offices on Jan. 7, 2015.
A mural on the street shows the faces of the 11 Charlie Hebdo employees who were killed that day. The 12th victim was a police officer, shot dead near where one of two suspects in Friday's attack was arrested.
""I feel like I'm reliving past horrors,"" said a resident of a neighbouring street. ""It's a never-ending nightmare."" 
Dr Nathan Messas, who lives opposite Charlie Hebdo's former offices, saw police leading away a man in handcuffs.
""Once again, hatred, gratuitous hatred,"" he said. ""I don't know when this is going to end.""
Charlie Hebdo moved to a secret bunker after the 2015 attack. A journalist there said the magazine's employees were safe and that their security detail had not been bolstered.
The stabbings coincide with the start of a trial this month of 14 alleged accomplices in the 2015 attack. 
Charlie Hebdo marked the trial's start by reprinting the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad which incensed the Muslim world when most of them were first published by a Danish newspaper in 2005 and then by Charlie Hebdo a year later. 
France has paid tribute to those slain in the years since the attack. This year, on the fifth anniversary, staff who survived stood on the street outside the magazine's former offices as a bugler played the Last Post.

""We will never lie down,"" editor Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau wrote in Charlie Hebdo when it reprinted the cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad this month. ""We will never give up.""

In the incident, one of the worst tragedies of the war that pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed Salvadoran army, soldiers executed unarmed villagers of El Mozote and surrounding hamlets in eastern El Salvador as they searched for guerrillas, according to a U.N. report.
""Most of the files... as any Salvadoran would imagine, were destroyed in these forty years. When? We don't know, it could be that they were destroyed immediately after the massacre,"" Bukele told a news conference on Thursday evening.
He added that he declassified the few existing files on the massacre and that they would be handed over to a judge and prosecutors.
Sixteen military officials were put trial in the matter in 2016, after El Salvador overturned a controversial amnesty law and allowed the case to be re-opened.
For years, El Salvador's government denied having perpetrated the El Mozote slaughter. But in 2012 the government of then-President Mauricio Funes acknowledged the state's role and apologized to the families of the victims.
The Central American nation's civil war stretched from 1980 to 1992, leaving 75,000 dead and 8,000 missing.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In the grasslands and mountainous terrain of Argentina's Cordoba province, dry weather and strong winds are fanning blazes that are on track to outpace previous years as firefighters battle to bring the flames under control.
The fires so far this year have scorched at least 48,000 hectares in the central province, according to the national fire management service, causing damage to property and almost engulfing a space observation center.
Dramatic drone footage earlier in the week showed fires advancing across forests and dry brush of the region, with thick plumes of smoke rising in their wake. Firefighters have used helicopters and airplanes to drop water to contain the blazes.
In some areas, the fires came under control in recent days, aided by rains. The fires, however, were still on track to spread further in some zones, said Juan Pablo Arganaraz, a biologist in Cordoba who has been tracking the progress. 
""There is typically around 53,000 hectares (burned) per year,"" Arganaraz said of the areas of Cordoba he previously studied. ""Now, among those that occurred in the month of August, we would be close to 90,000 hectares, so more than the average."" 
Provincial justice officials were investigating the cause of the fires amid suspicion that they were set by ranchers clearing pastures to make way for new growth, a common practice in Argentina. The dry weather enabled the fires to spread faster.
The Cordoba fires coincide with wetland fires in Argentina's Parana delta region, another area of concern for scientists due to its carbon-rich soil, while huge fires are engulfing wetland areas of Brazil.
Cordoba officials have moved to close transit routes to contain the flames and bring in fire-fighting equipment. Some homes had been lost in July-August, though officials said they had prevented further damage more recently. 

""We're moving heavy equipment that we have working here at Las Jarillas where we had to protect many residences. Luckily no homes have been burned; some locals have been evacuated,"" said Diego Concha, director of Cordoba's civil defense department.

Shamsia Alizada, 18, came first out of more than 170,000 students, the education ministry said, prompting congratulations from former President Hamid Karzai and foreign envoys including the U.S Charge D'affaires.
The celebration come at a particularly sensitive time in Afghanistan as the government holds peace talks with the Taliban Islamist militant group which barred girls from schools when it ruled between 1997 and 2001.
But Alizada said she would not let politics get in the way of her studies. ""I have some fears about the Taliban's comeback ... but I don't want to lose my hope, because my dreams are bigger than my fear.""
She said her father, who works in a mine in the north, had moved the family to Kabul to make sure she got an education.
""It is my sense of responsibility towards my family that brought me to this position. It is my dream now to study medicine and serve my people,"" she told Reuters by phone from her home.
The Taliban say they have changed and will let girls be educated, though many fear that women's rights will deteriorate if the group regains influence.
Around 2.2 million girls are still out of school and fewer than 30% of women in Afghanistan are literate, according to U.N. agencies.

(Reuters) - Kyle Rittenhouse, the teenager charged with killing two protesters and injuring another during demonstrations about race and justice in Kenosha, Wisconsin, will fight his requested extradition from Illinois, his lawyer told a court hearing on Friday.
Rittenhouse, 17, has been charged by Kenosha County's district attorney with six crimes for shooting three people who tried to subdue or disarm him during protests on Aug. 25, killing 36-year-old Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, 26.
Rittenhouse participated in the hearing at the Lake County Circuit Court in Illinois via video link from the detention facility where he is being held. He was wearing a black sweatshirt and a gray mask covered his face. 
""Good morning, your honor,"" he addressed the judge in his only remarks in the hearing, which lasted just a few minutes.
John Pierce, one of Rittenhouse's lawyers, said he planned to fight the request by Kenosha prosecutors that he be transferred to Wisconsin to face the charges. 
""We intend to challenge extradition by writ of habeas corpus,"" Pierce said. ""And so we would ask that the procedures be put in place whereby extradition documents are in fact sent from Wisconsin so we can review them.""
The teenager had traveled to Kenosha on Aug. 25 from his home in nearby Antioch, Illinois, in a self-appointed role to protect the streets of Kenosha where the police shooting of Jacob Blake had sparked unrest during protests against police brutality and racism.
Rittenhouse's legal team have said that he feared for his life when he fired his semi-automatic rifle and was acting in self-defense. Cellphone videos from the night show chaotic scenes, including one where Rittenhouse is chased and falls down before his encounter with Huber and another man, Gaige Grosskreutz.
Huber appeared to hit Rittenhouse in the shoulder with a skateboard and tried to grab his rifle before being shot, according to the criminal complaint. Rittenhouse then pointed the rifle at Grosskreutz, who had a hand gun. Grosskreutz was shot but survived.
Rittenhouse's lawyers have also sought to portray the case as a referendum on the right to bear arms following a summer of sometimes violent protests in major U.S. cities.

""A 17-year-old American citizen is being sacrificed by politicians, but it's not Kyle Rittenhouse they are after,"" the narrator says in a video released this week by a group tied to his legal team. ""Their end game is to strip away the constitutional right of all citizens to defend our communities.""

The United States on Thursday blacklisted several Iranian officials and entities over rights breaches, including slapping sanctions on a judge it said was involved in the case of an Iranian wrestler sentenced to death.
The move was criticised by Abbas Ali Kadkhodaei, spokesman for the Guardian Council, which vets legislation passed by parliament for compliance with the constitution.
""Would the Iranian judiciary be able to impose similar sanctions on the killers of blacks in that country who torture them upon arrest and kill them without trial?"" he tweeted in Farsi.
He was referring to the May 25 killing of George Floyd in the American city of Minneapolis after a white officer detaining him knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes with fellow officers beside him.
Those sanctioned on Thursday include Iranian Judge Seyyed Mahmoud Sadati, who reportedly oversaw the trial of wrestler Navid Afkari, executed this month for the fatal stabbing of a security guard during anti-government protests in 2018. 
Another judge, Mohammad Soltani, was also slapped with sanctions that include asset freezes and banning Americans from doing business with the targets. 
Earlier this week, Washington imposed sanctions on Iran's defence ministry and others involved in its nuclear and weapons program to support the U.S. assertion that all U.N. sanctions against Tehran are now restored.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have soared since U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's decision to leave the European Union was a brave one that demonstrated the country's ""greatness"" but it is not a path that Hungary will follow, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday.
Orban told Reuters in an interview in Brussels that the EU only had itself to blame for the British referendum vote in 2016 to leave the bloc because of the way it had treated the country. The vote for leave had safeguarded the ""the good reputation"" of the British people, he said.
""Brexit is a brave decision of the British people about their own lives...we consider it as evidence of the greatness of the British,"" he said.
Britain left the EU at the end of January, and it has been in difficult negotiations since then to agree on a new trade relationship with the 27-nation bloc that will kick in when a standstill transition ends on Dec. 31.
Orban said Hungary was not an island and was too closely economically integrated with the EU to follow Britain out. 
""We can't afford to follow that track,"" he said. ""It's reasonable for Hungary to be part of the European Union.""
He said there was a high level of support for the EU in Hungary despite the country's many disputes with other member states over issues such as migration and the rule of law.
Orban said one mistake the EU made was to press on with the appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the European Commission from 2014 in the face of opposition from Britain, which was backed by Hungary.
""I think Brexit was mainly a mistake of the European Union,"" Orban said. 

""We made mistakes, terrible mistakes,"" he said, stressing the point that the EU was not embodied by its central institutions in Brussels but rather a club of sovereign member states whose wishes could only be ignored with the gravest of consequences, like Brexit.

The country has reported 243.8 cases per 100,000 people in the past 14 days, the fastest pace in Europe except for in Spain, according to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
The ""R"" number showing how many people are likely to get infected by one person with the virus has dipped to roughly 1.4 from around 1.6 last week but still indicates exponential growth, Prymula said.
""With the current measures, we can cut (""R"") towards 1.2, but we need it below 1. Therefore there will be measures, which won't harm the economy, but they will affect gatherings,"" he said at a televised press conference.
""We want to pursue a strategy of a faster, shorter-term impact.""
He refused to detail the possible measures, saying they first needed to be discussed with other ministers and affected parties. 
The government is focusing on preventing a rise in the number of hospitalisations that would overburden the health system.
Prymula said capacity currently set aside for severely ill COVID-19 patients requiring ventilation was quite full in Prague, but there was a reserve of intensive care beds that could be used for patients with the virus.
The total number of people hospitalised has jumped to 740, he said, from 172 at the start of the month. 
Restrictions currently in place include an audience cap of 2,000 seated people for outdoor events, and 1,000 seated at indoor venues. Stand-up events are limited to 50 and 10 people respectively. 
Bars and pubs have to close by 10:00 p.m., some universities have shifted their courses online and face masks are mandatory on transport and indoors. 

Prymula said he expected the current wave could be brought down to acceptable numbers in about two months but there would be fluctuations until around mid-2021.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Friday he was convinced that Donald Trump will win another term in November's U.S. presidential election and has made no plans for any other outcome.
""The only reason why I'm sitting here after spending more than 30 years in politics is that I always believe in my plan A,"" the nationalist leader told Reuters in an interview in Brussels when asked about the looming U.S. vote.
""We have an exceptionally good relationship with Trump. Probably the level of openness and kindness and helping each other will be lower (if Democrat challenger Joe Biden wins the U.S. election). But my calculation is OK. He (Trump) will win.""
Orban this week endorsed Trump's re-election bid, saying his rival Democrats had forced a ""moral imperialism"" on the world that illiberal leaders like himself reject. (LINK)
Orban is a nationalist leader regularly at loggerheads with the EU over his anti-immigration campaigns and moves to put the judiciary, NGOs, media and academics under more state control. 
He clashed with the administration of then-U.S. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, over what critics said was an erosion of democratic values by his government.
Asked what the impact of a Trump victory would be for the EU, Orban said for those who view the bloc as built around its institutions it would be a blow.
""If you understand the European Union as a centralised power the spirit and heart of which is provided by the institutions - Trump is not the best option,"" he said. 
""But if you believe that the European Union is nothing else but just a community of member states - Trump is OK, is by far the best.""
He said that if Trump does win the election, the EU will need to normalise its trade relationship with the United States and also establish clarity about the long-term presence of U.S. troops on European soil. 
""The European Union has a huge trade surplus with the United States. The (U.S.) President always raises the point that he'd like to decrease it by changing regulations. Customs, basically. It's in the air, it's not fixed.""
He welcomed Poland's proposal to host U.S. troops that are being withdrawn from Germany, but said this would not be necessary for Hungary because it is not facing a direct threat from Russia.
Orban said Hungary would get to the NATO requirement - strongly backed by Trump - of spending 2% of GDP on defence. Asked how long that would take, he said: ""Not more than five years.""

Orban faces a challenge to his decade-long rule in parliamentary elections due in early 2022 as Hungary braces for the economic and social impact of a new rise in coronavirus infections.

The Kosovo Specialist Chambers in The Hague, mandated to investigate and prosecute suspects in war crimes committed during Kosovo's 1998-99 guerrilla uprising against Serbian rule, declined to comment on the reported arrest.
Witnesses said Hysni Gucati, head of Kosovo's War Veterans Association, was handcuffed and bundled into an EU police car by masked officers in the tiny Balkan country's capital Pristina. 
In recent weeks Gucati and his aides had published dozens of court documents with the names of suspects, witnesses and civilians allegedly murdered during the uprising, which eventually won Kosovo independence in 2008. 
""He was never interviewed on war crimes charges and, based on the documents we saw, he may have been arrested on obstruction of justice charges,"" Tome Gashi, lawyer for the War Veterans' Association, told Reuters.
Earlier this week the tribunal prosecutor’s office condemned the veterans association's release of the case documents as an attempt to ""undermine the proper administration of justice"".
It said it was committed to ""vigorously investigating and prosecuting"" people who sought to expose potential witnesses. 
The Specialist Chamber was set up in The Hague in 2015 to handle cases of alleged atrocities by Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas during the uprising. 
Kosovo-based investigations have been foiled by widespread intimidation in a country where clan loyalties run deep and former rebels are lionised. The tribunal was set up in the Netherlands partly to help ensure protection of witnesses.
EU police in Kosovo are empowered to make arrests related to war crimes charges if requested by the Hague-based court.

In June, the chamber’s prosecutor charged Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, the former guerrilla commander, with war crimes and crimes against humanity including nearly 100 murders. A judge has yet to confirm the indictment, a step required for a trial. Thaci denies wrongdoing and remains in Kosovo.

1594,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 10:16AM ET</span>",Hungarian PM Orban against new EU migration pact over hosting asylum seekers,"By Gabriela Baczynska and John Chalmers
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban on Friday rejected a new migration plan by the European Union's executive, saying it would force Hungary to welcome aslyum seekers, but he welcomed some other elements of the proposal. 
Speaking in a Reuters interview a day after discussing migration in Brussels with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Orban said the devil was in the detail of the proposal over how to handle arrivals in the bloc, an issue that has long divided the EU.
""There are some goods news and there are some problems that are still not solved,"" he said, speaking in an elegant, art-deco hotel in Brussels, where the EU's executive arm on Wednesday presented what it dubbed a ""balanced"" blueprint on migration.
""Some taboos have disappeared,"" Orban said, in welcoming the strengthened focus on sending back to their countries of origin those who do not qualify for asylum in the EU.
But he said asylum applications should be managed in ""hotspots"" outside of EU borders, something seen as all-but-impossible to do for legal and practical reasons, and that those who come to Europe's borders would otherwise be detained. 
Rights groups have long raised the alarm about Hungary detaining, refusing basic supplies like food or pushing back people arriving from Serbia. They say it runs against the right to claim asylum enshrined under international humanitarian law. 
Budapest has lost a number of legal cases on migration at the EU's top court since Orban adopted his hardline policies following a 2015 rise in Mediterranean arrivals that caught the bloc by surprise, contributing to a rise in far-right sentiment. 
But Orban, his black face mask with a little Hungarian flag embroidered on it resting on a coffee table, was unapologetic, saying people can apply for asylum in Hungarian embassies abroad, or face being locked up if they come to the border. 
""Nobody can step into the Hungarian territory without having a legally completed procedure and getting a clear permission to do so,"" he said. ""Migration in Hungary is a national security issue.""
A former liberal and anti-communist crusader, who then studied in the West thanks to the financial support of an ally-turned-foe, Hungarian billionaire philantropist George Soros, Orban rejected the notion of a multi-cultural society. 
""In Hungary, we are very strict that we would not like to have a parallel society, or open society or a mixed-up culture,"" he said. 
""We don't think a mixture of Muslim and Christian society could be a peaceful one and could provide securtiy and good life for the people.""
""RATHER STUBBORN""
Orban said migration - together with protecting what he sees as Europe's Christian cultural identity and its high living standards - was the top challenge today, just as overthrowing the Soviet-imposed communist regimes in eastern Europe was 30 years ago. 
He criticised the Commission's new migration plan for envisaging a possibility that Budapest's commitment to send people back from southern EU states of arrival like Italy or Greece could turn into an obligation to host them in Hungary. 
""That is a very problematic point. It's not good, it's rather bad,"" he said. ""It's nothing else but just renamed relocation. And we always reject relocation.""
While Orban said it was too early to consider a Hungarian veto, he said it would take months before all EU states even clarify their exact positions on the proposal, which Brussels hopes would resolve bitter internal EU feuds over immigration. 
He left no doubt, however, that Budapest would not agree to anything that could lead to Hungary being under obligation to take in people coming from the Middle East or Africa. 

""This point is not acceptable for the Hungarian people,"" he said. ""That is why on certain points we are rather stubborn.""

KIGALI (Reuters) - Paul Rusesabagina, the former hotelier portrayed as a hero in a film about Rwanda's 1994 genocide, told his terrorism trial on Friday he had backed opposition groups, but denied any involvement in violence.
Rusesabagina - who was played by Don Cheadle in the movie ""Hotel Rwanda"" - was detained in August and charged in Kigali with crimes including terrorism, financing terrorism, arson, kidnap and murder.
The 66-year-old, who has attended past hearings in a suit, appeared in court for the first time in a prison uniform of pink shorts and shirt, with his head shaved.
He enjoyed worldwide acclaim after the Oscar-nominated film portrayed him using his connections with the Hutu elite to protect Tutsis fleeing slaughter.
He went on to become a prominent critic of the government that came in after the genocide, accusing President Paul Kagame of stifling political opposition. 
He left the country for Belgium, then the United States and, in a YouTube video posted in December 2018, called for armed rebellion.
On Friday he told the court he had been one of the rotating presidents of the Mouvement Rwandais pour le Changement Démocratique (MRCD). The Rwandan government has accused the MRCD of launching attacks, but he said it was ""a platform of many political parties"" including his own PDR-Ihumure, all pushing for change.
""I was never involved in the leadership of FLN rebels,"" he said, referring to an armed organisation that he said was directed by another member of the umbrella group. ""When we created FLN, it was not a terror group,"" Rusesabagina said.
He asked the judge to release him on bail, saying he was ill with a history of thrombosis, cancer and blood pressure-related ailments. The court adjourned, saying it would reconvene on Oct. 2 to consider the bail request.
Rwandan officials abruptly announced Rusesabagina's detention on Aug. 31 and paraded him before the press in handcuffs.

His family said he had been kidnapped and brought to Rwanda. But Rusesabagina, a Belgian citizen, told the New York Times he had been tricked into boarding a private jet he believed was bound for Burundi.

Navalny thanked his ""unknown good friends"" in the latest of a series of Instagram posts charting his gradual recovery from the poisoning, which German, French and Swedish laboratories have established was carried out with a nerve agent. Russia denies poisoning him and says it has seen no evidence.
""As far as I understand ... the killers' plan was simple: I will feel bad 20 minutes after takeoff, after another 15 minutes I will pass out,"" said Navalny, who collapsed shortly after his flight took off from the Siberian city of Tomsk on Aug. 20.
""Medical assistance will be guaranteed to be unavailable, and in another hour I will continue my journey in a black plastic bag on the last row of seats, terrifying passengers going to the toilet,"" he added with characteristic black humour.
Though he has not been allowed to form a political party, Navalny has been a thorn in the side of President Vladimir Putin for the past decade, using YouTube and Instagram to publish stinging investigations of official corruption.
The 44-year-old thanked the pilots for diverting the plane to Omsk, despite a bomb warning that was phoned through to the airport there.
He also credited the airport medical officers and ambulance team who ""did not say any lies about diabetes, etc., but immediately clearly said: 'this is toxic poisoning' and gave me a dose of atropine.""
Contradictory accounts have emerged of when and where Navalny was given atropine, a drug used to treat nerve agent or pesticide poisonings. Medical experts have said it probably saved his life.
Sources had previously told Reuters that parademics gave him injections, but not of atropine, and that this was administered later when he was admitted to hospital in Omsk.
Navalny was discharged from a Berlin hospital earlier this week and has said he will undertake daily physiotherapy.
The latest Instagram post showed him hugging his wife Yulia and gazing straight into the camera with a neutral expression.

""Thank you, good unknown friends. You are good people,"" he said.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 07:55AM ET</span>",Trump Supreme Court pick would slash odds of surprise liberal victories,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amid a flurry of major rulings early this summer, the U.S. Supreme Court in an under-the-radar case handed a significant win to Native Americans by finding for the first time that almost half of Oklahoma is tribal land.
The ruling was a 5-4 decision in which conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the four liberal justices, one of a handful of such surprise victories by the liberal wing of the court in recent terms.
The death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her possible replacement by a conservative appointed by President Donald Trump imperil such unlikely liberal wins in coming years. 
The 5-4 conservative majority before Ginsburg's death meant that the liberals on certain key issues only needed one conservative colleague siding with them. 
Now, if Trump replaces her, they would need two, with likely implications for headline-grabbing issues on which liberals have prevailed in recent years, including abortion and gay rights, as well as lesser-known cases. 
""The stars would have to line up,"" said John Elwood, a Supreme Court lawyer.
The last two Supreme Court terms have defied expectations with a series of 5-4 rulings in which Chief Justice John Roberts joined the liberals in ruling against Trump's bid to add a citizenship question to the U.S. census, blocking the president's effort to rescind protections for young immigrants known as ""Dreamers"" and striking down a Louisiana abortion restriction.
But there are also several lesser-noticed 5-4 rulings that would have been unlikely with a 6-3 conservative majority.
The Oklahoma ruling was one. It is one of three 5-4 cases on Native American issues in which Gorsuch, who was appointed by Trump, joined the four liberals in the majority. 
Similarly, Gorsuch two years ago was the fifth vote for the liberal wing of the court in striking down part of an immigration law that made it easier to deport people convicted of certain criminal offenses. He also cast the deciding vote that year in two 5-4 criminal cases in favor of defendants.
Last year, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, another conservative appointed by Trump, joined the four liberals in a 5-4 ruling that gave the greenlight to an antitrust lawsuit accusing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) of forcing consumers to overpay for iPhone software applications.
In an important case on evolving privacy rights in the age of the smartphone, Roberts and the four liberals prevailed in another 5-4 case in 2018 as the court imposed limits on the ability of police to obtain cellphone data pinpointing the past location of criminal suspects.
Whether the three liberals will be able to cobble together a majority in similar cases in future depends in large part on the identity of Trump's nominee.
UNPREDICTABLE VOTES
Trump has said he intends to announce his nomination on Saturday, with conservative appeals court judges Amy Coney Barrett and Barbara Lagoa considered the frontrunners to be named to succeed Ginsburg, who died last Friday at age 87. The Republican-controlled Senate, which has to vote on whether to approve or reject the nomination, is poised to act even ahead of Nov. 3, when Trump is seeking re-election. 
Carolyn Shapiro, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, said that even before Ginsburg's death, the 5-4 cases in which liberals prevailed were contingent on the individual legal reasoning of the conservative who joined them. It might be possible to win certain cases with a 6-3 majority, she added, but it will be harder.
""Those occasions are likely to be fairly idiosyncratic and mostly unpredictable,"" Shapiro said.
One area where liberal votes may still be key is on LGBT rights. In June, the court to the dismay of conservatives ruled 6-3 that federal law that outlaws sex discrimination in the workplace applies to gay, lesbian and transgender people. 
In that case, both Roberts and Gorsuch were in the majority with the liberals, so even with Ginsburg's absence, five of the votes in favor of LGBT workers remain on the court. Other cases on the definition of sex discrimination under other federal laws are likely to reach the court soon.
Shannon Minter, a lawyer with the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said he is ""hopeful"" that the majority remains intact but noted that every time there is a change in personnel on the court it can change the internal dynamic in unpredictable ways.

As such, he added, ""Ginsburg's absence is a significant factor.""

PARIS (Reuters) - Parisian commuters in their thousands reacted to the COVID-19 epidemic by ditching public transport and walking or biking instead, but now they find themselves fighting each other for space on the crowded streets.
Twice daily during rush hour, throngs of cyclists teem through central Paris, in many places using cycle lanes specially widened to encourage people to avoid cramming into the metro where they risk spreading the disease.
At junctions and pedestrian crossings, the flow of cyclists intersects with a flow of people on foot. On occasion, cyclists ride through red lights, or pedestrians step out into a cycle lane without looking. Accidents and near-misses are common.
""Cyclists are not so careful with pedestrians. They just keep going,"" said Nadine Lefebvre, a 66-year-old retiree. ""This morning on the pavement, a bicycle slalomed around me, because he could no longer pass on the road.""
In September last year sensors in Paris detected an average of 55.8 cyclists per hour around the city; this September the figure is up to 97.2 per hour.
Paris city authorities have sent out marshals to keep order in the cycle lanes, and they say they are imposing on-the-spot fines of up to 135 euros ($157) for cyclists who break the rules.
David Belliard, deputy mayor of Paris, said he wanted to create a ""pedestrians' committee"" to draw up proposals on how to better share city streets with cyclists.
""We must protect the pedestrians,"" he said.
Previously, the most heated turf war on the streets of Paris was between cars and other, greener forms of transport.
Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo has partially settled that argument, by restricting access for cars in many streets. Her ultimate goal is to pedestrianise the city centre.

The section of Paris' Rue de Rivoli thoroughfare that runs past the Louvre Museum used to have three lanes of traffic and a cycle lane. Since May this year, private vehicles are banned, and three lanes are given over to cyclists.

Goodluck Jonathan, the envoy for the 15-member Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), said on Wednesday that he hoped sanctions would be lifted following Ndaw's inauguration, although no decision has yet been taken.

Lukashenko, in power since 1994, was inaugurated on Wednesday in a secretive ceremony after weeks of huge protests. He declared a landslide win at an election last month that was marred by vote-rigging allegations he denies. 

Russia is a close ally of Belarus and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the move not to recognise him would complicate the EU's dialogue with Belarus, but not affect Belarusian ties with Moscow.

DUK PADIET, South Sudan (Reuters) - Severe flooding in South Sudan has forced more than 600,000 people to flee their homes since July, the United Nations said, after months of torrential rains caused the Nile to burst its banks.
The impoverished East African nation is struggling to recover from a five-year civil war and was already suffering severe food shortages.
Scientists say the unusual rains are caused by a cyclical weather pattern that has been exacerbated by climate change. 
The coronavirus pandemic is also complicating the response, said United Nations humanitarian coordinator for South Sudan Alain Noudéhou. Costs for delivering aid have risen with the need to protect aid workers and families are forced to squeeze together on thin slivers of land.
""With the flooding, people had to move to higher ground and there’s not much higher ground,"" he said on Thursday during a visit to flood-hit areas.
He said the U.N. had allocated $10 million to help flood victims, but needed $40 million more by the end of the year. 
Around him, families waded through water or tried to herd bedraggled chickens away from sodden piles of belongings. 
Kok Manyok, 70, said he was sleeping under the trees after fleeing from his village Dorok in August with his grandchildren. 
""The water level reached almost halfway up my body,"" he said, motioning to his chest as he spoke in his native Dinka language. ""There are no shelters for me and my grandchildren, our cattle are gone and we are sleeping under a tree.""
Families were living off of leaves and sorghum, said Matthew Hollingworth, the country director of the U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP). 
""That is not enough to keep them healthy and fit,"" he said. Some food was due to be distributed next month but there was not enough to go round, he said.
South Sudan’s civil war erupted two years after the country won its independence from Sudan in 2011 and ended with a peace deal signed between the main parties in 2018. But not all armed groups signed the deal and low-level clashes, banditry and attacks on aid workers continue.
The conflict displaced around a third of the 12 million population, creating the worst refugee crisis in Africa since the 1994 Rwandan genocide.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel was set to impose a tighter nationwide COVID-19 lockdown on Friday as critics accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of trying to curb protests against his handling of the health and economic crises.
Netanyahu's government decided on Thursday to tighten a three-week lockdown imposed on Sept. 18, but parliament has not yet approved the measures, which include new limits on public demonstrations.
The restrictions will come into effect at 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) on Friday, just ahead of the Israeli weekend.
They will force Israelis to stay mostly at home, shut down most businesses and restrict group prayer during the approaching Jewish high-holiday season, which includes Yom Kippur.
But while Netanyahu's government is authorised to impose measures it deems urgent, including most restrictions on movement, any restrictions on citizens' rights to protest require parliamentary approval. 
With parliament deadlocked over the protest measures, Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party said it had proposed ""emergency regulations for a few days to prevent mass demonstrations that would cause the public to disregard the closure and endanger many lives"". 
Demonstrators have been gathering weekly outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence, criticising him over the economy, the pandemic and corruption allegations. He denies all wrongdoing.
The new lockdown rules will in part restrict attendance at street protests to within 1 kilometre (0.6 miles) of citizens' homes, effectively shutting down the demonstrations outside Netanyahu's gate.
However, Defence Minister Benny Gantz wrote on Twitter: ""We will not allow emergency regulations to be used to prevent demonstrations."" 
""The decision on a stringent lockdown was designed to stop the spread of the virus, not to block protests,"" he said. 
Without mentioning the curbs on protests, Netanyahu defended the new measures on Thursday, saying that Israelis had not complied with social distancing requirements. 
""Wake up. Enough is enough. We are in a different reality. Something needs to be done and it must be done now. A tight lockdown, especially during the holidays, when the economic cost is much lower,"" he said in public remarks.
A first lockdown was imposed in Israel in late March and eased in May as new cases tapered off. But infections have surged again in recent weeks, reaching daily highs of more than 7,000.

A survey published by the non-partisan Israel Democracy Institute on Wednesday showed only 27% of Israelis trust Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.

WASHINGTON/DUBAI/KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Despite over a year of negotiations, Sudan is facing a fresh obstacle to its removal from a U.S. terrorism list that has hindered its economy: a demand that it normalize relations with Israel, three sources familiar with the matter said.
However, three Sudanese government officials told Reuters on Thursday that Sudan is resisting the linkage of the two issues, which comes as U.S. President Donald Trump has been touting himself as a historic peacemaker on the campaign trail.
Sudan's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism dates back to its toppled ruler Omar al-Bashir, and makes it difficult for its new transitional government to access desperately needed debt relief and foreign financing.
Sudan's skyrocketing inflation and plummeting currency have been the biggest challenge to the stability of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's transitional administration.
Many Sudanese say the designation, imposed in 1993 because the U.S. believed Bashir's regime was supporting militant groups, is now undeserved as he was removed last year and Sudan has long cooperated with the U.S. on counter-terrorism.
""Sudan has completed all the necessary conditions,"" a Sudanese official told Reuters on Thursday. ""We expect to be removed from the list soon."" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a letter to Congress last week that the administration was looking to remove Sudan from the list in October.
The White House and State Department declined to comment when asked about the status of negotiations.
GULF EXAMPLE
In talks with military head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan this week, U.S. officials indicated they want Khartoum to copy the example of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain and open ties with Israel, two U.S. and one Gulf-based sources said.
The United States has offered Sudan development and humanitarian help as well, the U.S. and Gulf-based sources said.
""Sudan made clear to the American side that there is no relationship between removing Sudan from the terror list and exploring relations with Israel,"" a Sudanese government source said, reiterating a message from Hamdok to Pompeo last month.
Burhan's military-led sovereign council said he had discussed the future of Arab-Israeli peace with U.S. officials, and the government would discuss the topic internally, according to the ""interests and aspirations of the Sudanese people.""
A senior U.S. official told Reuters that Washington was prepared to allow time for Sudan to decide, saying that there were disagreements between the military and civilian government on how to proceed. 
Burhan and Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a surprise meeting in Uganda earlier this year. Yet opening ties is sensitive, as Sudan was a staunch foe of Israel under Bashir and some parties in the transitional coalition oppose taking such a step.
CONGRESSIONAL DELAY
Even if a normalization deal is struck, the U.S. Congress is holding up necessary legislation restoring Sudan's sovereign immunity, the principle that prevents lawsuits against sovereign governments, which it lost because of the terrorism designation. 
Sudan wants the legislation passed before it releases a $335 million settlement to victims of al-Qaeda attacks on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the funds for which it said on Wednesday were secured. The settlement was the most significant condition officially placed by the United States.
Sudan's lawyers in the United States said it had already paid an additional $72 million to victims of a 2000 al-Qaeda attack on the USS Cole. ""This is more than Sudan can afford,"" lawyer Christopher Curran said.
""We want to ensure the passing of the immunity law so that we can put an end to the settlements matter,"" the Sudanese official said.
The legislation was left out of a spending bill under consideration this week because of concerns from New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez and New York Senator Chuck Schumer that sovereign immunity would make it more difficult for victims and insurers to sue Sudan for damages tied to the 9/11 attacks, Congressional sources say.
Schumer's office did not respond to a request for comment, but Menendez has made his opposition clear in statements.

Backers of the Sudan legislation said they still hoped to reach a compromise that would let the measure quickly pass the Senate. Sources say that compromise could include an exception to Sudan's immunity making it easier for 9/11 lawsuits.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Just four days into the new school year, Trevor Boutilier's five-year-old son was sent home from his Ottawa kindergarten with a runny nose and slight cough, and told to stay away until he'd had a COVID-19 test and was symptom free.
The local testing center was overrun, so Boutilier drove his son miles out of the city to a small town for the test. They waited for four days for the result, which came back negative.
By then, his son, who suffers seasonal allergies, had been symptom free for days and missed nearly a week of school.
""If you're going to send them home and have them get COVID tested for every runny nose and every sniffle then you're never going to have any kids in school,"" Boutilier said. ""You're just going to have line-ups upon line-ups at the testing centers.""
The long checklist of symptoms that Canadian schools and daycare centers use to screen children has emerged as a major point of contention for parents. Like Boutilier, they say it is overly restrictive, especially in cold and allergy season, and will force children to miss classes and parents to miss work.
This week, British Columbia removed a number of common cold symptoms from its checklist, including runny noses and sore throats, saying those symptoms in isolation should not keep kids at home.
Epidemiologists supported the move, and Ontario and Manitoba are now reconsidering their stay-home checklists. Doctors were less sanguine.
""I'm sort of surprised they'd be doing this as COVID cases are going up,"" said Dr Anna Banerji, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Toronto. 
""A lot of kids that get COVID don't have a fever or shortness of breath,"" she said, pointing to symptoms still on British Columbia's checklist. ""I think you're going to miss a lot of cases.""
New COVID-19 infections have surged in Canada in recent days, with an average of 1,144 new cases reported daily over the past week, up sharply from a daily average of 380 in mid-August. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declared that the second wave had arrived.
The surge, coupled with the reopening of schools for the new term, has led to long line-ups at testing centers in many major cities.
Canada's official opposition leader, Erin O'Toole, slammed Trudeau's government last week after facing a long wait at an Ottawa testing center and called for rapid testing. He is now in isolation after his test came back positive.
""Sore throats and runny nose are symptoms of COVID-19, but they're also symptoms of other well known viruses,"" said Vancouver doctor Funmi Okunola, who is pushing for rapid home testing. ""The only way we can tell the difference between the two is through testing."" 
But home collection kits are still being reviewed by Health Canada, leaving daily symptom checklists as the best screening option for now, though epidemiologists said the kitchen-sink approach may not be realistic.
""Kids get sick from a lot of stuff and it's probably impossible to keep all symptomatic kids out of the system indefinitely,"" said Raywat Deonandan, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. 
""It makes sense to take a few symptoms off the table,"" he added, noting the focus should be on screening for symptoms like a fever, the most common indicator of COVID-19 in children. 
But physicians warned that research is still limited. 

""The consequence of not being careful in schools is those schools may shut down and then everyone loses,"" said Dr Banerji.

The grizzled 55-year-old is now ice navigator on board a Greenpeace ship in the Arctic, and painfully aware of how much more fragile the environment he has devoted much of his life to protecting has become in the three decades he has sailed the globe with the group.
""I used to say to my friends back home, go up and see the Arctic before it's gone, but I think that joke is turning out to be a reality,"" he told Reuters TV from the Arctic Sunrise, where he is helping gather data on biodiversity and the impact of global warming.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's foreign ministry this week summoned Iran's envoy over the country's human rights record, three sources aware of the matter said, signalling concern about what Paris calls ""serious and constant violations"".
France rarely comments publicly on human rights in Iran, but on Sept. 22 Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said more needed to be done over what he said was worsening human rights violations in Iran following anti-government protests in November 2019.
When asked whether France, in conjunction with Britain and Germany had acted collectively, to warn Iran over its treatment of political prisoners and dual nationals held in the country, a foreign ministry official sidestepped the question. 
""The French authorities regularly express their concerns about the serious and constant violations of human rights in Iran,"" spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said.
""These concerns are shared by many partners, including Germany and the United Kingdom.""
One source said the three European powers had acted jointly and warned Iran its actions were harming relations. Two sources said the envoy had been summoned on Thursday.
Britain's Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday that the respective ambassadors from all three countries were being summoned specifically over Tehran's treatment of political prisoners and the detention of dual nationals.
Iranian-French academic Fariba Adelkhah is serving a six-year sentence on security charges. Le Drian said she was being held for political reasons and the charges were baseless.
The move by the three Europeans, known as the E3, comes as they strive to keep alive a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, while confronting U.S. efforts to raise pressure on Tehran and kill the accord.
Washington on Thursday blacklisted several Iranian officials and entities over alleged gross violations of human rights. The European Union has not imposed sanctions over rights violations in Iran since 2013. 
Without naming the E3, Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh responded to the Guardian article in a statement saying some European powers were interfering in the country's internal affairs.

""Iran believes the politically-motivated behaviour and selective moves of the U.S. and certain European governments have always dealt the heaviest blow to the principle of human rights,"" he said.

WINDHOEK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Namibia is struggling to contain the second outbreak this year of the African migratory red locust, which has destroyed 500 hectares of grazing land in the north-east of the country, the country's agriculture minister said on Friday. 
At least 19 areas in the fertile Zambezi region, which borders Zambia, Zimbabwe Angola and Botswana, have been hit by a red locust outbreak since Aug. 12, agriculture minister Calle Schlettwein said in a statement. 
In total, 4,002 square kilometres have been invaded and 500 hectares of livestock grazing land destroyed, he said. 
The country needs around 30 million Nambian dollars ($1.77 million) for additional resources to contain the spread and enable aerial spraying, the minister added.
Some neighbouring countries, also affected, are already spraying from the air, which Schlettwein said was driving the locusts to countries, such as Namibia, that have yet to do so.
The outbreak follows another in February of the large, red-winged grasshopper species, which is common to sub-Saharan Africa. It breeds prolifically in conditions of drought followed by rain and rapid vegetation growth.
Sophia Kasheeta, deputy executive director of the agriculture ministry, told Reuters the money needed could be sourced from the private sector, government ""or anyone who can come on board"".
So far the Food and Africulture Organization is among international bodies providing technical help and materials.

(Reuters) - As Republican President Donald Trump assails the use of mail-in voting, a Pennsylvania court decision over the use of envelopes for hiding the identity of mail-in voters could have major ramifications for the Nov. 3 election between Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden.
One official in the state has warned the ruling could lead to confusion and the disenfranchisement of more than 100,000 voters in the crucial battleground state.
In an interview on Fox News Radio, Trump on Thursday called mail-in ballots ""a horror show,"" despite studies showing no significant problems with that method of voting over the years.
Here are some more details on the Sept. 17 decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
What did the ruling say?
Pennsylvania uses an unusual two-envelope approach to voting by mail: a completed ballot goes into a “secrecy envelope” that has no identifying information about the voter, and then into a larger return envelope signed by the voter.
Interpreting state election laws, the court said officials should throw away mail-in ballots submitted without a secrecy envelope, known as ""naked ballots.""
That ruling was a victory for the Trump campaign, which argued in a court filing that naked ballots should be discarded to ""ensure the secrecy of absentee and mail-in ballots and to prevent fraud.""
Democrats have said that secrecy envelopes are an unnecessary vestige of a time when absentee ballots were counted by officials at polling places. Mail-in ballots in the state are now quickly scanned electronically, making it all but impossible for officials to stop and see how any one person voted, Democrats in the state have said.
Could the ruling help Trump win Pennsylvania?
Yes. Many opinion polls have shown that Democrats are more likely than Republicans to vote by mail this year. 
The polls underscore how mail-in voting has become a political flashpoint. Trump has railed against mail voting, characterizing it without evidence as more fraudulent than in-person voting and a plot by Democrats to rig the election. 
Democrats have encouraged voting by mail as a way to cast ballots safely during the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of Americans, including much of the military, have cast absentee ballots by mail for years without problems.
How many ""naked ballots"" will there be in Pennsylvania?
It is hard to say because 2020 is the first year Pennsylvania is allowing all voters to vote by mail. One Philadelphia election official, Lisa Deeley, has estimated the ruling could lead to more than 100,000 votes not being counted.
In 2016, Trump won Pennsylvania by a narrow margin of about 44,000 votes out of more than 6 million cast, a difference of 0.72%.
Deeley, who chairs the three-member board overseeing Philadelphia’s elections, wrote in a letter to legislators that the ruling will cause ""significant post-election legal controversy, the likes of which we have not seen since Florida in 2000.""
How unusual is Pennsylvania's approach?

Fifteen other states use secrecy envelope or sleeves, including the battleground states of Florida and Ohio. But election officials in those states typically do not throw away ballots sent by voters who forget to use a secrecy envelope.

China has stepped up its military activities near Taiwan which it claims as its own territory, including flying fighter jets across the unofficial mid-line of the sensitive Taiwan Strait, which combat aircraft normally don't breach.
China says it has been reacting to what Beijing has called ""collusion"" between Taiwan and the United States, and to protect China's sovereignty, responding to U.S. Undersecretary for Economic Affairs Keith Krach's visit last week to Taipei.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the drills to repel a landing took place on the Matsu archipelago, which lies just offshore the Chinese city of Fuzhou.
""Whether the engine of a fighter plane or the rumbling of artillery, it is a reassuring sound for the national army that is defending the homeland,"" it said in a post on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
The drills took place across the archipelago involving the use of cannons and machine guns, the ministry added, accompanied by pictures of the exercises.
""Please give the greatest applause to these officers and soldiers! Be our strongest backers!"" it said.
Taiwan has held Matsu, along with Kinmen further down the coast, since defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 at the end of the Chinese civil war.
When Taiwan and China last joined battle on a large scale in 1958 it was around Matsu and Kinmen, with Chinese forces carrying out more than a month of bombardments, including naval and air battles.
Today the islands are popular tourist destinations, though Taiwan maintains a sizeable military presence.
Both are considered by experts as likely targets for Chinese invasion in any war with Taiwan due to their proximity to China.

SHAMBHU, India (Reuters) - Thousands of farmers in India blocked roads and railway tracks on Friday in a protest against new legislation that they say could pave the way for the government to stop buying grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has defended the bills - recently approved by parliament - as reforms to help rid India's vast agriculture sector of antiquated laws and allow farmers to sell to institutional buyers and big retailers such as Walmart (NYSE:WMT).
The government insists the new rules give farmers the option to sell their produce to private buyers while it would still purchase staples such as rice and wheat at guaranteed prices.
But such assurances have failed to mollify millions of farmers who make up an influential voting bloc in states such as Punjab and Haryana - India's northern farm belt which borders the capital New Delhi.
Modi, who was re-elected with an overwhelming majority in 2019, now faces the biggest farmers' protest just weeks before an assembly election in Bihar, India's third-most populous state.
As part of a nationwide shutdown called by India's leading farmers' organisations, growers held demonstrations in many parts of the country and blocked highways leading to New Delhi using trucks, tractors and combine harvesters.
Farmer Karam Singh accused the government of trying to make traditional wholesale markets redundant. Farm leaders say India's more than 7,000 regulated wholesale markets have played a crucial role in ensuring timely payments to growers.
Singh said the new law has made nearly 85% of India's poor farmers, who own less than 2 hectares (5 acres) of land, vulnerable to being shortchanged by private buyers. 
""The private sector will give us a good price for one or two years, but what about after that?"" he asked. ""The government should guarantee the private sector will give us more than the government price.""
As well as in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, farmers held protests in the eastern states of Odisha and West Bengal.
Farmers' bodies also organised protests in Modi's home state of Gujarat in eastern India.
The protests have remained peaceful but most growers, who hit the streets in large numbers, did not wear face masks despite a daily surge in coronavirus cases in India. 
Authorities on Friday had to cancel several train services as farmers blocked railway tracks.

Police in various states have beefed up security in the hope of heading off any violence, especially around New Delhi.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Ltd. (AX:RIO) ignored repeated requests from traditional owners for sacred Australian rockshelters to be protected in the months before the site was blasted during a mine expansion, an Indigenous group said on Friday.
The world’s biggest iron ore miner in May destroyed the two caves in Western Australia, sparking an outcry from the public and Rio's investors. One of the caves showed evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation, making it some of the earliest evidence of human civilisation.
Representatives of the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) peoples sent communications as early as 2008, setting out the importance of the site before preservation efforts picked up in the months before the blast - but they went unheeded, the group said in a submission to a government enquiry.
""We are extremely angry that, over an extended period, Rio Tinto did not act on our input nor the input of specialist archaeologists and anthropologists relating to the cultural importance of the Juukan Gorge rockshelters,"" the group said.
""We are also angry that, once we raised the alarm bells in the months and weeks leading up to the disaster, Rio Tinto ignored our requests and concerns."" 
Rio Tinto declined to comment on the report but has noted that concerns over the site's significance were not elevated to senior executives, including Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two others who ultimately lost their jobs over the destruction.
The Indigenous group set out a string of perceived failures and what they called ""misrepresentation"" by the company in their 120-page report, which is likely to ratchet up pressure on Rio's board, the Western Australian mining industry and the state government, which allowed the blasting.
It also accused Rio of withholding important information at critical junctures before the blast and of laying explosives even after agreeing to freeze its detonation plans. 
""The destruction ... has caused immeasurable cultural and spiritual loss and profound grief to the PKKP People,"" the group said.
The culture that prioritised profit and minimal heritage preservation was not confined to Rio Tinto, the group said as it called for wider reform of ""inadequate"" legislation.
""The problems within Rio Tinto ... are deep-seated and systemic and revolve around culture and behaviour,"" it said.
""The same culture is exhibited by the overwhelming majority of resource industry proponents in Western Australia."" 
The destruction has triggered pledges by other major miners such as BHP Group (AX:BHP) and Fortescue (AX:FMG) to review their mine plans.
""We believe that Aboriginal culture and heritage is undervalued in Australia and throughout the world. Steps need to be put in place to adequately protect, rehabilitate, capture and celebrate it,"" it said.

The enquiry continues next month.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A referendum next month on legalising recreational cannabis has divided opinion in New Zealand with ruling party politicians staying clear of the contentious issue ahead of a general election they are likely to win.
If passed, New Zealand would be only the third country in the world after Uruguay and Canada to legalise the adult use and sale of cannabis, and the first in the Asia Pacific. The referendum will be held along with the Oct. 17 general election in which Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is seeking a second term.
Ardern is a strong favourite to win the election but opinion is sharply divided on the referendum - 49.5% of respondents in a nationwide Horizon Research survey earlier this month said they were in favour of legalising cannabis while 49.5% were against, and 1% gave no response.
""This is the one opportunity we get. A no vote will entrench the current system and scare politicians away,"" said Ross Bell, Executive Director at the New Zealand Drug Foundation, a charitable trust that works to prevent alcohol and drug harm.
Ardern has repeatedly refused to be drawn on whether she would support the change, claiming she does not want to influence the decision. 
Under the proposed bill, licensed cannabis retailers could sell up to 14 grams of cannabis per person each day, to customers over the age of 20. It allows people to consume cannabis on private property or licensed premises and grow two plants.
A yes vote would open up a new market in New Zealand for the $100 billion global marijuana industry, that is valued annually at NZ$1.5 billion ($981.75 million) in the country.
As seen in Canada, Uruguay and almost a dozen U.S. states that legalized cannabis for both medicinal and recreational use, pharmaceutical and other companies are expected to move into the market with new weed-infused products.
A report commissioned by the government said more than 400 retail stores could pop up to supply the estimated 49.7 tonnes of cannabis products consumed in New Zealand each year.
Supporters of the yes vote say regulating cannabis will put an end to the black market, and bring down drug convictions, which are disproportionately higher among the marginalized and the indigenous Maori community.
STAYING CLEAR
Campaigners against legalising marijuana, which include some faith based institutions, refute these claims. 
""The black market will remain, and a new legal market of 400 stores appearing around the country, and then a whole lot of people growing cannabis plants in their backyard. It's hard to believe in that scenario that cannabis use will be reduced,"" said Aaron Ironside, spokesman for the Say Nope to Dope campaign.
Analysts say with all recent polls pointing to a comfortable election victory for Ardern due to her success in handling the coronavirus, she would not want to get into other topics. [nL3N2GJ10J]
""She just would not want to talk about any other issue other than COVID-19,"" said Geoffrey Miller, political analyst at the Democracy Project. 
""It's just not in Labour's interest to talk about cannabis...there is no upside,"" he said.
Ardern's Labour Party is governing in a coalition with the Greens and New Zealand First. The Greens made the cannabis referendum a condition of their support for Ardern back in 2017.
The 40-year-old leader has however kept the topic of cannabis at arms length as she campaigns across the country. 
The main opposition National Party has said it will vote against legalising cannabis, and challenged Ardern to reveal her stand. 
NZ Drug Foundation's Bell said there's been a failure of political leadership on the subject.
""While ultimately the referendum is a vote for New Zealand's public, a lot of voters would want senior minister or even the prime minister herself to talk about why they wrote the bill in the way they did,"" he said.

MARSEILLE, France (Reuters) - Hundreds of restaurant owners and bar staff protested outside Marseille's commercial court on Friday against a government order to shut from Saturday to curb the surge in new coronavirus cases in France's second biggest city.
The government ordered bars and restaurants in the city to close for two weeks after placing Marseille and its surrounds on the Mediterranean on the maximum alert level for the spread of the virus.
But Marseille residents and local officials say the move is disproportionate to the risks and will devastate the local economy.
""We're in complete despair. When they shut us down, they humiliate us,"" said restaurateur Bernard Marty.
""This doesn't just penalise the restaurateur behind the till. It's an entire sector plunged into crisis: suppliers, event organisers, discotheques. Do they expect us to die in silence?""
Renaud Muselier, president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, which includes Marseille, said a legal injunction seeking reprieve would be filed.
Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne said the government would act to cover the fixed costs of bars and restaurants during the shutdown. Partial unemployment schemes would guarantee employees receive their full salary, she added.
""We have to act now to avoid finding ourselves in the same situation we experienced in March,"" Borne told CNews.

Health Minister Olivier Veran will travel to Marseille in the afternoon. The protesters said they would intercept him with their chants of ""let's stay open"".

With time running out for up to 20 breathing mammals still trapped in rugged Macquarie Harbour in Tasmania, rescuers had managed to save about 94 of the 470-strong pod while around 380 had died. 
""We haven't dealt with a stranding of this type before (and) we are getting up to 94 animals released - that is one hell of an effort,"" said Kris Carlyon, a marine conservation biologist advising the government's response.
Most of the released whales, a gregarious species that lives in deep waters, were expected to ""regroup"" and recover from the traumatic event, Carlyon said, but a number of them had returned to the sandbar and died.
The rescue attempt, which has involved a team of more than 100 rescuers, volunteers and police, would continue through Friday and Saturday to try to save the last few animals, officials said.
Authorities were also attempting to contain the carcasses of the dead whales, at least one of which had been found mauled by predators. The bodies were being separated into groups and enclosed with water booms to try keep them in one place, as officials prepare to dispose them at sea. 
""We've certainly had one carcass that's been chomped and another report of sharks further up the coast,"" said Nic Deka, the incident controller for the state government's Parks and Wildlife Service.
""There are sharks around, their numbers may increase with the carcasses in the sea but we are doing a few things to try and get them to decompose and break down more quickly so that if that is an issue it's an issue for less time.""
The stranding, the biggest on record in modern Australia and one of the largest in the world, has drawn attention to a natural phenomenon that remains largely a mystery to scientists.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian school student Ambrose Hayes, 15, rode on a protest barge in Sydney Harbour on Friday holding a huge yellow banner demanding ""No Gas"" as part of a global climate rally calling for greater action from world leaders.
""I am here because I am fed up with the Australian government's inaction on the climate crisis. We need to act now before it's too late,"" climate activist Hayes told Reuters TV.
Hayes protest is part of some 500 climate events planned across Australia as part of ""Fridays for Future"" movement that was made famous by Swedish student Greta Thunberg. 
Hayes is one of eight students who have launched a class action to stop the environment minister approving an expansion of a coal mine arguing it will endanger their futures.
The students argue the Environment Minister Susan Ley has a duty of care to protect them from climate change and the expansion of Whitehaven Coal's (AX:WHC) Vickery coal mine in New South Wales state will contribute to climate change and endanger their future.
""If we don't take action now we're going to face more intense droughts, more intense fires... these are just going to happen more and more and we're not going to stop it if we don't take action now,"" Hayes said.
Less than two years ago, Hayes was at school frustrated by what he perceived as inaction to lower carbon emissions. Now, he is a leading climate activist in Australia.
""I shouldn't have to be doing this. I should be a 'normal kid' going to school and not having to worry about this. But the government has left us no choice. The last generations have left us not choice. We need to stand up,"" Hayes told Reuters. Climate change has been a divisive topic in Australia, one of the world's largest per capita carbon emitters. The country's conservative government has won successive elections on a platform of supporting Australia's dominant fossil fuel sectors. But massive bushfires earlier this year, which experts said were stoked by a drought exacerbated by climate change, have elevated climate change as an issue for many, especially with fires expected in a few months when Australia's summer returns.

About 300,000 Australian school children and climate activist last year took to the streets demanding urgent action to lower carbon emissions, protests criticised by several senior Australian government ministers.

1628,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 25, 2020 03:57AM ET</span>",Guns versus dogs: Swiss decide Sunday on law to ease curbs on wolf shooting,"By John Miller
ILANZ, Switzerland (Reuters) - Rival sides are squaring up over a resurgent Swiss wolf population, ahead of a vote on Sunday which could make it easier to shoot the predators whose global comeback has also inflamed passions in the United States, Germany and France.
A reboot of a 1980s Swiss hunting law, backed by farmers and opposed by wolf advocates, would give regional authorities power to kill wolves deemed a threat to livestock before they attack.
Under the proposals, wolves would be classified as protected, but regulated. They could also be shot if they are seen as having lost their fear of humans. 
Currently, a lone wolf must attack 25 farm animals in a month, or 15 if there was damage in the previous year, before officials can authorise its killing. 
The government can also allow half of the wolf pups in a pack to be culled if 15 livestock are killed in its territory within four months. There are other restrictions.
Above a wild stretch of the Rhine River near the mountain village of Ilanz, farmer Martin Keller last year lost 59 sheep to wolf attacks. This year, he installed 25,000 Swiss francs ($27,300) worth of electrical fencing. While Keller's livestock went unscathed this summer, his farm's finances suffered.
""The law's opponents always talk about a 'Shoot-to-kill' initiative,"" said Keller. ""We don't want to kill all the wolves. All we want is to be allowed to regulate problem wolves, and that local decisions can be made more easily.""
ENTRENCHED FOES
The country's wolves were eradicated by the 19th century, but returned from hold-out packs in Italy in recent decades and now number about 100 animals in 11 packs, with some lone wolves, according to Ralph Manz of the publicly-funded Swiss wolf monitoring organization KORA.
Their recovery has inflamed emotions akin to those that flared after the 1990s, when wolves were re-introduced to the U.S. Rocky Mountains.
Their fate is also at the centre of shifting modern political power as agricultural communities affected by the predator's return compete with a more-urban conservation lobby. 
Wolf hunts in Idaho, Wyoming and Montana, where there are now more than 2,000 of the predators, have entrenched positions, with animal activists angered by so-called ""wolf derbies"" where hunters compete to shoot the animals.
There are similar tensions in Europe. French farmers decry thousands of sheep killed yearly while Germany - which has 600 wolves and rising - eased shooting curbs last year. [https://reut.rs/3ku3nwW]
Some studies show Switzerland, with ample prey like deer or wild boar, has habitat for 60 packs, a figure the hunting law's proponents dispute.
""We have relatively little room for wolves,"" said Georges Schnydrig, a farmer-politician from Switzerland's Valais region who raises black-nosed sheep. ""The law is a compromise that says, 'If we can regulate wolf numbers, all stakeholders can find common ground.' ""
DOGS NOT GUNS
The Swiss government says the revisions give more power to cantons to regulate wolves while still ensuring that packs thrive. The last hunting law dates from the 1980s, before wolves returned permanently to the country. 
Foes of the changes say they hand too much power to the regions, including in Valais where some have called for their extermination.
They also contend the 300-500 Swiss sheep, goats and cattle lost annually to wolf raids represent just a fraction of the thousands killed by disease or accidents. 
Given some 87% of livestock killed by the carnivores were unprotected, according to one Swiss canton's tally, pro-wolf groups argue heavily-subsidised farmers should deploy more fences, shepherds and herd dogs, not guns. Sheep farmers in 2018 got 15.7 million Swiss francs ($17 million). 
Farmers including Keller receive some payments to install fences, though they say they must bear most of the cost themselves for the extra measures.
""Protective measures require effort,"" said conservation group CHWOLF.org president Christina Steiner. ""Shooting wolves seems easier.""
Wolves rarely attack people. Some tourist communities though back controls, arguing hikers and mountainbikers could be scared off by herd dogs trained to guard sheep or mother cows that have grown aggressive to protect their young as wolves move in.
Polls show Swiss voters divided going into Sunday's vote.
Regardless of the outcome, KORA's Manz predicts debate will continue since wolf numbers are likely to keep rising. 
""The wolf's return intrudes on tradition and private property,"" he said. ""An animal that intrudes on property is an enormous challenge for humans. People aren't used to that.""

Protesters flooded streets in Turkey's mainly Kurdish southeast in early October 2014, accusing the Turkish army of standing by as Islamic State besieged Kobani, just across the Syrian border. The protests led to the deaths of 37 people.
Ankara accuses the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group of inciting the demonstrations. It also accuses the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) of links to the PKK and supporting the protests. The HDP, the third largest party in parliament, denies this.
In a statement on Friday, prosecutors in Ankara said arrest warrants were issued over ""several calls made to invite the public to the streets and carry out terror acts"", adding suspects would be sought in seven provinces. 
""The Ankara Prosecutor's Terror Crimes Investigation Bureau has launched an investigation on the PKK terrorist organisation and its so-called executives, as well as certain political party executives and members... and, at the current stage, ordered the detention of 82 suspects,"" the prosecutor's office said.
Broadcaster NTV and other media said the suspects included HDP members including the mayor of the northeastern Kars province Ayhan Bilgen, former lawmaker Sirri Sureyya Onder, and some party executives, and that some had already been detained.
The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and European Union, has fought against the state in the southeast since 1984. A ceasefire collapsed in 2015.

Taiwan's Chinese Wild Bird Federation (CWBF), since renamed the Taiwan Wild Bird Federation (TWBF), this month became the latest and unlikely frontline in Chinese efforts to assert sovereignty over the democratically-ruled island.
China has ramped up pressure on international groups and companies to refer to Taiwan as being part of China, to the anger of Taiwan's government and many of its people.
In correspondence published by the TWFB on its website, the Cambridge-based BirdLife International said it was committed to ""follow UN positions and protocols on countries and territories"" and to treating Taiwan, which it referred to as ""Chinese Taiwan"", as part of China.
BirdLife, which said it was responding to an internal risk review, demanded the group stop using the expression Republic of China, Taiwan's formal name, ""and/or any other expression suggesting independence"".
It also asked them to formally commit not to advocate or promote in any way Taiwan's independence of Taiwan or the legitimacy of the Republic of China.
It is not clear from the correspondence whether the Chinese government was involved in the request, though expressions like ""Chinese Taiwan"" are how Beijing requires international organisations refer to the island.
BirdLife did not respond to several requests for comment.
The TWBF, which had refused to sign any political documents, reiterated it has never taken a political position.
""We are conservationists, not political actors. In fact, it was BirdLife who asked us to take a political stance by insisting we sign an overtly political declaration and by describing us as a 'risk', without ever clearly defining what that risk was.""
Beijing's government took over the Chinese seat at the United Nations in 1971 from Taipei, though the U.N. resolution on that move makes no explicit mention of Taiwan's status.

During more than two months of anti-government protests, some protest leaders have said they seek constitutional reforms to reduce the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy but that they were not seeking to abolish it. 
The republican hashtag, in English rather than Thai, had been used in more than 730,000 Tweets and was the top trending hashtag in Thailand on Friday morning, according to Twitter. 
The Royal Palace did not comment and has made no response to requests for comment on the protests or the demands for royal reform. 
Government spokesman Anucha Burapachaisri said he had not seen the hashtag and declined to comment on it but said Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha was listening to all sides on the issue of the constitution. 
""There are those who want to amend the constitution and others who don't,"" he said. 
Parliament, dominated by supporters of the government, voted on Thursday to delay making a decision on whether it will amend the constitution.
The decision angered protesters and opposition parliamentarians, who accused parliament of trying to buy time.
Protesters seek changes to a constitution they say was drafted to ensure Prayuth, a former junta leader, kept power after an election last year. They also want his departure. Prayuth says the election was fair. 
The protests are the biggest challenge to the military and palace-dominated establishment since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup.
The biggest protest drew tens of thousands of people at the weekend. They cheered calls for reforms to the monarchy, which were first aired in August, breaking a longstanding taboo on not criticising an institution that the constitution says must be held ""in a position of revered worship"".
Some protesters say the constitution also gives too much power to the king, who paid a rare visit to Thailand on Thursday for ceremonies honouring his grandfather, Prince Mahidol Adulyadej. 
The king has spent most of his time in Europe since taking the throne nearly four years ago.

Hundreds of royalists marched to parliament on Wednesday to oppose calls from the anti-government protesters for changes to the constitution.

The cannabis seeds sowed in a plaza by Mexico's Senate by pro-marijuana activists in February have mushroomed into strikingly large plants, and become symbolic of a drive to legalize marijuana in a nation riven by drugs-related violence. 
""Being able to smoke here (in the garden) in freedom is very important to me,"" said Marco Flores, a barista sitting on a bench overlooking the Congress building. 
""I no longer go out on the streets in fear"".
Mexico's Supreme Court has ruled that laws prohibiting cannabis use are unconstitutional but the government is yet to draft legislation that would formally legalise marijuana, leaving pot-smokers facing criminal charges if caught smoking.
But in the garden run by pro-marijuana activists, people are allowed in for 30 minutes at a time and can light up in peace. So far police appear to be turning a blind eye to the practice, though it's unclear how long that will last.
""It's great that they have opened a space for people who are open to new experiences, or who want to find out a little bit about this subject,"" said Carlos Diaz, another smoker. ""They can come and check it out.""
For Jose Rivera, a cannabis activist, the garden is a tool to educate and offer 'human rights'.

""We want (Mexican lawmakers) to understand that we are smoking quietly and that we are not a risk to anyone,"" he said. ""Enough of the mistreatment.""

The overall population dropped by about 18,000 people, or 0.3%, to 5.69 million, according to an annual population report. 
A sharp drop in foreigners, down 2% to 1.64 million, as well as a marginal fall in permanent residents, outweighed a modest rise in citizens, some of whom returned from overseas as the pandemic spread globally.
""These trends were largely due to COVID-19 related challenges, brought about by weak demand and travel restrictions,"" the report said, citing job losses in services, a sector heavily reliant on low-paid foreign labour.
As the economy faces the deepest recession in its history - an economic decline officially estimated between 5%-7% for the year - the government has been raising barriers for foreign hiring to preserve jobs for locals.
But authorities in the low-tax corporate hub, home to the Asian headquarters of many multinational companies, have also warned that a populist turn could hurt business.
""We must be careful not to give the wrong impression that we are now closing up and no longer welcoming foreigners,"" Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech earlier this month, after an election in which opposition parties criticised the government's immigration policies as too slack. 
Singapore's non-resident population has more than doubled over the last 20 years, powering population growth in a city-state with one of the world's lowest birth rates. 
This has prompted recurring concerns about competition for jobs and the strains on public infrastructure, which again came to the fore on the July 10 ballot, in which the ruling People's Action Party ceded a record number of seats to the opposition.

The prime minister’s explosive proposal to rewrite the Withdrawal Agreement he signed eight months ago had threatened to derail any attempt to secure an EU-U.K. trade deal. The bloc has given Johnson until the end of the month to back down or face legal action.
Officials close to the discussions, though, say the two sides have succeeded in taking the heat out of the situation. Johnson’s chief Brexit negotiator, David Frost, held informal talks with his opposite number, Michel Barnier, in London on Wednesday, and they were able to lay the foundations for a round of negotiations in Brussels next week.
The EU is still likely to start legal action, but the bloc will, as one official put it, hold its nose and continue discussions with the British. Johnson will come under pressure to withdraw the most controversial parts of his bill rewriting the Brexit divorce agreement when the outlines of a wider trade deal emerge, the official added.
Without such an accord, businesses face the risk of disruption when the U.K. leaves the EU’s single market and customs union at the end of the year. But the negotiations have been deadlocked because the two sides can’t agree on what EU state-aid rules the U.K. will have to follow, and what access the bloc’s fishing boats will have to British waters.
Far Apart
EU governments have “agreed that our collective focus should continue to be on achieving a successful conclusion to the future relationship negotiations,” Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told the country’s parliament on Thursday after talks with his counterparts in Brussels. He stressed that the two sides remain far apart.
Even so, negotiators are increasingly hopeful both sides want a deal. EU officials say Johnson needs one to boost his reputation after it was dented by his handling of the coronavirus; their British counterparts say they believe the bloc is still ready to make more concessions. It’s a situation ripe for finding compromise, one EU official said.
But a breakthrough isn’t expected next week -- and the row over Johnson’s plan to undo parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol could still overshadow the start of the talks. U.K. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove is due to meet European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic in Brussels on Monday. With only days to go before the EU’s deadline expires, that could make for an unpleasant start to the week, one official said.
Barnier and Frost are scheduled to resume negotiations on the future relationship on Tuesday. Barnier told EU diplomats this week that Johnson’s move had left some bad feeling, but the atmosphere between negotiators remained constructive.
With a little more than two weeks to go until Johnson’s own Oct. 15 deadline to reach a deal, several officials warned the negotiations could now stretch into November or even December.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top federal prosecutor in the battleground state of Pennsylvania on Thursday said his office was investigating a small number of military ballots cast for President Donald Trump that had been ""discarded.""
In a highly unusual public statement, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, David Freed, said his office and the FBI was probing incidents that occurred in Luzerne County, which is located in northeastern Pennsylvania and includes Wilkes-Barre. 
Nine military ballots had been ""improperly opened"" by elections staff and ""discarded,"" Freed said in a letter to a county election official released on Thursday. 
Seven of the nine ballots were found outside their official envelopes, Freed said, adding that those ballots were all cast for Trump.
""The majority of the recovered materials were found in an outside dumpster,"" Freed said. 
He called the findings ""troubling,"" but has not yet filed any charges or taken official action.
Freed said his investigation remains active, but he was releasing information now because of ""the limited amount of time before the general election and the vital public importance of these issues.""
The Nov. 3 election is less than six weeks away.
Some former Justice Department officials criticized Freed's announcement, saying there was no legitimate reason to disclose that the ballots were marked for Trump.
""This is both bizarre and disturbing,"" David Laufman, a former Justice Department official, said on Twitter. ""U.S. Attorney’s Offices don’t issue reports on pending investigations — and certainly not reports so blatantly contrived to provide political ballast for a sitting President’s campaign narrative."" 
The announcement has added fuel to Trump's efforts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the upcoming election. He has often asserted, without evidence, that widespread mail-in voting will lead to fraud. Democrats, meanwhile, have encouraged voting by mail so that Americans can safely vote during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The comments came after U.S. immigration officials earlier this month said a federal watchdog would investigate complaints made by a whistleblower nurse in a Georgia immigration detention facility who alleged detainees had improperly received hysterectomies and other gynecological procedures.
Ebrard told reporters that 20 of 24 female Mexican nationals being held at detention centers in the U.S. states of Georgia and Texas had been interviewed and none of then had been subjected to such procedures.
He added, however, that an investigation was ongoing as more women still needed to be interviewed.
Earlier this week, Mexican officials said they were interviewing at least six women who may have been subject to improper medical procedures, including hysterectomies - the surgical removal of a woman's uterus.

Ebrard at the time described such potential abuse as ""unacceptable"" and said that if the procedures were confirmed, measures would have to be taken, without giving details.

1638,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 09:46PM ET</span>",'Our first dictatorship is school': Thai kids revolt,"By Juarawee Kittisilpa
BANGKOK (Reuters) - Wearing white ribbons, publicly hacking off their hair and making ""Hunger Games"" salutes - Thailand's high school students are doing their best to shake up the country's rigid education system. 
As university students stage weeks of high-profile campus protests for democracy, their younger brethren are advancing their own rebellion to Thailand's establishment.
""There's a viral saying that 'our first dictatorship is school',"" 17-year old Peka Loetparisanyu told Reuters at her apartment.
""They are trying instill in us that we are only the little people in an authoritarian society,"" Loetparisanyu said. ""This means that a lot of our rights have been violated.""
The movement sweeping through Thai high schools has been dubbed ""Bad Student"" by its leaders. Its namesake is a book written by university student activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal about his experiences in high school titled ""A Bad Student in an Excellent Education System.""
As well as supporting the broader aims of the anti-government protests, the high school movement is targeted at gaining self-expression for students via the abolition of rules they deem as archiac.
Traditionalism runs through Thailand's education system. The royal anthem is played at morning assemblies, uniform and deportment rules are strict and students are expected to be unquestioning of authority. 
Critics say the school system is aimed at compliance more than education. Global scores compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) for 2018 show Thailand far behind top performer Singapore and also lagging neighbouring Malaysia in reading, maths and science.
Still, conservatives were furious last month when some students wore white ribbons and raised three-finger ""Hunger Games"" salutes during the morning anthem recital to support the pro-democracy movement. The salute has been a symbol of calls for democracy since Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha first took power in a 2014 coup. The white ribbons represent the purity of the students.
Education Minister Nataphol Teepsuwan earlier this year bowed to demands by students to relax the rules that prescribe specific hair length and styles for male and female students.
But Nataphol said more discussion was needed on calls to abolish uniforms and other major changes. 
""I don't think the students are my opponents,"" he told Reuters. ""I feel that by listening to them, I'm giving them an opportunity to voice their concern safely.""
Fifteen-year-old Benjamaporn Nivas became one of the first faces of the 'Bad Student' movement when she sat in public places with a sign around her neck inviting passersby to cut her hair as symbolic 'punishment' for infringing the haircut rule.
She's now set her sights on further reform. 

""They should revoke all the outdated rules, not just that one,"" she told Reuters. ""Those rules shouldn't exist in the first place. They violate our human rights.""

The video showed nuclear-capable H-6 bombers striking what appears to be Anderson, though it did not directly mention the base name, as regional tensions rise and the U.S. carries out a major biennial drill near Guam.
""I'm always concerned about our ability to protect our service members and their families,"" Brig. Gen. Jeremy T. Sloane, Andersen's commander, told reporters on a conference call about the ongoing Valiant Shield exercises.
""The video itself - they know the timing of the exercise,"" he added. ""It's a propaganda video ... although we're always concerned about the protection of the island and the protection of our people, the video itself is just purely propaganda designed to coerce and antagonise us.""
The Chinese government has not commented on the video, which lifted taken some scenes from Hollywood movies like ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"", to the amusement of posters on Chinese social media.
It was released on Sept. 19 on the Chinese air force's Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) account, in the midst of the Sept. 14-25 Valiant Shield drill.
Sloane said Valiant Shield continued as scheduled. 
""The exercise itself is going to go on as planned because it's designed to make sure that we're trained and ready to conduct ourselves across a variety of operations in the Indo-Pacific and to support our allies and partners.""
Guam is home to major U.S. military facilities, including the air base, which would be key to responding to any conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.
The video also came as China carried out a second day of drills near Chinese-claimed Taiwan, to express anger at the visit of a senior U.S. State Department official to Taipei.
The H-6 has been involved in multiple Chinese flights around and near Taiwan, according to Taiwan's air force, including those last week.

(Reuters) - While the enormity of tackling climate change can be so overwhelming that some people shut down, presenting people with examples of how they can take action offers hope, says climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe.
In a live interview with Reuters on Thursday Hayhoe explained how climate change was causing weather events such as heat waves, wildfires and hurricanes to become more severe and more frequent. https://www.pscp.tv/w/1gqxvagqNBjJB
“According to natural factors we should be very gradually but inevitably getting cooler right now,” said Hayhoe, an atmospheric scientist at Texas Tech University in Lubbock. “Instead we're getting warmer faster than any time in the history of human civilization on this planet.”
The urgency of climate change is real, she says, calling it “a here issue, and a now issue.” Climate change was a major factor in heat waves that made recent fires in Siberia, Australia, and the U.S. West so extensive and damaging, she said.
Hayhoe, widely known as a top communicator of climate change, addressed what often stands in the way of more aggressive action toward reducing emissions and adapting our societies to cope with change. 
“Scaring the pants off us, for most of us, doesn't move us forward. It actually causes us to freeze. That’s how our brains are hard-wired,” Hayhoe said. “We are wired to move forward not only to escape fear but rather towards a reward, something positive.”
Instead, Hayhoe focuses on communicating how climate change is affecting people locally and offering suggestions for how people can help provide solutions – even if those solutions are small. Giving people a sense of efficacy, she said, means giving people hope.
For many, that sense of agency could come simply from talking about climate risks with friends or within their communities. For others, individual actions such as switching to LED light bulbs or forgoing meat can help people feel they are part of the solution. 
Individual actions can only address a small part of the problem, she said. So governments need to step up, as does the private sector. 

“Having different metrics that measure not only economic growth, but also the sustainability, the ability to live within our boundaries, we need a different paradigm for business,"" she said. ""It’s business leaders, and business experts and business thinkers who have to be involved in developing that paradigm,” she said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrats in of the House of Representatives will introduce a bill next week to limit the tenure of U.S. Supreme Court justices to 18 years from current lifetime appointments, in a bid to reduce partisan warring over vacancies and preserve the court's legitimacy.
The new bill, seen by Reuters, would allow every president to nominate two justices per four-year term and comes amid heightened political tensions as Republican President Donald Trump prepares to announce his third pick for the Supreme Court after the death on Sept. 18 of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, with just 40 days to go until the Nov. 3 election.
""It would save the country a lot of agony and help lower the temperature over fights for the court that go to the fault lines of cultural issues and is one of the primary things tearing at our social fabric,"" said California U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, who plans to introduce the legislation on Tuesday, along with Representatives Joe Kennedy III of Massachusetts and Don Beyer of Virginia. 
Partly due to rising life expectancies, justices serve increasingly long tenures, on average now more than 25 years. 
Term limits for high court justices have for years had support from a number of legal scholars on both the right and the left. Several polls in recent years have also shown large majorities of the American public support term limits.
The bill - the Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act - is the first to try to set Supreme Court term limits by statute, according to Gabe Roth, the executive director of Fix the Court, a judicial transparency group whose campaign for high court term limits has been gaining attention.
Some legal observers, including those who favor term limits, say they must be accomplished through an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which has been interpreted as requiring life tenure for federal judges and justices. 
The bill seeks to avoid constitutional concerns by exempting current justices from the 18-year rule. Those appointed under term limits would become ""senior"" upon retirement and rotate to lower courts. 

""That's perfectly consistent with their judicial independence and having a lifetime salary and a lifetime appointment,"" Khanna said.

Dozens of opposition parties are refusing to participate in the vote on the grounds that it is rigged in favor of the ruling Socialist Party, though one group within the opposition has said it is seeking better conditions for possible participation.
""An EU mission is in Caracas this week to have contacts with all stakeholders (including all main political forces, civil society, academia, the private sector and the church),"" an EU spokesperson said in an email.
""This mission takes place in the context of the ongoing ... efforts to promote minimum democratic conditions ahead of legislative elections.""
The EU said it has received an invitation to observe the elections in Venezuela in December, but said President Nicolas Maduro's government so far has not met ""minimum conditions"" to allow it to do so.
Maduro responded that it would be ""impossible"" to delay the vote. {nL1N2GF00T]
European nations have broadly disavowed the government of Maduro on the grounds that his 2018 re-election was fraudulent and have instead recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's rightful head of state.
The legislature has been controlled by the opposition since 2016 following a landslide victory the year before, but the pro-government supreme court has blocked nearly every piece of legislation it has approved.
The United States has launched a broad sanctions program against Maduro in efforts to force him from office. 

Maduro says the sanctions are illegal and harm the country's population by limiting the government's capacity to import food and fuel and restricting its capacity to earn export revenue from oil sales.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump made a final push to keep his tax returns away from Manhattan's top prosecutor, saying he deserves a ""fair chance"" to show a subpoena for the returns was overbroad and issued in bad faith, according to a court filing on Thursday.
Trump's lawyers made the filing with the federal appeals court in Manhattan.
That court will hear oral arguments on Friday over whether Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance can enforce a grand jury subpoena to Trump's accounting firm Mazars USA for eight years of his corporate and personal tax returns for a criminal probe.
Trump is appealing U.S. District Judge Victor Marrero's Aug. 20 ruling to enforce the subpoena, following an unsuccessful effort this year to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court he was immune from criminal probes while in the White House.
Vance is probing Trump and his businesses, which include the Trump Organization.
The probe began after news that Trump's former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen made hush money payments before the 2016 election to keep two women quiet about claimed sexual encounters with Trump, which the president denies.
Vance has signaled the probe has a broader scope.
He has said in court filings he might have grounds to investigate Trump and his businesses for tax fraud, insurance fraud and falsifying business records, and the probe also related to reports of possible bank fraud.
But Trump's lawyers said the probe ""is about the Cohen payments,"" and accused Vance of making it seem the grand jury was examining reported allegations about Trump and his businesses ""no matter how baseless, how old, or how far beyond the District Attorney’s compass.""
They also said ""fever pitch"" tensions between Vance and the Trump Organization made Trump's allegations even more plausible.
Vance's ""apparent trepidation at having to defend this subpoena on the merits is not a basis for denying the President a fair chance to test its legality,"" Trump's lawyers wrote.
All three judges on the appeals court panel were appointed by Democratic presidents, as was Marrero. Vance is also a Democrat, while Trump is a Republican. Trump could appeal again to the Supreme Court if he loses.
Vance's probe is separate from New York Attorney General Letitia James' civil investigation into whether Trump and the Trump Organization overstated the value of some assets to obtain loans and tax benefits.

A New York state judge on Wednesday ordered Trump's son Eric, a Trump Organization executive vice president, to answer questions under oath in that probe by Oct. 7.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - About 2,000 people in Ethiopia have been charged over deadly violence that followed the killing of a popular singer in June and charges against more prisoners are likely to follow, the attorney general said on Thursday. 
At least 166 people were killed following the murder of Haacaaluu Hundeessaa, some in protests against authorities and some in ethnically-targeted attacks. 
More than 9,000 people were arrested in the wake of the violence, including some politicians from Oromiya, Ethiopia's most populous province and the home of the deceased singer.
""Some the suspects and some of the accused complained that they are being charged for their political activity,"" Attorney General Gideon Timothewos told a news conference. 
""They are not,"" he said. ""They are being charged for their conduct that has resulted in the death of hundreds of citizens.""
He did not give details on the charges or on whether any prisoners had been released without charge. 
Haacaaluu was shot dead on June 29 while driving in the capital Addis Ababa. He was one of Ethiopia's biggest musical stars and a powerful political voice, with many of his songs speaking out on behalf of his Oromo ethnic group and calling for more freedoms.
Africa's second most populous nation, Ethiopia is one of the continent's fastest growing economies and is due to hold elections next year. 
But decades of frustration over government repression and a series of democratic reforms by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who tokk office in April 2018, have emboldened regional power-brokers keen to challenge the ruling party.
Long-suppressed frustrations frequently explode into ethnic violence. 
Abiy won the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his peacemaking efforts which ended two decades of hostility with Eritrea.
But some of his critics have accused him of using similar heavy-handed tactics - such as mass arrests or the detention of political opponents - to the regime that preceeded him. 
Gideon said the riots after the singer's death had to be quashed. 
""We have to distinguish between peaceful, lawful political mobilisation and the kind of rhetoric, the kind of ultranationalist militant violent political activism, that results in deaths and injury,"" he said.

1646,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Key Vatican cardinal caught up in real estate scandal resigns suddenly,"By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - A powerful Vatican cardinal caught up in a real estate scandal resigned suddenly on Thursday and gave up his right to take part in an eventual conclave to elect a pope, in one of the most mysterious episodes to hit the Holy See in years.
A brief statement, issued unusually in the evening, said that Pope Francis had accepted the resignation of Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu, head of the department that decides who will be the saints of the Roman Catholic Church.
But perhaps more significantly, the statement said the Becciu, 72, had ""given up the rights associated with being a cardinal"".
The one-line statement gave no details but the most important right of Roman Catholic cardinals under 80, as is Becciu, is to take part in a conclave to elect a new pope after the current pope dies or resigns. 
The relinquishing of that right indicated that the reason for Becciu's resignation was particularly serious.
The last cardinal to give up that right was Cardinal Keith O'Brien of Scotland, who resigned over a sex scandal in 2013.
Becciu was until 2018 deputy secretary of state, one of the most powerful positions in the Vatican.
During his tenure in that office the Vatican became embroiled in a controversial deal in which the Secretariat of State used Church money to purchase a luxury building in London as an investment.
That investigation led to the suspension last year of five Vatican employees, the resignation of the Vatican's police chief and the departure of the former head of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF).
Becciu has denied all wrongdoing in the London property deal and defended the purchase, saying the property has increased in value.
In June, Vatican police arrested Gianluigi Torzi, an Italian middleman who was part of a controversial deal, and charged him with extortion, embezzlement, aggravated fraud and money laundering, the Vatican press office said in a statement.

He was later released but the investigation is continuing. Vatican sources said they expected Vatican magistrates to hand down indictments soon.

A simmering decades-old conflict which split the east Mediterranean island's Greek and Turkish Cypriots has come full circle with the issue featuring prominently in disputes between NATO allies Greece and Turkey, and now holding up EU plans to impose sanctions on Belarus.
EU member Cyprus - backed by Greece - is at odds with Turkey over maritime energy resources. It is blocking EU sanctions on Minsk until the bloc takes a tougher stance towards Ankara. 
""For the (Cyprus peace) talks to resume with realistic prospects for success, it is imperative to create an environment which will be conducive for constructive and good faith negotiations... not under conditions of intimidation or threats,"" Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades said in an address to the U.N. General Assembly.
Turkey has dispatched survey vessels close to Cyprus in areas the Greek Cypriot government has licenced to multinationals to explore for oil and gas.
Cyprus was split after a Turkish invasion in 1974 triggered by a brief coup engineered by the military then ruling Greece. The EU admitted the island into the bloc in 2004, represented internationally by its Greek Cypriot government which effectively controls only its south. Its north is a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state.
The latest attempt at reunification between the two Cypriot sides collapsed in disarray in mid-2017. Each Cypriot side blames the other for the collapse.

Anastasiades, who heads Cyprus's internationally-recognised government, repeated that his administration was willing to place any revenues from gas exploration into an escrow account for the Turkish Cypriot community.

(Reuters) - The U.S. government plans on Thursday to execute Christopher Vialva, a convicted murderer and the first Black man to face the federal death penalty since the punishment was resumed this summer after a 17-year hiatus. 
Vialva was 19 years old when he and fellow members of a gang in Killeen, Texas, killed Todd and Stacie Bagley, white married Christian youth ministers from Iowa, on the Fort Hood army base in 1999.
The Department of Justice says it will kill Vialva using lethal injections of pentobarbital, a barbiturate, at 6 p.m. EDT (2200 GMT) at its execution chamber in Terre Haute, Indiana, the sixth federal execution this year after the hiatus and the second this week.
Vialva, 40, has asked the U.S. Supreme Court for a stay, which was still under consideration on Thursday. His lawyers argue that the Federal Death Penalty Act requires the U.S. Bureau of Prisons to obtain an execution warrant from a judge. The court's conservative majority previously dismissed legal efforts to delay the five federal executions that have already taken place this year.
Vialva's execution comes as the nation grapples with racial disparities in the criminal justice system, with daily protests occurring in U.S. cities against police brutality against Black people.
Of the 56 people on federal death row, 26, or 46%, are Black, and 22, or 39%, are white, according to the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC), a non-profit organization based in Washington. Black people make up only 13% of the U.S. population.
DPIC published a report this month concluding that racial bias persists in the U.S. system of capital punishment. The report said that the killers of white people were more likely to face the death penalty than the killers of Black people, and a study in North Carolina found that qualified Black jurors were struck from juries at more than twice the rate of qualified white jurors.
At Vialva's trial in the U.S. District Court for Western Texas in 2000, a jury of 11 white people and one Black person found him and a Black accomplice, Brandon Bernard, guilty of carjacking and murder, and voted for them to receive the death penalty. Bernard's execution date has not been set.
The American Civil Liberties Union has said that the teenaged Vialva was unfairly tried as an adult and circulated a video of Vialva this month speaking from prison about racial disparities.
""The death penalty has been used disproportionately against Black people for decades,"" Vialva says in the video. ""People are unaware that many of us here were arrested before we were old enough to drink.""
According to court records, Vialva and his accomplices were looking for someone to rob when they found Todd Begley using a payphone at a convenience store, and he agreed to give them a ride in his car. In the back seat, Vialva pulled out a gun and ordered Begley and his wife to get into the car's trunk.
After forcing Begley to disclose his PIN, Vialva withdrew cash from Begley's account at an ATM, though there was less than $100 on deposit. He used the cash to buy fast food and cigarettes, among other items. During the several hours they spent in the trunk, the Begleys could be heard telling their kidnappers to embrace Christianity.

Eventually, Vialva parked the car in an isolated part of Fort Hood, opened the trunk and shot both Begleys in the head, killing Todd and rendering Stacie unconscious. Bernard then set the car on fire, and an autopsy showed that she died from smoke inhalation.

Several incidents involving orcas and small sailboats have been reported off the Galician shore near La Coruna since Aug. 19, the Transport Ministry said. No one was hurt.
On Wednesday it banned boats under 15 meters (49 ft) long from taking to sea for at least a week off a land segment of about 90 km (56 miles) between Cape Piorino Grande and Point Estacas de Bares. 
The orcas have bumped the boats' hulls and rudders, causing damage that in some cases has led to the coastguard having to tow boats back to shore. The ban could be extended if the cetaceans remain in the area.
Highly social orcas are spotted regularly off the Spanish shores in the Straits of Gibraltar and the Gulf of  Cadiz  (NASDAQ:CDZI) in the south and off Galicia and Cantabria in the north.

They usually feed on fish, penguins and seals. An adult can measure up to eight meters and weigh up to six tonnes. In the wild, they are not known to attack humans.

MAD chief Christof Gramm had begun reforms to combat right-wing extremism in the military and achieved noticeable improvements, the ministry said in a statement, adding, however, that further progress was needed and this required more effort.
""This new phase should also be made visible in terms of personnel,"" the statement said.
By mutual consent, Gramm is to be relieved of his duties next month, and will take early retirement, the defence ministry said, adding that a successor would be chosen soon.
Several incidents in the last few months have raised concerns about the influence of the far right in the military, an especially sensitive subject for Germans given the country's Nazi past.
In June, Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said she would disband a company in the military's elite KSK special forces due to a persistent problem of far-right extremism within the ranks.
A KSK captain had asked the minister to intervene after he accused instructors and senior commandos in the unit of cultivating a ""toxic culture of acceptance"" under which complaints about far-right influence were suppressed.

The casing, known as a reliquary, was snatched on Wednesday from an altar dedicated to the Polish pope, who died in 2005 after a 27-year reign.
A sacristan who was closing the cathedral for the night discovered the theft of the reliquary, which encased a vial holding a few drops of blood.
Relics, which Catholics venerate as they pray to the saint, are usually pieces of a saint's body or clothing.
The relic was in the Spoleto cathedral temporarily and was due to be moved next month to a new church in the Umbria region named after the late pope.
""Give the reliquary back to the cathedral and the faithful,"" said Archbishop Renato Boccardo, who was a close aide to the late pope for years at the Vatican. ""It would be the serious thing to do"".
Boccardo said it was not clear if the reliquary had been stolen for ransom, which has happened in the past with other relics in Italy. Police were reviewing footage of security cameras inside and outside the cathedral.

The establishment of formal Israel-UAE ties over the last month - spurred in part by common worries about Iran - unleashed a flurry of bilateral deals, including on cyber technologies, Israeli exports of which were valued at $6.5 billion in 2019.
""We are threatened by the same threats ... because of the nature of the region, because of the nature of our new, 'outed' relations and because of who we are - strong economically and technologically,"" Igal Unna, head of Israel's National Cyber Directorate, told UAE counterpart Mohamed al-Kuwaiti in an online conference.
""We see already things in fast progress and I am very optimistic that we have a lot in common and a lot to share.""
Kuwaiti described the UAE as potentially at risk of online sabotage including ransomware attacks as it develops its digital sphere. He promoted the idea of international cooperation - including in joint exercises - in cyber defence.
""Israel is very well-known on the technological part and that will really help,"" Kuwaiti said. 
Doron Hadar, commander of the Israeli military's crisis negotiation unit, said during the conference that dealing with ransomware attacks is ""not a 'win/lose situation', it's a 'lose/lose less' situation.

(Reuters) - The former head of now-defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica has been banned from running limited liability companies in Britain for seven years for letting staff offer ""unethical services"", a state agency said.
Alexander Nix was a director of the firm and five linked companies that had marketed themselves as offering clients ""bribery or honey trap stings"" and ""voter disengagement campaigns,"" the UK's Insolvency Service said on Thursday.
Nix had accepted the disqualification, the Service said. Nix told Reuters he had not admitted any wrongdoing and had not been accused of breaking any laws, but had decided to bring the matter to a close to ""avoid an unnecessary, lengthy and expensive court case"".
Cambridge Analytica, which was hired by U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 election campaign, closed down in 2018 following a scandal over its mining of  Facebook Inc  (O:FB) users' data. (https://reut.rs/2HuBuXl)
The firm said at the time it and its parent company SCL Elections ceased trading after suffering a sharp decline in business amid the bad publicity. 
The British government's Insolvency Service said it had started an investigation into the directors' conduct after the companies went into compulsory liquidation.
""Our conclusions were clear that SCL Elections had repeatedly offered shady political services to potential clients over a number of years,"" Mark Bruce, the Insolvency Service's chief investigator, said in Thursday's statement.
The agency said it had found that Nix ""had caused or permitted SCL Elections or associated companies to act with a lack of commercial probity"".
""The unethical services offered by the companies included bribery or honey trap stings, voter disengagement campaigns, obtaining information to discredit political opponents and spreading information anonymously in political campaigns,"" it said in its statement.
It did not say whether the companies had ever performed any of those services for a client.
Nix, 45, was disqualified from acting as a director or becoming involved with a limited company without court permission from Oct. 5 onwards, and for a period of seven years, the service said.
Nix told Reuters: ""In relation to my undertakings to the Secretary of State, I have made no admission of wrongdoing and importantly the Government did not seek to press that I had breached any laws.""

The U.S. Federal Trade Commission ruled in December that Cambridge Analytica had deceived consumers about the collection of Facebook data for voter profiling and targeting.

LOUISVILLE, Kentucky (Reuters) - Louisville on Thursday braced for a second night of protests after two police officers were shot during demonstrations over a decision by a grand jury to bring no direct charges against policemen in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor.
The protests erupted in the Kentucky city on Wednesday immediately after the state attorney general announced that none of the three white officers involved in a deadly, botched raid on Taylor's apartment would have to face charges of causing the Black woman's death. One officer was indicted on charges of endangering her neighbors.
Civil rights activists decried the outcome as a miscarriage of justice in keeping with a nationwide pattern of unwarranted police violence against minorities. 
The demonstration that started peacefully on Wednesday night turned violent after dark when the two officers were shot and wounded. Police arrested 127 people in Louisville. 
Clashes between police and demonstrators on Louisville's streets were the latest incident in a wave of protests that gripped the country over the summer following the deaths of several African Americans in the hands of police officers in incidents caught on cellphone video.
On Wednesday, protests also flared up in New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Seattle. In Portland, Oregon, the scene of more than 100 straight nights of protests, police once again declared a riot on Wednesday in the unrest that followed the grand jury decision.
Leaders of the Louisville anti-racism protesters have yet to announce plans for Thursday night, but typically they give little advance notice of their plans. In New York, organizers have already scheduled two Breonna Taylor events for Thursday afternoon in Brooklyn.
With people already casting ballots in early voting for the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election, the demonstrations have drawn not only peaceful anti-racism protests but also a volatile mix of armed, right-wing militias and anarchists. 
Demonstrators led by movements such as Black Lives Matter have renewed their calls for racial justice and against excessive police force since the May 25 death of George Floyd after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.
Taylor, 26, a Black emergency medical technician and aspiring nurse, was killed in front of her armed boyfriend after the three officers forced their way into her home with a search warrant in a drug trafficking investigation.
Taylor's case drew little national attention at first but was thrust into prominence after Floyd's death and with the help of celebrities such as Hollywood stars and basketball great LeBron James.
Her death became a symbol, and her image a familiar sight, during months of daily protests.
The grand jury did not bring any charges for the six police bullets that struck Taylor, but instead for stray shots that hit the neighboring apartment.
Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron said the panel declined to bring any charges against two of the three policemen who fired into Taylor's apartment because their actions were found to have been justified under Kentucky law as they returned fire after Taylor's boyfriend shot at them, wounding one of them.
Following the grand jury announcement, protesters immediately took to the streets of Kentucky's largest city and marched for hours chanting, ""No lives matter until Black lives matter,"" amid sporadic clashes with police in riot gear.
Several gunshots rang out as heavily armed police closed in on a throng of protesters at nightfall, ordering the crowd to disperse about a half hour before a 9 p.m. curfew was due to go into effect.
One suspect was arrested in connection with the shooting of the two officers, who were in stable condition - one undergoing surgery - with non-life-threatening injuries, interim Louisville Metropolitan Police chief Robert Schroeder told reporters. 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Louisville issued a plea for the public's help on Thursday, asking for any videos related the shooting of the two officers.
Police on Thursday said arrests were made after some protesters damaged businesses, jumped on a police vehicle, damaged public works trucks serving as barricades, set garbage cans on fire, and defied orders to disperse from what police determined were unlawful assemblies.

At least three stores were looted, police said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, the current holder of the European Union's rotating presidency, urged the European Parliament on Thursday to speed up talks and work on weekends to agree on 1.8 trillion euros worth of the bloc's next budget and a linked pandemic recovery.
The European Parliament must endorse the package agreed by EU governments after a tortuous four-day summit in July, before the money can start flowing to help revive the EU economy from the deepest recession in the bloc's history.
But in exchange for its consent, the EU parliament wants governments to spend more money on research and development and to provide a legally binding timetable for the introduction of new EU-wide taxes to pay for the stimulus spending.
Crucially, parliament also wants a clear link between the EU money and observing the rule of law -- a condition watered down by Poland and Hungary, both under EU investigations for flouting democratic checks and balances.
""I am very concerned that the negotiations are currently progressing too slowly. We must increase the frequency of negotiations significantly. We have offered the European Parliament to negotiate through the weekends as well,"" German ambassador to the EU, Michael Clauss, told Reuters.
But Armin Wisdorff, a European Parliament spokesman, said it was EU governments, called the Council, that hampered progress by lumping all issues together.
""For the moment the Council is delaying the talks in insisting on treating the MFF (the long-term budget), recovery plan and apparently also the rule of law regulation as a package,"" Wisdorff said. 
Parliament had reduced the number of programmes in the long-term budget that it wants more money for, he said, but governments have not reciprocated by separating and simplifying the package. 
""There is no acceptable proposal yet,"" Wisdorff said.
The rule of law mechanism appears to the most difficult.
Because the EU's 1.1 trillion euro budget for 2021-2027 and the 750 billion recovery package have to be agreed unanimously, Warsaw and Budapest have the power to hold up the money for the other 25 EU countries if a firm rule of law link is introduced.
""On the rule of law mechanism, we are in intensive talks with the EU member states,"" Clauss said, noting the negotiations were ""extremely complicated"" and that Berlin would soon present a proposal to other EU governments on the exact wording of the rule-of-law conditions for accessing EU cash.
Wisdorff said the parliament's demand for a strong and clear link between EU money and observing the rule of law by the government that gets it, has not changed since last year.
""As for the rule of law, the EP's position is on the table since 2019. We now have to wait for Council’s proposal and see what it looks like,"" Wisdorff said.

Clauss said that on EU-wide taxes, governments and parliament were ""already close to each other"". But the issue is tricky because it concerns tax-setting powers jealously guarded by national parliaments.

His assets were seized on Aug. 27 in connection with a lawsuit filed by the Moscow Schoolchild catering company, spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh said in a video posted on Twitter. The politician and his allies have been involved in a long-running dispute with the company.
""This means the flat cannot be sold, donated or mortgaged,"" Yarmysh said. 
Navalny was flown from Russia to Berlin last month after falling ill on a domestic flight in Siberia. Tests in Germany, France and Sweden found he was poisoned with a nerve agent.
The West has demanded an explanation from the Kremlin, which has denied any involvement in the incident and said it has yet to see evidence of a crime.
In the dispute with Moscow Schoolchild, a Russian court in October 2019 ordered Navalny, his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and ally Lyubov Sobol to pay $1.4 million in damages for libelling the company and causing it moral damage.
The court told his group to delete a video in which they had called into question the quality of its food.
Yarmysh said on Thursday that the court had decided to recover 88 million roubles ($1.14 million) from Navalny, Sobol and the FBK. 
""This is the amount it estimates in lost profit for Moscow Schoolchild because of losing a contract to provide food."" 
The court could not be reached for comment. Reuters called nine listed telephone numbers for Moscow Schoolchild and got through only once, to a woman who identified herself as an accountant but hung up when told she was speaking to a journalist. 
Navalny and his allies have long been a thorn in the side of President Vladimir Putin, organising large protests in Moscow in 2019 and regularly producing videos accusing prominent political figures of corruption. 

His supporters say lawsuits and police raids targeting Navalny and his foundation are part of a coordinated campaign to cripple their activities. Russian authorities deny those charges.

MUMBAI/BENGALURU, (Reuters) - Indian farmers intensified their protests over three new bills that they believe could pave the way for the government to stop buying grain at guaranteed prices, leaving them at the mercy of private buyers such as traders and retailers. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has defended the legislation - recently approved by India's parliament - as reform measures that will help rid India's vast agriculture sector of antiquated laws. 
Modi and some of his ministers have said that the new bills would help remove middlemen from farm trade, allowing farmers to sell to institutional buyers and large retailers like Walmart (NYSE:WMT). 
On Thursday, farmers from some of India's big northern heartland states - key producers of wheat and rice - blocked railway tracks, forcing authorities to cancel a few trains on some local routes. 
Leading farmers' organisations have chalked out plans for bigger protests on Friday, when opposition parties from across the country are likely to join. 
Last week, Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Modi's minister for food processing, resigned over her opposition to the bills that she termed as ""anti-farmer"". 
Badal's regional party, an ally of Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and India's opposition parties have said that farmers would lose their bargaining power if large private traders and retailers are allowed to buy directly from growers. 
Farm Minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Thursday accused opposition parties of misleading farmers and said the government would continue to buy grain from farmers at government-set guaranteed prices. 
In the southern state of Karnataka, several farmers' organisations have called for a shutdown on Sept. 28 to protest ""anti-farmer"" policies of the state and federal governments, said Kodihalli Chandrashekar, president of the Karnataka State Farmers Association. 

""If we don't protest now fearing coronavirus, these policies will claim a thousand more farmers' lives than what COVID will,"" Chandrashekar said.

WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The United States, Britain and Canada plan to impose sanctions on Belarusian individuals following what they view as a rigged election and violence against peaceful protesters since, six sources familiar with the matter said on Thursday.
Four of the sources, all speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S., British and Canadian sanctions could come as early as Friday.
They said the sanctions aimed to show there would be consequences for the disputed election and the treatment of protesters in Belarus, a former Soviet state where President Alexander Lukashenko has ruled for 26 years.
Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in the Aug. 9 election. Since then, his forces have detained or driven out all of Belarus's leading opposition figures, arrested thousands of protesters and clamped down on news reporting. He was abruptly sworn in for a sixth term on Wednesday.
The ceremony would normally have been publicized as a major state occasion but was instead held without warning. The opposition, which has staged regular mass protests since the election demanding his resignation, denounced it as illegitimate.
Local media footage showed helmeted riot police pinning protesters to the ground, and marching or carrying them away into detention. Several people were injured after water cannon were fired, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.
""Up to now, the abiding goal for U.S. and European officials has been to prevent the level of regime-instigated violence from getting out of hand,"" said Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank in Washington.
""Anyone who watched the image of yesterday's police riot on the streets of Minsk knows that Western policy has failed.""
On Sept. 1, a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters the United States was considering imposing sanctions on seven Belarusians who it believes were involved in falsifying the results of the election and in violence against protesters.
One of the six sources said the number was now eight Belarusians, but could change.
The U.S. State Department and the Canadian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the possibility of joint sanctions.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told parliament that Britain was preparing sanctions against those responsible for serious human rights violations in Belarus and coordinating with the United States and Canada ""as a matter of urgency"".
Separately, Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said Lukashenko was not the legitimate leader of Belarus and that his ""so-called inauguration"" behind closed doors followed a ""fraudulent"" election.
The European Union said his swearing-in had gone directly against the will of the people.

Washington had hoped to impose sanctions in concert with the EU, but the bloc has been unable to achieve consensus because of an unrelated dispute over the Eastern Mediterranean.

GAZA/RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian factions have agreed to hold an election within six months, in the latest of many attempts to end more than a decade of infighting between President Mahmoud Abbas's Fatah movement and his Islamist rival Hamas.
The factions renewed reconciliation efforts after Israel reached diplomatic accords this month with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, an event that dismayed Palestinians and prompted their leaders to try to present a united front.
""The two sides have agreed in principle to hold elections within six months,"" said Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas official in Istanbul, where officials from both groups met over the past two days.
Fatah official Jibril Al-Rajoub confirmed the agreement and said Abbas would issue a decree setting a date. 
But he said the vote would be in stages - starting with parliament, then electing a new president, and finally choosing members of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the Palestinians' highest decision-making body. 
The rivals have been unable to repair a rift from 2007, when Hamas, considered a terrorist group by Israel and many Western countries, seized control of the Gaza Strip. Abbas's Western-backed Palestinian Authority remains dominant in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

The Palestinians have opposed Israel's deals with the UAE and Bahrain, fearing a weakening of a longstanding pan-Arab position that calls for Israeli withdrawal from occupied territory and acceptance of Palestinian statehood in return for normal relations with Arab countries.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Christian lawmakers in Slovakia hope to win parliamentary approval for a tightening of abortion rules in a vote expected on Friday, part of a trend towards more socially conservative policies across parts of central Europe.
If adopted, the new regulation would still allow abortion on demand until 12 weeks but would double waiting periods to 96 hours, ban clinics from advertising services and make women declare their reasons for termination. 
Its impact would also be felt in Poland, where rights activists say hundreds, and possibly thousands, of women cross the border to Slovakia every year for terminations that would be illegal or impossible at home.
Proponents say the proposed changes in Slovakia would help women make informed decisions and provide financial support earlier in pregnancy.
""This law is not about preventing abortions, this law is for helping women on social and health issues,"" said Milan Vetrak, one of the law's authors and member of a Christian group elected on the ticket of the main ruling party, Ordinary People.
""It creates room for women to make a decision and make the right one, and creates room for them to get help,"" he told Reuters.
Slovakia, unlike the neighbouring Czech Republic, is majority Roman Catholic, though the Church is less influential than in Poland. 
""UNDER PRESSURE""
Opponents including dozens of human rights groups say it would put women under stress and may force some into accepting unsafe practices. 
""This will cause many women to miss the 12-week limit or, as they will feel anxious or under pressure and face administrative barriers, they may decide not to seek an abortion at a health facility,"" said Adriana Mesochoritisova from the civic group Moznost volby (Freedom of Choice). 
Slovak clinics performed 7,153 abortions last year, including 1,329 on non-residents.
In Poland, the ruling conservatives want to tighten further already restrictive abortion rules, but proposals have led to public protests and no change has been implemented.
Polish government lawmakers and other conservatives have also asked the Constitutional Court to rule on whether abortion in the case of fetal deformities or illness is admissible. A ruling is due in October.
In Hungary, abortion rights are not in focus but parliament has banned people from changing their gender on identity documents as part of a campaign by Prime Minister Viktor Orban to protect traditional Christian values from what he calls ""rainbow propaganda"" by LGBT activists.
In Slovakia, only 17% of people favour tougher abortion rules, according to a poll published in July. 
The new proposal has divided the ruling coalition, with the liberal Freedom and Solidarity party (SaS) expressing dissent.
""As they do not have the support for a total abortion ban, which they would like most, they are trying to put up as many barriers as possible,"" said SaS deputy Jana Bitto Ciganikova.
Longer waiting periods or the need to get a second medical assessment - which the proposal wants for medically motivated abortions - would require many women to travel more. This would raise the cost and time pressure, with the heaviest impact falling on poorer women.
Aleksandra, 26, a Polish mother of two, who had an abortion in Slovakia in February, said more restrictions would be wrong.
""(It) makes women even more hopeless, stressed, but those who are sure they want to do it will do it anyway, even if they are forced to travel halfway around the world,"" she said.

LONDON (Reuters) - British prosecutors launched an attempt on Thursday to confiscate 30.8 million pounds ($39.3 million) from a London lawyer who assisted a Nigerian politician in looting and laundering funds from the oil state he governed.
Bhadresh Gohil was convicted in 2010 of 13 counts of money-laundering and other offences linked to his role in the case of James Ibori, who was governor of Delta State in southern Nigeria from 1999 to 2007. Gohil was sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Then a partner at a firm in the London district of Mayfair, Gohil had helped Ibori channel stolen funds through shell companies and offshore accounts, and buy assets such as an English country house and a $20 million private jet - although police caught up with the men before the jet was delivered. 
Gohil also masterminded a fraud in which $37 million in fake consultancy fees was stolen from two Nigerian states in connection with the sale of their stakes in a telecoms company.
With its highly developed financial and legal services industries, Britain has long been a favoured destination for people seeking to launder dirty money. 
Banks have been fined and scandals revealed by leaks such as the FinCEN and Panama papers, but it remains unusual for direct beneficiaries such as Ibori and Gohil to be held to account.
Ibori was extradited to Britain in 2011, and in 2012 was convicted of 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering and jailed for 13 years - a rare instance of a senior Nigerian politician serving time for plundering public funds.
Britain hailed the case as a landmark in the fight against corruption and pledged to return stolen funds to Nigerian state coffers. But confiscation proceedings against both Ibori and Gohil have dragged on for close to a decade, repeatedly delayed by appeals and complications.
In Ibori's case, a hearing took place at London's Southwark Crown Court in January. Prosecutors asked the court to make a confiscation order against Ibori of 117.7 million pounds. The judge has yet to hand down his decision.
A hearing on Gohil's case is ongoing at the same court. Lead prosecution counsel Jonathan Kinnear on Thursday began setting out the details of what he said was Gohil's criminal benefit.
Gohil will have a chance later in the hearing to call witnesses and give evidence himself to dispute the prosecution case. Any confiscation order against him, as for Ibori, will be issued by the judge at a later date.

""The U.S. is committed to holding accountable those who deny freedom and justice to people of Iran and later today United States will announce sanctions on several Iranian officials and entities including the judge who sentenced Navid Afkari to death,"" Abrams said during a hearing at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Afkari was executed earlier this month after being convicted of stabbing a security guard to death during anti-government protests in 2018, Iranian state media reported. Iran’s Supreme Court rejected a review of the case in late August.
Afkari's case had sparked an outcry from Iranians on social media and from international human rights groups. U.S. President Donald Trump also called on Iran this month not to execute the wrestler.
The athlete's family has maintained that his conviction depended on a confession that was extracted through torture, which Afkari later recanted.

Earlier this week, the United States slapped new sanctions on Iran's defense ministry and others involved in its nuclear and weapons program to support the U.S. assertion that all U.N. sanctions against Tehran are now restored, which key European allies as well as Russia and China reject.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell joined other Republican lawmakers in rallying to the defense of constitutional government on Thursday, after President Donald Trump refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power following the Nov. 3 election. 
""The winner of the November 3rd election will be inaugurated on January 20th. There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,"" McConnell wrote in a tweet.
Several other lawmakers came out strongly in favor of a peaceful transition of power following the Republican president's comments on Wednesday, though none criticized him directly.
""The peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in our Constitution and fundamental to the survival of our Republic. America's leaders swear an oath to the Constitution. We will uphold that oath,"" Representative Liz Cheney, who leads the House of Representatives Republican Conference, wrote on Twitter.
Senator Marco Rubio, a former Republican presidential candidate, asserted that the upcoming election contest between Trump and Democrat Joe Biden will be legitimate, fair and in line with more than two centuries of American practice.
""It may take longer than usual to know the outcome, but it will be a valid one,"" Rubio wrote on Twitter.
In a tweet, Republican Representative Steve Stivers wrote, ""Nothing defines our Constitutional Republic more than the peaceful transition of power. I've taken an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and I will uphold that oath.""
On Wednesday Trump, responding to a reporter's question, refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power should he lose in November, and said he expected the election battle to end up before the Supreme Court.
""We're going to have to see what happens,"" he told reporters.
Not all Republicans expressed alarm at Trump's remarks. 
""In the spring, stores sold out of hand sanitizer and toilet paper. This fall, they sold out of ammo,"" tweeted Representative Thomas Massie, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus. 
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham (NYSE:GHM), a Trump ally who is overseeing the process to weigh the president's forthcoming Supreme Court nominee, said he expected a peaceful transition. 
""I can assure you it will be peaceful,"" Graham told Fox News. ""Now we may have litigation about who won the election, but the (Supreme) Court will decide and if the Republicans lose, we will accept that result. But we need a full court.""
Trump, who trails Biden in national opinion polls, has long sought to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the election, claiming without evidence that mail-in voting would be rife with fraud. ""The ballots are a disaster,"" Trump said on Wednesday.
A record number of Americans are expected to vote by mail this year to avoid the coronavirus pandemic, and Democrats hope mail-in ballots will help to motivate large numbers of voters who oppose Trump. 
In 2016, Trump also raised questions about whether he would accept the results of the election, which he went on to win. 
But Democrats said Trump's latest remarks were far more disturbing.
""Chilling is too mild a word,"" Senator Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, told CNN. ""It's really an invitation to violence.""
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer predicted that voters would not allow Trump to become a dictator. ""This man has no honesty, honor, values or faith in the American system,"" he said in a CNN interview. 
Biden, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, said Trump's comments on the transition of power were ""irrational.""

The former vice president's campaign said it was prepared for any ""shenanigans"" from Trump, and reiterated comments from July that ""the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's parliament voted on Thursday to delay making a decision on whether it will amend the constitution, as demanded by anti-government protesters who have demonstrated nearly every day for more than two months.
The parliament, dominated by supporters of the government, opted instead to set up a committee to study the process of the constitutional amendment first.
""The vote to accept a motion for constitutional changes is effectively delayed to November,"" pro-government lawmaker Chinnaworn Boonyakiat told Reuters.
The decision angered opposition parliamentarians and protesters, more than 1,000 of whom had gathered outside the parliament to press their demands for constitutional change and for the removal of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, a former junta leader.
Protesters say the current constitution was drafted to ensure he kept power after elections last year. Prayuth says the vote was fair.
Wiroj Lakkhanaadisorn, an MP from the opposition Move Forward Party, said the parliament's decision to delay voting on the motion was intended to ""deceive the people.""
""If the process is delayed by a month to set up this committee, and if the motion is rejected then, it will mean members of parliament cannot propose another such motion again until next year,"" he said in a tweet.
Siraphop Attohi, one of the protesters, said: ""This is a game to buy more time ... We cannot stand by this."" 
The protests are the biggest challenge to the Thai military and palace-dominated establishment since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup. The biggest protest drew tens of thousands of people at the weekend.
Some protesters say the constitution also gives too much power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn and have called for his influence to be reduced, challenging a longstanding taboo of not criticising the monarchy.
The 2017 constitution was written by a military-appointed committee and passed a nationwide referendum in 2016 at which opposition campaigning was banned.

The assembly combines an elected lower House of Representatives and a military-appointed Senate.

Johnson told parliament in London on Tuesday that Britain had a worse coronavirus infection rate than nations like Italy and Germany because it was a ""freedom-loving country"" which therefore resisted social restrictions to curb the disease.
Asked about the comment during a visit to Sardinia, Mattarella said: ""We Italians also love freedom, but we also care about seriousness."" 
The highly discreet president was asked about Johnson during a private conversation, but his words were swiftly reported in the local media and his office confirmed the remarks.
Britain this week imposed fresh restrictions to try to stamp out a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19 in the country, with government scientists warning there could be 50,000 new cases per day by mid-October without fresh curbs.
Italy, which was the first country in Europe to be hit by the contagion in February, has seen new cases tick higher in recent weeks -- but has so far managed to avoid a renewed surge.
Asked in parliament why Britain's figures were worse than Germany and Italy, Johnson said: ""There is an important difference between our country and many other countries around the world and that is our country is a freedom-loving country...It is very difficult to ask the British population uniformly to obey guidelines in the way that is necessary.""

The 16-second video clip, filmed by a Euroradio.fm reporter, features a movie-like pursuit and escape that unfolded in a Minsk residential area on Wednesday evening as crowds protested against what they said was the illegitimate inauguration of Lukashenko.
The video, viewed by tens of thousands of people on various online platforms, shows a young man being chased by baton-wielding policemen in riot gear who then manages to jump into a taxi.
The taxi driver, who appeared to be waiting for the traffic lights to change, then apparently makes a split second judgment, lurches into the opposite lane and briefly mounts the pavement before speeding away despite the angry shouts of the policemen.
Police in Belarus detained 364 people at anti-government protests on Wednesday, according to the country's Interior Ministry. The protesters accuse Lukashenko, who has led his country for 26 years, of rigging the Aug. 9 presidential election, a charge he denies.
Lukashenko, 66, was sworn in for a new term in an inauguration held without prior notice and denounced as illegitimate by the opposition, the European Union and the United States.

ABOARD 'ARCTIC SUNRISE' (Reuters) - Like many of her generation, Mya-Rose Craig feels strongly that adults have failed to take the urgent action needed to tackle global warming and so she has headed to the Arctic Ocean to protest.
Armed with a placard reading 'Youth Strike for Climate"", the 18-year-old British activist is staging the most northerly protest in a series of youth strikes worldwide.
The strikes, made famous by Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg, are resuming after a lull caused by the global coronavirus pandemic to draw public attention back to the threat posed by climate change.
""I'm here to... try and make a statement about how temporary this amazing landscape is and how our leaders have to make a decision now in order to save it,"" she told Reuters Television as she stood with her placard on the edge of the Arctic sea ice.
""I absolutely think that my generation has always had to think about climate change... which is why as we’ve got older there’s been this massive wave of just this need for change, this demand for change when we realised the grown-ups aren’t going to solve this so we have to do it ourselves.""
Craig, from southwest England, is known as ""Birdgirl"" online, where her blog chronicling her bird-watching experiences has attracted thousands of followers.
She has travelled hundreds of miles above the Arctic Circle aboard a Greenpeace ship, Arctic Sunrise.
Climate data shows the Arctic is one of the fastest changing ecosystems on the planet, with serious consequences for wildlife from polar bears and seals to plankton and algae, while the melting sea ice contributes to rising sea levels worldwide.
Warming in the Arctic shrank the ice covering the polar ocean this year to its second-lowest extent in four decades, scientists said on Monday. 
For Craig, getting to the ice floe involved a two-week quarantine in Germany, followed by a three-week voyage to the edge of the sea ice.
Craig said those who dismiss the youth protests as just a rebellious phase by her generation are wrong, and she wants those in power to stop treating climate change as a low-priority issue, raised only to appease ""the lefties in the corner"".
""It’s everything now and it has to be treated like that,"" she said.

Footage broadcast by state-owned Vietnam Television (VTV) this week showed dozens of large bags containing the used contraceptives scattered across the floor of a warehouse in the southern province of Binh Duong.
Police said the bags weighed over 360 kilograms (794 lbs), equivalent to 345,000 condoms, according to VTV.
The owner of the warehouse said they had received a ""monthly input of used condoms from an unknown person,"" state newspaper Tuoi Tre reported.
A woman detained during the bust told police that the used prophylactics were first boiled in water then dried and reshaped on a wooden phallus before being repackaged and resold. 
VTV said it was not clear how many of the recycled condoms had already been sold. The detained woman said she had received $0.17 for every kilogramme of recycled condoms she produced.
Neither she nor the owner of the warehouse were available for comment.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko was sworn in for a sixth term after an election that the opposition and several foreign governments say was rigged.
""Given Lukashenko's fraudulent inauguration, I have directed the FCDO (foreign office) sanctions team to prepare Magnitsky sanctions for those responsible for the serious human rights violations,"" Raab told parliament.
""We are coordinating with the United States and Canada to prepare appropriate listings as a matter of urgency.""
Raab said the ""whole range of potential individuals"" was under considerations for sanctions, but did not give any names.
Britain had been prepared to work with the European Union on coordinated sanctions, but the bloc's plans have been blocked by member state Cyprus. 
In July, Britain, having left the European Union, imposed its own sanction regime to place sanctions on 25 Russians and 20 Saudis, aimed at stopping the laundering of ""blood money"".

The so-called Magnitsky sanctions are named after Russian lawyer Sergei Magnitsky who was arrested in 2008 after alleging that Russian officials were involved in large-scale tax fraud. Magnitsky died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment.

Kolesnikova, 38, was last seen in public on Sept. 7 being snatched off a Minsk street and shoved into a van by masked men.
In a statement made through her lawyer soon afterward, Kolesnikova said she had been driven to the Ukrainian border by security officers in the middle of the night, and threatened with expulsion ""alive or in bits"".
Kolesnikova then ripped up her passport to avoid expulsion, a move that has burnished her status as a hero to the mass protest movement against Lukashenko.
His 26-year grip on power is being challenged by opponents who say his Aug. 9 presidential victory was rigged. 
In the letter, sent to her father from jail, Kolesnikova urged fellow Belarusians not to buckle in their fight against the rule of Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm boss. 
""You must tell them not to give up, just keep going! These people who have kidnapped me are all incredibly weak and hysterical. They don't even know how to do their job well.
""Everything is fine with me, the conditions are tolerable and the new friends are wonderful,"" she wrote in the letter, which Tut.By said was delivered in an envelope decorated with red and white hearts, the colours of Belarus' opposition.

Lukashenko, 66, was sworn in for a new term on Wednesday in an inauguration held without prior notice and denounced as illegitimate by the opposition and the European Union.

""The caution that existed in the spring has more and more been replaced by hugs, parties, bus trips in rush hour traffic, and an everyday life that, for many, seems to return to normal,"" Lofven told a news conference. 
""What we do right now, we will be glad of later. What we do wrong now, we will suffer for later,"" he said
He called on Swedes to adhere to the guidelines of social distancing and good hygiene and said the government was ready to introduce new measures if needed to stop the spread of the virus. 
New cases in Sweden are still relatively low in Sweden compared to Europe, with 320 reported on Wednesday, but Lofven said signs were still worrying. 
""In Sweden, the situation is comparatively more stable, but we also see signs that the number of infections is increasing in certain areas in our country,"" Lofven said. 
Sweden, which has shunned a strict lockdown, has reported close to 5,900 deaths since the start of the pandemic, many more per capita than its Nordic neighbours, but also lower than countries like Spain and Italy that opted for hard lockdowns. 

The government also said on Thursday it had decided to extend a loan guarantee scheme for small and mid-sized businesses until the end of the year.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya's candidate to become the next head of the World Trade Organisation pledged on Thursday to integrate climate change issues into the WTO agenda if selected.
Amina Mohamed, who is the East African nation's sports minister, progressed to the second round of selection to become the next director-general of the WTO, along with four other candidates, on Friday.
""How is it possible that the WTO does not discuss climate change?... WTO must be a part of the global conversation on climate change,"" she told an online media briefing from Geneva.
Mohamed, who was involved in the development of green financial instruments when she was the deputy head of the U.N. agency for the environment (UNEP), said she would make the WTO's trade and environment committee active.
""At the end of the day, it is about the bottom line, but that bottom line can actually be improved by going green because that is the future,"" she said.
The committee's first task, if she wins the selection contest, would be to draw up rules for the international trade of environmental goods and services like solar panels and wind turbines, she said.
It will also look to replicate climate change mitigation initiatives, like the carbon tax in Europe, which is now being adopted by other states in places like Africa. 
""The WTO can do that on a grander scale... so that the impact of the measures that we are putting in place can be felt,"" Mohamed said, adding that the measures will be accompanied by incentives for firms like other tax breaks.
The wider adoption of those climate change mitigation measures will make the globe reap their benefits sooner, because ""we don't have to wait for 50 years"" to feel the impact of individual states or trade blocs are doing, she said. 
In the second round of selection, the WTO's 164 members will give their preferences from Sept 24 to Oct 6, whittling the candidates down to two. The organisation has said it wants to select the winner by early November.

1678,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Could Egypt's #MeToo movement be the tinder for a 'feminist revolution'?,"By Menna A. Farouk
CAIRO (Reuters) - In just two months, Egypt's burgeoning #MeToo movement has exposed sexual assaults, spurred legal reform and emboldened hundreds of abuse victims including celebrities to speak out, sparking a long-overdue debate about gender inequality.
Now, rights activists in the conservative country say keeping the social media campaign's momentum going hinges on taking the message offline to reach poorer women, especially in rural areas, and changing attitudes in the justice system. 
""I hope this momentum does not remain in the upper- and middle-class segments of society, but moves downwards to the lower social classes as well,"" said Entessar El-Saeed, head of the Cairo Center for Development and Law, an NGO.
""There are many women who are not educated and are exposed to sexual harassment but still do not speak up whether because they fear social stigma or they are not aware of the legal procedures,"" El-Saeed told the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation.
She noted that many less-educated women, especially outside the cities, do not use social media or have internet access.
Only 54% of Egypt's population is connected to the internet, according to a 2020 report by UK-based creative agency We Are Social. In rural areas, that figure falls to 19.1%, found a 2019 report by the state-run statistics agency CAPMAS.
Randa Fakhr El-Deen, executive director of the NGOs' Union on Harmful Practices against Women and Children, said that in poorer areas many women do not have mobile phones and are barely aware of social media trends.
""Moreover, violence against women is at much higher levels in these areas,"" she said. ""Those women are really left behind. That is why the state along with NGOs have to concentrate their efforts towards them.""
She suggested taking #MeToo offline by organizing workshops where women can share their stories, and training more female rural leaders to help raise awareness among women about their legal rights and how to address gender-based violence.
'RAPE CULTURE, VICTIM BLAMING'
The current reckoning over sexual violence began in July when a 22-year-old student launched a #MeToo-style Instagram page called Assault Police to expose a university student who is now accused of raping and blackmailing several women.
Weeks later, it brought to light a gang rape case, which now involves up to nine suspects from powerful, wealthy families.
Responding to the growing public debate, parliament passed a law in August giving women the automatic right to anonymity in a bid to encourage more to report sexual assaults.
In a country where women have long felt disadvantaged, rights activists are keen to seize on the movement as an opportunity to change deep-rooted patriarchal attitudes.
A 2017 Thomson Reuters Foundation poll found Cairo to be the most dangerous megacity for women and 99% of women in Egypt interviewed by the United Nations in 2013 said they had experienced sexual harassment.
Alia Soliman, a women's rights advocate, said there was a gap between improved public awareness and the way in which police and judicial authorities handle sexual assault cases.
""Social media use and raising awareness is important to shatter rape culture (and) victim blaming. It needs to be complimented with strong and consistent legal zero tolerance actions against rapists and sexual harassers,"" she said.
Fakhr El-Deen suggested installing special units in police stations to handle complaints of gender-based violence.
Many women still fear the stigma of reporting sexual abuse in Egypt, where there is a deep bias to put more blame on women for behaviour deemed provocative than on men for sex crimes.
Reda Eldanbouki, a lawyer and executive director of the Women's Center for Guidance and Legal Awareness, an NGO, said #MeToo had highlighted the need for a law to protect witnesses.
Egyptian authorities arrested a man and three women who were witnesses to the gang rape case, charging them with ""morality"" and ""debauchery"" offenses, according to Human Rights Watch.
""This can make women fearful of reporting cases of sexual assaults as lawyers of suspects can turn the case against them and level accusations against them,"" Eldanbouki said. 
#MeToo's supporters acknowledge the scale of their task.
Calling the campaign ""a feminist revolution"", Shady Noor, a women's rights advocate and filmmaker who has become a leading voice in the movement, said he was determined that women of all social classes should benefit. 
""There is a great resistance. We know that,"" he said.
""(But) we don't want it to remain for some time and then fade away like previous waves.""

""Right now we do not have a date,"" Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters. ""We are moving towards there relatively soon.""
Turkey has also given no timing for a resumption of the talks but a senior official has said they could begin by the end of the month. 
Greece has said that the talks will resume in Istanbul.
The talks, which broke off in 2016 after 60 rounds, made little progress in resolving outstanding differences over 14 years.

The Philippines is confident the United States will give more weight to its ties with the Philippines and President Rodrigo Duterte's personal friendship with counterpart Donald Trump, said Duterte's spokesman, Harry Roque.
Roque during a regular briefing dismissed as a ""wild suggestion"" the bill filed by U.S. Representative Susan Wild, which seeks suspension of American aid to the Philippine military and police, due to concerns over an anti-terrorism law that took effect in July. 
The new law has been condemned by rights groups at home and abroad as a weapon to target Duterte's opponents and stifle free speech. Numerous petitions have been filed with the Supreme Court to try to block it.
Duterte says law-abiding citizens should not fear the law, which is intended for ""terrorists"" and communist insurgents. Critics, however, fear the vague definition of what constitutes a ""terrorist"" could be abused. 
Wild's bill comes four years after the U.S. State Department halted the planned sale of some 26,000 assault rifles to the Philippine police, after Senator Ben Cardin vowed to block the deal due to the high number of killings in Duterte's police-led war on drugs.
That move angered Duterte, a fierce critic of U.S. foreign policy who speaks fondly of Trump and has been praised by the U.S. president for his tough approach to drugs. 

Military spokesman Edgard Arevalo in a separate news conference said all Filipino soldiers operated ""within the limits and bounds of respect for human rights, law of armed conflict"".

1682,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>",Bleary-eyed U.S. election officials turn to signature-verifying software in mail-in surge,"By Paresh Dave and Andy Sullivan
OAKLAND, Calif./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When election officials in at least 29 U.S. counties face an expected avalanche of mail-in ballots in the Nov. 3 presidential election due to the coronavirus pandemic, they will not rely on eyes alone to verify voters' signatures.
They will also use software to approve signatures and guard against fraud, a Reuters survey found, a trend that voting technology experts cautiously welcome. Parascript, a Colorado company that says it helps banks identify check fraud, developed the technology.
The software could reduce the inconsistency and bias inherent when humans decide whether the signature on a ballot envelope matches what governments have on file, officials and voting rights advocates say. 
But absent clear standards, officials have replaced one set of variables with another in the at least eight states that have counties using the software. Two of the states, Florida and Nevada, are considered swing states where either Joe Biden, a Democrat, or President Donald Trump, a Republican, could win.
The software's performance variability is visible in Colorado, where the technology approves about 40% of signatures in Republican-leaning Douglas County, 20% in Democratic Denver County, and 50% in the swing county of Larimer, Reuters found. Colorado law requires that staff review at least 2% of the software's approvals. 
Two California counties audit all of the software's approvals, while Oregon's Multnomah County initially double-checks everything and then a few a day as counting continues. Pierce County, Washington, reviews at minimum 3% of software approvals and also the ones passed with least confidence. 
AN ERROR IS A LOST VOTE
The counties emphasized that staff examined every signature that software could not verify, meaning no ballot was tossed without human review. 
But election officials said they had not analyzed the software's outcomes to determine whether it treats racial or other demographic groups differently. The outcomes should be examined, as they can influence human reviewers, nonpartisan election experts said. 
""An error here is someone losing their chance to vote,"" said Michael Herron, government professor at Dartmouth College.
The artificial intelligence software aims to automate validating a voter's signature - a measure enforced in 33 states, at least eight of which use software. 
Nineteen states, including those eight, let voters appeal signature rejections, which advocates contend younger voters and Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to experience than others.
More than 175,000 absentee ballots did not count in the 2016 presidential election because of signature discrepancies, the top reason for rejection. Voting advocates warn that number could surge this election as millions more Americans vote by mail. 
Signature mismatches negated 0.5% of Colorado's mail-in ballots in 2018, federal data show. But Democratic-leaning Lake County rejected 2.39%, nearly five times the statewide average. Four counties did not reject any ballots for signature discrepancies.
CHARACTER STROKES
The shift to mail-in voting has increased the burden on election officials even as the digital economy has decreased the emphasis on careful signing of documents, prompting scrutiny on verification methods. 
Linton Mohammed, a forensic document examiner who testified in election cases, described signatures as poor for voter authentication because of the variance in them over time and inadequate training for some reviewers.
Parascript's software aims to address those concerns by running black-and-white scans through seven algorithms. They study character strokes, spacing and other attributes to score whether the signature matches one on file. 
The software allows officials in each of the 29 counties to set their own minimum scores for approving signatures, a variable that experts want studied. 
The software, which debuted about a decade ago and can cost $7,000 annually, can process 1,000 signatures a minute, compared with two to three by a worker.
At least seven counties adopted the technology this year, mostly to meet social-distancing standards, Reuters found.
Proponents said it was reliable, saved time and allowed staff to focus on problematic signatures. Only one official could identify a slip-up: The software accepting ""deceased"" as a match for a voter named Denise in Oregon.
""In the time I've been here, five elections, it has never failed an audit,"" said Jack Twite, deputy of elections in Douglas County, Colorado.
Parascript said results from its automated signature verification software varied because voter turnout, ballot envelope designs, scanning equipment and voter signature records differ by county and election. 
For instance, the signature approval rate for Adams County, Colorado, jumped when it boxed the signature space on envelopes, generating more readable images. Larimer's percentage fell as more signatures on file came from motor vehicle records that were too fuzzy for software analysis.
The lack of standardization has left room for debate, even as at least 10 additional counties said they may adopt the software next year.
Denver elections director Jocelyn Bucaro said other counties in Colorado used the software too permissively and risked illegitimate votes.
""We don't view that as a best practice,"" Bucaro said. 
Angela Myers, clerk and recorder for Larimer, said the laborious process demanded significant automation. ""We love it,"" she said. 
Portia Allen-Kyle, associate director at the nonpartisan group Voting Rights Lab, said the public should be able to vet the software to ensure it is fair for all voters. 

""We have an opportunity to regulate automated signature verification programs before they become even more embedded, unchecked, into our electoral system,"" she said.

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 06:51AM ET</span>",Trailblazing journalist Harold Evans dead at 92,"By Bill Trott
(Reuters) - Sir Harold Evans, a British-American editor whose 70-year career as a hard-driving investigative journalist, magazine founder, book publisher and author made him one of the most influential media figures of his generation, died on Wednesday at the age of 92.
Evans died of congestive heart failure in New York, according to his wife Tina Brown.
A former editor of Britain's Sunday Times and, at his death, Reuters editor-at-large, Evans put a unique stamp on investigative journalism. Championing causes either overlooked or denied, he and his team uncovered human rights abuses and political scandals, and advocated for clean air policies.
One of his most famous investigations exposed the plight of hundreds of British thalidomide children who had never received any compensation for their birth defects. Evans organized a campaign to take on the drug companies responsible for manufacturing the drug, an effort that eventually won compensation for the families after more than a decade.
""All I tried to do - all I hoped to do - was to shed a little light,"" Evans said in an interview with the Independent in 2014. ""And if that light grew weeds, we'd have to try and pull them up.""
After 14 years at the Sunday Times, Evans became editor of the Times of London shortly after media mogul Rupert Murdoch purchased the paper in 1981. Evans left a year later in a dispute with Murdoch over editorial independence.
A few years later, Evans moved to the United States with Brown, the journalist and editor to whom he was married for nearly 40 years. He continued his career as an author, publisher and university lecturer. He penned several books, including ""The American Century"" (1998) and its sequel ""They Made America"" (2004), as well as an ode to good writing called ""Do I Make Myself Clear?"" (2017). 
He became the subject of books and documentaries, including ""Attacking The Devil: Harold Evans and the Last Nazi War Crime"" (2014), about the thalidomide campaign.
Evans founded Conde Nast Traveler magazine and served as president and publisher of Random House from 1990 to 1997.
Under his leadership, Random House scored various publishing successes, including the best-selling ""Primary Colors,"" a satire about Bill Clinton by Anonymous, later revealed to be journalist Joe Klein, and Colin Powell's ""My American Journey.""
'RESPECTABLE WORKING CLASS'
Born to a family from what he called ""the respectable working class,"" Evans received one of the highest honors of the British monarchy when he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 2004 for his services to British journalism. Two years earlier, a poll by Britain's Press Gazette and the British Journalism Review named him the greatest newspaper editor of all time.
Evans joined Reuters in 2011. In his role as editor-at-large, Evans moderated conversations with global newsmakers in business and politics who included Tony Blair, Mark Cuban, Al Gore, John Kerry, Henry Kissinger, Jim Mattis and Satya Nadella. 
""Harry Evans was an inspiration, not only as a great journalist but as a great man. He had an insatiable intellect, extraordinary tenacity, high principle, and a generous heart,"" Stephen J. Adler, Reuters editor-in-chief, said.
Evans also had a sense of humor. ""Editor-at-large means you're free to create as much havoc as they will tolerate,"" Evans was quoted as saying by the Financial Times.
""He was the inventor of team journalism. In the editorial chair, he was a human dynamo and set in motion such a stream of powerful stories and campaigns that his rivals (I was one) could only struggle to keep up,"" Donald Trelford, the former editor of the Observer, wrote in a review of Evans' memoir published in 2009 called, ""My Paper Chase: True Stories of Vanished Times.""  
Harold Matthew Evans was born in Greater Manchester, England, on June 28, 1928, the son of a train driver. 
He entered journalism in what was then the traditional way, taking his first reporting job at a weekly newspaper at age 16. He went on to study at Durham University. 
After serving in the military and earning a master's degree, Evans became an assistant editor at the Manchester Evening News.
In 1961 he was named editor of the Northern Echo and first developed his reputation as a relentless journalist with campaigns against air pollution and for a national program to detect cervical cancer, an initiative that still saves thousands of lives each year.
Evans became editor of national weekly the Sunday Times in 1967, and made it an exemplar of investigative journalism, with reports from its Insight team.
KIM PHILBY SPY CASE
In addition to helping win compensation for Britons who suffered birth defects from thalidomide, a drug taken for pregnancy sickness, the Sunday Times published in 1967 an expose of high-ranking British intelligence officer Kim Philby's decades as a Soviet spy, despite objections from the British government that the report would endanger national security.
When Murdoch bought the Sunday Times and Times of London in 1981 from the Thomson Corp, he installed Evans as editor of the Times but the relationship quickly turned sour - and stayed that way. Evans said the British government allowed Murdoch to buy the Times newspapers on the strength of pledges he made to uphold editorial independence.
""He broke them all within a year,"" Evans said in a 2013 Reuters interview.
He said his own writings about then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher were the source of the rift with Murdoch.
""When she started to dismantle the British economy, the most cogent critic of that policy ... was the Sunday Times,"" he told the Independent. ""I wrote 70 percent of that criticism myself. When I became editor of the Times, I continued to criticize monetarism.""
Within a year, Evans was ousted from the Times in what he called ""the saddest moment of my life."" Murdoch said he made the move to avert a staff rebellion and insisted he had never tried to dictate newspaper policy.
That same year, Evans married Brown in New York. The two had met in 1973 when she had been a writer for the Sunday Times.
In 1984, Evans and Brown moved to the United States, where he taught at Duke University in North Carolina and later held various positions with U.S. News & World Report, the Atlantic Monthly and New York Daily News among others.
In London, Brown had edited The Tatler magazine. In America, she became editor of Vanity Fair magazine and later the New Yorker, before co-founding the Daily Beast news website in 2008. Evans became a U.S. citizen in 1993 and Brown followed suit in 2005.
In addition to his wife, Evans leaves his children Isabel, Georgie, Ruth, Michael and Kate Evans, grandchildren Anna and Emily Vanderpool, and brother Peter Evans. His first wife, Enid, from whom he was divorced in 1978, died in 2013.

Winter sports are serious business in Austria, a superpower of competitive skiing where tourism accounts directly and indirectly for around 15% of economic output.
But its resorts are also known for less athletic fun. Once lifts shut, skiers pile into often rowdy bars that became a breeding ground for the virus last season, fuelling several outbreaks, including one at the resort of Ischgl.
""There will be no apres-ski as we know it from earlier times,"" Tourism Minister Elisabeth Koestinger told a news conference, adding the seating requirement would also apply to outdoor areas. 
""Standing, dancing, singing while densely packed in small bars or under-umbrella bars is a potential source of infection and we are distancing ourselves from it,"" she said.
In closed ski lifts, face masks will be required and passengers must stay 1 metre apart, Koestinger said, likening it to public transport.
The requirement to sit at tables is in line with new rules for bars and restaurants in Austria, which is trying to bring a second wave of infections under control. Daily cases https://info.gesundheitsministerium.at/?l=en are as high as they were in late March, when the first spike was decreasing under a national lockdown.
The conservative-led government wants to avoid such drastic measures for the sake of the economy, but its top source of foreign guests, Germany, has already issued a travel warning for one of its skiing regions, the province of Vorarlberg.

""Skiing pleasure yes, but without apres-ski,"" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said.

Navalny made his first public appearance on Wednesday after being discharged from a Berlin hospital where Germany said he was being treated for poisoning by a potentially deadly nerve agent. 
""He is still not 100% how he was before,"" Jaka Bizilj, founder of the Cinema for Peace Foundation, told foreign journalists in Berlin on Thursday.
""When we got the first reports, we got the impression he had made a fast recovery and was fit but we have to be careful,"" he said. ""I think he will need at least a month to be fit again.""
Navalny was flown from Russia to Berlin last month after falling ill on a domestic flight in Siberia. The West has demanded an explanation from the Kremlin, which has denied any involvement in the incident and said it has yet to see evidence of a crime. 
Bizilj, who had previously helped anti-Kremlin activist Pyotr Verzilov get treatment in Germany after a suspected poisoning, said he had no doubt Navalny would return to Russia.

""His chief of staff has made clear there is no doubt he wants to go back to Russia,"" he said, adding he had not seen Navalny in person but was in contact with his team and family.

COLOMBO/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The owners the New Diamond supertanker which caught fire with a cargo of two million barrels of oil aboard has agreed to pay 340 million rupees ($1.84 million) to Sri Lanka for its help in extinguishing the blaze and averting disaster.
The interim claim is for services provided by the Sri Lankan navy, air force, ports authority and Marine Environment Protection Authority (MEPA) after the fire on Sept. 3 until Sept 15, said Nishara Jayaratne, coordination officer of Sri Lanka's Attorney General.
Insurers of the vessel West of England will settle the bill, MEPA Chairperson Dharshani Lahandapura said. 
The New Diamond, loaded with Kuwaiti oil, is chartered by Indian Oil Corp and is currently 66 nautical miles (122 kilometres) from Batticaloa on Sri Lanka's east coast. 
MEPA has allowed the release of 20 crew members while one injured sailor is undergoing treatment in a private hospital in Sri Lanka, Lahandapura said.
The captain has not been allowed to leave the country as he is going through legal proceedings, she said.
Greece-based Porto Emporios Shipping Inc is the registered owner of the 20-year old Panama-flagged very large crude carrier, Refinitiv data showed. 
Lahandapura said the interim claim does not include damages for the spill of marine oil. While it did leak fuel, its crude oil cargo remained intact.
The ship's managers, New Shipping Ltd, have appointed SMIT Singapore Pte Ltd to lead salvage operations.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) party chief Jaroslaw Kaczynski may take over supervision of the powerful justice ministry, officials said on Thursday, as PiS and its allies in government hold talks to avert a breakdown of their three-party coalition.
The move could herald some softening of the government rhetoric over Poland's opposition to gay rights and on relations with Brussels, issues at the heart of the internal rivalries and disagreements among the country's ruling conservatives.
If the emergency talks fail it could force PiS to govern as a minority administration or even trigger an early election.
At the centre of the dispute is Justice Minister Zbigniew Ziobro, 50, who heads a small, ultra-conservative coalition grouping and wants Warsaw to take a more combative stance on issues such as women's and gay rights and judicial reform.
Kaczynski's nationalist PiS, however, argues Poland should be more pragmatic about its relationship with the European Union, already tense over European Commission criticism that Warsaw is subverting democratic norms.
""It would seem Kaczynski is entering the government and will oversee the justice ministry,"" Ryszard Terlecki, a senior PiS lawmaker, told reporters.
While he is said to prefer working from behind the scenes without holding any executive posts, Kaczynski, 71, is seen as the final arbiter on policy in Poland. Sources say Ziobro and Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, a relative newcomer to PiS, are jostling for position to succeed him in the coming years.
It was not immediately clear how Kaczynski taking over the supervision of the justice ministry could affect the party's ambitions to deepen court reforms, which Brussels says politicise the judiciary and weaken democratic checks and balances.
Uncertainty about the outcome of coalition talks has been an additional factor weakening the Polish zloty, adding to investors' worries as they fret about the health of a global economy which is facing rising numbers of coronavirus cases. 
The zloty broke through the psychologically important barrier of 4.50 against the euro earlier this week.

If a snap election were held now, opinion polls show PiS would fall short of a majority and its two smaller coalition partners would fail to meet the threshold to win seats.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Locked in a power struggle with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin needs a solid victory in a state election on the island of Borneo on Saturday to stop support within his coalition parties melting away, analysts say.
Anwar ignited political fireworks on Wednesday with the bold claim that he had the backing of nearly two-thirds of the 222 lawmakers in Malaysia's parliament and would be asking the king to install him as prime minister in place of Muhyiddin. 
Muhyiddin's nearly seven-month-old coalition has survived with a wafer-thin majority, and allies have pressured him to seek an early election to secure a strong mandate, rather than wait for a national poll not due until 2023.
Since he came to power, the Southeast Asian nation has been consumed with fighting the coronavirus crisis, relying on the government to bolster its badly hit export-led economy, and the latest bout of political wrangling could hinder those efforts. 
The state election in Sabah, where his party is in an opposition coalition, will be Muhyiddin's first test at the ballot box. While Anwar's own party is a relatively minor player in the Sabah election, a regional party friendly to his Pakatan Harapan bloc will be the obstacle to Muhyiddin's allies. 
The Sabah contest won't directly decide the fate of the federal government, but it could give Muhyiddin a foretaste of how he might fare if the king denies Anwar's request to be given the premiership, and instead tells the politicians to sort it out through a national election.
The king, Sultan Abdullah, cancelled an audience with Anwar earlier this week due to ill health, and the opposition leader is still waiting for a re-scheduled appointment.
While campaigning in Sabah last Friday, Muhyiddin said that he would ""hurry up and have the general election"" if his coalition won the state contest, according to a report by Malaysiakini news website.
Analysts say Muhyiddin needs a sizable victory in Sabah to consolidate support within his Perikatan Nasional (PN) coalition.
""Anything less than a proper win would lead to an even further erosion within Muhyiddin's coalition, especially amongst members who are on the fence,"" said Shazwan Mustafa Kamal, senior associate at political consultancy firm Vriens & Partners.
""ONLY OPTION""
While Muhyiddin dismissed Anwar's claims of commanding a majority, the leader of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the largest party in the ruling coalition conceded on Wednesday that there had been defections to Anwar's camp.
No major political party has come out in support of Anwar yet. But if he does have the numbers he claims, Muhyiddin's ""only option"" would be to call a snap election, a source close to the prime minister's office told Reuters.
Muhyiddin became prime minister in March, backed by UMNO, which lost the last election in 2018, and Islamist party PAS.
Opponents accused him of stealing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box, as he came out on top in the political wrangling that led to the collapse of the previous government led by Mahathir Mohamad.
Party-hopping has also triggered the election in Sabah, where state government lawmakers defected to Muhyiddin's coalition. 
Analysts say that the party that stands to gain most from the Sabah contest is UMNO, which lost power for the first time in Malaysia's post-colonial history in 2018 when then-Prime Minister Najib Razak became mired in a massive corruption scandal.
""Whichever way the (Sabah) election goes, UMNO will emerge as the real winner,"" said Adib Zalkapli, a director with political risk consultancy BowerGroupAsia.

""And the prime minister may have to call an early general election to put an end to the uncertainty and instability in the federal government.""

Authorities halted tourism in Indonesia's prime attraction in April to prevent the spread of the virus, devastating its economy. 
Though it reopened for local visitors in July, it is struggling to get back on track and has also seen infection numbers climb. 
I Putu Astawa, chief of Bali's tourism agency, told Reuters that 4,440 participants would be separated into 12 groups and given two-night stays at resorts between Oct. 7 and Nov. 27 to test out measures designed to keep visitors safe.
The trips will include local tours and participants are expected to promote ""New Normal Bali"" on social media.
Bali last year had more than 10 million visitors, 6.3 million of which were foreigners, Astawa said. 
The staycation plan was announced on a day when Indonesia reported 4,634 new coronavirus cases, a record for new daily infections, bringing the total number to 262,022. Its death toll of 10,105 is Southeast Asia's biggest.
On average, Bali recorded 48 cases per day from Aug. 1 to August 23. It recorded 127 on average cases per day in all of September.
Bali had initially weathered the health crisis better than other parts of Indonesia, but coronavirus cases spiked after it reopened to domestic tourism.

""Lots of people gather and throw parties at the beach,"" said I Gusti Agung Ngurah Anom, chairman of the Indonesian medical association in Bali.

The paper, published by the ruling Chinese Communist Party's official People's Daily, said the decision to bar Clive Hamilton and Alex Joske came after Australia revoked the visas of two Chinese scholars over ""alleged infiltration"" in early September. 
China's foreign ministry did not confirm the entry bans, but said during a regular briefing on Thursday that the country has the right to bar any foreign national and blamed Australia for difficulties in relations.
""We firmly oppose any acts to deliberately attack China, endanger China's national security, or spread disinformation under the pretext of studies and other academic activities,” spokesman Wang Wenbin said.
Ties have become strained over issues from trade disputes to Australia's call for an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus that first emerged in China late last year, and by accusations of Chinese meddling in domestic affairs. 
""This ban is quite unexpected, although I have been on Beijing's enemy list for some years,"" Hamilton said in an email to Reuters.
He added that the ban against him and Joske was ""retaliation"" for the Australian government's actions against Chinese scholars and that he had already decided ""two or three years ago"" it would be too dangerous to travel to China. 
""Only when Beijing decides to stop interfering in Australian politics and attempting to bully the Australian government will relations improve. I hope that happens soon,"" he said. 
In a 2018 book, Hamilton, a professor of public ethics at Australia's Charles Sturt University, accused China's Communist Party of a campaign to exert influence in Australia's domestic politics. 
Joske is an analyst at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, which the Global Times called ""infamous for churning out anti-China propaganda and fabricating anti-China issues."" 
He said on Twitter that the ban is the ""latest in a series of attempts by the Chinese Communist Party to punish those who shine a light on its activities"" and that he had also judged the risk of travelling to China to be ""too high."" 
""I have not held or applied for a Chinese visa for years,"" Joske said.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong arrested for 2019 illegal assembly,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested prominent democracy activist Joshua Wong on Thursday for participating in an unauthorised assembly in October 2019 and violating the city's anti-mask law, according to a post on his official Twitter account.
Wong's latest arrest adds to several unlawful assembly charges or suspected offences he and other activists are facing related to last year's pro-democracy protests, which prompted Beijing to impose a sweeping national security law on June 30.
Hong Kong police confirmed they arrested two men, aged 23 and 74, on Thursday for illegal assembly on Oct 5, 2019.
The arrest of Wong, aged 23, comes around 6 weeks after media tycoon Jimmy Lai was detained on suspicion of colluding with foreign forces. 
Wong had been a frequent visitor to Washington where he appealed to the U.S. Congress to support Hong Kong's democracy movement and counter Beijing's tightening grip over the global financial hub. His visits drew the wrath of Beijing, which says he is a ""black hand"" of foreign forces.
Wong disbanded his pro-democracy group Demosisto in June, just hours after China's parliament passed national security law for Hong Kong, bypassing the city's local legislature, a move widely criticised by Western governments. 
His long-time colleague, Agnes Chow, and two other activists were also among 10 people police arrested in August on suspicion of violating the new law. 
The new law punishes anything China considers as subversion, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces, with up to life in prison.
Wong was just 17 years old when he became the face of the 2014 student-led Umbrella Movement democracy protests, but he was not a leading figure of the often violent unrest that shook the semi-autonomous former British colony last year.
An anti-mask law was introduced last year in a bid to help police identify the protesters they suspected of committing crimes and it is facing a challenge in court. In the meantime, the Hong Kong government has made face masks mandatory in most circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian officials were focusing on the grim task of disposing of almost 400 whale carcasses on Thursday, while attempts to rescue the few remaining survivors of one of the world's worst mass strandings was expected to extend another day.
Rescuers had managed to free almost 90 of the long-finned pilot whales beached off the country's remote southern coast by late Thursday.
The majority of those freed had reached deeper water, officials said, but four had to be euthanised and others might return when the tide turns.
The clock was ticking for a small group of whales still floundering in shallow water on a wide sandbank, four days after the 470-strong pod was first spotted off the northwest coast of the island state of Tasmania.
""There is a likelihood that we will be continuing the rescue efforts tomorrow,"" said Nic Deka, the incident controller for the state government's Parks and Wildlife Service.
""While we have live animals that have a chance and we have the crew to shift them, we will give it a go,"" he told a media briefing.
After a positive veterinary assessment, a rescue attempt would continue on Friday for a mother and calf that appeared in footage posted by local media on Twitter. The video showed the calf swimming among rescuers as they tried to save its mother.
Alongside these measures, authorities were also developing a plan to dispose of around dead 380 whales at sea.
Options included loading the carcasses onto a barge or gathering them into a group to tow, Deka said, adding that a barge with a crane attached was due to arrive on Monday.
""Realistically it could take several days. We are intending to start tomorrow. If we get a method that works efficiently it may be by early next week we will have made a real dent.""
Graphic: Whales stranded off the coast of Tasmania - https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-WHALES/azgvoakqwvd/AUSTRALIA-WHALES.jpg
'ETHICAL AND HUMANE'
Euthanising those animals too exhausted to swim to safety was another daunting but necessary task, experts said.
""For large whales, very sadly, it could take weeks for them to die, and they get blistered in the sun, so you would be thinking about an ethical and humane thing to do,"" Mike Double, a zoologist that leads the Australian Marine Mammal Centre, told Reuters.
While larger whales can require a lethal dose of potassium chloride to the heart or explosives, smaller whales like the long-finned pilots are usually shot with a firearm.
More whales were likely to be euthanised on Friday, Deka said. 
The effort has taken a physical and emotional toll on rescuers, and a fresh crew was due to arrive in the next day, Deka said, adding that counselling was being made available to those involved.
""The emotional toll can be significant,"" the department's wildlife biologist Kris Carlyon said.
""Most crew are really focused on just getting the job done, so it might be a little bit later that they start to really think about it, and it starts to sink in."" 
More than 60 government scientists and volunteers had dashed to the remote location, braving freezing cold waters in an arduous refloating process. 
As many as four or five people per whale were needed to attach slings to the animals and guide them as they were pulled to deeper water by boats.

The stranding, the biggest on record in modern Australia and one of the largest in the world, has drawn attention to a natural phenomenon that remains largely a mystery to scientists.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A German man whom investigators suspect of murdering British toddler Madeleine McCann and currently jailed for drug dealing may face more prison time after Europe's top court retroactively cleared his extradition to Germany for a rape charge.
There had been concerns that Christian B., who is seeking parole, may disappear once he has served his sentence for drug dealing in a prison in Kiel in the north of Germany.
The 43-year-old German, who lived in the Algarve region of Portugal when 3-year-old Madeleine vanished from her bedroom in 2007, had disputed the validity of the European arrest warrant issued by Germany when he was in Italy because it cited a drugs conviction but not the 2005 rape charge.
The man challenged the warrant even though Germany had in 2018 obtained Italy's agreement for his extradition to be prosecuted and tried for rape and extortion.
A German court had subsequently sought guidance from the Luxembourg-based Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).
The CJEU on Thursday confirmed the procedures for extraditions, which Germany had complied with.
""A measure involving deprivation of liberty taken against a person referred to in a first European Arrest Warrant (EAW) on the basis of a prior offence different from the one which justified his surrender under a second EAW is not contrary to EU law if that person's departure from the Member State that issued the first EAW was voluntary,"" judges said.
""In that context, consent must be given by the executing authorities of the member state which surrendered the prosecuted person on the basis of the second EAW,"" they said.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - President Alexander Lukashenko is not the legitimate president of Belarus, the European Union said on Thursday, saying his abrupt swearing-in on Wednesday went directly against the will of the people.
The ceremony accelerated EU plans to boycott Lukashenko following the disputed Aug. 9 election, as the European Parliament had earlier decided not to recognise the veteran leader from November, when his term as president was due to end.
""The so-called 'inauguration' ... and the new mandate claimed by Aleksander Lukashenko lack any democratic legitimacy,"" the EU's 27 states said in a statement.
""This 'inauguration' directly contradicts the will of large parts of the Belarusian population, as expressed in numerous, unprecedented and peaceful protests since the elections, and serves to only further deepen the political crisis in Belarus.""
The EU, a large financial donor to Belarus, also said it was ""reviewing its relations"" with the country, meaning the bloc would seek to cut off direct funding to Lukashenko's government, channelling it to aid groups and hospitals instead.
Before the election, the EU had committed to spend 135 million euros on projects in Belarus and has also pledged 53 million euros for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya discussed with EU foreign ministers on Monday in Brussels how to bypass state administration to support doctors and hospitals.

""I asked Europe not to support financially the regime. All the money Mr.Lukashenko can get now will not go to support the Belarusian people but will go for those repressions,"" she told reporters, referring to the pro-democracy crackdown.

Health Minister Olivier Veran ordered bars and restaurants in Marseille to shut for two weeks from next Monday, after placing the city and surrounding region on the Mediterranean coast on the maximum alert level for the spread of the virus.
Local politicians said the step was out of proportion to the risks and would devastate their economy.

""This decision is unilateral, ill-conceived, and unfair,"" Muselier wrote on Twitter.

Responding to the criticism, Veran Tweeted that the bar and restaurant closures were designed to protect people in Marseille because the epidemic was worsening, and that he had given advance notice to local officials.

1698,By Reuters,"<span>Sep 24, 2020 04:20AM ET</span>",A Hong Kong protester's farewell note and failed escape,"By Jessie Pang and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Wong Wai-yin's wife feared the worst after reading his short farewell letter.
""I am sorry and thanks for accompanying me throughout the years,"" the hand-written note found on a desk at their home read. ""I'm sorry that I can't walk with you anymore... Please take care of yourselves."" 
Wong, 30, an unemployed dock mechanic facing criminal charges relating to his participation in the protests that roiled Hong Kong last year, had scribbled his message to his wife and his mother on a page torn from a notebook.
He apologised for not repairing their ramshackle house before he departed. ""I still haven't had the time to fix the rooftop of our home, but I'm afraid I won't have such a chance anymore,"" he wrote.
Wong’s wife and mother set out on a desperate search to find him, worried he had killed himself, they told Reuters.
By the time they read his note, Wong was already in the custody of Chinese authorities after a failed attempt to flee by boat the night before to Taiwan with 11 other activists all looking to avoid prosecutions related to the protests.
""When I heard that he's still alive, my heart lit up,"" said Wong’s wife, who shared parts of her husband's letter with Reuters. She said the note was taken by police as evidence, without any further explanation. Hong Kong police declined to answer Reuters' questions on its investigation. 
""But soon I became very nervous,"" Wong’s wife said, after learning her husband had been detained in mainland China, fearing he would not receive fair treatment there. She said she often wakes up from nightmares. Both she and her mother asked not to be identified fully because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The families of some of the 12 activists now under arrest in China, including a 16-year-old, held a news conference on Sept. 12, masked and hooded to avoid identification. Appearing with two Hong Kong lawmakers, they made a plea to Chinese authorities to allow the detainees to contact family members and be represented by independent lawyers. 
China’s foreign ministry, which described the people as separatists, said they have been detained in Shenzhen, the mainland city that shares a border with the northern part of Hong Kong, for illegally crossing into Chinese waters. The ministry referred questions on the matter to the Shenzhen Municipal Public Security Bureau, which did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. 
Florence Wong, a spokeswoman for the Hong Kong government's Security Bureau, said Hong Kong ""respects and does not interfere with the enforcement actions of other jurisdictions,"" in response to questions from Reuters about the people being held. She said Hong Kong would ask for the return of the 12 detainees after they have been dealt with by China. 
Carrie Lam, the city's leader, told reporters at a news conference on Tuesday that the detainees must face justice in China and Hong Kong had no legal basis to demand any particular rights such as presumption of innocence, fair trial or legal representation. 
The incident has become another flashpoint in U.S.-China relations and fuelled tension between Beijing and Taiwan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said earlier this month that the United States was deeply concerned about the case, saying the detainees had been denied access to lawyers of their choice.   
Pompeo and other international critics say China’s imposition of a national security law on Hong Kong in June has threatened established civil liberties and rule of law in the former British colony.
    China says the law, which punishes anything it deems to be subversion, terrorism, collusion with foreign forces or an attempt to separate Hong Kong from China with up to life in prison, was needed to bring stability back to the financial hub after a year of mass anti-China protests.
Ten of the 12 arrested after the failed attempt to flee by speedboat to Taiwan had faced charges including rioting, arson and police assault. One stood accused of colluding with foreign forces under the new law.
Wong had been arrested on Jan. 16 for allegedly making explosive substances. He was only one of hundreds of Hong Kong democracy activists and protesters who have left the city by sea and air over the past year or so.
He joined a group of 10 other men and one woman before dawn on Aug. 23 to board a speedboat berthed in a quiet fishing village before setting off for Taiwan, around 600 km (375 miles) away. If weather conditions are good, the trip can be completed in less than a day. 
On the way, Wong and the others were apprehended by a Chinese coastguard vessel and sent to a detention centre in Shenzhen, Chinese authorities said.
‘I WILL WAIT FOR HIM’
Wong met his wife, originally from mainland China, during a holiday in Vietnam in 2014. They moved into a modest village house in Hong Kong looking onto fields. But they were happy, she said.
Before Wong's arrest in January, their life was simple, she said. They dreamt of finally going on a honeymoon in Japan, reshooting their wedding photos and having a child after saving up enough. They planned to buy a flat and retire in mainland China.
Police said Wong was arrested after a raid on his home found a beaker, a measuring cup, chemicals and electronic equipment they suspected could be used for producing explosives. He has been charged with making explosives, which if done with intent to endanger life, carries a punishment of up to 20 years in prison. Neither Wong nor his wife has commented publicly on the charge. 
He was released on bail on Feb. 14. The High Court ordered surveillance cameras to be installed at Wong's home. A date had not been set for his trial.
After Wong’s arrest, his mother said they stopped meeting relatives and friends, worrying they would cause them trouble by association.
When Wong fled and skipped bail, $96,000 was confiscated by the court together with fees his wife said she had set aside to hire an independent lawyer. Half of the family’s savings vanished, his wife added. 
Hong Kong police confirmed the charge Wong faces, but declined to answer any further questions from Reuters on the case.
Wong’s wife said she has received no official information about her husband except an Aug. 28 letter from Hong Kong police notifying the family he faced criminal prosecution in China. Hong Kong authorities said the 12 would be represented by mainland lawyers chosen by the detainees from a list given to them by Chinese authorities. 
Wong’s wife said the mainland lawyer she hired to represent her husband was not allowed to meet him. That lawyer declined to comment to Reuters, saying authorities warned him his lawyer’s licence would be revoked if he conducted media interviews. 

""He doesn't need to worry about us. I will safeguard this family with his mother,” Wong’s wife told Reuters. ""I will wait for him for the rest of my life.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean troops shot dead a South Korean fisheries official who went missing earlier this week, before dousing his body in oil and setting it on fire in what was likely an effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, South Korea's military said on Thursday.
South Korea's military said evidence suggested the man was attempting to defect to the North when he was reported missing from a fisheries boat on Monday about 10 km (6 miles) south of the Northern Limit Line (NLL), a disputed demarcation of military control that acts as the de facto maritime boundary between the two Koreas.

The exact reason the 47-year-old official was shot is not known but North Korean troops appear to have been acting under anti-coronavirus orders, South Korea's military said.
The presidential Blue House's national security office said the killing was a ""crime against humanity"", and called on North Korea to apologise and put measures in place to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents in the future.
Citing intelligence sources, the military said the unidentified man appeared to have been questioned at sea, north of the NLL and about 38 km (24 miles) from where he went missing, before he was executed on an ""order from a superior authority"". Troops in gas masks then doused the body in oil and set it on fire.
The military said it sent a message on Wednesday to the North through the land border demanding explanations, but has not received any response yet. 
""Our military strongly condemns such an atrocity, and strongly demands North Korea provide explanations and punish those who are responsible,"" General Ahn Young-ho, who is in charge of operations at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a briefing.
CORONAVIRUS FEARS
The U.S. military commander in South Korea said this month that North Korean troops had been given ""shoot-to-kill orders"" to prevent the coronavirus entering the country.
Such strict enforcement of those orders may be an attempt to prevent an outbreak from disrupting a major military parade expected to be held on Oct. 10 when the country commemorates the founding of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, said Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, which monitors North Korea.
""In many ways, this parade is a huge potential viral risk,"" he said in a post on Twitter. ""And it seems paranoia about that risk is at play (with) shoot-to-kill rules.""
In July, a man who had defected to South Korea three years ago triggered a coronavirus scare when he crossed back over the heavily monitored border into North Korea, which says it has had no cases of the disease.
His arrival prompted North Korean officials to lock down a border city and quarantine thousands of people over fears he may have had the coronavirus, though the World Health Organization later said his test results were inconclusive.

Last week, South Korean police arrested a defector who they said had tried to return to North Korea by breaking into a military training site in South Korea's border town of Cheorwon.
